This narrative will comprehend not only all the explorations made in past ages , but also all the new discoveries which have of late years so greatly interested the scientific world .
In order to give to this work -- enlarged perforce by the recent labours of modern travellers , -- all the accuracy possible , I have called in the aid of a man whom I with justice regard as one of the most competent geographers of the present day : M. <NAME> , attached to the <NAME> .
With the advantage of his acquaintance with several foreign languages which are unknown to me , we have been able to go to the fountain-head , and to derive all information from absolutely original documents .
Our readers will , therefore , render to M. Marcel the credit due to him for his share in a work which will demonstrate what manner of men the great travellers have been , from the time of <NAME> and <NAME> down to that of <NAME> and <NAME> .

The first traveller of whom we have any account in history , is <NAME> , who was sent by the <NAME> senate to colonize some parts of the <NAME> coast of <NAME> .
The account of this expedition was written in the <NAME> language and afterwards translated into <NAME> .
It is known to us now by the name of the " Periplus of <NAME> . "
At what period this explorer lived , historians are not agreed , but the most probable account assigns the date B.C .
505 to his exploration of the <NAME> coast .
<NAME> left <NAME> with a fleet of sixty vessels of fifty oars each , carrying 30,000 persons , and provisions for a long voyage .
These emigrants , for so we may call them , were destined to people the new towns that the Carthaginians hoped to found on the west coast of <NAME> , or as we now call it , <NAME> .
The fleet successfully passed the <NAME> of <NAME> , the rocks of <NAME> and <NAME> which command the <NAME> , and ventured on the <NAME> , taking a southerly course .
Two days after passing the <NAME> , <NAME> anchored on the coast , and laid the foundation of the town of Thumiaterion .
Then he put to sea again , and doubling the cape of <NAME> , made fresh discoveries , and advanced to the mouth of a large <NAME> river , where he found a tribe of wandering shepherds camping on the banks .
He only waited to conclude a treaty of alliance with them , before continuing his voyage southward .
He next reached the <NAME> of <NAME> , situated in a bay , and measuring five stadia in circumference , or as we should say at the present day , nearly 925 yards .
According to <NAME> 's own account , this island should be placed , with regard to the <NAME> of <NAME> , at an equal distance to that which separates these Pillars from <NAME> .
They set sail again , and <NAME> reached the mouth of the river <NAME> , which forms a sort of natural harbour , but as they endeavoured to explore this river , they were assailed with showers of stones from the native negro race , inhabiting the surrounding country , and driven back , and after this inhospitable reception they returned to <NAME> .
We must not omit to add that Hanno mentions finding large numbers of crocodiles and hippopotami in this river .
<NAME> days after this unsuccessful expedition , the fleet reached a mountainous region , where fragrant trees and shrubs abounded , and it then entered a vast gulf which terminated in a plain .
This region appeared quite calm during the day , but after nightfall it was illumined by tongues of flame , which might have proceeded from fires lighted by the natives , or from the natural ignition of the dry grass when the rainy season was over .
In five days , <NAME> doubled the <NAME> , known as the <NAME> , there , according to his own account , " he heard the sound of fifes , cymbals , and tambourines , and the clamour of a multitude of people . "
The soothsayers , who accompanied the party of <NAME> explorers , counselled flight from this land of terrors , and , in obedience to their advice , they set sail again , still taking a southerly course .
They arrived at a cape , which , stretching southwards , formed a gulf , called <NAME> , and , according to M. D'Avezac , this gulf must have been the mouth of the river <NAME> , which falls into the <NAME> almost within the Tropic of <NAME> .
At the lower end of this gulf , they found an island inhabited by a vast number of gorillas , which the Carthaginians mistook for hairy savages .
They contrived to get possession of three female gorillas , but were obliged to kill them on account of their great ferocity .
This Notu Keras must have been the extreme limit reached by the <NAME> explorers , and though some historians incline to the belief that they only went to <NAME> , which is two degrees <NAME> of the tropics , it is more probable that the former account is the true one , and that <NAME> , finding himself short of provisions , returned northwards to Carthage , where he had the account of his voyage engraved in the temple of <NAME> .
After <NAME> , the most illustrious of ancient travellers , was <NAME> , who has been called the " Father of <NAME> , " and who was the nephew of the poet <NAME> , whose poems ranked with those of <NAME> and <NAME> .
It will serve our purpose better if we only speak of <NAME> as a traveller , not an historian , as we wish to follow him so far as possible through the countries that he traversed .
<NAME> was born at <NAME> , a town in <NAME> , in the year B.C .
His family were rich , and having large commercial transactions they were able to encourage the taste for explorations which he showed .
At this time there were many different opinions as to the shape of the earth : the <NAME> school having even then begun to teach that it must be round , but <NAME> took no part in this discussion , which was of the deepest interest to learned men of that time , and , still young , he left home with a view of exploring with great care all the then known world , and especially those parts of it of which there were but few and uncertain data .
He left <NAME> in 464 , being then twenty years of age , and probably directed his steps first to <NAME> , visiting <NAME> , <NAME> , and Thebes .
He seems to have specially turned his attention to the overflow of the banks of the Nile , and he gives an account of the different opinions held as to the source of this river , which the <NAME> worshipped as one of their deities .
" When the <NAME> overflows its banks , " he says , " you can see nothing but the towns rising out of the water , and they appear like the islands in the <NAME> . "
He tells of the religious ceremonies among the <NAME> , their sacrifices , their ardour in celebrating the feasts in honour of their goddess <NAME> , which took place principally at <NAME> ( whose ruins may still be seen near <NAME> ) , and of the veneration paid to both wild and tame animals , which were looked upon almost as sacred , and to whom they even rendered funeral honours at their death .
He depicts in the most faithful colours , the Nile crocodile , its form , habits , and the way in which it is caught , and the hippopotamus , the momot , the phoenix , the ibis , and the serpents that were consecrated to the god Jupiter .
Nothing can be more life-like than his accounts of <NAME> customs , and the notices of their habits , their games , and their way of embalming the dead , in which the chemists of that period seem to have excelled .
Then we have the history of the country from <NAME> , its first king , downwards to <NAME> ' time , and he describes the building of the <NAME> under <NAME> , the <NAME> that was built a little above the <NAME> ( of which the remains were discovered in A.D. 1799 ) , <NAME> itself , whose origin he ascribes to the hand of man , and the two Pyramids which are situated a little above the lake .
He seems to have admired many of the <NAME> temples , and especially that of <NAME> at <NAME> , and of <NAME> and <NAME> at <NAME> , and the colossal monolith that was three years in course of transportation from <NAME> to <NAME> , though 2000 men were employed on the gigantic work .
After having carefully inspected everything of interest in <NAME> , <NAME> went into <NAME> , little thinking that the continent he was exploring , extended thence to the tropic of <NAME> .
He made special inquiries in <NAME> as to the number of its inhabitants , who were a simple nomadic race principally living near the sea-coast , and he speaks of the Ammonians , who possessed the celebrated temple of <NAME> , the remains of which have been discovered on the north-east side of the <NAME> desert , about 300 miles from <NAME> .
<NAME> furnishes us with some very valuable information on <NAME> customs ; he describes their habits ; speaks of the animals that infest the country , serpents of a prodigious size , lions , elephants , bears , asps , horned asses ( probably the rhinoceros of the present day ) , and cynocephali , " animals with no heads , and whose eyes are placed on their chest , " to use his own expression ; foxes , hyenas , porcupines , wild zarus , panthers , etc .
He winds up his description by saying that the only two aboriginal nations that inhabit this region are the Lybians and Ethiopians .
According to Herodotus the Ethiopians were at that time to be found above <NAME> , but commentators are induced to doubt if this learned explorer ever really visited <NAME> , and if he did not , he may easily have learnt from the Egyptians the details that he gives of its capital , <NAME> , of the worship of <NAME> and <NAME> , and the longevity of the natives .
There can be no doubt , however , that he set sail for Tyre in <NAME> , and that he was much struck with the beauty of the two magnificent temples of <NAME> .
He next visited <NAME> and took advantage of the information gathered on the spot , to write a short history of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
We next find that he went southward to <NAME> , and he calls it the <NAME> of <NAME> , for he thought the southern parts of <NAME> were the limits of human habitation .
He tells us of the remarkable way in which the <NAME> kept any vow that they might have made ; that their two deities were <NAME> and <NAME> , and of the abundant growth of myrrh , cinnamon and other spices , and he gives a very interesting account of their culture and preparation .
We can not be quite sure which country he next visited , as he calls it both <NAME> and <NAME> , but he gives a most minute account of the splendid city of <NAME> ( which was the home of the monarchs of that country , after the destruction of <NAME> ) , and whose ruins are now only in scattered heaps on either side of the <NAME> , which flowed a broad , deep , rapid river , dividing the city into two parts .
On one side of the river the fortified palace of the king stood , and on the other the temple of <NAME> , which may have been built on the site of the Tower of <NAME> .
<NAME> next speaks of the two queens , <NAME> and <NAME> , telling us of all the means taken by the latter to increase the prosperity and safety of her capital , and passing on to speak of the natural products of the country , the wheat , barley , millet , sesame , the vine , fig-tree and palm-tree .
He winds up with a description of the costume of the <NAME> , and their customs , especially that of celebrating their marriages by the public crier .
After exploring Babylonia he went to <NAME> , and as the express purpose of his travels was to collect all the information he could relating to the lengthy wars that had taken place between the Persians and <NAME> , he was most anxious to visit the spots where the battles had been fought .
He sets out by remarking upon the custom prevalent in <NAME> , of not clothing their deities in any human form , nor erecting temples nor altars where they might be worshipped , but contenting themselves with adoring them on the tops of the mountains .
He notes their domestic habits , their disdain of animal food , their taste for delicacies , their passion for wine , and their custom of transacting business of the utmost importance when they had been drinking to excess ; their curiosity as to the habits of other nations , their love of pleasure , their warlike qualities , their anxiety for the education of their children , their respect for the lives of all their fellow-creatures , even of their slaves , their horror both of debt and lying , and their repugnance to the disease of leprosy which they thought proved that the sufferer " had sinned in some way against the sun . "
The <NAME> of <NAME> , according to M. Vivien de <NAME> , only consisted of that part of the country that is watered by the five rivers of the <NAME> , adjoining <NAME> , and this was the region where the young traveller turned his steps on leaving <NAME> .
He thought that the population of <NAME> was larger than that of any other country , and he divided it into two classes , the first having settled habitations , the second leading a nomadic life .
Those who lived in the eastern part of the country killed their sick and aged people , and ate them , while those in the north , who were a finer , braver , and more industrious race , employed themselves in collecting the auriferous sands .
<NAME> was then the most easterly extremity of the inhabited world , as he thought , and he observes , " that the two extremities of the world seem to have shared nature 's best gifts , as <NAME> enjoyed the most agreeable temperature possible , " and that was his idea of the western limits of the world .
<NAME> is the next country visited by this indefatigable traveller , and he gives the history of the <NAME> , the nation which was the first to shake off the <NAME> yoke .
They founded the great city of <NAME> , and surrounded it with seven concentric walls .
They became a separate nation in the reign of Deioces .
After crossing the mountains that separate <NAME> from <NAME> , the <NAME> traveller entered the country , made famous by the valour of <NAME> , and studied its manners and customs with the care and attention that were among his most striking characteristics .
<NAME> seems to have been well acquainted with the geography of the <NAME> , for he speaks of it as a Sea " quite by itself " and having no communication with any other .
He considered that it was bounded on the west by the <NAME> and on the east by a great plain inhabited by the <NAME> , who , both <NAME> and <NAME> think , may have been <NAME> .
These <NAME> worshipped the <NAME> as their only deity , and sacrificed horses in its honour .
He speaks here of two large rivers , one of which , the <NAME> , would be the <NAME> , and the other , that he calls the <NAME> , must be the <NAME> .
The traveller then went into <NAME> , and he thought that the Scythians were the different tribes inhabiting the country that lay between the <NAME> and the <NAME> , in fact a considerable portion of <NAME> <NAME> .
He found the barbarous custom of putting out the eyes of their prisoners was practised among them , and he notices that they only wandered from place to place without caring to cultivate their land .
<NAME> relates many of the fables that make the origin of the <NAME> nation so obscure , and in which <NAME> plays a prominent part .
He adds a list of the different tribes that composed the <NAME> nation , but he does not seem to have visited the country lying to the north of the <NAME> , or <NAME> .
He gives a minute description of the habits of these people , and expresses his admiration for the <NAME> .
The dimensions that he gives of the <NAME> , the <NAME> , of the <NAME> , the <NAME> and of the <NAME> , are almost exactly the same as those given by geographers of the present day .
He also names the large rivers that flow into these seas .
The Ister or <NAME> , the <NAME> or <NAME> , the <NAME> , or <NAME> ; and he finishes by relating how the alliance , and afterwards the union between the Scythians and <NAME> took place , which explains the reason why the young women of that country are not allowed to marry before they have killed an enemy and established their character for valour .
After a short stay in <NAME> , during which he was convinced that the Getæ were the bravest portion of this race , <NAME> arrived in <NAME> , which was to be the termination of his travels , to the country where he hoped to collect the only documents still wanting to complete his history , and he visited all the spots that had become illustrious by the great battles fought between the <NAME> and Persians .
He gives a minute description of the <NAME> of <NAME> , and of his visit to the plain of <NAME> , the battlefield of <NAME> , and his return to <NAME> , whence he passed along the coast on which the <NAME> had established several colonies .
<NAME> can only have been twenty-eight years of age when he returned to <NAME> in <NAME> , for it was in B.C .
456 that he read the history of his travels at the Olympic Games .
His country was at that time oppressed by <NAME> , and he was exiled to <NAME> ; but though he soon after rose in arms to overthrow the tyrant , the ingratitude of his fellow-citizens obliged him to return into exile .
In 444 he took part in the games at the <NAME> , and there he read his completed work , which was received with enthusiasm , and towards the end of his life he retired to <NAME> in <NAME> , where he died , B.C .
406 , leaving behind him the reputation of being the greatest traveller and the most celebrated historian of antiquity .
After Herodotus we must pass over a century and a half , and only note , in passing , the <NAME> , a contemporary of <NAME> , who published the account of a voyage to <NAME> that he really never made ; and we shall come in chronological order to <NAME> , who was at once a traveller , geographer , and historian , one of the most celebrated men of his time .
It was about the year B.C .
340 that <NAME> set out from the columns of <NAME> with a single vessel , but instead of taking a southerly course like his <NAME> predecessors , he went northwards , passing by the coasts of <NAME> and <NAME> to the furthest points which now form the Cape of <NAME> , and then he entered the <NAME> Channel and came upon the <NAME> coast -- the <NAME> -- of which he was to be the first explorer .
He disembarked at various points on the coast and made friends with the simple , honest , sober , industrious inhabitants , who traded largely in tin .
<NAME> ventured still further north , and went beyond the <NAME> to the furthest point of <NAME> , and he must have reached a very high latitude , for during the summer the night only lasted two hours .
After six days further sailing , he came to lands which he calls <NAME> , probably the <NAME> or <NAME> of the present day , beyond which he could not pass , for he says , " there was neither land , sea , nor air there . "
He retraced his course , and changing it slightly , he came to the mouth of the <NAME> , to the country of the Ostians , and , further inland , to <NAME> .
Thence he visited the mouth of the <NAME> , that is supposed to be the <NAME> or the <NAME> , and he retuned to <NAME> , just a year after leaving his native town .
<NAME> , besides being such a brave sailor , was a remarkably scientific man : he was the first to discover the influence that the moon exercises on the tides , and to notice that the polar star is not situated at the exact spot at which the axis of the globe is supposed to be .
Some years after the time of <NAME> , about B.C .
326 a <NAME> traveller made his name famous .
This was <NAME> , a native of <NAME> , one of <NAME> 's admirals , and he was charged to visit all the coast of <NAME> from the mouth of the <NAME> to that of the <NAME> .
When <NAME> first resolved that this expedition should take place , which had for its object the opening up of a communication between <NAME> and <NAME> , he was at the upper part of the <NAME> .
He furnished <NAME> with a fleet of thirty-three galleys , of some vessels with two decks , and a great number of transport ships , and 2000 men .
Nearchus came down the <NAME> in about four months , escorted on either bank of the river by <NAME> 's armies , and after spending seven months in exploring the <NAME> , he set sail and followed the west line of what we call <NAME> in the present day .
He put to sea on the second of October , a month before the winter storms had taken a direction that was favourable to his purpose , so that the commencement of his voyage was disastrous , and in forty days he had scarcely made eighty miles in a westerly direction .
He touched first at <NAME> and at <NAME> , which do not seem to answer to any of the now-existing villages on the coast ; then at the <NAME> of <NAME> , which forms the bay of <NAME> .
<NAME> back by contrary winds , after doubling the cape of <NAME> , the fleet took refuge in a natural harbour that its commander thought that he could fortify as a defence against the attacks of the barbarous natives , who , even at the present day , keep up their character as pirates .
After spending twenty-four days in this harbour , <NAME> put to sea again on the 3rd of November .
Severe gales often obliged him to keep very near the coast , and when this was the case he was obliged to take all possible precautions to defend himself from the attacks of the ferocious <NAME> , who are described by eastern historians " as a barbarous nation , with long dishevelled hair , and long flowing beards , who are more like bears or satyrs than human beings . "
Up to this time , however , no serious disaster had happened to the fleet , but on the 10th of November in a heavy gale two galleys and a ship sank .
Nearchus then anchored at <NAME> , and there he was met by a ship laden with corn that <NAME> had sent out to him , and he was able to supply each vessel with provisions for ten days .
After many disasters and a skirmish with some of the natives , <NAME> reached the extreme point of the land of the <NAME> , which is marked in modern geography by <NAME> .
Here , he states in his narrative that the rays of the sun at mid-day are vertical , and therefore there are no shadows of any kind ; but this is surely a mistake , for at this time in the <NAME> hemisphere the sun is in the Tropic of <NAME> ; and , beyond this , his vessels were always some degrees distant from the Tropic of <NAME> , therefore even in the height of summer this phenomenon could not have taken place , and we know that his voyage was in winter .
Circumstances seemed now rather more in his favour ; for the time of the eastern monsoon was over , when he sailed along the coast which is inhabited by a tribe called <NAME> , who subsist solely on fish , and from the failure of all vegetation are obliged to feed even their sheep upon the same food .
The fleet was now becoming very short of provisions ; so after doubling <NAME> took a pilot from those shores on board his own vessel , and with the wind in their favour they made rapid progress , finding the country less bare as they advanced , a few scattered trees and shrubs being visible from the shore .
They reached a little town , of the name of which we have no record , and as they were almost without food <NAME> surprised and took possession of it , the inhabitants making but little resistance .
<NAME> , or <NAME> as we call it , was their next resting-place , and at the present day the ruins of a town are still visible in the bay .
But their corn was now entirely exhausted , and though they tried successively at <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> for further supplies , it was all in vain , these miserable little towns not being able to furnish more than enough for their own consumption .
The fleet had neither corn nor meat , and they could not make up their minds to feed upon the tortoises that abound in that part of the coast .
Just as they entered the <NAME> they encountered an immense number of whales , and the sailors were so terrified by their size and number , that they wished to fly ; it was not without much difficulty that <NAME> at last prevailed upon them to advance boldly , and they soon scattered their formidable enemies .
[ Illustration : Nearchus leading on his followers against the monsters of the deep . ]
Having changed their westerly course for a north-easterly one , they soon came upon fertile shores , and their eyes were refreshed by the sight of corn-fields and pasture-lands , interspersed with all kinds of fruit-trees except the olive .
They put into <NAME> or <NAME> , and after leaving it and passing <NAME> or <NAME> , they came in sight of the <NAME> , to which <NAME> , following the geography of the <NAME> , gave the misnomer of the <NAME> .
They sailed up the gulf , and after one halt reached <NAME> , which has since given its name to the little island of <NAME> .
There he learnt that <NAME> 's army was only five days ' march from him , and he disembarked at once , and hastened to meet it .
No news of the fleet having reached the army for twenty-one weeks , they had given up all hope of seeing it again , and great was <NAME> 's joy when <NAME> appeared before him , though the hardships he had endured had altered him almost beyond recognition .
<NAME> ordered games to be celebrated and sacrifices offered up to the gods ; then <NAME> returned to <NAME> , as he wished to go as far as <NAME> with the fleet , and set sail again , having invoked Jupiter the <NAME> .
He touched at some of the neighbouring islands , probably those of <NAME> and <NAME> , and soon afterwards the vessels ran aground , but the advancing tide floated them again , and after passing <NAME> , they arrived at the island of <NAME> , that is sacred to <NAME> and <NAME> .
This was the boundary-line between <NAME> and <NAME> .
As they advanced along the <NAME> coast , they visited different places , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , & c. , and at the last-named was found a quantity of wheat which <NAME> had sent for the use of the explorers .
Some days after this they came to the mouth of the river <NAME> , that separates <NAME> from <NAME> , and thence they reached a large lake situated in the country now called <NAME> , and finally anchored near the village of <NAME> , at the source of the <NAME> , having accomplished their project of visiting all the coast lying between the <NAME> and <NAME> .
Nearchus returned a second time to <NAME> , who rewarded him magnificently , and placed him in command of his fleet .
<NAME> 's wish , that the whole of the <NAME> coast should be explored as far as the <NAME> , was never fulfilled , as he died before the expedition was arranged .
It is said that <NAME> became governor of <NAME> and <NAME> , but in his leisure time he wrote an account of his travels , which has unfortunately perished , though not before <NAME> had made a complete analysis of it in his <NAME> .
It seems probable that <NAME> fell in the battle of <NAME> , leaving behind him the reputation of being a very able commander ; his voyage may be looked upon as an event of no small importance in the history of navigation .
We must not omit to mention a most hazardous attempt made in B.C .
146 , by <NAME> of <NAME> , a geographer living at the court of <NAME> , to sail round <NAME> .
He had visited <NAME> and the coast of <NAME> , when this far greater project occurred to him , one which was only accomplished sixteen hundred years later by <NAME> da Gama .
<NAME> fitted out a large vessel and two smaller ones , and set sail upon the unknown waters of the <NAME> .
How far he took these vessels we do not know , but after having had communication with some natives , whom he thought were Ethiopians , he returned to <NAME> .
Thence he went to <NAME> , and made preparations for another attempt to circumnavigate <NAME> , but whether he ever set out upon this voyage is not known ; in fact some learned men are even inclined to consider <NAME> an impostor .
We have still to mention two names of illustrious travellers , living before the <NAME> era ; those of <NAME> and <NAME> .
100 , was pre-eminently a _conqueror_ , not an _explorer_ , but we must remember , that in the year B.C .
58 , he undertook the conquest of <NAME> , and during the ten years that were occupied in this vast enterprise , he led his victorious Legions to the shores of <NAME> , where the inhabitants were of <NAME> extraction .
As to <NAME> , who was born in <NAME> B.C .
50 , he distinguished himself more as a geographer than a traveller , but he travelled through the interior of <NAME> , and visited <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , living many years in <NAME> , and dying there in the latter part of the reign of <NAME> .
<NAME> wrote a Geography in seventeen <NAME> , of which the greater part has come down to us , and this work , with that of <NAME> , are the two most valuable legacies of ancient to modern Geographers .
<NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> -- Pausanias visits <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> -- Fa-Hian explores Kan-tcheou , <NAME> , <NAME> , the <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> -- <NAME> , and the <NAME> of the <NAME> -- <NAME> describes <NAME> , the valley of <NAME> , the <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , the river <NAME> , <NAME> , the <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and Constantinople -- <NAME> and the <NAME> -- <NAME> travels through <NAME> , and <NAME> , and crosses the Gulf of <NAME> and the <NAME> Sea .
In the first two centuries of the <NAME> era , the study of geography received a great stimulus from the advance of other branches of science , but travellers , or rather explorers of new countries were very few in number .
<NAME> in the year A.D. 23 , devoted the third , fourth , fifth , and sixth books of his <NAME> History to geography , and in A.D. 50 , <NAME> , a clever navigator , discovered the laws governing the monsoon in the <NAME> , and taught sailors how they might deviate from their usual course , so as to make these winds subservient to their being able to go to and return from <NAME> in one year .
<NAME> , a <NAME> historian , born A.D. 105 , wrote an account of the navigation of the <NAME> or <NAME> , and pointed out as nearly as possible , the countries that had been discovered by explorers who had lived before his time ; and Ptolemy the <NAME> , about A.D. 175 , making use of the writings of his predecessors , published a celebrated geography , in which , for the first time , places and cities were marked in their relative latitude and longitude on a mathematical plan .
The first traveller of the <NAME> era , whose name has been handed down to us , was <NAME> , a <NAME> writer , living in <NAME> in the second century , and whose account of his travels bears the date of A.D. 175 .
<NAME> did for ancient <NAME> what <NAME> , the industrious and clever <NAME> did for the other countries of <NAME> , in compiling the " <NAME> 's Guide . "
His account , a most reliable one on all points , and most exact even in details , was one upon which travellers of the second century might safely depend in their journeys through the different parts of <NAME> .
<NAME> gives a minute description of <NAME> , and especially of <NAME> and its monuments , tombs , temples , citadel , academy , columns , and of the <NAME> .
From <NAME> went to <NAME> , and then explored the <NAME> of <NAME> and <NAME> , <NAME> , the <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
The roads in the provinces and even the streets in the towns , are mentioned in his narrative , as well as the general character of the country through which he passed ; although we can scarcely say that he added any fresh discoveries to those already made , he was one of those careful travellers whose object was more to obtain exact information , than to make new discoveries .
His narrative has been of the greatest use to all geographers and writers upon <NAME> and the <NAME> , and an author of the sixteenth century has truly said that this book is " a most ancient and rare specimen of erudition . "
[ Illustration : World as known to the <NAME> . ]
It was about a hundred and thirty years after the <NAME> historian , in the fourth century , that a <NAME> monk undertook the exploration of the countries lying to the west of <NAME> .
The account of his travels is still extant , and we may well agree with M. Charton when he says that " this is a most valuable work , carrying us beyond our ordinarily narrow view of western civilization . "
<NAME> , the traveller , was accompanied by several monks ; wishing to leave <NAME> by the west , they crossed more than one chain of mountains , and reached the country now called Kan-tcheou , which is not far from the great wall .
They crossed the river Cha-ho , and a desert that <NAME> was to explore eight hundred years later .
After seventeen days ' march they reached the <NAME> of <NAME> in <NAME> .
From this point all the countries that the monks visited were alike as to manners and customs , the languages alone differing .
Being dissatisfied with the reception that they met with in the country of the <NAME> , who are not a hospitable people , they took a south-easterly course towards a desert country , where they had great difficulty in crossing the rivers ; and , after a thirty-five days ' march , the little caravan reached Tartary in the kingdom of <NAME> , which contained , according to <NAME> , " Many times ten thousand holy men . "
Here they met with a cordial welcome , and after a residence of three months were allowed to assist at the " Procession of the <NAME> , " a great feast , in which both <NAME> and <NAME> join , when all the idols are placed upon magnificently decorated cars , and paraded through streets strewn with flowers , amid clouds of incense .
The feast over , the monks left <NAME> for <NAME> , and after resting there fifteen days , we find them further south in the <NAME> country of the present day , a cold and mountainous district , where wheat was the only grain cultivated , and where Fa-Hian found in use the curious cylinders on which prayers are written , and which are turned by the faithful with the most extraordinary rapidity .
Thence they went to the eastern part of <NAME> ; it took them four weeks to cross the mountains , in the midst of which , and the never-melting snow they are said to have found venomous dragons .
On the further side of this rocky chain the travellers found themselves in <NAME> , where the country is watered by the streams which , further on , form the <NAME> or <NAME> .
After traversing the kingdoms of On-tchang , Su-ho-to , and Kian-tho-wei , they arrived at Fo-loo-cha , which must be the town of <NAME> , standing between <NAME> and the <NAME> , and twenty-four leagues farther west , they came to the town of <NAME> , built on the banks of a tributary of the river <NAME> .
In these towns Fa-Hian specially notices the feasts and religious ceremonies practised in the worship of Fo or <NAME> .
[ Illustration : One of <NAME> 's companions falls . ]
When the monks left <NAME> , they were obliged to cross the Hindoo-Koosh mountains , lying between <NAME> and the <NAME> , the cold being so intense that one of their party sank under it .
After enduring great hardships they reached <NAME> , a town that is still standing , and then , after again crossing the <NAME> , they entered the <NAME> .
<NAME> , descending towards the south-east , with a view of crossing the northern part of the <NAME> , they reached <NAME> , a town in the province of <NAME> , and crossing the great salt desert which lies to the east of the <NAME> , travelled through a country that Fa-Hian calls " a happy kingdom , where the inhabitants are good and honest , needing neither laws nor magistrates , and indebted to none for their support ; without markets or wine merchants , and living happily , with plenty of all that they required , where the temperature was neither hot nor cold . "
This happy kingdom was <NAME> .
Fa-Hian followed a south-easterly route , and came to Feroukh-abad , where <NAME> is said to have alighted as he came down from heaven , the <NAME> traveller dwelling much upon the <NAME> .
Thence he visited the town of <NAME> , standing on the right bank of the <NAME> , that he calls <NAME> , and this is the very centre of <NAME> .
Wherever Buddha is supposed to have rested , his followers have erected high towers in his honour .
The travellers visited the temple of <NAME> , where for twenty-five years <NAME> practised the most severe mortifications , and where he is said to have given sight to five hundred blind men .
They are said to have been much moved by the sight of this temple .
They set out again , passing <NAME> and <NAME> , on the frontier of <NAME> , all made famous by <NAME> 's miracles , and then reached the celebrated town of Palian-foo , in the delta of the <NAME> , in the kingdom of <NAME> .
This was a fertile tract of country inhabited by a civilized , upright people , who loved all philosophic researches .
After climbing the peak of <NAME> , which stands at the source of the <NAME> and <NAME> rivers , <NAME> descended the <NAME> , visited the temple of Issi-paten that was frequented by magicians and astrologers , reached <NAME> , " the kingdom of splendours , " and a little lower down , the town of Tomo-li-ti , situated at the mouth of the river , a short distance from the site of <NAME> in the present day .
Fa-Hian found a party of merchants just preparing to put to sea with the intention of going to <NAME> ; he sailed with them , and in fourteen days landed on the shores of the ancient <NAME> , of which the <NAME> merchant , <NAME> , had given a curious account some centuries previously .
Here the <NAME> monk found all the traditions and legends regarding the god Fo , and passed two years in searching ancient manuscripts .
He left <NAME> for <NAME> , where he landed after a very rough voyage , in the course of which , when the sky was overclouded , he says , " we saw nothing but great waves dashing one against another , lightning , crocodiles , tortoises , and monsters of the deep . "
He spent five months in <NAME> , and then set sail for <NAME> ; but the winds were again unfavourable , and after undergoing great hardships he landed at the town of <NAME> of the present day ; then having spent some time at Nankin he returned to Fi-an-foo , his native town , after an absence of eighteen months .
<NAME> is the account of <NAME> 's travels , which have been well translated by M. Abel de <NAME> , and which give very interesting details of <NAME> and <NAME> customs , especially those relating to their religious ceremonies .
The next traveller to the <NAME> monk , in chronological order , is an <NAME> called <NAME> , a name that M. Charton renders as " Cosmographic traveller in <NAME> . "
He lived in the sixth century , and was a merchant of <NAME> , who , on his return from visiting <NAME> and part of <NAME> , entered a monastery .
His narrative is called the " <NAME> Topography of the <NAME> . "
It gives no details of its author 's voyages , but begins with cosmographic discussions , to prove that the world is square , and enclosed in a great oblong coffer with all the other planets .
This is followed by some dissertations on the function of the angels , and a description of the dress of the <NAME> Priests .
<NAME> also gives the natural history of the animals of <NAME> and <NAME> , and notices the rhinoceros and buffalo , which can be made of use for domestic purposes , the giraffe , the wild ox , the musk that is hunted for its " perfumed blood , " the unicorn , which he considers a real animal and not a myth , the wild boar , the hippopotamus , the phoca , the dolphin , and the tortoise .
Afterwards , <NAME> describes the pepper-plant , as a frail and delicate shrub , like the smallest tendrils of the vine , and the cocoa-tree , whose fruit has a fragrance " equal to that of a nut . "
From the earliest times of the <NAME> era there has been a great love for visiting the <NAME> , the cradle of the new religion .
These pilgrimages became more and more frequent , and we have many names left to us of those who visited <NAME> during the first centuries of <NAME> .
One of these pilgrims , the <NAME> <NAME> , who lived towards the end of the seventh century , has left us an account of his travels .
He sets out by giving a topographical description of the site of <NAME> , and describes the wall that surrounds the holy city , then the circular church built over the <NAME> , the tomb of our <NAME> , and the stone that closed it , the church dedicated to the <NAME> , the church built upon <NAME> , and the basilica of <NAME> on the site of the place where the real cross was found .
These various churches are united in one building , which also encloses the <NAME> of <NAME> , and <NAME> , where our <NAME> was crucified .
<NAME> then descended into the <NAME> of <NAME> , which is situated to the east of the city , and contains the church that covers the tomb of the <NAME> ; he also saw that of <NAME> , which he calls the Tower of <NAME> .
He describes the <NAME> of <NAME> that faces the city beyond the valley , and he prayed in the cave where <NAME> prayed .
He also went to <NAME> , which stands outside the town on the south side ; he notices the gigantic fig-tree , on which , according to tradition , <NAME> hanged himself , and he visited the church of the guest-chamber , now destroyed .
After making the tour of the city by the <NAME> of <NAME> , and ascending by the brook <NAME> , the bishop returned to the <NAME> of <NAME> , which was covered with waving wheat and barley , grass and wild flowers , and he describes the place where <NAME> ascended from the summit of the mountain .
On this spot a large church has been built , with three arched porticoes that are not roofed over or covered in any way , but are open to the sky .
" They have not roofed in this church , " says the bishop , " because it was the place whence our Saviour ascended upon a cloud , and the space open to heaven allows the prayers of the faithful to ascend thither .
For when they paved this church they could not lay the pavement over the place where our <NAME> 's feet had rested , as , when the stones were laid upon that spot , the earth , as though impatient of anything not divine resting upon it , threw them up again before the workmen .
Beyond this , the dust bears the impress of the divine feet , and though , day by day , the faithful who visit the spot efface the marks , they immediately reappear and may be seen perpetually . "
After having explored the neighbourhood of <NAME> in the midst of the grove of olives , where the grave of <NAME> is said to be , and where the church , standing on the right hand is supposed to mark the spot where our Lord usually conversed with His disciples , <NAME> went to <NAME> , which is a short distance from the holy city .
He describes the birthplace of our Lord , a natural cave , hollowed out of the rock at the eastern end of the village , the church , built by <NAME> , the tombs of the three shepherds , upon whom the heavenly light shone at the birth of our Saviour , the burial-places of the patriarchs , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , and that of <NAME> , and he visited the oak of <NAME> , under which <NAME> received the visit of the angels .
<NAME> , <NAME> went to <NAME> , or rather the place where the town once stood , whose walls fell at the sound of <NAME> 's trumpets .
He explored the place where the children of <NAME> first rested in the land of <NAME> after crossing the river <NAME> , and he speaks of the church of <NAME> , where the twelve stones are placed , which the children of <NAME> took from the river when they entered the promised land .
He followed the course of the <NAME> , and found near one of the bends of the river on the right bank , and among the most beautiful scenery , about an hour 's walk from the <NAME> , the place where our <NAME> was baptized by <NAME> the <NAME> .
A cross is placed to mark the spot , but when the river is swollen , it is covered by the water .
After examining the banks of the <NAME> and tasting its brackish water , he viewed the source of the <NAME> , at the foot of <NAME> , and explored the greater part of the <NAME> of <NAME> , visiting the well where the woman of <NAME> gave our Lord the water He so much needed , seeing the fountain in the desert of which <NAME> the <NAME> drank , and the great plain of <NAME> , where our Lord blessed the five loaves and two fishes , and fed the multitude .
Next he went down to <NAME> , of which there are now no remains ; then visited <NAME> , where our <NAME> spent His childhood , and ended his journey at <NAME> in <NAME> .
The bishop 's narrative contains both geographical and historical accounts of other places , beyond those immediately connected with our <NAME> 's life on earth .
He visited the royal city of <NAME> , which is watered by four large rivers .
Also <NAME> , the chief town of <NAME> , which , though once separated from the mainland , was joined to it again by the jetty or pier made by the orders of <NAME> .
He speaks of <NAME> , once the capital of <NAME> , which he reached forty days after leaving <NAME> , and lastly , of <NAME> , where he often visited the large church in which " the wood of the cross is preserved , upon which the <NAME> suffered for the salvation of the human race . "
The account of this journey was written by the <NAME> de St. Columban at the dictation of the bishop , and not many years afterwards the same journey was undertaken by an <NAME> pilgrim , and accomplished in much the same way .
The name of this pilgrim was <NAME> , a member of a rich family living at <NAME> , who , on his recovery from a long illness , dedicated him to <NAME> 's service .
All his early life was spent in holy exercises in the monastery of <NAME> ; when he was grown up he had the most intense wish to see <NAME> 's at <NAME> , and was so set upon this , that it induced his father , brother , and young sister to wish to go there also ; they embarked at <NAME> in the spring of 721 , and making their way up the <NAME> , they landed at <NAME> .
We have but few details of the journey to <NAME> , but <NAME> mentions that after passing through <NAME> and <NAME> , at which latter place his father sank under the fatigue of the journey and died , he reached <NAME> in safety with his brother and sister , and passed the winter there , but they were all in turn attacked with fever .
When <NAME> regained his health , he determined to continue his journey to the <NAME> .
He sent his brother and sister back to <NAME> , while he joined some monks who were going in the same direction as himself .
They went by <NAME> and <NAME> to <NAME> , and set sail for <NAME> in <NAME> , and <NAME> and <NAME> in <NAME> , whence they again embarked , and , after touching at <NAME> and <NAME> , landed at <NAME> in <NAME> , where they visited the tombs of <NAME> John the <NAME> , of <NAME> , and of the seven sleepers of <NAME> , that is , seven Christians martyred in the time of the <NAME> .
They made some stay at <NAME> and at <NAME> , and then went to <NAME> and <NAME> ; we next find the party , seven in number , at <NAME> , visiting the tomb of <NAME> Thomas the <NAME> .
Here they were arrested as spies , and thrown into prison by the <NAME> , but the king , on the petition of a <NAME> , set them at liberty .
As soon as they were set free they left the town in great haste , and from that time their route is almost the same as that of the <NAME> ; they visited <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , where they saw a wonderful amphora on <NAME> , where our <NAME> was transfigured , and the <NAME> of <NAME> , where <NAME> walked upon the water ; <NAME> , where <NAME> and his sister dwelt ; <NAME> , where our Lord raised to life the son of the nobleman ; <NAME> in <NAME> , the native place of <NAME> Peter and <NAME> <NAME> ; <NAME> , where our Lord cured those possessed with devils ; <NAME> , and the spot where our <NAME> was baptized , as well as <NAME> and <NAME> .
They also went to the <NAME> of <NAME> , the <NAME> of <NAME> , and to <NAME> , the scene of the murder of the Innocents by <NAME> , and <NAME> .
While they were at <NAME> , <NAME> tells us that he suddenly became blind , while he was in the church of <NAME> , and only recovered his sight two months afterwards , as he entered the church of the <NAME> at <NAME> .
He went through the valley of Diospolis or <NAME> , ten miles from <NAME> , and then went to <NAME> and <NAME> , and thence , by <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , back to <NAME> , where the travellers spent the winter .
This was not to be the limit of their exploration , for we hear of them at <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , where <NAME> the <NAME> is said to have been buried , and at <NAME> , where it must be confessed that <NAME> defrauded the revenue of that time by smuggling some balsam that was very celebrated , and on which a duty was levied .
On quitting Tyre they went to <NAME> and lived there for two years before returning by <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
The <NAME> pilgrim reached the monastery of <NAME> , just ten years after his first setting out on his travels ; but his time of rest had not yet come , as he was appointed to a bishopric in <NAME> by <NAME> .
He was forty-one years of age when he was made bishop , and he lived forty years afterwards .
In 938 he was canonized by <NAME> .
We will conclude the list of celebrated travellers living between the first and ninth centuries , by giving a short account of <NAME> , a merchant of <NAME> , who , starting from the <NAME> , arrived eventually on the shores of <NAME> .
This narrative is in two distinct parts , one written in 851 , by <NAME> himself , who was the traveller , and the other in 878 by a geographer named Abou-Zeyd Hassan with the view of completing the first .
<NAME> , the orientalist , is of opinion that this narrative " has thrown quite a new light on the commercial transactions that existed in the ninth century between <NAME> , <NAME> , and the countries bordering on the <NAME> on one side , and the vast provinces of <NAME> and <NAME> on the other . "
<NAME> , as we have said , started from the <NAME> after having taken in a good supply of fresh water at <NAME> , and visited first , the second sea , or that of <NAME> .
He noticed a fish of enormous size , probably a spermaceti whale , which the seamen endeavoured to frighten away by ringing a bell , then a shark , in whose stomach they found a smaller shark , enclosing in its turn one still smaller , " both alive , " says the traveller , which is manifestly an exaggeration ; then , after describing the remora , the dactyloptera , and the porpoise , he speaks of the sea near the <NAME> in which he counted an enormous number of islands , among them he mentions <NAME> by its <NAME> name , with its pearl fisheries ; <NAME> , inhabited by cannibals , and rich in gold-mines ; <NAME> , and the <NAME> , where cannibalism still exists even at the present day .
" This sea , " he says , " is subject to fearful water-spouts which wreck the ships , and throw on its shores an immense number of dead fish and sometimes even large stones .
When these tempests are at their height the sea seethes and boils . "
<NAME> imagined it to be infested by a sort of monster who preyed upon human beings ; this is thought to have been a kind of dog-fish .
[ Illustration : <NAME> noticed a shark in whose stomach they found a smaller shark . ]
Arrived at <NAME> , <NAME> traded with the inhabitants , bartering some iron for cocoa-nuts , sugar-cane , bananas , & c. ; he then crossed the sea , and seems to have made for <NAME> , and northwards by the Gulf of <NAME> .
<NAME> put into a harbour , near <NAME> , to revictual his ships , and thence he went by the <NAME> Sea to Jehan-fou the port of the present town of Tche-kiang .
The remainder of the account of <NAME> 's travels , written by Abou-Zeyd Hassan , contains a detailed account of the manners and customs of the <NAME> and <NAME> ; but it is not the traveller himself who is speaking , and we shall find the same subjects spoken of in a more interesting manner by later authors .
We must add , in reviewing the discoveries made by travellers sixteen centuries before , and nine centuries after , the <NAME> era , that from <NAME> to the extreme boundaries of <NAME> , taking a line through the <NAME> ocean , the <NAME> , the <NAME> , the <NAME> , and the <NAME> of <NAME> , the immense extent of coast bordering these seas had been in a great measure visited .
Some explorations had been attempted in the interior of these countries ; for instance , in <NAME> as far as <NAME> , in <NAME> Minor to the <NAME> , in <NAME> and <NAME> ; and if these old travellers may not have quite understood mathematical precision , as to some of the points they visited , at all events the manners and customs of the inhabitants , the productions of the different countries , the mode of trading with them , and their religious customs , were quite sufficiently understood .
Ships could sail with more safety when the change of winds was no longer a subject of mere speculation , the caravans could take a more direct route in the interior of the countries , and the great increase of trade which took place in the middle ages is surely owing to the facilities afforded by the writings of travellers .
The Scandinavians in the <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> -- Benjamin of <NAME> visits <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , the <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , the <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> -- <NAME> explores <NAME> -- Manners and customs of the <NAME> -- <NAME> and the <NAME> of <NAME> , the <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
In the course of the tenth , and at the beginning of the eleventh century , a considerable amount of ardour for exploration had arisen in <NAME> .
Some Norwegians and adventurous <NAME> had penetrated to the <NAME> seas , and , if we may trust to some accounts , they had gone as far as the <NAME> and visited the country of the <NAME> .
Some documents say that <NAME> may have explored the <NAME> continent .
At all events we may be tolerably certain that <NAME> was discovered about A.D. 861 by some <NAME> adventurers , and that it was soon after colonized by <NAME> .
About this same time a <NAME> had taken refuge on a newly discovered land , and surprised by its verdure he gave it the name of <NAME> .
The communication with this portion of the <NAME> continent was difficult and uncertain , and one geographer says " it took five years for a vessel to go from <NAME> to <NAME> , and to return from <NAME> to <NAME> . "
Sometimes in severe winters the <NAME> was completely frozen over , and a certain Hollur-Geit , guided by a goat , was able to cross on foot from <NAME> to <NAME> .
We should keep in mind that the period of which we are speaking is the time when legends and traditions were very plentiful , and gained ready credence .
Let us return to well-authenticated facts , and relate the journey of a <NAME> Jew , whose truthfulness is beyond question .
This Jew was the son of a rabbi of <NAME> , a town in <NAME> , and he was called <NAME> of <NAME> .
It seems probable that the object of his voyage was to make a census of his brother <NAME> scattered over the surface of the <NAME> , but whatever may have been his motive , he spent thirteen years , from 1160-1173 , exploring nearly all the known world , and his narrative was considered the great authority on this subject up to the sixteenth century .
<NAME> of <NAME> left <NAME> , and travelling by <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , reached <NAME> .
Here he visited the two synagogues in the town and the principal Jews , and then set sail for <NAME> , arriving there in four days .
The Genoese were masters of the sea at that time , and were at war with the people of <NAME> , a brave people , who , like the <NAME> , says the traveller , " owned neither kings nor princes , but only the judges whom they appointed at their own pleasure . "
After visiting <NAME> , <NAME> of <NAME> went to <NAME> .
was <NAME> at that time , and according to this traveller , he included some Jews among his ministers .
Among the monuments of special interest in the eternal city , he mentions <NAME> 's and <NAME> <NAME> , but his descriptions are not interesting .
From Rome by <NAME> , and <NAME> , then partly inundated , he went to <NAME> , where he seems to have seen nothing but the five hundred Jews living there ; then by <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> Nicholas of <NAME> , and <NAME> , he arrived at <NAME> , having crossed <NAME> and yet found nothing interesting to relate of this splendid country .
The list of the places <NAME> of <NAME> visited , is not interesting , but we must not omit to mention one of them , for his narrative is most precise , and it is useful to follow his route by the maps specially prepared for this purpose by <NAME> .
From <NAME> to <NAME> , his halting-places were <NAME> , the Gulf of <NAME> , <NAME> , an ancient town in <NAME> , <NAME> in <NAME> , on the Gulf of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , at the foot of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , whose two thousand <NAME> inhabitants were the best makers of silk and purple in <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> .
Here , according to the <NAME> traveller , is the boundary-line of <NAME> ; he says the Wallachians are as nimble as goats , and come down from the mountains to pillage the neighbouring <NAME> towns .
<NAME> of <NAME> went on to Constantinople by way of <NAME> , a small township on the Gulf of <NAME> , <NAME> , a port much frequented by the Venetians and <NAME> , <NAME> , a town of which no traces are left , <NAME> , the ancient Thessalonica , and <NAME> .
He gives us some details of <NAME> ; the <NAME> was reigning at that time and lived in a palace that he had built upon the sea-shore , containing columns of pure gold and silver , and " the golden throne studded with precious stones , above which a golden crown is suspended by a chain of the same precious metal , which rests upon the monarch 's head as he sits upon the throne . "
In this crown are many precious stones , and one of priceless worth : " so brilliant are they , " says this traveller , " that at night , there is no occasion for any further light than that thrown back by these jewels . "
He adds that there is a large population in the city , and for the number of merchants from all countries who assemble there , it can only be compared to <NAME> .
The inhabitants are principally dressed in embroidered silk robes enriched with golden fringes , and to see them thus attired and mounted upon their horses , one would take them for princes , but they are not brave warriors , and they keep mercenaries from all nations to fight for them .
One regret he expresses , and that is , that there are no Jews left in the <NAME> , and that they have all been transported to <NAME> , near the entrance of the port , where are nearly two thousand five hundred of the sects ( <NAME> and <NAME> ) , and among them many rich merchants and silk manufacturers , but the <NAME> have a bitter hatred for them , and treat them with great severity .
Only one of these rich <NAME> was allowed to ride on horseback , he was the <NAME> 's physician , <NAME> , the <NAME> .
As to the remarkable buildings of <NAME> , he mentions the <NAME> of <NAME> , in which the number of altars answers to the number of days in a year , and the columns and gold and silver candlesticks , are too numerous to be counted ; also the <NAME> , which at the present day is used as a horse-market , but was then the scene of combats between " lions , bears , tigers , other wild beasts , and even birds . "
[ Illustration : The approach to <NAME> . ]
When <NAME> of <NAME> left <NAME> , he visited <NAME> and <NAME> , a port on the <NAME> coast , and went to the islands in the <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , whence there was much trade in the juice of the pistachio-tree , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
As he sailed towards the land of <NAME> , he passed by <NAME> , by <NAME> , where he admired the arrangements for supplying the city with water , and by <NAME> on his way to <NAME> , which he found had been recently shaken by an earthquake , that had been felt for miles round .
We next hear of him at <NAME> , at <NAME> , and <NAME> , celebrated for its glass manufactory , at <NAME> , at <NAME> near <NAME> , at <NAME> , at the beautiful town of <NAME> , at <NAME> , which is built in the midst of a fertile tract , where are vineyards , gardens , orchards , and olive-yards , at <NAME> , at <NAME> , and then at <NAME> .
In the holy city , it was but natural that the Jew could see nothing that would have interested a <NAME> visitor .
For him , <NAME> appeared only a small town , defended by three walls and peopled with <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> of all languages and nations .
He found four hundred horse-soldiers in the city ready for war at any moment , a great temple in which is the tomb of " that man , " as the <NAME> styles our Saviour , and a house in which the Jews had the privilege of carrying on the work of dyeing ; but they were few in number , scarcely two hundred , and they lived under the tower of <NAME> at one corner of the city .
Outside <NAME> , the traveller mentions the tomb of <NAME> , the sepulchre of <NAME> , the pool of <NAME> , near the brook <NAME> , the valley of <NAME> , and the <NAME> of <NAME> , from whose summit one can see the <NAME> .
Two leagues from it stands the pillar of <NAME> 's wife , and the traveller adds , " that though the flocks and herds which pass this pillar of salt are continually licking it , yet it never diminishes in size . "
From <NAME> , <NAME> of <NAME> went to <NAME> , and inscribed his name on <NAME> 's tomb , as it was customary for all Jews to do who passed by it ; and from <NAME> , after counting twelve Jewish dyeing establishments , he went on to <NAME> , which is now deserted and in ruins .
After visiting , in the plain of <NAME> , the tombs of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , and passing by Beth-Jairim , <NAME> , <NAME> , Beth-Nubi , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , built by <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , where are some hot springs , <NAME> and <NAME> , which is still a spot visited by <NAME> pilgrims , <NAME> and <NAME> , near the cavern , where the <NAME> takes its rise , the traveller left the land of <NAME> , and entered <NAME> .
The following is his description of this city , where the <NAME> rule begins .
" It is a very large and beautiful city , walled round , and outside the walls for fifteen miles are gardens and orchards , and of all the surrounding country , this is the most fertile spot .
The town stands at the foot of <NAME> , whence rise the two rivers , <NAME> and <NAME> ; the first passes through the city , and its waters are taken into the larger houses by means of aqueducts , as well as through the streets and markets .
This town trades with all the world .
The river <NAME> fertilizes the orchards and gardens outside the town .
There is an <NAME> mosque , called Goman-Dammesec , meaning the synagogue of <NAME> , and this building has not its equal ; it is said to have been <NAME> 's palace , and it contains a glass wall , built apparently by magic .
This wall has 365 holes in it , answering to the days of the year ; as the sun rises and sets it shines through one or other of these holes , so that the hour of the day may thus always be known .
Inside the palace or mosque are gold and silver houses , large enough to hold two or three persons at a time , if they wish to wash or bathe in them . "
After going to <NAME> and <NAME> , which are two days ' journey from <NAME> , <NAME> reached <NAME> , the <NAME> of the <NAME> and <NAME> , built by <NAME> , in the valley of the <NAME> , then to <NAME> , which is <NAME> , also built entirely of great stones .
Then passing by <NAME> , he stopped at <NAME> , which was partially destroyed by an earthquake in 1157 , which overthrew many of the <NAME> towns .
Now comes in the narrative a list of names , which are of no great interest : we may mention among them , <NAME> , whence the traveller returned towards the <NAME> ; and finally that he reached <NAME> , the residence of the <NAME> .
<NAME> was of great interest to the Jewish traveller ; he says it is a large town three miles in circumference , containing a hospital both for <NAME> and sick people of any nation .
It is the centre for learned men , philosophers , and magicians from all parts of the world .
It is the residence of the <NAME> , who at this time was probably <NAME> , whose dominion included western <NAME> and the banks of the <NAME> .
He had a vast palace , standing in a park watered by a tributary of the <NAME> and filled with wild beasts , he may be taken as a model sovereign on some points ; he was a good and very truthful man , kind and considerate to all with whom he came in contact .
He lived on the produce of his own toil , and made blankets , which , marked with his own seal , were sold in the market by the princes of his court , to defray the expense of his living .
He only left his palace once a year , at the feast of <NAME> , when he went to the mosque near the <NAME> gate , and there acting as <NAME> , he explained the law to his people .
He returned to his palace by a different route which was carefully guarded all the rest of the year , so that no other passer by might profane the marks of his footsteps .
All the brothers of the <NAME> inhabit the same palace as he does ; they are all treated with much respect , and have the government of provinces and towns in their hands , the revenues from them enabling them to pass a pleasant life ; only , as they once rebelled against their sovereign , they are now all fettered with chains of iron , and have guards mounted before their houses .
<NAME> of <NAME> visited that part of <NAME> in <NAME> which is watered by the <NAME> and <NAME> , and saw the ruined city of <NAME> , passing by what is said to be the furnace into which <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> were thrown , and the tower of <NAME> , which he describes as follows .
" The tower built by the tribes that were dispersed is of bricks ; its largest ground work must be two miles in circumference ; its length is two hundred and forty cubits .
At every ten cubits there is a passage leading to a spiral staircase , which goes to the upper part of the building ; from the tower there is a view of the surrounding country for twenty miles ; but the wrath of <NAME> fell upon it and it is now only a heap of ruins . "
[ Illustration : The Tower of <NAME> . ]
From <NAME> the traveller went to the <NAME> of <NAME> , situated on the <NAME> , a real sanctuary where believers congregate to read the book written by the prophet .
Then traversing <NAME> , & c. , to <NAME> , once the site of a celebrated Jewish college , and <NAME> , whose synagogue is built with stones from <NAME> , and crossing the desert of Yemen he passed Themar , <NAME> , and <NAME> which contained a great number of <NAME> inhabitants , to <NAME> ; and thence to <NAME> on the <NAME> , nearly at the end of the <NAME> .
He gives no account of this important town ; and thence he seems to have gone to <NAME> , to visit the tomb of the prophet <NAME> ; then he entered <NAME> and sojourned at <NAME> , a large town , partly in ruins , which the river <NAME> divides into two parts , one rich the other poor , joined by a bridge , over which hangs the coffin of <NAME> the prophet .
He went to <NAME> , which is the boundary of <NAME> , where he says the impostor David-el-roi appeared , the worker of false miracles , who is none other than our <NAME> , but called among the Jews of that part by the former name .
Then he went to <NAME> , where the tombs of <NAME> and Esther are found , and by Dabrestan he reached <NAME> , the capital of the kingdom , a city measuring twelve miles in circumference .
At this point the narrative of the traveller becomes somewhat obscure ; according to his notes we find him at <NAME> , then at <NAME> , then at the foot of the mountains in <NAME> .
This seems to have been his farthest point towards the north-east ; he must have come back to <NAME> and <NAME> on the banks of the <NAME> ; thence after a sea voyage of two days to El-Cachif , an <NAME> town on the <NAME> , where the pearl fishery is carried on .
Then , after another voyage of seven days and crossing the <NAME> of <NAME> , he seems to have reached <NAME> on the coast of <NAME> .
He was at last in <NAME> , the kingdom of the worshippers of the <NAME> and of the descendants of <NAME> .
This country produces pepper , ginger , and cinnamon .
<NAME> days after leaving Quilon he was among the fire-worshippers in <NAME> , and thence , perhaps , he went to <NAME> .
He thought this voyage a very perilous one , and says that many vessels are lost on it , giving the following singular expedient for averting the danger .
" You should take on board with you several skins of oxen , and , if the wind rises and threatens the vessel with danger , all who wish to escape envelope themselves each in a skin , sew up this skin so as to make it as far as possible water-tight , then throw themselves into the sea , and flocks of the great eagles called griffins , thinking that they are really oxen , will descend and bear them on their wings to some mountain or valley , there to devour their prey .
Immediately on reaching land the man will kill the eagle with his knife , and leaving the skin , will walk towards the nearest habitation ; many people , " he adds , " have been saved by this means . "
We find <NAME> of <NAME> again at <NAME> , then at the <NAME> of <NAME> in the <NAME> , and after crossing the <NAME> Sea he arrives in <NAME> , which he styles " the <NAME> that is on terra firma . "
Thence he goes down the Nile , crosses the country of <NAME> , reaches the town of <NAME> , and by the <NAME> , where the sand swallows up whole caravans , he goes to <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> or <NAME> .
This last is a large town containing fine squares and shops .
It never rains there , but this want is supplied by the overflow of the Nile once a year , which waters the country and renders it very fertile .
[ Illustration : Benjamin of <NAME> in the Desert of <NAME> . ]
He passed <NAME> on leaving <NAME> but does not mention the pyramids , and just names Ain-Schams , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> ; he stopped at <NAME> , built by <NAME> the <NAME> , a city of great commerce , frequented by merchants from all parts of the world .
Its squares and streets are thronged with people , and so long that one can not see from one end to another .
A dike or causeway runs out a mile into the sea , on which a high tower was built by the conqueror , and on the top of it a glass mirror was placed , by which all vessels could be seen while still fifty days ' sail away , coming from <NAME> or the east on their way to make war upon or otherwise harm the town .
" This tower , " if we may credit the writer , " is still of use as a signal to vessels coming to <NAME> , for it can be seen night or day , a great flaming torch being kept lighted at night , visible 100 miles off ! "
What are our light-houses when even with the electric light they are only visible thirty miles away ?
From <NAME> , the traveller visited several neighbouring towns , then returning there he embarked on board a vessel and twenty days afterwards landed at <NAME> .
He wished to continue the census that he was making , so by way of <NAME> and Lucca he went to <NAME> .
He mentions visiting several towns both in <NAME> and <NAME> , where <NAME> had settled , and according to <NAME> 's account , <NAME> of <NAME> 's computation brought the number of Jews to about 768,165 .
In conclusion the traveller speaks of <NAME> , which he seems to have visited ; he says , " This great town numbers among its inhabitants some remarkably learned men , who are unequalled for learning by any in the world ; they spend all their time studying law , and at the same time are very hospitable to all strangers , but especially to all their Jewish brethren . "
<NAME> is the account of <NAME> of <NAME> 's travels ; they form an important part of the geographical science of the middle of the twelfth century .
As we have used the modern names , it is easy to follow the short account of his route that we have given , on any atlas of the present day .
Next in order of succession we come to the name of <NAME> du <NAME> de <NAME> , or as some authors render it simply , <NAME> .
He was a Franciscan or <NAME> , born in 1182 , at <NAME> in <NAME> .
It is well known what inroads the <NAME> had made under Gengis-Khan , and in 1206 this chieftain had made <NAME> , an ancient <NAME> town , his capital .
This town was a little north of <NAME> .
His successor <NAME> , extended the <NAME> dominion into the centre of <NAME> , and , after raising an army of 600,000 men , he even invaded <NAME> .
<NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , all became the scenes of sanguinary conflicts which almost always ended in favour of the invaders .
The <NAME> were looked upon as demons possessed with superhuman power , and <NAME> was terrified at their approach .
sent an ambassador to the <NAME> , but he was treated with arrogance ; at the same time he sent other ambassadors to the <NAME> living in <NAME> Tartary , in the hope of stopping the <NAME> invasion , and as chief in this mission , the <NAME> was chosen , being known to be a clever and intelligent diplomatist .
<NAME> was accompanied by <NAME> , a <NAME> ; they set out on the 6th of April , 1245 , and went first to <NAME> , where the king gave them letters to some relations living in <NAME> , who he hoped might facilitate their entrance into <NAME> .
<NAME> had no difficulty in reaching the territory of the <NAME> of <NAME> , and by his advice they bought beaver and other furs as presents for the <NAME> chiefs .
Thus provided , they took a north-easterly route to <NAME> , then the chief town of <NAME> and now the seat of Government of that part , but they travelled in fear of the Lithuanians , who scoured the country at that time .
The Governor of <NAME> advised the <NAME> 's envoys to exchange their own for <NAME> horses , who were accustomed to seek for their food under the snow , and thus mounted they had no difficulty in getting as far as <NAME> .
There they both were attacked by severe illness ; when nearly recovered they bought a carriage , and in spite of the intense cold set out again .
Arrived at <NAME> , on the <NAME> , they found themselves in the frontier town of the <NAME> empire , and hence they were conducted to the <NAME> camp by one of the chiefs , whom they had made their friend by gifts .
In the camp they were badly received at first , but being directed to the <NAME> of <NAME> , who commanded an army of 60,000 men forming the advanced guard : this general sent them with an escort of three Tartars to <NAME> , the next in command to the Emperor himself .
Relays of horses were prepared for them on the road , they travelled night and day , and thus passed through the <NAME> ' country lying between the <NAME> , the <NAME> , the <NAME> , and the <NAME> , frequently having to cross the frozen rivers , and finally reaching the court of <NAME> on the frontiers of the <NAME> ' country .
" As we were being conducted to the prince , " says <NAME> , " we were told that we should have to pass between two fires , in order to purify us from any infection we might carry , and also to do away with any evil designs we might have towards the prince , which we agreed to do that we might be freed from all suspicion . "
The prince was seated on his throne in the midst of his courtiers and officers in a magnificent tent made of fine linen .
He had the reputation of being a just and kind ruler of his people , but very cruel in war .
<NAME> and <NAME> were placed on the left of the throne , and the papal letters , translated into a language composed of <NAME> and <NAME> , were presented to the prince .
He read them attentively and then dismissed the envoys to their tents , where their only refreshment was a little porringer full of millet .
This interview took place on <NAME> Friday , and the next day <NAME> sent for the envoys , and told them they must go to the Emperor .
They set out on Easter-day with two guides ; but having lived upon nothing but millet , water , and salt , the travellers were but little fit for a journey ; nevertheless their guides obliged them to travel very quickly , changing horses five or six times in a day .
They passed through almost a desert country , the <NAME> having driven away nearly all the inhabitants .
They came next to the country of the <NAME> to the east of <NAME> , where there was a great deficiency of water ; in this province the people were mostly herdsmen , under the hard yoke of the Mongolians .
<NAME> was travelling from <NAME> till Ascension-Day through the land of the <NAME> , and thence he came into the <NAME> country , or what we call <NAME> in the present day ; on all sides the eye rested on towns and villages in ruins .
After crossing a chain of mountains the envoys entered Kara-Kâty on the 1st of <NAME> ; here the governor received them very hospitably , and made his sons and the principal officers of his court dance before them for their amusement .
On leaving Kara-Kâty the envoys rode for some days along the banks of a lake lying to the north of the town of <NAME> , which must be , according to M. de Rémusat , the <NAME> .
There lived <NAME> , the eldest of the <NAME> captains , and here <NAME> and <NAME> took a day 's rest before encountering the cold and mountainous country of the Maimans , a nomadic people living in tents .
After some days the travellers reached the country of the <NAME> , and on the 22nd of July arrived at the place where the <NAME> was , or rather he who was to be <NAME> , the election having not yet taken place .
This future <NAME> was named <NAME> ; he received the envoys in a most friendly manner , a letter from <NAME> Bathy having explained to him the object of their visit ; not being yet Emperor he could not entertain them nor take any part in public affairs , but from the time of <NAME> 's death , his widow , the mother of <NAME> <NAME> had been <NAME> ; she received the travellers in a purple and white tent capable of holding 2000 persons .
<NAME> gives the following account of the interview : " When we arrived we saw a large assembly of dukes and princes who had come from all parts with their attendants , who were on horseback in the neighbouring fields and on the hills .
The first day they were all dressed in white and purple , on the second when <NAME> appeared in the tent , in red , on the third day they wore violet , and on the fourth , scarlet , or crimson .
Outside the tent , in the surrounding palisade were two great gates , by one of which the <NAME> alone might enter ; it was unguarded , but none dared to enter or leave by it ; while the other , which was the general entrance , was guarded by soldiers with swords , and bows and arrows ; if any one approached within the prescribed limits he was beaten , or else shot to death with arrows .
We noticed several horsemen there , on whose harness can not have been less than twenty marks ' worth of silver . "
A whole month passed away before <NAME> was proclaimed <NAME> , and the envoys were obliged to wait patiently for this before they could be received by him .
<NAME> turned this leisure time to account by studying the habits of the people ; he has given much interesting information on the subject in his account of his travels .
The country seemed to him to be principally very hilly and the soil sandy , with but little vegetation .
There is scarce any wood ; but all classes are content with dung for fuel .
Though the country is so bare , sheep seem to do well .
The climate is very changeable ; in summer , storms are very frequent , many fall victims to the vivid lightning , and the wind is often so strong as even to blow over men on horseback : during the winter there is no rain , which all falls in the summer , and then scarcely enough to lay the dust , while the storms of hail are terrible ; during <NAME> 's residence in the country they were so severe that once 140 persons were drowned by the melting of the enormous mass of hail-stones that had fallen .
It is a very extensive country , but miserable beyond expression .
<NAME> who seems to have been a man of great discernment took a very just idea of the Tartars themselves .
He says , " Their eyes are set very far apart ; they have very high cheek-bones , their noses are small and flat ; their eyes small , and their eye-lashes and eyebrows seem to meet ; they are of middle height with slender waists , they have small beards , some wear moustaches , and what are now called imperials .
On the top of the head the hair is shaved off like monks , and to the width of three fingers between their ears they also shave off the hair , letting what is between the tonsure and the back of the head grow to some length ; in fact it is as long as a woman 's in many cases , and plaited and tied in two tails behind the ear .
He says there is but little difference perceptible in the dress of the men and women , all alike wearing long robes trimmed with fur , and high buckram caps enlarged towards the upper part .
Their houses are built like tents of rods and stakes , so that they can be easily taken down and packed on the beasts of burden .
Other larger dwellings are sometimes carried whole as they stand , on carts , and thus follow their owner about the country .
" The <NAME> believe in God as the <NAME> of the universe and as the <NAME> and <NAME> of all , but they also worship the sun , moon , fire , earth , and water , and idols made in felt , like human beings .
They have little toleration , and put <NAME> of <NAME> and <NAME> to death for not worshipping the sun at midday at the command of <NAME> .
They are a superstitious people , believing in enchantment and sorcery , and looking upon fire as the purifier of all things .
When one of their chiefs dies he is buried with a horse saddled and bridled , a table , a dish of meat , a cup of mare 's milk , and a mare and foal .
" The Tartars are most obedient to their chiefs , and are truthful and not quarrelsome ; murders and deeds of violence are rare , there is very little robbery , and articles of value are never guarded .
They bear great fatigue and hunger without complaint , as well as heat and cold , singing and dancing under the most adverse circumstances .
They are much prone to drink to excess ; they are very proud and disdainful to strangers , and have no respect for the lives of human beings . "
<NAME> completes his sketch of the <NAME> character by adding that they eat all kinds of animals , dogs , wolves , foxes , horses , and even sometimes their fellow-creatures .
Their principal beverage is the milk of the mare , sheep , goat , cow , and camel .
They have neither wine , cervisia , ( a beverage composed of grain and herbs , ) nor mead , but only intoxicating liquors .
They are very dirty in their habits , scarcely ever washing their porringers , or only doing so in their broth ; they hardly ever wash their clothes , more especially " when there is thunder about ; " and they eat rats , mice , & c. , if they are badly off for other food .
The men are not brought up to any manual labour , their whole occupation consisting in hunting , shooting with bow and arrows , watching the flocks , and riding .
The women and girls are very athletic and very brave , they prepare furs and make clothes , drive carts and camels , and as polygamy is practised among them , and a man _buys_ as many wives as he can keep , there are enough women for all these employments .
<NAME> is the résumé of <NAME> 's observations made during his residence at Syra-Orda while he was awaiting the <NAME> 's election .
Soon he found that the election was about to take place ; he noticed that the courtiers always sang before <NAME> when he came out of his tent , and bowed down before him with beautiful little wands in their hands , having small pieces of scarlet wool attached to them .
On a plain about four leagues from Syra-Orda , beside a stream , a tent was prepared for the <NAME> , carpeted with scarlet , and supported on columns covered with gold .
On <NAME> 's day a large concourse of people assembled , each one fell on his knees as he arrived , and remained praying towards the sun ; but <NAME> and his companion refused to join in this idolatrous worship of the sun .
Then <NAME> was placed on the imperial throne , and the dukes and all the assembled multitudes having done homage to him , he was consecrated .
As soon as this ceremony was over , <NAME> and <NAME> were commanded to appear before the Emperor .
They were first searched and then entered the imperial presence at the same time as other Ambassadors , the bearers of rich presents ; the poor papal envoys had nothing to present ; whether this had anything to do with the length of time they had to wait before his <NAME> could attend to their affairs we do not know ; but days passed slowly by , and they were nearly dying of hunger and thirst , before they received a summons to appear before the Secretary of the <NAME> , and letters to the <NAME> were given to them , ending with these words , " we worship <NAME> , and by His help we shall destroy the whole earth from east to west . "
The envoys had now nothing to wait for , and during the whole of the winter they travelled across icy deserts .
About May they again arrived at the court of <NAME> , who gave them free passes , and they reached <NAME> about the middle of June , 1247 .
On the 9th of October of the same year the <NAME> made <NAME> of <NAME> in <NAME> , and this celebrated traveller died at <NAME> about the year <NAME> 's mission was not of much use , and the <NAME> remained much as they were before , a savage and ferocious tribe ; but six years after his return another monk of the minor order of <NAME> , named <NAME> , of <NAME> origin , was sent to the barbarians who lived in the country between the <NAME> and the <NAME> .
The object of this journey was as follows , -- St. <NAME> was waging war against the <NAME> of <NAME> at this time , and while he was engaging the <NAME> , <NAME> , a Mongol prince , attacked them on the side nearest to <NAME> , and thus caused a diversion that was in favour of the King of <NAME> .
The report arose that <NAME> had become a <NAME> , and <NAME> , anxious to prove the truth of it , charged <NAME> to go into the prince 's own country and there make what observations he could upon the subject .
In the month of June 1253 , <NAME> and his companions embarked for <NAME> .
From thence they reached the mouth of the river <NAME> on the <NAME> of <NAME> where they found a great number of <NAME> .
On their arrival among the <NAME> , their reception was at first very inhospitable , but after presenting the letters with which they were furnished , <NAME> , the governor of that province , gave them waggons , horses , and oxen for their journey .
Thus equipped they set out and were much surprised next day by meeting a moving village ; that is to say , all the huts were placed on waggons and were being moved away .
During the ten days that <NAME> and his companions were passing through this part of the country they were very badly treated , and had it not been for their own store of biscuits , they must have died of starvation .
After passing by the end of the <NAME> of Azov they went in an easterly direction and crossed a sandy desert on which neither tree nor stone was visible .
This was the country of the Comans that <NAME> had traversed , but in a more northerly part .
<NAME> left the mountains inhabited by the Circassians to the south , and after a wearisome journey of two months arrived at the camp of <NAME> <NAME> on the banks of the <NAME> .
This was the court of the prince , the son of <NAME> ; he had six wives , each of whom possessed a palace of her own , some houses , and a great number of chariots , some of them very large , being drawn by a team of twenty-two oxen harnessed in pairs .
<NAME> received the envoys of the King of <NAME> very graciously , and seeing their poverty , he supplied them with all that they required .
They were to be presented to the prince in their sacerdotal dress , when , bearing on a cushion a splendid <NAME> , the gift of the King of <NAME> , a Psalter given by the Queen , a <NAME> , a crucifix and a censer , they entered the royal presence , taking good care not to touch the threshold of the door , which would have been considered profanation .
Once in the royal presence , they sang the " <NAME> . "
After the prince and those of the princesses who were present at the ceremony had examined the books , & c. , that the monks had brought with them , the envoys were allowed to retire ; it being impossible for <NAME> to form any opinion as to <NAME> 's being a <NAME> , or not ; but his work was not yet finished , the prince having pressed the envoys to go to his father 's court .
<NAME> complied with the request , and crossing the country lying between the <NAME> and the <NAME> , they arrived at their destination .
There the same ceremonies had to be gone through as at the court of <NAME> .
The monks had to prepare their books , & c. , and be presented to the <NAME> , who was seated on a large gilded throne , but not wishing to treat with the envoys himself , he sent them to <NAME> , to the court of Mangu-khan .
They crossed the country of the <NAME> and visited <NAME> , <NAME> , passed the <NAME> and reached <NAME> , a town of which the position can not be accurately ascertained in the present day ; then by the land of <NAME> , by the <NAME> of <NAME> , and the territory of the <NAME> , they arrived at <NAME> , the capital of the <NAME> empire , where <NAME> had stopped without entering the town .
This town , says <NAME> , was surrounded with walls of earth , and had four gates in the walls .
The principal buildings it contained were two mosques and a <NAME> church .
While in this city , the monk made many interesting observations on the surrounding people , especially upon the <NAME> , whose oxen , of a remarkable race , are no other than the <NAME> , so celebrated in <NAME> .
In speaking of the Thibetans he notices their most extraordinary custom of eating the bodies of their fathers and mothers , in order to secure their having an honourable sepulture .
When <NAME> and his companions reached <NAME> , they found that the great khan was not in his capital , but in one of his palaces which was situated on the further side of the mountains which rise in the northern part of the country .
They followed him there , and the next day after their arrival presented themselves before him with bare feet , according to the <NAME> custom , so securing for themselves frozen toes .
<NAME> thus describes the interview : " Mangu-Khan is a man of middle height with a flat nose ; he was lying on a couch clad in a robe of bright fur , which was speckled like the skin of a sea-calf . "
He was surrounded with falcons and other birds .
Several kinds of beverages , arrack punch , fermented mare 's milk , and ball , a kind of mead , were offered to the envoys ; but they refused them all .
The khan , less prudent than they , soon became intoxicated on these drinks , and the audience had to be ended without any result being arrived at .
<NAME> remained several days at Mangu-Khan 's court ; he found there a great number of <NAME> and <NAME> prisoners , mostly employed in making different kinds of arms , or in working the mines of <NAME> .
The prisoners were well treated by the <NAME> , and did not complain of their lot .
After several interviews with the great khan , <NAME> gained permission to leave , and he returned to <NAME> .
Near this town stood a magnificent palace , belonging to the khan ; it was like a large church with nave and double aisles , here the sovereign sits at the northern end on a raised platform , the gentlemen being seated on his right , and the ladies on his left hand .
It is at this palace that twice every year splendid fêtes are given , when all the nobles of the country are assembled round their sovereign .
While at <NAME> , <NAME> collected many interesting documents relating to the <NAME> , their customs , literature , & c. ; then leaving the capital of the <NAME> , he returned by the same route as he had come , as far as <NAME> ; but there he branched to the south and went to <NAME> with a <NAME> escort , which was rendered necessary by the presence of tribes bent on pillage .
He visited <NAME> , and went thence by <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , to the port of <NAME> , whence he embarked for his own country .
His route was much the same as that of <NAME> , but his narrative is less interesting , and the <NAME> does not seem to have been gifted with the spirit of observation which characterized the <NAME> monk .
With <NAME> and <NAME> closes the list of celebrated travellers of the thirteenth century , but we have the brilliant career of <NAME> now before us , whose travels extended over part of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries .
The interest of the <NAME> and <NAME> merchants in encouraging the exploration of <NAME> -- The family of <NAME> , and its position in <NAME> -- <NAME> and <NAME> , the two brothers -- They go from <NAME> to the Court of the <NAME> of <NAME> -- Their reception at the Court of Kublaï-Khan -- The <NAME> appoints them his ambassadors to the <NAME> -- Their return to <NAME> -- <NAME> -- He leaves his father <NAME> and his uncle <NAME> for the residence of the King of Tartary -- The new <NAME> X. -- The narrative of <NAME> is written in <NAME> from his dictation , by <NAME> of <NAME> .
The <NAME> and <NAME> merchants could not fail to be much interested in the explorations of the brave travellers in <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , for they saw that these countries would give them new openings for disposing of their merchandise , and also the great benefit to be derived by the <NAME> from being supplied with the productions of the <NAME> .
The interests of commerce stimulated fresh explorations , and it was this motive that actuated two noble Venetians to leave their homes , and brave all the fatigue and danger of a perilous journey .
These two Venetians belonged to the family of <NAME> , which had come originally from <NAME> , and , owing to successful trading , had become so opulent as to be reckoned among the patrician families of <NAME> .
In 1260 the two brothers , <NAME> and <NAME> , who had lived for some years in <NAME> , where they had established a branch house , went to the <NAME> , with a considerable stock of precious stones , where their eldest brother , <NAME> , had his place of business .
<NAME> , taking a north-easterly direction and crossing the country of the <NAME> , they reached the camp of Barkaï-Khan on the <NAME> .
This Mongol prince received the two merchants very kindly , and bought all the jewels they offered him at double their value .
<NAME> and <NAME> remained a year in the <NAME> camp , but a war breaking out at this time between <NAME> , and <NAME> , the conqueror of <NAME> , the two brothers , not wishing to be in the midst of a country where war was being waged , went to <NAME> , and there they remained three years .
But when <NAME> was vanquished and his capital taken , the partisans of <NAME> induced the two Venetians to follow them to the residence of the grand Khan of <NAME> , who was sure to give them a hearty welcome .
This Kublaï-Khan , the fourth son of Gengis-Khan , was Emperor of <NAME> , and was then at his summer-palace in <NAME> , on the frontier of the <NAME> empire .
The <NAME> merchants set out , and were a whole year crossing the immense extent of country lying between <NAME> and the northern limits of <NAME> .
Kublaï-Khan was much pleased to receive these strangers from the distant <NAME> .
He fêted them , and asked , with much eagerness , for any information that they could give him of what was happening in <NAME> , requiring details of the government of the various kings and emperors , and their methods of making war ; and he then conversed at some length about the <NAME> and the state of the <NAME> .
<NAME> and <NAME> fortunately spoke the <NAME> language fluently , so they could freely answer all the emperor 's questions .
[ Illustration : Kublaï-Khan 's feast on the arrival of the <NAME> <NAME> . ]
It had occurred to Kublaï-Khan to send messengers to the <NAME> ; and he seized the opportunity to beg the two brothers to act as his ambassadors to his <NAME> .
The merchants thankfully accepted his proposal , for they foresaw that this new character would be very advantageous to them .
The emperor had some charters drawn up in the <NAME> language , asking the <NAME> to send a hundred learned men to convert his people to <NAME> ; then he appointed one of his barons named <NAME> to accompany them , and he charged them to bring him some oil from the sacred lamp , which is perpetually burning before the tomb of <NAME> at <NAME> .
The two brothers took leave of the khan , having been furnished with passports by him , which put both men and horses at their disposal throughout the empire , and in 1266 they set out on their journey .
Soon the baron <NAME> fell ill , and the Venetians were obliged to leave him and continue their journey ; but in spite of all the aid that had been given to them , they were three years in reaching the port of <NAME> , in <NAME> , now known by the name of <NAME> .
Leaving this port , they arrived at <NAME> in 1269 , where they heard of the death of <NAME> IV. , to whom they were sent , but the legate Theobald lived in <NAME> and received the <NAME> ; learning what was the object of their mission he begged them to wait for the election of the new Pope .
The brothers had been absent from their country for fifteen years , so they resolved to return to <NAME> , and at Negropont they embarked on board a vessel that was going direct to their native town .
On landing there , <NAME> was met by news of the death of his wife , and of the birth of his son , who had been born shortly after his departure in 1254 ; this son was the celebrated <NAME> .
The two brothers waited at <NAME> for the election of the <NAME> , but at the end of two years , as it had not taken place , they thought they could no longer defer their return to the <NAME> of the <NAME> ; accordingly they started for <NAME> , taking <NAME> with them , who could not then have been more than seventeen .
At Acre they had an interview with the legate Theobald , who authorized them to go to <NAME> and there to procure some of the sacred oil .
This mission accomplished , the Venetians returned to <NAME> and asked the legate to give them letters to Kublaï-Khan , mentioning the death of <NAME> .
; he complied with their request , and they returned to <NAME> or <NAME> .
There , to their great joy , they learnt that the legate Theobald had just been made <NAME> with the title of <NAME> X. , on the 1st of September , 1271 .
The newly-elected <NAME> sent at once for the <NAME> envoys , and the King of <NAME> placed a galley at their disposal to expedite their return to <NAME> .
The <NAME> received them with much affection , and gave them letters to the <NAME> of <NAME> ; he added two preaching friars , <NAME> of <NAME> and <NAME> of <NAME> , to their party , and gave them his blessing on their departure .
They went back to <NAME> , but had scarcely arrived before they were made prisoners by the soldiers of the <NAME> , who was then ravaging <NAME> .
The two preaching friars were so discouraged at this outset of the expedition that they gave up all idea of going to <NAME> , and left the two Venetians and <NAME> to prosecute the journey together as best they could .
Here begins what may properly be called <NAME> 's travels .
It is a question if he really visited all the places that he describes , and it seems probable that he did not ; in fact , in the narrative written at his dictation by <NAME> of Pisa it is stated " Marco-Polo , a wise and noble citizen of <NAME> , saw nearly all herein described with his own eyes , and what he did not see he learnt from the lips of truthful and credible witnesses ; " but we must add that the greater part of the kingdoms and towns spoken of by <NAME> Polo he certainly did visit .
We will follow the route he describes , simply pointing out what the traveller learnt by hearsay , during the important missions with which he was charged by Kublaï-Khan .
During this second journey the travellers did not follow exactly the same road as on the first occasion of their visit to the <NAME> of <NAME> .
They had lengthened their route by passing to the north of the celestial mountains , but now they turned to the south of them , and though this route was shorter than the other , they were three years and a half in accomplishing their journey , being much impeded by the rains and the difficulty of crossing the great rivers .
Their course may be easily followed with the help of a map of <NAME> , as we have substituted the modern names in place of the ancient ones used by <NAME> in his narrative .
<NAME> Minor -- <NAME> -- <NAME> -- <NAME> -- <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> -- <NAME> -- The Province of <NAME> -- Comadi -- Ormuz -- The <NAME> Man of the <NAME> -- Cheburgan -- Balkh -- <NAME> -- Kashgar -- <NAME> -- <NAME> -- The Desert -- Tangun -- Kara-Korum -- Signan-fu -- The <NAME> Wall -- Chang-tou -- The residence of Kublaï-Khan -- <NAME> , now <NAME> -- The <NAME> 's fêtes -- His hunting -- Description of <NAME> -- <NAME> <NAME> and bank-notes -- The system of posts in the <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> left the town of <NAME> ; he describes <NAME> as a very unhealthy place , the inhabitants of which , though once valiant , are now cowardly and wretched , their only talent seeming to lie in their capacity for drinking to excess .
From <NAME> Minor he went to <NAME> , whose inhabitants , though somewhat of savages , are clever in cultivating pastures and breeding horses and mules ; and the townspeople excel in the manufacture of carpets and silk .
<NAME> <NAME> , that <NAME> next visited , affords a good camping-ground to the <NAME> armies during the summer .
There the traveller saw <NAME> , where <NAME> 's <NAME> rested after the <NAME> .
He noticed that the lands bordering on the <NAME> Sea afford large supplies of naphtha , which forms an important item in the trade of that neighbourhood .
When he left Armenia he took a north-easterly course towards <NAME> , a kingdom lying on the south side of the <NAME> , whose ancient kings , says the legend , " were born with an eagle traced on their right shoulders . "
The <NAME> , he describes as good archers and men of war , and also as clever in working in gold and manufacturing silk .
Here is a celebrated defile , four leagues in length , which lies between the <NAME> and the <NAME> , that the <NAME> call the <NAME> , and Europeans the <NAME> of <NAME> , and here too is the miraculous lake , where fish are said to exist only during Lent .
Hence the travellers descended towards the kingdom of <NAME> , and arrived at the town of the same name on the right bank of the <NAME> , thence going to <NAME> , the residence of the <NAME> of all the <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> gives an account of the taking of <NAME> by the <NAME> in 1255 ; mentioning a wonderful story in support of the <NAME> idea of <NAME> , " that can remove mountains ; " he points out the route from this town to the <NAME> , which may be reached in eighteen days by the river , passing <NAME> , the country of dates .
From this point to <NAME> , a <NAME> town in the province of Adzer-baidjan , <NAME> 's route seems to be doubtful .
He takes up his narrative at <NAME> , which he describes as a large flourishing town built in the midst of beautiful gardens and carrying on a great traffic in precious stones and other valuable merchandise , but its Saracen inhabitants are disloyal and treacherous .
Here he seems to divide <NAME> geographically into eight provinces .
The natives of <NAME> , according to him , are formidable enemies to the merchants , who are obliged to travel armed with bows and arrows .
The principal trade of the country seems to be in horses and asses , which are sent to <NAME> or <NAME> and thence to <NAME> .
The natural productions of the country are wheat , barley , millet , and grapes , which grow in abundance .
<NAME> <NAME> went next to <NAME> , the most easterly town of <NAME> Proper ; on leaving it , after a ride of seven days through magnificent forests abounding in game , he came to the province of <NAME> .
Here the mines yield large quantities of turquoise , as well as iron and antimony ; the manufacture of arms and harness as well as embroidery and the training of falcons for hunting occupy a great number of the inhabitants .
On leaving <NAME> and his two companions set out on a nine days ' journey across a rich and populous country to the town of <NAME> , which is supposed to be the <NAME> of the present day , and was even then sinking into decay .
The country was superb ; on all sides were to be seen fine fat sheep , great oxen , white as snow , with short strong horns , and thousands of domestic fowls and other birds ; also there were magnificent date , orange , and pistachio trees .
After travelling for five days they entered the beautiful and well watered plain of <NAME> or <NAME> , and after two days ' further march they reached the shores of the <NAME> and the town of <NAME> , which forms the sea-port of the kingdom of <NAME> .
This country they found very warm und unhealthy , but rich in date and spice trees , in grain , precious stones , silk and golden stuffs , and elephants ' tusks , wine made from the date and other merchandise being brought into the town ready for shipment on board ships with but one mast , which came in numbers to the port ; but many were lost on the voyage to <NAME> , as they were only built with wooden pegs , not iron nails , to fasten them together .
From <NAME> , <NAME> , going up again towards the north-east , visited <NAME> ; then he ventured by dangerous roads across a sandy desert , where there was only brackish water to be found , the desert across which , 1500 years before , <NAME> had led his army to meet <NAME> .
Seven days afterwards he entered the town of <NAME> .
On leaving this town he crossed for eight days the great plains to <NAME> , the capital of the province of <NAME> , probably <NAME> .
At this point of his narrative <NAME> gives an account of the " Old Man of the <NAME> , " the chief of the <NAME> sect called the <NAME> , who were noted for their religious fanaticism and terrible cruelty .
He next visited the <NAME> town of <NAME> , a city celebrated for its sweet melons , and then the noble city of <NAME> , situated near the source of the <NAME> .
Next he crossed a country infested by lions to <NAME> , a great salt-market frequented by a large number of merchants , and to <NAME> ; this town seems to be the <NAME> spoken of by <NAME> , the <NAME> or <NAME> of Hiouen-Tsang , which <NAME> has identified with the hill of <NAME> of Zend-Avesta , that some commentators think must be the modern Koundouz .
In this part of the country he says porcupines abound , and when they are hunted they curl themselves up , darting out the prickles on their sides and backs at the dogs that are hunting them .
We now know how much faith to put in this pretended power of defence said to be possessed by the porcupine .
<NAME> Polo now entered the rocky mountainous kingdom of the <NAME> , whose kings claim descent from <NAME> the <NAME> ; a cold country , producing good fast horses , excellent falcons , and all kinds of game .
Here , too , are prolific ruby-mines worked by the king and which yield large quantities , but they are so strictly enclosed that no one on pain of death may set foot on the <NAME> mountain containing the mines .
In other places silver is found , and many precious stones , of which he says " they make the finest azure in the world , " meaning lapis-lazuli ; his stay in this part of the country must have been a long one to have enabled him to observe so many of its characteristics .
Ten days ' journey from hence he entered a province which must be the <NAME> of the present day , whose dark-skinned inhabitants were idolaters ; then after seven days ' further march , about mid-day he came to the kingdom of <NAME> , where the temperature is cool , and towns and villages are very numerous .
<NAME> <NAME> continued his route in the same direction he would soon have reached the territory of <NAME> , but instead of that he took a northerly course , and in twelve days was in <NAME> , a land watered by the <NAME> , which runs through splendid pastures , where feed immense flocks of wild sheep , called mufflons .
Thence he went through a mountainous country , lying between the <NAME> and <NAME> ranges to <NAME> .
Here <NAME> 's route is the same as that of his uncle and his father during their first voyage , when from <NAME> they were taken to the residence of the great khan .
From <NAME> , <NAME> diverged a little to the west , to <NAME> , a large town inhabited by <NAME> and <NAME> , then to <NAME> , a city frequented by caravans trading between <NAME> and <NAME> ; passing by <NAME> , the capital of the province of that name , and by <NAME> , a town whose situation is uncertain , but in a part of the country where chalcedony and jasper abound .
He came to the kingdom of <NAME> , which extends along the borders of the desert of <NAME> ; then after five days ' further travelling over sandy plains , where there was no water fit to drink , he rested for eight days in the city of <NAME> , a place now in ruins , while he prepared to cross the desert lying to the east , " so great a desert , " he says , " that it would require a year to traverse its whole length , a haunted wilderness , where drums and other instruments are heard , though invisible . "
After spending a year crossing this desert , <NAME> reached Tcha-tcheou , in the province of <NAME> , a town built on the western limits of the <NAME> empire .
There are but few merchants here , the greater part of the population being agricultural .
The custom that seems to have struck him the most in the province of <NAME> , was that of burning their dead only on a day fixed by the astrologers ; " all the time that the dead remain in their houses , the relations stay there with them , preparing a place at each meal as well as providing both food and drink for the corpse , as though it were still alive . "
<NAME> <NAME> and his companions made an excursion to the north-east , to the city of <NAME> , going on as far as <NAME> , a town inhabited by idolaters , <NAME> , and <NAME> , whose situation is disputed .
From this town <NAME> returned to Tcha-tcheou , and went eastward across <NAME> , by the town of So-ceu , over a tract of country particularly favourable to the cultivation of rhubarb , and by <NAME> , the Khan-tcheou of the <NAME> , then the capital of the province of <NAME> , an important town , whose numerous chiefs are idolaters and polygamists .
The three Venetians remained a year in this large city ; it is easy to understand , from their long halts and deviations , why they required three years for their journey across <NAME> .
They left Khan-tcheou , and after riding for twelve days they reached the borders of a sandy desert , and entered the city of <NAME> .
This was another détour , as it lay directly north of their route , but they wished to visit Kara-Korum , the celebrated capital of <NAME> , where <NAME> had been in 1254 .
<NAME> <NAME> was certainly an explorer by nature ; fatigue was nothing to him if he had any geographical studies to complete , which is proved by his spending forty days crossing an uninhabited desert without vegetation , in order to reach the <NAME> town .
When he arrived there , he found a city measuring three miles in circumference , which had been for a long time the capital of the <NAME> , before it was conquered by Gengis-Khan , the grandfather of the reigning emperor .
Here <NAME> makes an historical digression , in which he gives an account of the wars of the <NAME> chiefs against the famous Prester <NAME> who held all this part of the country under his dominion .
<NAME> <NAME> after returning to Khan-tcheou left it again , marching five days towards the east , and arriving at the town of <NAME> .
Thence he went a little to the south to visit Sining-foo , across a tract of country where grazed great wild oxen and the valuable species of goat which is called the " musk-bearer . "
Returning to <NAME> , they went eastward to <NAME> , where there is the best manufactory of cloth made from camels ' hair in the world , to <NAME> , a town in the province of the same name , where a descendant of Prester <NAME> reigned , but who had given in his submission to the great khan ; this was a busy flourishing town : from hence the travellers went to Sinda-tchou , and on beyond the great wall of <NAME> as far as <NAME> , which must be Tzin-balgassa , a pretty town where the emperor lives when he wishes to hawk ; for cranes , storks , pheasants , and partridges abound in this neighbourhood .
At last <NAME> , his father , and his uncle , reached <NAME> or Tchan-tchou of the present day , called elsewhere in this narrative Clemen-foo .
Here Kublaï-Khan received the papal envoys , for he was occupying his summer palace beyond the great wall , north of <NAME> , which was then the capital of the empire .
The traveller does not tell us what reception he met with , but he describes most carefully the palace , the grandeur of the building of stone and marble , standing in the middle of a park surrounded by walls , enclosing menageries and fountains .
Also a building made of reeds , so closely interlaced as to be impenetrable to water ; it was a sort of movable kiosk that the great khan inhabited during the fine months of June , July , and August .
The weather during the emperor 's sojourn in this summer palace could not but be beautiful , for , according to <NAME> , the astrologers who were attached to the khan 's court were charged to scatter all rain and fog by their sorcery , and the travellers seem to believe in the power of these magicians .
" These astrologers , " he says , " belong to two races , both idolaters ; they are learned in all magic and enchantments , above any other men , and what they do is done by the aid of the devil , but they make others believe that they owe their power to the help of <NAME> , and their own holiness .
These people have the following strange custom : when a man has been condemned and put to death , they take the body , cook , and eat it ; but in the case of a natural death they do not eat the body .
And you must know that these people of whom I am speaking , who know so many kinds of enchantments , work the wonder I am about to relate .
When the great khan is seated at dinner in the principal dining-hall , the table of which is eight cubits in length , and the cups are on the floor ten paces from the table , filled with wine , milk , and other good beverages , these clever magicians , by their arts , make these cups rise by themselves , and without any one touching them , they are placed before the great khan .
This has been done before an immense number of people , and is the exact truth ; and those skilled in necromancy will tell you that it is quite possible to do this . "
<NAME> Polo next gives a history of <NAME> , whom he considers to possess more lands and treasures than any man since our first father , <NAME> .
He tells how the great khan ascended the throne in the year 1256 , being then eighty-five ; he was a man of middle height , rather stout , but of a fine figure , with a good complexion and black eyes .
He was a good commander in war , and his talents were put to the proof when his uncle <NAME> , having rebelled against him , wished to dispute his power at the head of 400,000 cavalry .
Kublaï-Khan collected ( in secret ) a force of 300,000 horsemen , and 100,000 foot-soldiers , and marched against his uncle .
The battle was a most terrible one , so many men being killed , but the khan was victorious , and <NAME> , as a prince of the blood royal , was condemned to be sewn up tightly in a carpet , and died in great suffering .
After his victory the khan made a triumphal entry into <NAME> , capital of <NAME> , or , as it is now called , <NAME> .
When <NAME> arrived at this city he made a long stay there , remaining until the emperor needed his services to undertake various missions into the interior of <NAME> .
The emperor had a splendid palace at <NAME> , and the traveller gives so graphic an account of the riches and magnificence of the <NAME> sovereigns , that we give it word for word .
" The palace is surrounded by a great wall , a mile long each way , four miles in length altogether , very thick , ten feet in height , all white and battlemented .
At each corner of this wall is a palace beautiful and rich , in which all the trappings of war belonging to the great khan are kept ; his bows , quivers , the saddles and bridles of the horses , the bow-strings , in fact everything that would be wanted in time of war ; in the midst of each square is another building , like those at the corner , so that there are eight in all , and each building contains one particular kind of harness or trapping .
In the wall on the south side are five doors , the middle or large door only being opened when the emperor wishes to go in or out ; near this great gate on either side is a smaller one through which other people may pass , and two others for the same purpose .
Inside this wall is another , having also eight buildings to be used in the same manner . "
Thus we see that all these buildings constituted the emperor 's armoury and harness-store ; we shall not be surprised that there was so much harness to be kept when we know that the emperor possessed a race of horses white as snow , and among them ten thousand mares , whose milk was reserved for the sole use of princes of the blood royal .
[ Illustration : The <NAME> 's palace at <NAME> . ]
<NAME> <NAME> continues his narrative thus : -- " The inner wall has five gates on the south side , answering to those in the outer wall , but on the other sides the walls have only one gate each .
In the centre of the enclosure made by these walls , stands the palace , the largest in the world .
It has no second story , but the ground-floor is raised about eight feet above the ground .
The roof is very high , the walls of the rooms are covered with gold and silver , and on this gold and silver are paintings of dragons , birds , horses , and other animals , so that nothing can be seen but gilding and pictures .
The dining-hall is large enough to hold 6000 men , and the number of other rooms is marvellous , and all is so well arranged that it could not be improved .
The ceilings are painted vermillion , green , blue , yellow , and all kinds of colours , varnished so as to shine like crystal , and the roof is so well built that it will last for many years .
Between the two walls the land is laid out in fields with fine trees in them , containing different species of animals , the musk-ox , white deer , roe-buck , fallow-deer , and other animals , who fill the space between the walls , except the roads reserved for human beings .
On the north-western side is a great lake , full of fishes of divers kinds , for the great khan has had several species placed there , and each time that he desires it to be done , he has his will in it .
A river rises in this lake and flows out from the grounds of the palace , but no fish escape in it , there being iron and brass nets to prevent their doing so .
On the northern side , near an arched doorway , the emperor has had a mound made , a hundred feet in height and more than a mile in circumference ; it is covered with evergreen trees , and the emperor , being very fond of horticulture , whenever he hears of a fine tree , sends for it and has it brought by his elephants , with the roots and surrounding soil , the size of the tree being no impediment , and thus he has the finest collection of trees in the world .
The hill is called 'green hill , ' from its being covered with evergreen trees and green turf , and on the top of the hill is a house .
This hill is altogether so beautiful that it is the admiration of every one . "
After <NAME> has concluded his description of this palace , he gives one of that of the emperor 's son and heir ; then he speaks of the town of <NAME> , the old town which is separated from the modern town of <NAME> by a canal , the same which divides the <NAME> and <NAME> quarters of <NAME> .
The traveller gives many particulars of the emperor 's habits , and among other things , he says that Kublaï-Khan has a body-guard of 2000 horse-soldiers ; but he adds , " it is not fear that causes him to keep this guard . "
His meals are real ceremonies , and etiquette is most rigidly enforced .
His table is raised above the others , and he always sits on the north side with his principal wife on his right , and lower down his sons , nephews , and relations ; he is waited upon by noble barons , who are careful to envelope their mouths and noses in fine cloth of gold , " so that their breath and their odour may not contaminate the food or drink of their lord . "
When the emperor is about to drink , a band of music plays , and when he takes the cup in his hand , all the barons and every one present , fall on their knees .
The principal fêtes given by the grand khan were on the anniversary of his birth , and on the first day of the year .
At the first , 12,000 barons were accustomed to assemble round the throne , and to them were presented annually 150,000 garments made of gold and silk and ornamented with pearls , whilst the subjects , idolaters as well as <NAME> , offered up public prayers .
At the second of these fêtes , on the first day of the year , the whole population , men and women alike , appeared dressed in white , following the tradition that white brings good fortune , and every one brought gifts to the king of great value .
One hundred thousand richly-caparisoned horses , five thousand elephants covered with handsome cloths and carrying the imperial plate , as well as a large number of camels , passed in procession before the emperor .
During the three winter months of December , January , and February , when the khan is living in his winter palace , all the nobles within a radius of sixty days ' march are obliged to supply him with boars , stags , fallow-deer , roes , and bears .
Besides , <NAME> is a great huntsman himself , and his hunting-train is superbly mounted and kept up .
He has leopards , lynxes and fine lions trained to hunt for wild animals , eagles strong enough to chase wolves , foxes , fallow and roe-deer , and , as <NAME> says , " often to take them too , " and his dogs may be counted by thousands .
It is about March when the emperor begins his principal hunting in the direction of the sea , and he is accompanied by no less than 10,000 falconers , 500 gerfalcons , and many goshawks , peregrine , and sacred falcons .
During the hunting excursion , a portable palace , covered outside with lions ' skins and inside with cloth of gold , and carried on four elephants harnessed together , accompanies the emperor everywhere , who seems to enjoy all this oriental pomp and display .
He goes as far as the camp of Chachiri-Mongou , which is situated on a stream , a tributary of the river <NAME> , and the tent is set up , which is large enough to hold ten thousand nobles .
This is his reception-saloon where he gives audiences ; and when he wishes to sleep he goes into a tent which is hung all round with ermine and sable furs of almost priceless value .
The emperor lives thus till about <NAME> , hunting cranes , swans , hares , stags , roebucks , & c. , and then returns to his capital , <NAME> .
<NAME> Polo now completes his description of this fine city and enumerates the twelve quarters it contains , in many of which the rich merchants have their palatial houses , for commerce flourishes in this town , and more valuable merchandise is brought to it than to any other in the world .
It is the depôt and market for the richest productions of <NAME> , such as pearls and precious stones , and merchants come from long distances round to purchase them .
The khan has established a mint here for the benefit of trade , and it is an inexhaustible source of revenue to him .
The bank-notes , sealed with the emperor 's seal , are made of a kind of card-board manufactured from the bark of the mulberry-tree .
The card-board thus prepared is cut into various thicknesses according to the value of the money it is supposed to represent .
The currency of this money is enforced , none daring to refuse it " on pain of death ; " the emperor using it in all his payments , and enforcing its circulation throughout his dominions .
Besides this , several times in the year the possessors of precious stones , pearls , gold , or silver , are obliged to bring their treasures to the mint and receive in exchange for them these pieces of card-board , so that , in fact , the emperor becomes the possessor of all the riches in his empire .
According to <NAME> the system of the <NAME> Government was wonderfully centralized .
" The kingdom is divided into thirty-four provinces , and is governed by twelve of the greatest barons living in <NAME> ; in the same palace also reside the intendants and secretaries , who conduct the business of each province .
From this central city a great number of roads diverge to the various parts of the kingdom , and on these roads are now post-houses stationed at intervals of twenty-two miles , where well-mounted messengers are always ready to carry the emperor 's messages .
Besides this , at every three miles on the road there is a little hamlet of about fourteen houses where the couriers live , who carry messages on foot ; these men wear a belt round their waists and have a girdle with bells attached to it , that are heard at a long distance ; they start at a gallop , quickly accomplishing the three miles and giving the message to the courier who is waiting for it at the next hamlet ; thus the emperor receives news from places at long distances from the capital in a comparatively short time . "
This mode of communication also involved but small expense to Kublaï-Khan , as the only remuneration he gave these couriers was their exemption from taxation , and as to the horses , they were furnished gratuitously by the provinces .
But if the emperor used his power in this manner to lay heavy burdens upon his subjects , he exerted himself actively for their good , and was always ready to help them ; for instance , when their crops were damaged by hail-storms , he not only remitted all taxes , but gave them corn from his own stores , and when there was any great mortality among the flocks and herds in any particular province , he always replaced them at his own expense .
He was careful to have a large quantity of wheat , barley , millet , and rice , stored up in years of abundant harvest , so as to keep the price of grain at a uniform rate when the harvest failed .
He was particularly careful of the poor who lived in <NAME> .
" He had a list made of all the poorest houses in the town , where they were usually short of food , and supplied them liberally with wheat and other grain according to the size of their families , and bread was never refused to any applying at the palace for it ; it is computed that at least 30,000 persons avail themselves of this daily throughout the year .
His kindness to his poor subjects makes them almost worship him . "
The whole affairs of the empire are administered with great care , the roads well kept up and planted with fine trees , so that from a distance their direction can easily be traced .
There is no want of wood , and in <NAME> they work a number of coal-pits which supply abundance of coal .
[ Illustration : Map of the world according to <NAME> 's ideas . ]
<NAME> <NAME> remained a long time at <NAME> , and his intelligence , spirit , and readiness in adapting himself , made him a great favourite with the emperor .
He was intrusted with various missions , not only in <NAME> , but also to places on the coast of <NAME> , <NAME> , the <NAME> and <NAME> coasts , and a part of <NAME> near <NAME> , and between the years 1277 and 1280 he was made governor of Yang-tcheou , and of twenty-seven other towns which were joined with it under the same government .
<NAME> to the missions on which he was sent , he travelled over an immense extent of country , and gained a great amount of ethnological and geographical knowledge .
We can now follow him map in hand through some of these journeys , which were of the greatest service to science .
Tso-cheu -- Tai-yen-fou -- Pin-yang-fou -- The <NAME> River -- Signan-fou -- Szu-tchouan -- Ching-tu-fou -- Thibet -- Li-kiang-fou -- <NAME> -- Yung-tchang -- Mien -- <NAME> -- <NAME> -- Tai-ping -- Cintingui -- Sindifoo -- Té-cheu -- Tsi-nan-fou -- Lin-tsin-choo -- Lin-sing -- Mangi -- Yang-tcheu-fou -- Towns on the coast -- Quin-say or Hang-tcheou-foo -- Fo-kien .
When <NAME> had been at <NAME> some time , he was sent on a mission that kept him absent from the capital for four months .
Ten miles southwards from <NAME> , he crossed the fine river Pe-ho-nor ( which he calls the <NAME> ) , by a stone bridge of twenty-four arches , and 300 feet in length , which was then without parallel in the world .
<NAME> miles further on he came to the town of Tso-cheu , where a large trade in sandal-wood is carried on ; at ten days ' journey from hence he came to the modern town of <NAME> , which was once the seat of an independent government .
All the province of Shan-si seemed rich in vines and mulberry-trees ; the principal industry in the towns was the making of armour for the emperor 's use .
[ Illustration : A fine bridge of stone built on twenty-four arches . ]
Seven days ' journey further on they came to the beautiful commercial city of <NAME> , now called Pin-yang-foo , where the manufacture of silk was carried on .
He soon afterwards came to the banks of the <NAME> , which he calls <NAME> or <NAME> , probably on account of its waters being darkened by the aquatic plants growing in them ; at two days ' journey from hence he came to the town of <NAME> , whose position is not now clearly defined .
He found nothing remarkable in this town , and leaving it he rode across a beautiful country , covered with towns , country-houses , and gardens , and abounding in game .
In eight days he reached the fine city of <NAME> , the ancient capital of the <NAME> dynasty , now called <NAME> , and the capital of <NAME> ; here reigned <NAME> , the emperor 's son , an upright and amiable prince , much loved by his people .
He lived in a magnificent palace outside the town , built in the midst of a park , of which the battlemented wall can not have been less than five miles in circumference .
From <NAME> , the traveller went towards <NAME> , across the modern province of Szu-tchouan , a mountainous country intersected by deep valleys , where lions , bears , lynxes , & c. , abounded , and after twenty-eight days ' march he found himself on the borders of the great plain of Acmelic-mangi .
This is a fertile country and produces all kinds of vegetation ; ginger is especially cultivated ; there is sufficient to supply all the province of <NAME> , and so fertile is the soil that according to a <NAME> traveller , M. E. Simon , an acre is now worth 15,000 francs , or three francs the metre .
In the thirteenth century this plain was covered with towns and country-houses , and the inhabitants lived upon the fruits of the ground , and the produce of their flocks and herds , while the large quantity of game furnished hunters with abundant occupation .
<NAME> Polo next visited the town of <NAME> ( now Tching-too-foo ) , the capital of the province of Se-tchu-an , whose population at the present day exceeds 1,500,000 souls .
<NAME> , measuring at that time twenty miles round , was divided into three parts , each surrounded with its own wall , and each part had a king of its own before Kublaï-Khan took possession of the town .
The great river <NAME> ran through the town : it contained large quantities of fish , and from its size resembled a sea more than a river ; its waters were covered by a vast number of vessels .
Five days after leaving this busy , thriving town <NAME> reached the province of <NAME> , which he says " is very desolate , for it has been destroyed by the war . "
<NAME> abounds in lions , bears , and other savage animals , from which the travellers would have much difficulty in defending themselves had it not been for the quantity of large thick canes that grow there , which are probably bamboos : he says , " the merchants and travellers passing through these countries at night collect a quantity of these canes and make a large fire of them , for when they are burning they make such a noise and crackle so much , that the lions , bears , and other wild beasts take flight to a distance , and would not approach these fires on any account ; thus both men , horses , and camels are safe .
In another way , too , protection is afforded by throwing a number of these canes on a wood fire , and when they become heated and split , and the sap hisses , the sound is heard at least ten miles off .
When any one is not accustomed to this noise , it is so terrifying that even the horses will break away from their cords and tethers ; so their owners often bandage their eyes and tie their feet together to prevent their running away . "
This method of burning canes is still used in countries where the bamboo grows , and indeed the noise may be compared to the loudest explosion of fire-works .
According to <NAME> , <NAME> is a very large province , having its own language ; and its inhabitants , who are idolaters , are a race of bold thieves .
A large river , the Khin-cha-kiang , flows over auriferous sands through the province ; a quantity of coral is found in it which is much used for idols , and for the adornment of the women .
<NAME> was at this time under the dominion of the great khan .
The traveller took a westerly direction when he left <NAME> , and crossing the kingdom of Gaindu he must have come to Li-kiang-foo , the capital of the country that is now called Tsi-mong .
In this province he visited a beautiful lake which produces pearl-oysters ; the fishing is the emperor 's property ; he also found great quantities of cinnamon , ginger , cloves , and other spices under cultivation .
After leaving the province of <NAME> , and crossing a large river , probably the <NAME> , <NAME> took a south-easterly course to the province of <NAME> , which probably forms the north-western part of <NAME> .
According to his account all the inhabitants of this province , who are mostly great riders , live on the raw flesh of fowls , sheep , buffaloes , and oxen ; the rich seasoning their raw meat with garlic sauce and good spices .
This country is infested with great adders , and serpents , " hideous to look upon . "
These reptiles , probably alligators , were ten feet long , had two legs armed with claws , and with their large heads and great jaws could at one gulp swallow a man .
Five days ' journey west of <NAME> , <NAME> took a new route to the south , and entered the province of <NAME> , whose capital <NAME> , is the modern town of Yung-chang .
All the inhabitants of the city had teeth of gold ; that is to say , they covered their teeth with little plates of gold which they removed before eating .
The men of this province employed themselves only in hunting , catching birds , and making war , the hard work all devolving upon the women and slaves .
These Zardanians have neither idols nor churches , but they each worship their ancestor , the patriarch of the family .
Their tradesmen carry their goods about on barrows like the bakers in <NAME> .
They have no doctors , but only enchanters , who jump , dance , and play musical instruments around the invalid 's bed till he either dies or recovers .
[ Illustration : <NAME> in the midst of the forests . ]
Leaving these people with gilded teeth , <NAME> took the great road which conveys all the traffic between <NAME> and <NAME> , and passed by <NAME> , where a market is held three times a week , which attracts merchants from the most distant countries .
After riding for fifteen days through forests filled with elephants , unicorns , and other wild animals , he came to the great city of <NAME> ; that is to say , to that part of <NAME> , of which the present capital , of recent erection , is called <NAME> .
This city of <NAME> , which may be , perhaps , the old town of Ava now in ruins , or the old town of <NAME> situated on the <NAME> , possessed a veritable architectural marvel , in two towers , one built of fine stone , and entirely covered with a coating of gold about an inch in thickness , and the other , also of stone , coated with silver , both intended to serve as a tomb for the king of <NAME> , before his kingdom fell under the dominion of the khan .
After visiting this province , the traveller went to <NAME> , the <NAME> of the present day , which at this time , 1290 , did not belong to Kublaï-Khan .
The emperor 's forces were then engaged in trying to conquer this fertile country , rich in cotton plants , in sugar-canes , & c. , and whose magnificent oxen were like elephants in height .
From thence , the traveller ventured as far as the city of <NAME> , in the province of the same name , probably the modern town of <NAME> .
The natives here tattooed their bodies , and with needles drew pictures of lions , dragons , and birds on their faces , necks , bellies , hands , legs , and bodies , and he who had the greatest number of these pictures they considered the most beautiful of human beings .
<NAME> was the most southerly point visited by <NAME> , during this journey .
Leaving this city , he went towards the north-east , and by the country of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , he reached <NAME> , now called Tai-ping , after fifteen days ' march .
There he found that fine race of men , of dark colour , who have crowned their mountains with strong castles , and whose ordinary food is the flesh of animals , milk , rice , and spices .
On leaving <NAME> , he followed the course of a river for twelve days , and found numerous towns on its banks .
Here , as M. <NAME> truly observes , the traveller is leaving the country known as <NAME> beyond the <NAME> , and returning towards <NAME> .
In fact , <NAME> after leaving <NAME> visited the province of <NAME> with its capital of the same name , and what struck him most in this country , ( and we can not but think that the bold explorer was also a keen hunter ) was the great number of lions that were to be seen about its mountains and plains .
Only , commentators are of opinion that the lions he speaks of must have been tigers , for no lions are found in <NAME> , but we will give his own words : he says , " There are so many lions in this country , that it is not safe to sleep out of doors for fear of being devoured .
And when you are on the river and stop for the night , you must be careful to anchor far from land , for otherwise the lions come to the vessel , seize upon a man , and devour him .
The inhabitants of this part of the country are well aware of this , and so take measures to guard against it .
These lions are very large and very dangerous , but there are dogs in this country brave enough to attack these lions ; it requires two dogs and a man to overcome each lion . "
From this province <NAME> returned to <NAME> , the capital of the province of Se-chuen , whence he had started on his excursion into <NAME> ; and retracing the route by which he had set out , he returned to Kublaï-Khan , after having brought his mission to <NAME> to a satisfactory termination .
It was probably at this time that the traveller was first entrusted by the emperor with another mission to the south-east of <NAME> .
M. Pauthier , in his fine work upon the <NAME> traveller , speaks of this south-easterly part of <NAME> as " the richest and most flourishing quarter of this vast empire and that also about which , since the 16th century , <NAME> have had the most information . "
As we return to the route that M. Pauthier has traced on his map , we find that <NAME> went southwards to <NAME> , probably the town of Ti-choo , and at six days ' journey from thence he came to <NAME> , the present city of Tsi-nan , the capital of the province of Shan-tung , the birthplace of <NAME> .
It was at that time a fine town and much frequented by silk-merchants , and its beautiful gardens produced abundance of excellent fruit .
Three days ' march from hence , the traveller came to the town of Lin-tsing , standing at the mouth of the Yu-ho canal , the principal rendezvous for the innumerable boats that carry so much merchandise to the provinces of <NAME> and <NAME> .
Eight days afterwards he passed by <NAME> , which seems to correspond to the modern town of Lin-tsin , and the town of <NAME> , the first city in the province of <NAME> ; then by the town of <NAME> , he arrived at <NAME> , the <NAME> , which he had crossed higher up when he was on his way to <NAME> ; here <NAME> was not more than a league from the mouth of this great river .
After crossing it he was in the province of <NAME> , a territory included in the <NAME> of the <NAME> .
Before this province of <NAME> belonged to Kublaï-Khan it was governed by a very pacific king , who shunned war , and was very merciful to all his subjects .
<NAME> <NAME> describes him so well that we will quote his own words .
" This last emperor of the <NAME> dynasty was most generous , and I will cite but two noble traits to show this ; every year he had nearly 20,000 infants brought up at the royal charge , for it was the custom in these provinces , when a poor woman could not bring up a child herself , to cast it away as soon as it was born , to die .
The king had all these children taken care of , and a record kept of the sign and the planet under which each was born , and then they were sent to different places to be brought up , for there are a quantity of nurses .
When a rich man had no sons , he came to the king and asked of him some of his wards , who were immediately given to him .
As the children grew up they intermarried , and the king gave them sufficient incomes to live upon .
When he went through his dominions and saw a small house among several much larger ones , he inquired why this house was smaller than those near it , and if he found it was on account of the poverty of the owner , he immediately had it made as large as the others at his own expense .
He was always waited upon by a thousand pages and a thousand girls .
He kept up such rigorous discipline throughout his kingdom that there was never any crime ; at night , houses and shops remained open , and nothing was taken from them , and travelling was as safe by night as by day . "
<NAME> <NAME> came first to the town of <NAME> , now called Hoang-fou , on the banks of the <NAME> , where the principal industry is the preparation of the salt found in the salt marshes .
One day 's journey from this town he came to Pau-in-chen , famous for its cloth of gold , and the town of <NAME> , now Kao-yu , whose inhabitants are clever fishermen and hunters , then to the city of <NAME> , where numerous vessels are generally to be found , and at last to the city of <NAME> .
This town of <NAME> , of which <NAME> was the governor for three years , is the modern Yang-tchou ; it is a very populous and busy town , and can not be less than two leagues in circumference .
It was from <NAME> that the traveller set out on the various expeditions which enabled him to see so much of the inland and sea-coast towns .
First , the traveller went westward to Nan-ghin , which must not be confounded with Nan-kin of the present day .
Its modern name is Ngan-khing , and it stands in the midst of a remarkably fertile province .
Further on in the same direction he came to <NAME> , which is now called Siang-yang , and is built in the northern part of the province of Hou-pe .
This was the last town in the province of Mangi that resisted the dominion of <NAME> ; he besieged it for three years , and he owed his taking it at last to the help of the three Polos , who constructed some powerful balistas and crushed the besieged under a perfect hail-storm of stones , some of which weighed as much as three hundred pounds .
From <NAME> retraced his steps that he might visit some of the towns on the sea-coast .
He visited Kui-kiang on the river <NAME> , which is very broad here , and upon which 5000 ships can sail at the same moment ; Kain-gui , which supplies the <NAME> 's palace with corn ; Ching-kiang where are two <NAME> <NAME> churches ; <NAME> , now Tchang-tcheou , a busy thriving city ; and <NAME> , now called Soo-choo , a large town , which , according to the very exaggerated account of the <NAME> traveller , has no less than 6000 bridges .
After spending some time at <NAME> , probably Hou-tcheou , and at <NAME> , now Kia-hing , <NAME> reached the fine city of <NAME> , after three days ' march .
This name means the " City of <NAME> , " but it is now called Hang-chow-foo .
It is six leagues round ; the river Tsien-tang-kiang flows through it , and by its constant windings , makes <NAME> almost a second Venice .
This ancient capital of the <NAME> is almost as populous as <NAME> ; its streets are paved with stones and bricks , and if we may credit <NAME> 's statement , it contained " 600,000 houses , 4000 bathing establishments , and 12,000 stone bridges . "
In this city dwell the richest merchants in the world with their wives , who are " beautiful and angelic creatures . "
It is the residence of a viceroy , who has besides , 140 other cities under his dominion .
Here was to be seen also the palace of the Mangi sovereigns surrounded by beautiful gardens , lakes , and fountains , the palace itself containing more than a thousand rooms .
Kublaï-Khan draws immense revenues from this town and province , and it is by tens of thousands of pounds we must reckon the income derived from the sugar , salt , spices , and silk , which form the principal productions of this country .
At one day 's journey south from <NAME> , <NAME> visited Chao-hing , <NAME> , or Hou-tcheou , <NAME> or Kui-tcheou , <NAME> or Yo-tcheou-fou ( according to M. Charton ) , and Sonï-tchang-fou ( according to M. Pauthier ) , and <NAME> or Kiou-tcheou , the last town in the kingdom of <NAME> ; thence he entered the kingdom of <NAME> , whose chief town of the same name is now called Fou-tcheou-foo , the capital of the province of Fo-kien .
According to <NAME> , the inhabitants of this province are a cruel warlike race , never sparing their enemies , of whom , after they have killed them , they drink the blood and eat the flesh .
After passing by <NAME> , now Kien-ning-foo , and <NAME> , the traveller entered <NAME> , probably the modern town of Kuant-tcheou ( called <NAME> amongst us ) , and the chief town of the province , where a large trade in pearls and precious stones was carried on , and in five days he reached the port of <NAME> , probably the <NAME> town of Tsiuen-tcheou , which was the extreme point reached by him in this exploration of south-eastern <NAME> .

<NAME> <NAME> returned to the court of Kublaï-Khan when he had finished the expedition of which we spoke in the last chapter .
He was then entrusted with several other missions , in which he found his knowledge of the <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> languages of the greatest use .
He seems to have taken part in an expedition to the islands in the <NAME> , and he brought back a detailed account of this hitherto little known sea .
There is a want of clearness as to dates at this part of his life , which makes it difficult to give a correct narrative of these voyages in their right order .
He gives a circumstantial account of the <NAME> of <NAME> , a name applying to the group of islands which make up <NAME> ; but it does not appear that he actually entered that kingdom .
This country was famous for its wealth , and about 1264 , some years before <NAME> arrived at the <NAME> court , Kublaï-Khan had tried to conquer it and sent his fleet there with that purpose .
They had taken possession of a citadel and put all its valiant defenders to the edge of the sword , but just at the moment of apparent victory a storm arose and dispersed all the enemy 's fleet , and thus the expedition was useless .
<NAME> <NAME> gives a long account of this attempt , and adds many curious particulars as to <NAME> customs .
<NAME> <NAME> , with his father and uncle , had now been seventeen years in the service of Kublaï-Khan , and even longer absent from their own country ; they had a great wish to revisit it , but the <NAME> had become so much attached to them , and valued their services so highly , that he could not make up his mind to part with them .
He tried in every way to shake their resolution , offering them riches and honour if only they would remain with him , but they still held to their plan of returning to <NAME> ; the Emperor then absolutely refused to allow them to go , and <NAME> could find no means of eluding the surveillance of which he was the object , until circumstances arose which quite changed Kublaï-Khan 's resolution .
A Mongol prince , named <NAME> , whose dominions were in <NAME> , had sent an ambassador to the Emperor to ask one of the princesses of the blood royal , in marriage .
Kublaï-Khan acceded to his request and sent off his daughter <NAME> to <NAME> , attended by a numerous suite ; but the countries by which they endeavoured to travel were not safe ; the caravan was soon stopped by disturbances and rebellions , and after some months was obliged to return to the <NAME> 's palace .
The <NAME> ambassadors had heard <NAME> spoken of as a clever navigator who had had some experience of the <NAME> , and they begged the Emperor to confide the <NAME> to his care , that he might conduct her to her future husband , thinking that the voyage by sea would probably be attended by less danger than a land journey .
After some demur Kublaï-Khan acceded to their request , and equipped a fleet of forty four-masted vessels , provisioning them for two years .
Some of these were very large , having a crew of 250 men , for this was an important expedition worthy of the opulent Emperor of <NAME> .
<NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> set out with the <NAME> princess and the <NAME> ambassadors , and it was during this voyage , which lasted eighteen months , that it seems most probable that <NAME> visited the islands of <NAME> and other islands in the <NAME> , as well as <NAME> and the towns on the coast of <NAME> .
We will follow him in his voyage and give his description of the places that he visited in this hitherto little known portion of the globe .
[ Illustration : Kublaï-Khan equips a fleet . ]
It must have been about 1291 or 1292 that the fleet left the port of <NAME> , under the command of <NAME> .
He steered first for <NAME> , a great country situated at the south of <NAME> , and which contains the present province of <NAME> , belonging to <NAME> .
This was not a new country to <NAME> , as he had visited it about 1280 , when he was on a mission for the Emperor .
At this time , <NAME> was under the dominion of the grand khan , and paid him an annual tribute in elephants ; when <NAME> visited this country before its conquest by Kublaï-Khan , he found the reigning king had no less than 326 children , of whom 150 were old enough to carry arms .
Leaving the peninsula of <NAME> , the fleet went in the direction of <NAME> , the rich island that Kublaï-Khan had never been able to subjugate , where abundance of pepper , cloves , nutmegs , & c. , grew .
After putting into port at <NAME> and <NAME> , at the extremity of the peninsular of <NAME> , they reached the island of <NAME> ( <NAME> ) , situated near the eastern entrance of the straits of <NAME> , and the island of <NAME> , called <NAME> .
" This island is so much in the south , " he says , " that they never see there the polar star , " which is true as far as the inhabitants of the southern part are concerned .
It is very fertile , aloes growing most luxuriantly ; and here wild elephants and rhinoceroses ( called by <NAME> unicorns ) are found , and apes , too , in large numbers .
The fleet was detained five months on these shores by contrary winds , and the traveller made the most of his time in visiting the principal provinces of the island , such as <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> ( which boasts a great number of men with tails -- evidently apes ) , and the island of <NAME> or <NAME> , where the sago-tree grows , from which a kind of flour is obtained that makes very good bread .
At last the wind changed , and enabled the vessels to leave <NAME> , and after touching at <NAME> , which must be one of the <NAME> , and at the <NAME> group , whose inhabitants are still cannibals , as they were in the time of <NAME> , the fleet took a south-westerly course and arrived on the coast of <NAME> .
" This island , " says the traveller in his narrative , " was once much larger , for according to the map of the world that the pilots of these seas carry , it was once 3600 miles in circumference but the north wind blows with such force in these parts that it caused a part of the island to be submerged . "
This tradition is still held by the inhabitants of <NAME> .
Here are collected in abundance , rubies , sapphires , topaz , amethysts , and other precious stones , such as garnets , opals , agates , and sardonyx .
The king of the country was the possessor at this time of a most splendid ruby as long as the palm of the hand , as thick as a man 's arm , and red as fire , which excited the envy of the grand khan , who vainly tried to induce its possessor to part with it , offering a whole city in exchange , but that could not tempt the King to let him have the jewel .
<NAME> miles west of Ceylon the travellers came to <NAME> , a great province on the coast of <NAME> .
This must not be mistaken for <NAME> , which is situated on the west coast of the <NAME> peninsula .
This Maabar forms the southern part of the <NAME> coast , and is celebrated for its pearl fisheries .
Here the magicians are at work , and are said to render the monsters of the deep harmless to the fishermen ; they are astrologers whose race is perpetuated even to modern times .
<NAME> <NAME> gives some interesting details of the customs of the natives , one is that when a king dies , the nobles throw themselves into the fire in his honour ; another strange custom is that of the religious purifications twice every day , and their blind faith in astrologers and diviners ; he also speaks of the frequency of religious suicides , and the sacrifice of widows whom the funeral pile awaits on the death of their husbands .
He also notices the skill in physiognomy evinced by the natives .
The next resting-place of the fleet was <NAME> , of which the capital is now called <NAME> , the chief city of the kingdom of <NAME> .
This country was well governed by a queen , a widow for forty years , who desired to remain faithful to the memory of her husband .
The country contained many valuable diamond mines , but these were unfortunately among mountains where serpents abounded ; the miners had recourse to a strange device when collecting the precious stones , to protect themselves from these reptiles , which we may believe or not as we choose .
<NAME> <NAME> says : " They take several pieces of meat , and throw them among the pointed rocks , where no man can go , and the meat , falling upon the diamonds , they become attached to it .
Now , among these mountains live a number of white eagles , who hunt the serpents , and when they see the meat at the foot of the precipices they swoop down and carry it away .
At the moment the men who have been following the eagles ' movements see them alight to eat the meat , they raise fearful cries , the meat is dropped and the eagles take to flight , and thus the men have no difficulty in taking the diamonds that are attached to the meat .
Diamonds are often found on the mountains , mingled with the excrement of the eagles . "
After visiting the small town of <NAME> , situated some miles to the south of <NAME> , where <NAME> the apostle is said to be buried , the travellers explored the kingdom of <NAME> and especially the province of <NAME> , from whence spring all the " _Abrahamites_ " of the world , probably the <NAME> .
These men , he says , live to a great age , owing to their abstinence and sobriety ; some have been known to attain 150 and even 200 years of age ; their diet is principally rice and milk , and they drink a mixture of sulphur and quicksilver .
These " Abrahamites " are clever merchants , superstitious , however , but remarkably sincere , and never guilty of theft of any kind ; they never kill any living thing , and they worship the ox , which is a sacred animal among them .
The fleet now returned to <NAME> , where in 1284 Kublaï-Khan had sent an ambassador who had brought him back some pretended relics of <NAME> , and among other things two of his molar teeth ; for , if we can believe the <NAME> traditions , the tomb of our first father must have been on the summit of one of the precipitous mountains , which forms the highest ground in the island .
After losing sight of <NAME> , <NAME> went to <NAME> , a port that we do not find marked on any of the modern maps , but a place where all the vessels touched coming from <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and the coasts of <NAME> .
Thence doubling <NAME> they came to <NAME> , now <NAME> , which was a very thriving city in the thirteenth century .
It is there that a great quantity of sandal-wood and indigo is found , and merchants come in large numbers from the <NAME> and from the <NAME> to trade in both .
The country of <NAME> produces a great quantity of rice , and wild animals are found there , such as leopards , which <NAME> calls " black lions , " also peacocks of much greater beauty than those of <NAME> , as well as different kinds of parroquets .
The fleet , leaving <NAME> , and advancing northwards along the <NAME> coast , arrived at the shores of the kingdom of <NAME> , which derives its name from a mountain situated on the borders of <NAME> and <NAME> ; here pepper , ginger , saffron , and other spices abound .
To the north of this kingdom extended that country which the <NAME> traveller calls <NAME> , and which is situated to the north of <NAME> proper .
The vessels of the Mangalore merchants came here to trade with the natives of this part of <NAME> for cargoes of spices , a fine kind of cloth called buckram and other valuable wares ; but their vessels were frequently attacked , and too often pillaged by the pirates who infested these seas , and who were justly regarded as formidable enemies .
These pirates principally inhabit the peninsula of <NAME> , now called <NAME> , where the fleet was on its way after calling at <NAME> -- a country where is collected the frankincense -- and <NAME> , now <NAME> , a town where there is a great trade in leather .
Visiting <NAME> , a city of the peninsula , whose inhabitants are cruel , ferocious , and idolaters , and <NAME> , the modern city of <NAME> , the capital of <NAME> , situated on the <NAME> near the sea , and the last town in <NAME> on the northwest , <NAME> went westward across the sea of <NAME> , instead of going to <NAME> , which was the destination of the princess .
His insatiable love of exploration led him 500 miles away to the shores of <NAME> , where he stopped at the <NAME> and <NAME> , so called from the men usually living on one island , and their wives on the other .
Thence they sailed to the south towards the island of <NAME> , at the entrance of the Gulf of <NAME> , which , <NAME> partially explored .
He speaks of the inhabitants of <NAME> as clever magicians , who , by their enchantments , obtain the fulfilment of all their wishes as well as the power of stilling storms and tempests .
Then , taking a southerly course of 1000 miles , he arrived at the shores of <NAME> .
This island appeared to him to be one of the grandest in the world .
Its inhabitants are very much occupied with commerce , especially in elephants ' tusks .
They live principally upon camels ' flesh , which is better and more wholesome food than any other .
The merchants on their way from the coast of <NAME> are usually only twenty days crossing the <NAME> of <NAME> ; but when they return they are often three months on the voyage on account of the opposing currents which take them always southwards .
Nevertheless , they visit <NAME> very constantly , for there are whole forests of sandal-wood , and amber is also found there , from which they can obtain great profit by bartering it for gold and silk stuffs .
<NAME> animals and game are plentiful ; according to <NAME> , leopards , bears , lions , wild boars , giraffes , wild asses , roebucks , deer , stags , and cattle were to be found in great numbers ; but what seemed most marvellous of all to him was the fabulous griffin , the roc , of which we hear so much in the " <NAME> and one Nights , " which is not , he says , " an animal , half-lion and half-bird , able to raise and carry away an elephant in its claws . "
It was probably the " _epyornis maximus_ , " for some eggs of this bird are still to be found in <NAME> .
[ Illustration : This wonderful bird was probably the _epyornis maximus_ . ]
From this island <NAME> went in a north-westerly direction to <NAME> and the coast of <NAME> .
The inhabitants seemed to him remarkably stout , but strong and able to carry the burdens of four ordinary men , " which is not strange , " he says , " for they each eat as much as five other men ; " these natives were black and wore no clothing , they had large mouths and turned-up noses , thick lips , and large eyes , a description that agrees exactly with that of the natives of that part of <NAME> now .
They live upon rice , meat , milk , and dates , and make a kind of wine of rice , sugar , and spices .
They are brave warriors and fearless of death ; they are usually in war mounted on camels and elephants , and armed with a leathern shield , a sword , and a lance ; they give their animals an intoxicating drink to excite them on going into action .
In <NAME> 's time , says M. <NAME> , the countries comprised under the title of <NAME> were divided into three parts ; <NAME> or <NAME> , that is , the country lying between the <NAME> and the <NAME> ; <NAME> , that is , all the country lying beyond the <NAME> , between the western coast of the peninsula and the coast of <NAME> ; lastly , <NAME> , that is , <NAME> and the <NAME> coast to the <NAME> .
After leaving Zanzibar it was <NAME> India whose coast <NAME> explored , sailing towards the north , and first Abassy or <NAME> , a fertile country where the manufacture of fine cotton cloths and buckram is largely carried on .
Then the fleet went to <NAME> , almost at the entrance of the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb , and at last by the coast of Yemen and Hadramaut they came to <NAME> , the port frequented by all the ships trading with <NAME> and <NAME> ; then to <NAME> , whence a great quantity of fine horses are exported ; <NAME> , which produces incense of the finest quality , and <NAME> , now <NAME> , on the coast of <NAME> ; then to <NAME> , that <NAME> had visited once before when he was on his way from <NAME> to the court of Kublaï-Khan .
This was the furthest point that the fleet had to reach , as the princess was now on the borders of <NAME> , after a voyage of eighteen months .
But on their arrival they were met by the sad news of the death of <NAME> , the fiancé of the princess , and they found the country involved in civil war .
The poor princess was put under the care of <NAME> , the son of <NAME> , who did not ascend the throne until 1295 , when his uncle , the usurper , was strangled .
What became of the princess we do not hear , but on parting with <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , she bestowed on them great marks of favour .
It was probably during <NAME> 's residence in <NAME> that he collected some curious documents upon <NAME> in <NAME> ; they are disconnected pieces , which he gives at the close of his narrative , and they form a genuine history of the <NAME> of <NAME> .
His travels for exploration were at an end , and after taking leave of the <NAME> princess , the three Venetians well escorted , and with all expenses paid , set out on their way home .
They went to <NAME> , then to <NAME> , and thence to <NAME> , where they embarked for Venice .
It was in the year 1295 , twenty-four years after leaving it , that <NAME> and his companions returned to their native town .
They were bronzed by exposure to the air and sun , coarsely clad in <NAME> costume , and both in manners and language were so much more Mongolian than <NAME> , that even their nearest relatives failed to recognize them .
Beyond this , a report had been widely spread that they were dead , and it had gained so much credence that their friends never expected to see them again .
They went to their own house in the part of <NAME> called <NAME> , and found it occupied by different members of the Polo family , who received the travellers with every mark of distrust , which their pitiable appearance did not tend to lessen , and placed no faith in the somewhat marvellous stories related to them by <NAME> .
After some persuasion , however , they gained admittance into their own house .
When they had been a few days in <NAME> , the three travellers gave a magnificent banquet , followed by a splendid fête , to do away with any remaining doubts as to their identity .
They invited the nobility of <NAME> and all the members of their own family , and when all the guests were assembled the three hosts appeared dressed in crimson satin robes ; the guests then entered the dining-room , and the feast began .
After the first course was over the three travellers retired for a few moments and then reappeared , clad in robes of splendid silk damask , which they proceeded to tear , and to present each of their guests with a piece .
After the second course they dressed themselves in even more splendid robes of crimson velvet , which they wore until the feast was over , when they appeared in simple <NAME> costume .
The astonished guests marvelled at the magnificence of these garments , and wondered what their hosts would next show them ; then the coarse rough clothes that they had worn on the voyage were brought in , and when the linings and seams were undone , rubies , sapphires , emeralds , diamonds , and carbuncles of great value were poured forth from them ; great riches had been hidden in these rags .
This unexpected sight cleared away all doubt ; the three travellers were recognized at once as <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , and congratulations upon their return were showered upon them .
So celebrated a man as <NAME> could not escape civic honours .
He was made first magistrate in <NAME> , and as he was continually speaking of the " millions " of the <NAME> , who commanded " millions " of subjects , he gained the soubriquet of <NAME> .
It was about 1296 that a war broke out between <NAME> and <NAME> .
A <NAME> fleet under the command of <NAME> crossed the <NAME> , and threatened the sea coast .
The <NAME> <NAME> immediately manned a larger fleet and entrusted the command of a galley to <NAME> who was justly considered an able commander .
The Venetians were beaten in a naval battle on the 8th of September , 1296 , and <NAME> , badly wounded , fell into the hands of the <NAME> , who , knowing and appreciating the value of their prisoner , treated him with great kindness .
He was taken to <NAME> , and there met with a hearty welcome from the most distinguished people , who were anxious to hear the account of his travels .
It was during his captivity , in 1298 , that he made acquaintance with <NAME> , and , tired of repeating his story again and again , dictated his narrative to him .
About 1299 <NAME> was set at liberty ; he returned to <NAME> , and there married .
From this time we hear no more of the incidents of his life , and only know from his will that he left three daughters ; he is thought to have died about the 9th of January , 1323 , at the age of seventy .
<NAME> is the life of this celebrated traveller , whose narrative had a marked influence on the progress of geographical science .
He was gifted with great power of observation , and could see and describe equally well ; and all later explorers have confirmed the truth of his statements .
Until the middle of the eighteenth century , the documents founded on this narrative formed the basis of geographical books , and were used as a guide in commercial expeditions to <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
<NAME> will concur in the suitability of the title that the first copyists gave to <NAME> 's work , that of " The <NAME> of the <NAME> of the World . "
<NAME> Batuta -- The Nile -- Gaza , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> -- Yemen -- <NAME> -- The country of the <NAME> -- Zanguebar -- Ormuz -- <NAME> -- Anatolia -- <NAME> Minor -- Astrakhan -- Constantinople -- <NAME> -- Herat -- The <NAME> -- Delhi -- <NAME> -- The <NAME> -- Ceylon -- The <NAME> coast -- <NAME> -- The <NAME> -- Sumatra -- <NAME> -- <NAME> -- The <NAME> -- Timbuctoo .
<NAME> <NAME> had returned to his native land now nearly twenty-five years , when a <NAME> monk traversed the whole of <NAME> , from the <NAME> to the extreme limits of <NAME> , passing by <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and the island of <NAME> ; but he was so credulous of all that was told him , and his narrative is so confused , that but little reliance can be placed upon it .
It is the same with the fabulous travels of <NAME> .
<NAME> says of them , " They are so utterly untrue , that they have not their parallel in any language . "
But we find a worthy successor to the <NAME> traveller in an <NAME> theologian , named <NAME> , better known by the name of <NAME> .
He did for <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , what <NAME> had done for <NAME> , and he is worthy to be placed in the foremost rank as a brave traveller and bold explorer .
In the year 1324 , the 725th year of the <NAME> , he resolved to make a pilgrimage to <NAME> , and starting from <NAME> , his native town , he went first to <NAME> , and thence to <NAME> .
During his stay in <NAME> he turned his attention to the Nile , and especially to the <NAME> ; then he tried to sail up the river , but being stopped by disturbances on the <NAME> frontier , he was obliged to return to the mouth of the river , and then set sail for <NAME> Minor .
[ Illustration : <NAME> in <NAME> . ]
After visiting <NAME> , the tombs of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , <NAME> , then strongly fortified and unassailable on three sides , and <NAME> , which was in ruins , and whose celebrated baths were completely destroyed , <NAME> was attracted by the wonders of <NAME> , the centre for all the hermits of that day , who had judiciously chosen one of the most lovely spots in the whole world wherein to end their days .
Then passing <NAME> , and going on to <NAME> , he found the city ( in the year 1345 ) decimated by the plague .
This fearful scourge devoured " 24,000 persons daily , " if we may believe his report , and <NAME> would have been depopulated , had not the prayers of all the people offered up in the mosque containing the stone with the print of <NAME> ' foot upon it , been heard and answered .
On leaving <NAME> , <NAME> went to <NAME> , where he visited the tomb of <NAME> , which attracts a large number of paralytic pilgrims who need only to spend one night in prayer beside it , to be completely cured .
<NAME> does not seem to doubt the authenticity of this miracle , well known in the <NAME> under the title of " the Night of <NAME> . "
From <NAME> , the traveller went to <NAME> , and entered the kingdom of <NAME> , and then the province of <NAME> , where he wished to converse with the celebrated worker of miracles , <NAME> .
From Shiraz he went to <NAME> , to <NAME> , then to <NAME> , where he prayed beside the tomb of the <NAME> , and finally to <NAME> , where he remained three years .
It is well known that from <NAME> , caravans are continually starting for the surrounding country , and it was in company with some of these bold merchants that <NAME> was able to visit the towns of Yemen .
He went as far as <NAME> , at the mouth of the <NAME> , and embarked for <NAME> , one of the <NAME> ports .
He was now once more on <NAME> ground , and advanced into the country of the <NAME> , that he might study the manners and customs of those dirty and repulsive tribes ; he found their diet consisted wholly of fish and camels ' flesh .
But in the town of <NAME> , there was an attempt at comfort and civilization , presenting a most agreeable contrast with the surrounding squalor .
The inhabitants were very fat , each of them , to use <NAME> 's own expression , " eating enough to feed a convent ; " they were very fond of delicacies , such as plantains boiled in milk , preserved citrons , pods of fresh pepper , and green ginger .
After seeing all he wished of the country of the <NAME> , chiefly on the coast , he resolved to go to <NAME> , and then , crossing the <NAME> and following the coast of <NAME> , he came to <NAME> , a town situated upon the <NAME> <NAME> .
The vegetation of this country is most luxuriant , the betel , cocoa-nut , and incense-trees forming there great forests ; still the traveller pushed on , and came to <NAME> on the <NAME> , and passed through several provinces of <NAME> .
We find him a second time at <NAME> in the year 1332 , three years after he had left it .
But this was only to be a short rest for the traveller , for now , leaving <NAME> for <NAME> , he went to <NAME> , a region but little known , and thence to <NAME> .
He next visited <NAME> , making a short stay at <NAME> and <NAME> , and thence he visited the Turkomans of <NAME> , where the " confraternity of young men " gave him a most hearty welcome .
After <NAME> , the <NAME> narrative speaks of <NAME> Minor .
<NAME> <NAME> advanced as far as <NAME> , where he was shown an aerolite weighing 620 pounds .
Then , crossing the <NAME> , he visited the <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , a town of sufficiently high latitude for the unequal length of day and night to be very marked ; and at last he reached <NAME> , at the mouth of the <NAME> , where the <NAME> of <NAME> lived during the winter months .
The <NAME> , the wife of the khan , and daughter of the <NAME> of <NAME> , was wishing to visit her father , and it was an opportunity not to be lost by <NAME> for exploring <NAME> in <NAME> ; he gained permission to accompany the princess , who set out attended by 5000 men , and followed by a portable mosque , which was set up at every place where they stayed .
The princess 's reception at <NAME> was very magnificent , the bells being rung with such spirit that he says , " even the horizon seemed full of the vibration . "
The welcome given to the theologian by the princes of the country was worthy of his fame ; he remained in the city thirty-six days , so that he was able to study it in all its details .
This was a time when communication between the different countries was both dangerous and difficult , and <NAME> was considered a very bold traveller .
<NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> in <NAME> , the <NAME> provinces had all in turn been explored by him .
After such hard work he might well have taken rest and been satisfied with the laurels that he had gained , for he was without doubt the most celebrated traveller of the fourteenth century ; but his insatiable passion for travelling remained , and the circle of his explorations was still to widen considerably .
On leaving <NAME> , <NAME> went again to <NAME> , thence crossing the sandy wastes of the present <NAME> , he arrived at <NAME> , a large populous town , then at <NAME> , half destroyed by the armies of Gengis-Khan .
Some time after we hear of him at <NAME> , a religious town which greatly pleased the learned traveller , and then at <NAME> which he could not reach without crossing the desert of <NAME> .
This town was all in ruins and desolate , for the armies of the barbarians had been there , and <NAME> could not remain in it , but wished to go westward to the frontier of <NAME> .
The mountainous country , near the <NAME> range , confronted him , but this was no barrier to him , and after great fatigue , which he bore with equal patience and good-humour , he reached the important town of <NAME> .
This was the most westerly point reached by the traveller ; he now resolved to change his course for an easterly one , and in going to the extreme limits of <NAME> , to reach the shores of the Pacific : if he could succeed in this he would pass the bounds of the explorations of the celebrated <NAME> .
He set out , and following the course of the river <NAME> and the frontiers of <NAME> , he came to the <NAME> , the modern <NAME> , and descended it to its mouth .
From the town of <NAME> , he went to <NAME> , which great and beautiful city had been deserted by its inhabitants , who had fled from the <NAME> .
This tyrant , who was occasionally both generous and magnificent , received the <NAME> traveller very well , made him a judge in <NAME> , and gave him a grant of land with some pecuniary advantages that were attached to the post , but these honours were not to be of any long duration , for <NAME> being implicated in a pretended conspiracy , thought it best to give up his place , and make himself a fakir to escape the <NAME> 's displeasure .
<NAME> , however , pardoned him , and made him his ambassador to <NAME> .
Fortune again smiled upon the courageous traveller , and he had now the prospect of seeing these distant lands under exceptionally good and safe circumstances .
He was charged with presents for the <NAME> of <NAME> , and 2000 horse-soldiers were given him as an escort .
But <NAME> had not thought of the insurgents who occupied the surrounding countries ; a skirmish took place between the escort and the <NAME> , and the traveller , being separated from his companions , was taken prisoner , robbed , garotted , and carried off he knew not whither ; but his courage and hopefulness did not forsake him , and he contrived to escape from the hands of these robbers .
After wandering about for seven days , he was received into his house by a negro , who at length led him back to the emperor 's palace at <NAME> .
<NAME> fitted out another expedition , and again appointed the <NAME> traveller as his ambassador .
This time they passed through the enemy 's country without molestation , and by way of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , they reached <NAME> .
Some time after , they arrived at the great port of <NAME> , an important place which became afterwards the chief town of <NAME> ; here they were detained by contrary winds for three months , and made use of this time to study the <NAME> mercantile marine which frequented this port .
<NAME> speaks with great admiration of these junks which are like floating gardens , where ginger and herbs are grown on deck ; they are each like a separate village , and some merchants were the possessors of a great number of these junks .
At last the wind changed ; <NAME> chose a small junk well fitted up , to take him to <NAME> , and had all his property put on board .
Thirteen other junks were to receive the presents sent by the King of <NAME> to the <NAME> of <NAME> , but during the night a violent storm arose , and all the vessels sank .
Fortunately for Ibn he had remained on shore to attend the service at the mosque , and thus his piety saved his life , but he had lost everything except " the carpet which he used at his devotions . "
After this second misfortune he could not make up his mind to appear before the King of <NAME> .
This catastrophe was enough to weary the patience of a more long-suffering emperor than <NAME> .
Ibn soon made up his mind what to do .
Leaving the service of the emperor , and the advantages attaching to the post of ambassador , he embarked for the <NAME> , which were governed by a woman , and where a large trade in cocoa was carried on .
Here he was again made a judge , but this was only of short duration , for the vizier became jealous of his success , and , after marrying three wives , <NAME> was obliged to take refuge in flight .
He hoped to reach the <NAME> coast , but contrary winds drove his vessel towards <NAME> , where he was very well received , and gained the king 's permission to climb the sacred mountain of <NAME> , or <NAME> 's Peak .
His object was to see the wonderful impression of a foot at the summit , which the <NAME> call " <NAME> 's , " and the Mahometans " <NAME> 's , foot . "
He pretends , in his narrative , that this impression measures eleven hands in length , a very different account from that of an historian of the ninth century , who declared it to be seventy-nine cubits long !
This historian also adds that while one of the feet of our forefather rested on the mountain , the other was in the <NAME> ocean .
<NAME> <NAME> speaks also of large bearded apes , forming a considerable item in the population of the island , and said to be under a king of their own , crowned with leaves .
We can give what credit we like to such fables as these , which were propagated by the credulity of the <NAME> .
From <NAME> , the traveller made his way to the <NAME> coast , but not without experiencing some severe storms .
He crossed to the other side of the <NAME> peninsula , and again embarked .
[ Illustration : <NAME> 's vessel was seized by pirates . ]
But his vessel was seized by pirates , and <NAME> arrived at <NAME> almost without clothes , robbed , and worn out with fatigue .
No misfortune could damp his ardour , his was one of those great spirits which seem only invigorated by trouble and disasters .
As soon as he was enabled by the kindness of some Delhi merchants to resume his travels , he embarked for the <NAME> , went on to <NAME> , there set sail for <NAME> , and disembarked at one of the <NAME> after a very bad passage which had lasted fifty days .
<NAME> days afterwards he arrived at <NAME> , where the king gave him a hearty welcome and furnished him with means to continue his journey to <NAME> .
A junk took him in seventy-one days to the port <NAME> , capital of a country somewhat problematical , of which the brave and handsome inhabitants excelled in making arms .
From <NAME> , <NAME> passed into the <NAME> provinces , and went first to the splendid town of <NAME> , probably the present Tsieun-tcheou of the <NAME> , a little to the north of <NAME> .
He passed through various cities of this great empire , studying the customs of the people and admiring everywhere the riches , industry , and civilization that he found , but he did not get as far as the <NAME> , which he calls " The obstacle of <NAME> and <NAME> . "
It was while he was exploring this immense tract of country that he made a short stay in the city of <NAME> , which is composed of six fortified towns standing together .
It happened that during his wanderings he was able to be present at the funeral of a khan , who was buried with four slaves , six of his favourites , and four horses .
In the meanwhile , disturbances had occurred at <NAME> , which obliged <NAME> to leave this town , so he set sail for <NAME> , and then after touching at <NAME> and <NAME> , he returned to <NAME> in 1348 , having made the tour of <NAME> and <NAME> .
But the time of rest had not yet come for this indefatigable explorer ; the following year he revisited his native place <NAME> , and then after travelling in the southern countries of <NAME> he returned to <NAME> , went to <NAME> and the countries watered by the <NAME> , crossed the <NAME> and entered <NAME> , thus making a journey which would have rendered illustrious a less ambitious traveller .
This was to be his last expedition .
In 1353 , twenty-nine years after leaving <NAME> for the first time , he returned to <NAME> , and settled at <NAME> .
He has earned the reputation of being the most intrepid explorer of the fourteenth century , and well merits to be ranked next after <NAME> , the illustrious <NAME> .
The <NAME> cavalier -- His ideas of conquest -- What was known of the Canary Islands -- Cadiz -- The Canary Archipelago -- Graciosa -- Lancerota -- Fortaventura -- <NAME> de <NAME> returns to <NAME> -- Revolt of <NAME> -- His interview with <NAME> III. -- <NAME> visits the Canary Archipelago -- Canary <NAME> or " Gran Canaria " -- <NAME> -- <NAME> .
<NAME> de <NAME> was born about the year 1339 , at <NAME> in <NAME> .
He was of good family , and <NAME> of <NAME> Martin-le-Gaillard , and had distinguished himself both as a navigator and warrior ; he was made chamberlain to <NAME> .
But his tastes were more for travelling than a life at court ; he resolved to make himself a still more illustrious name by further conquests , and soon an opportunity offered for him to carry out his plans .
On the coast of <NAME> there is a group of islands called the <NAME> , which were once known as the <NAME> .
<NAME> , a son of one of the <NAME> kings , is said to have been their first explorer , about the year of Rome 776 .
In the middle ages , according to some accounts , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , had partially visited this interesting group of islands .
In 1393 , a <NAME> gentleman named <NAME> , who was commanding an expedition , succeeded in landing on <NAME> , one of these islands , and brought back , with several prisoners , some produce which was a sufficient guarantee of the fertility of this archipelago .
The <NAME> cavalier now found the opening that he sought , and he determined to conquer the Canary Islands and try to convert the inhabitants to the <NAME> faith .
He was as intelligent , brave , and full of resources as he was energetic ; and leaving his house of Grainville-la-Teinturière at <NAME> , he went to <NAME> , where he met the <NAME> de la <NAME> , and having explained his project to him , they decided to go to the Canary Islands together .
<NAME> de Béthencourt having collected an army and made his preparations , and had vessels fitted out and manned , <NAME> and he set sail ; after experiencing adverse winds on the way to the Ile de Ré , and being much harassed by the constant dissensions on board , they arrived at <NAME> , and then at <NAME> .
Here they remained eight days , then set sail again , and doubling <NAME> , followed the <NAME> coast to <NAME> , and arrived at <NAME> , where they made a longer stay .
Here <NAME> had a dispute with some Genoese merchants , who accused him of having taken their vessel , and he had to go to <NAME> , where King <NAME> .
heard his complaint and acquitted him from all blame .
On his return to Cadiz he found part of his crew in open mutiny , and some of his sailors so frightened that they refused to continue the voyage , so the chevalier sent back the cowardly sailors , and set sail with those who were more courageous .
The vessel in which <NAME> de <NAME> sailed was becalmed for three days , then , the weather improving , he reached the island of <NAME> , one of the smaller of the Canary group , in five days , and then the larger island of <NAME> , which is nearly the same size as the island of <NAME> .
<NAME> has excellent pasturage , and arable land , which is particularly good for the cultivation of barley ; its numerous fountains and cisterns are well supplied with excellent water .
The orchilla , which is so much used in dyeing , grows abundantly here .
The inhabitants of this island , who as a rule wear scarce any clothing , are tall and well-made , and the women , who wear leathern great-coats reaching to the ground , are very good-looking and honest .
The traveller , prior to disclosing his plans of conquest , wished to possess himself of some of the natives , but his ignorance of the country made this a difficult matter , so , anchoring under the shelter of a small island in the archipelago , he called a meeting of his companions to decide upon a plan of action .
They all agreed that the only thing to be done was to take some of the natives by fair means or foul .
<NAME> , the king of the island , treated Béthencourt more as a friend than a subject .
A castle or rather fort was built at the south-western extremity of the island , and some men left there under the command of <NAME> de <NAME> , while <NAME> set out with the rest of his followers for the island of <NAME> or Fortaventura .
<NAME> counselled a debarcation by night , which was done , and then he took the command of a small body of men and scoured the island with them for eight days without meeting one native , they having all fled to the mountains .
Provisions failing , <NAME> was forced to return , and he went to the island of <NAME> between <NAME> and <NAME> ; but there his chief sailor mutinied and it was not without difficulty that <NAME> and <NAME> reached the fort on <NAME> .
<NAME> resolved to return to <NAME> to get provisions and a new contingent of soldiers , for his crew he could not depend upon ; so he left <NAME> in command and set sail for <NAME> in one of <NAME> 's ships .
It will be remembered that <NAME> de <NAME> had been left in command of the fort on <NAME> .
Unfortunately he was <NAME> 's bitter enemy , and no sooner had <NAME> set out than he tried to poison the minds of <NAME> 's men against him ; he succeeded in inducing some , especially the <NAME> , to revolt against the governor , who , quite innocent of <NAME> 's base designs , was spending his time hunting sea-wolves on the island of <NAME> with <NAME> de <NAME> and several others .
Remonnet having been sent to <NAME> for provisions , found no Berneval there , he having deserted the island with his accomplices for a port on <NAME> , where a coxswain , deceived by his promises , had placed his vessel at his disposal .
From <NAME> , the traitor <NAME> returned to <NAME> , and put the finishing stroke to his villany by pretending to make an alliance with the king of the island .
The king , thinking that no officer of <NAME> 's , in whom he had implicit confidence , could deceive him , came with twenty-four of his subjects to see <NAME> , who seized them when asleep , had them bound , and then carried them off to <NAME> .
The king managed to break his bonds , set three of his men free , and succeeded in escaping , but the remainder of his unfortunate companions were still prisoners , and <NAME> gave them up to some <NAME> thieves , who took them away to sell in a foreign land .
<NAME> 's evil deeds did not stop here .
By his order the vessel that <NAME> had sent to the fort at <NAME> was seized ; <NAME> tried resistance , but his numbers were too small , and his supplications were useless to prevent <NAME> 's men , and even <NAME> himself , from destroying all the arms , furniture , and goods , which <NAME> had placed in the fort at <NAME> .
Insults were showered upon the governor , and <NAME> cried , " I should like <NAME> de la <NAME> to know that if he were as young as I , I would kill him , but as he is not , I will spare him .
If he is put above me I shall have him drowned , and then he can fish for sea-wolves . "
Meanwhile , <NAME> and his ten companions were in danger of perishing on the island of <NAME> for want of food and fresh water , but happily the two chaplains of the fort of <NAME> had gone to <NAME> , and met the coxswain , who had been the victim of <NAME> 's treason , and he sent one of his men named <NAME> with them back to <NAME> .
There they found a small boat which they filled with provisions , and embarking with four men who were faithful to Gadifer , they succeeded in reaching <NAME> , four leagues off , after a most dangerous passage .
<NAME> and his companions were suffering fearfully from hunger and thirst , when <NAME> arrived just in time to save them from perishing , and the governor learning <NAME> 's treachery embarked in the boat for <NAME> , as soon as he was a little restored to health .
He was grieved at <NAME> 's conduct towards the poor islanders whom Béthencourt and he had sworn to protect .
he never could have expected such wickedness in one who was looked upon as the most able of the whole band .
But what was <NAME> doing meanwhile ?
After having betrayed his master , he did the same to the companions who had aided him in his evil deeds ; he had twelve of them killed and then he set out for <NAME> to rejoin <NAME> and make his own case good by representing all that had happened in his own way .
It was to his interest to get rid of inconvenient witnesses , and therefore he abandoned his companions .
These unfortunate men at first meditated imploring the pardon of the governor ; they confessed all to the chaplains , but then , fearing the consequences of their deeds , they seized a boat and fled towards Morocco .
The boat reached the coast of <NAME> , where ten of the crew were drowned and the two others taken for slaves .
While all this was happening at <NAME> , <NAME> arrived at <NAME> , where he took strong measures against his mutinous crew , and had the ringleaders imprisoned .
Then he sent his vessel to <NAME> , where King <NAME> .
was at that time ; but the ship sank in the Guadalquiver , a great loss to <NAME> , her owner .
<NAME> having arrived at <NAME> , met a certain <NAME> Calve who had lately come from the Canaries , and who offered to return thither with all the things needed by the governor , but <NAME> could not agree to this proposal before he had seen the king .
Just at this time , <NAME> arrived with some of his accomplices , and some islanders whom he intended to sell as slaves .
He hoped to be able to deceive <NAME> , but he had not reckoned upon a certain Courtille who was with him , who lost no time in denouncing the villany of <NAME> , and on whose word the traitors were all imprisoned at <NAME> .
<NAME> also told of the treatment that the poor islanders had received ; as <NAME> could not leave <NAME> till he had had an audience with the king , he gave orders that they should receive every kindness , but while these preliminaries were being concluded , the vessel that contained them was taken to <NAME> , and they were sold for slaves .
<NAME> obtained the audience that he sought with the king of <NAME> , and after telling him the result of his expedition he said , " <NAME> , I come to ask your assistance and your leave to conquer the Canary Islands for the <NAME> faith , and as you are king and lord of all the surrounding country , and the nearest <NAME> king to these islands , I beg you to receive the homage of your humble servant . "
The king was very gracious to him and gave him dominion over these islands , and beyond this , a fifth of all the merchandise that should be brought from them to <NAME> .
He gave him 20,000 maravédis , about 600_l._ , to buy all that he needed , and also the right to coin money in the Canary Islands .
Most unfortunately these 20,000 maravédis were confided to the care of a dishonest man , who fled to <NAME> , carrying the money with him .
gave Béthencourt a well-rigged vessel manned by eighty men , and stocked with provisions , arms , & c. He was most grateful for this fresh bounty , and sent <NAME> an account of all that had happened , and his extreme disappointment and disgust at <NAME> 's conduct , in whom he had so much confidence , announcing at the same time the speedy departure of the vessel given by the King of <NAME> .
But meanwhile very serious troubles had arisen on <NAME> .
King <NAME> was so hurt at <NAME> 's conduct that he had revolted , and some of <NAME> 's companions had been killed by the islanders .
<NAME> insisted upon these subjects being punished , when one of the king 's relations named <NAME> , came to him proposing to dethrone the king , and put himself in his place .
This <NAME> was a villain , who after having betrayed his king , proposed to betray the <NAME> , and to chase them from the country .
<NAME> had no suspicion of his motives ; wishing to avenge the death of his men , he accepted <NAME> 's proposal , and a short time afterwards , on the vigil of <NAME> 's day , the king was seized , and conveyed to the fort in chains .
Some days afterwards , <NAME> , the new king of the island attacked <NAME> 's companions , mortally wounding several of them , but the following night Guardafia having made his escape from the fort seized <NAME> , had him stoned to death , and his body burnt .
The governor ( <NAME> ) was so grieved by these scenes of violence , which were renewed daily , that he resolved to kill all the men on the island , and save only the women and children , whom he hoped to have baptized .
But just at this time , the vessel that <NAME> had freighted for the governor arrived , and brought besides the eighty men , provisions , & c. , a letter which told him among other things that <NAME> had done homage to the King of <NAME> for the Canary Islands .
The governor was not well pleased at this news , for he thought that he ought to have had his share in the islands ; but he concealed his displeasure , and gave the new comers a hearty welcome .
The arms were at once disembarked , and then <NAME> went on board the vessel to explore the neighbouring islands .
<NAME> and several others joined him in this expedition , and they took two of the islanders with them to serve as guides .
They arrived safely at <NAME> island ; a few days after landing on the island , <NAME> set out with thirty-five men to explore the country ; but soon the greater part of his followers deserted him , only thirteen men , including two archers , remaining with him .
But he did not give up his project ; after wading through a large stream , he found himself in a lovely valley shaded by numberless palm-trees ; here having rested and refreshed himself , he set out again and climbed a hill .
At the summit he found about fifty natives , who surrounded the small party and threatened to murder them .
<NAME> and his companions showed no signs of fear , and succeeded in putting their enemies to flight ; by the evening they were able to regain their vessel , carrying away four of the native women as prisoners .
[ Illustration : <NAME> found himself in a lovely valley . ]
The next day <NAME> left the island and went to the <NAME> island anchoring in a large harbour lying between <NAME> and <NAME> .
Five hundred of the natives confronted them , but apparently with no hostile intentions ; they gave them some fish-hooks and old iron in exchange for some of the natural productions of the island , such as figs , and dragon 's blood , a resinous substance taken from the dragon-tree , which has a very pleasant balsamic odour .
The natives were very much on their guard with the strangers , for twenty years before this some of <NAME> ' men had invaded the island ; so they would not allow <NAME> to land .
The governor was obliged to weigh anchor without exploring the island ; he went to <NAME> , and coasting along it arrived next at <NAME> ; it was night , and the sailors were attracted by the fires that the natives had lighted on the shore .
When day broke <NAME> and his companions wished to land ; but the islanders would not allow them to proceed when they reached the shore , and drove them back to their vessel .
Much disappointed by his reception , <NAME> determined to make another attempt at <NAME> ; there he found that he could land without opposition , and he remained on the island twenty-two days .
The interior of the island was very beautiful .
Pine-trees grew in abundance , and clear streams of water added to its fertility .
Quails were found in large numbers , as well as pigs , goats , and sheep .
From this fertile island the party of explorers went to <NAME> , and anchored in a harbour situated to the right of a large river .
This is the furthest island of the Canary group ; it is covered with pine and dragon-trees ; from the abundance of fresh water the pasturage is excellent and the land might be cultivated with much profit .
Its inhabitants are a tall , robust race , well made , with good features and very white skin .
<NAME> remained a short time on this island ; on leaving it he spent two days and two nights sailing round the other islands , and then returned to the fort on <NAME> .
They had been absent three months .
In the meantime , those of the party who had been left in the fort had waged a petty war with the natives , and had made a great number of prisoners .
The Canarians , demoralized , now came daily to cast themselves on their mercy , and to pray for the consecration of baptism .
<NAME> was so pleased to hear of this , that he sent one of his companions to <NAME> to inform Béthencourt of the state of the colony .
The return of <NAME> de Béthencourt -- <NAME> 's jealousy -- Béthencourt visits his archipelago -- <NAME> goes to conquer <NAME> -- Disagreement of the two commanders -- Their return to <NAME> -- <NAME> blamed by the King -- Return of <NAME> -- The natives of Fortaventura are baptized -- Béthencourt revisits <NAME> -- Returns to <NAME> -- Lands on the <NAME> coast -- Conquest of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> -- <NAME> appointed Governor of the archipelago -- Béthencourt obtains the <NAME> 's consent to the <NAME> being made an <NAME> -- His return to his country and his death .
The envoy had not reached <NAME> when <NAME> landed at the fort on <NAME> .
<NAME> gave him a hearty welcome , and so did the Canary islanders who had been baptized .
A few days afterwards , King Guardafia came and threw himself on their mercy .
He was baptized on the 20th of February , 1404 , with all his followers .
<NAME> 's chaplains drew up a very simple form of instruction for their use , embracing the principal elements of <NAME> , the creation , <NAME> and <NAME> 's fall , the history of <NAME> , the lives of the patriarchs , the life of our Saviour and His crucifixion by the Jews , finishing with an exhortation to believe the ten commandments , the <NAME> Sacrament of the <NAME> , <NAME> , confession , and some other points .
<NAME> was an ambitious man .
Not content with having explored , and so to speak , gained possession of the <NAME> , he desired to conquer the <NAME> countries bordering on the ocean .
This was his secret wish in returning to <NAME> , and meanwhile , he had full occupation in establishing his authority in these islands , of which he was only the nominal sovereign .
He gave himself wholly to the task , and first visited the islands which <NAME> had explored .
But before he set out , a conversation took place between <NAME> and himself , which we must not omit to notice .
<NAME> began boasting of all he had done , and asked for the gift of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , as a recompense .
" My friend , " replied <NAME> , " the islands that you ask me to give you are not yet conquered , but I do not intend you to be at any loss for your trouble , nor that you should be unrequited ; but let us accomplish our project , and meanwhile remain the friends we have always been . "
" That is all very well , " replied <NAME> , " but there is one point on which I do not feel at all satisfied , and that is that you have done homage to the King of <NAME> for these islands , and so you call yourself absolute master over them . "
" With regard to that , " said <NAME> , " I certainly have done homage for them , and so I am their rightful master , but if you will only patiently wait the end of our affair , I will give you what I feel sure will quite content you . "
" I shall not remain here , " replied <NAME> , " I am going back to <NAME> , and have no wish to be here any longer . "
Upon this they separated , but <NAME> gradually cooled down and agreed to accompany <NAME> in his exploration of the islands .
They set out for Fortaventura well armed and with plenty of provisions .
They remained there three months , and began by seizing a number of the natives , and sending them to <NAME> .
This was such a usual mode of proceeding at that time that we are less surprised at it than we should be at the present day .
The whole island was explored and a fort named <NAME> built on the slope of a high mountain ; traces of it may still be found in a hamlet there .
Just at this time , and when he had scarcely had time to forget his grievances and ill-humour , <NAME> accepted the command of a small band of men who were to conquer <NAME> .
He set out on the 25th July , 1404 , but this expedition was not fated to meet with any good results , winds and waves were against it .
At last they reached the port of <NAME> , but as it was nearly dark and a strong wind blowing they dared not land , and they went on to the little town of <NAME> , where they remained eleven days at anchor ; the natives , encouraged by their king , laid an ambush for <NAME> and his followers ; there was a skirmish , blood was shed , and the Castilians , feeling themselves outnumbered , went to <NAME> for two days , and thence to <NAME> .
<NAME> was much disappointed at his want of success , and began to be discontented with everything around him .
Above all , his jealousy of <NAME> increased daily , and he gave way to violent recriminations , saying openly that the chief had not done everything himself , and that things would not have been in so advanced a stage as they were if others had not aided him .
This reached <NAME> 's ears ; he was much incensed , and reproached <NAME> .
High words followed , <NAME> insisted upon leaving the country , and as <NAME> had just made arrangements for returning to <NAME> , he proposed to Gadifer to accompany him , that their cause of disagreement might be inquired into .
This proposal being accepted , they set sail , but each in his own ship .
When they reached <NAME> , <NAME> laid his complaints before the king , but as the king gave judgment against him , fully approving of <NAME> 's conduct , he left <NAME> , and returning to <NAME> , never revisited the Canary Islands which he had so fondly hoped to conquer for himself .
<NAME> took leave of the king almost at the same time , for the new colony demanded his immediate presence there ; but before he left , the inhabitants of <NAME> , with whom he was a great favourite , showed him much kindness ; what he valued more highly than anything else was the supply of arms , gold , silver , and provisions that they gave him .
He went to <NAME> , where his companions were delighted to see him .
<NAME> had left his son Hannibal in his place , but <NAME> treated him with much cordiality .
The first days of the installation of <NAME> were far from peaceful ; skirmishes were of constant occurrence , the natives even destroying the fortress of <NAME> , after burning and pillaging a chapel .
<NAME> was determined to overcome them , and in the end succeeded .
He sent for several of his men from <NAME> , and gave orders that the fortress should be rebuilt .
In spite of all this the combats began again , and many of the islanders fell , among others a giant of nine feet high , whom Béthencourt would have liked to have made prisoner .
The governor could not trust <NAME> 's son nor the men who followed him , for <NAME> seemed to have inherited his father 's jealousy , but as <NAME> needed his help , he concealed his distrust .
Happily , <NAME> 's men outnumbered those who were faithful to <NAME> , but <NAME> 's taunts became so unbearable that <NAME> de <NAME> was sent to remind him of his oath of obedience and to advise him to keep it .
<NAME> was very badly received , he having a crow to pick with <NAME> with regard to some native prisoners whom Gadifer 's followers had kept and would not give up .
<NAME> was obliged to obey the orders , but <NAME> represented his conduct to Béthencourt on his return in the very worst light , and tried to excite his master 's anger against him .
" No , sir , " answered the upright Béthencourt , " I do not wish him to be wronged , we must never carry our power to its utmost limits , we should always endeavour to control ourselves and preserve our honour rather than seek for profit . "
In spite of these intestine discords , the war continued between the natives and the conquerors , but the latter being well-armed always came off victorious .
The kings of <NAME> sent a native to <NAME> saying that they wished to make peace with him , and to become Christians .
This news delighted the conqueror , and he sent word that they would be well received if they would come to him .
Almost immediately on receiving this reply , King Maxorata , who governed the north-westerly part of the island , set out , and with his suite of twenty-two persons , was baptized on the 18th of January , 1405 .
Three days afterwards twenty-two other natives received the sacrament of baptism .
On the 25th of January the king who governed the peninsula of <NAME> , the south-eastern part of the island , came with twenty-six of his subjects , and was baptized .
In a short time all the inhabitants of <NAME> had embraced the <NAME> religion .
[ Illustration : The King of <NAME> arrived with his suite . ]
<NAME> was so elated with these happy results , that he arranged to revisit his own country , leaving Courtois as governor during his absence .
He set out on the last day of January amid the prayers and blessings of his people , taking with him three native men and one woman , to whom he wished to show something of <NAME> .
He reached <NAME> in twenty-one days , and two days later was at his own house , where he only intended making a short stay , and then returning to the Canary Islands .
He met with a very warm reception from everybody .
One of his chief motives in returning to <NAME> was the hope of finding people of all classes ready to return with him , on the promise of grants of land in the island .
He succeeded in finding a certain number of emigrants , amongst whom were twenty-eight soldiers , of whom twenty-three took their wives .
Two vessels were prepared to transport the party , and the 6th of May was the day named for them to set out .
On the 9th of May they set sail , and landed on <NAME> just four mouths and a half after <NAME> had quitted it .
He was received with trumpets , clarionets , tambourines , harps , and other musical instruments .
<NAME> could scarcely have been heard above the sound of this music .
The natives celebrated his return by dancing and singing , and crying out , " Here comes our king . "
<NAME> de <NAME> hastened to welcome his master , who asked him how everything was going on ; he replied , " Sir , all is going on as well as possible . "
<NAME> 's companions stayed with him at the fort of <NAME> ; they appeared much pleased with the country , enjoying the dates and other fruits on the island , " and nothing seemed to harm them . "
After they had been a short time at <NAME> , <NAME> went with them to see Fortaventura , and here his reception was as warm as it had been at <NAME> , especially from the islanders and their two kings .
The kings supped with them at the fortress of <NAME> , which <NAME> had rebuilt .
<NAME> announced his intention of conquering <NAME> , as he had done <NAME> and <NAME> ; his hope was that his nephew <NAME> , whom he had brought with him from <NAME> , would succeed him in the government of these islands , so that the name of <NAME> might be perpetuated there .
He imparted his project to <NAME> , who highly approved of it , and added , " Sir , when you return to <NAME> , I will go with you .
I am a bad husband .
It is five years since I saw my wife , and , by my troth , she did not much care about it . "
The 6th of October , 1405 , was the day fixed for starting for <NAME> , but contrary winds carried the ships towards the <NAME> coast , and they passed by <NAME> , where <NAME> landed .
He made an expedition twenty-four miles inland , and seized some natives and a great number of camels that he took to his vessels .
They put as many of the camels as possible on board , wishing to acclimatize them in the Canary Islands , and the baron set sail again , leaving <NAME> , which he had the honour of seeing thirty years before the <NAME> navigators .
During this voyage from the coast of <NAME> to <NAME> , the three vessels were separated in stormy weather , one going to <NAME> , and another to <NAME> , but finally they all reached <NAME> .
This island is sixty miles long and thirty-six miles broad ; at the northern end it is flat , but very hilly towards the south .
Firs , dragon-trees , olive , fig , and date-trees form large forests , and sheep , goats , and wild dogs are found here in large numbers .
The soil is very fertile , and produces two crops of corn every year , and that without any means of improving it .
Its inhabitants form a large body of people , and consider themselves all on an equality .
When <NAME> had landed he set to work at once to conquer the island .
Unfortunately his <NAME> soldiers were so proud of their success on the coast of <NAME> , that they thought they could conquer this island with its ten thousand natives , with a mere handful of men .
<NAME> seeing that they were so confident of success , recommended them to be prudent , but they took no heed of this and bitterly they rued their confidence .
After a skirmish , in which they seemed to have got the better of the islanders , they had left their ranks , when the natives surprised them , massacring twenty-two of them , including <NAME> de Courtois and <NAME> , <NAME> 's son .
After this sad affair <NAME> left <NAME> and went to try to subdue <NAME> .
The natives of this island were very clever in slinging stones , rarely missing their aim , and in the encounters with these islanders many fell on both sides , but more natives than <NAME> , whose loss , however , amounted to one hundred .
After six weeks of skirmishing , <NAME> left <NAME> , and went to <NAME> for three months , a large island twenty-one miles long and fifteen broad .
It is a flat table-land , and large woods of pine and laurel-trees shade it in many places .
The mists , which are frequent , moisten the soil and make it especially favourable for the cultivation of corn and the vine .
Game is abundant ; pigs , goats , and sheep run wild about the country ; there are also great lizards in shape like the iguana of <NAME> .
The inhabitants both men and women are a very fine race , healthy , lively , agile and particularly well made , in fact <NAME> is one of the pleasantest islands of the group .
<NAME> returned to Fortaventura with his ships after conquering <NAME> and <NAME> .
This island is fifty-one miles in length by twenty-four in breadth , and has high mountains as well as large plains , but its surface is less undulating than that of the other islands .
<NAME> streams of fresh water run through the island ; the euphorbia , a deadly poison , grows largely here , and date and olive-trees are abundant , as well as a plant that is invaluable for dyeing and whose cultivation would be most remunerative .
The coast of <NAME> has no good harbours for large vessels , but small ones can anchor there quite safely .
It was in this island that <NAME> began to make a partition of land to the colonists , and he succeeded in doing it so evenly that every one was satisfied with his portion .
Those colonists whom he had brought with him were to be exempted from taxes for nine years .
The question of religion , and religious administration could not fail to be of the deepest interest to so pious a man as <NAME> , so he resolved to go to <NAME> and try to obtain a bishop for this country , who " would order and adorn the <NAME> faith . "
Before setting out he appointed his nephew <NAME> as lieutenant and governor of the islands .
Under his orders two sergeants were to act , and enforce justice ; he desired that twice a year news of the colony should be sent to him in <NAME> , and the revenue from <NAME> and <NAME> was to be devoted to building two churches .
He said to his nephew <NAME> , " I give you full authority in everything to do whatever you think best , and I believe you will do all for my honour and to my advantage .
<NAME> as nearly as possible <NAME> and <NAME> customs , especially in the administration of justice .
Above all things , try and keep peace and unity among yourselves , and care for each other as brothers , and specially try that there shall be no rivalry among the gentlemen ; I have given to each one his share and the country is quite large enough for each to have his own sphere .
I can tell you nothing further beyond again impressing the importance of your all living as good friends together , and then all will be well . "
<NAME> remained three months in <NAME> and the other islands .
He rode about among the people on his mule , and found many of the natives beginning to speak Norman-French .
<NAME> and the other gentlemen accompanied him , he pointing out what was best to be done and the most honest way of doing it .
Then he gave notice that he would set out for <NAME> on the ensuing 15th of December .
Returning to <NAME> , he remained there till his departure , and ordered all the gentlemen he had brought with him , the workmen , and the three kings to appear before him two days before his departure , to tell them what he wished done , and to commend himself and them to <NAME> 's protection .
<NAME> failed to appear at this meeting ; they were all received at the fort on <NAME> , and sumptuously entertained .
When the repast was over , he spoke to them , especially impressing the duty of obedience to his nephew <NAME> upon them , the retention of the fifth of everything for himself , and also the exercise of all <NAME> virtues and of fervent love to God .
This done , he chose those who were to accompany him to <NAME> , and prepared to set out .
His vessel had scarcely set sail when cries and groans were heard on all sides , both Europeans and natives alike regretting this just master , who they feared would never return to them .
A great number waded into the water , and tried to stop the vessel that carried him away from them , but the sails were set and <NAME> was really gone .
" May God keep him safe from all harm , " was the utterance of many that day .
In a week he was at <NAME> , from thence he went to <NAME> , where the king received him very graciously .
He related the narrative of his conquests to the king , and requested from him letters recommending him to the <NAME> , that he might have a bishop appointed for the islands .
The king gave him the letters , and loaded him with gifts , and then <NAME> set out for <NAME> with a numerous retinue .
He remained three weeks in the eternal city , and was admitted to kiss <NAME> .
's foot , who complimented him on his having made so many proselytes to the <NAME> faith , and on his bravery in having ventured so far from his native country .
When the bulls were prepared as <NAME> had requested , and <NAME> des <NAME> was appointed <NAME> of the Canary Islands , the <NAME> took leave of the <NAME> after receiving his blessing .
The new prelate took leave of <NAME> , and set out at once for his diocese .
He went by way of <NAME> , taking with him some letters from <NAME> to the king .
Then he set sail for <NAME> and arrived there without any obstacle .
<NAME> gave him a cordial reception , and the bishop at once began to organize his diocese , governing with gentleness and courtesy , preaching now in one island , now in another , and offering up public prayers for <NAME> 's safety .
<NAME> was universally beloved , but especially by the natives .
This happy , peaceful time only lasted for five years , for later on , <NAME> began to abuse his unlimited power , and levied such heavy exactions that he was obliged to fly the country to save his life .
<NAME> after leaving <NAME> went to <NAME> and to <NAME> , and then to his own chateau , where a great number of people came to pay their respects to the king of the Canary Islands , and if on his return the first time he was much thought of , his reception this second time far exceeded it .
<NAME> established himself at <NAME> ; although he was an old man , his wife was still young .
He had frequent accounts from <NAME> of his beloved islands , and he hoped one day to return to his kingdom , but <NAME> willed otherwise .
One day in the year 1425 he was seized with what proved to be fatal illness ; he was aware that the end was near ; and after making his will and receiving the last sacraments of the church he passed away .
" May God keep him and pardon his sins , " says the narrative of his life ; " he is buried in the church of <NAME> la Teinturière , in front of the high altar . "

The year 1492 is an era in geographical annals .
It is the date of the discovery of <NAME> .
The genius of one man was fated to complete the terrestrial globe , and to show the truth of <NAME> 's saying , -- Unus erat mundus ; duo sint , ait iste ; fuere .
The old world was to be entrusted with the moral and political education of the new .
Was it equal to the task , with its ideas still limited , its tendencies still semi-barbarous , and its bitter religious animosities ?
We must leave the answer to these questions to the facts that follow .
Between the year 1405 , when <NAME> had just accomplished the colonization of the Canary Islands , and the year 1492 , what had taken place ?
We will give a short sketch of the geographical enterprise of the intervening years .
A considerable impetus had been given to science by the <NAME> ( who were soon to be expelled from <NAME> ) , and had spread throughout the peninsula .
In all the ports , but more especially in those of <NAME> , there was much talk of the continent of <NAME> , and the rich and wonderful countries beyond the sea .
" A thousand anecdotes , " says <NAME> , " stimulated curiosity , valour and avarice , every one wishing to see these mysterious countries where monsters abounded and gold was scattered over the surface of the land . "
A young prince , <NAME> , duke of <NAME> , third son of <NAME> , who was very fond of the study of astronomy and geography , exercised a considerable influence over his contemporaries ; it is to him that <NAME> owes her colonial power and wealth and the expeditions so repeatedly made , which were vividly described , and their results spoken of as so wonderful , that they may have aided in awakening <NAME> ' love of adventure .
<NAME> <NAME> had an observatory built in the southern part of the province of <NAME> , at <NAME> , commanding a most splendid view over the sea , and seeming as though it must have been placed there to seek for some unknown land ; he also established a naval college , where learned geographers traced correct maps and taught the use of the mariner 's compass .
The young prince surrounded himself with learned men , and especially gathered all the information he could as to the possibility of circumnavigating <NAME> , and thus reaching <NAME> .
Though he had never taken part in any maritime expedition , his encouragement and care for seamen gave him the soubriquet of " the Navigator , " by which name he is known in history .
Two gentlemen belonging to <NAME> 's court , <NAME> , and <NAME> had passed <NAME> , the terror of ancient navigators , when they were carried out to sea and passed near an island to which they gave the name of <NAME> .
Sometime afterwards , as they were sailing towards a black point that remained on the horizon , they came to a large island covered with splendid forests ; this was <NAME> .
[ Illustration : Prince Henry of <NAME> -- " The Navigator . " ]
In 1433 , <NAME> , which had for long been such a difficulty to navigators , was first doubled by the two <NAME> sailors , <NAME> and <NAME> , who passed more than forty leagues beyond it .
Encouraged by their example , <NAME> , and <NAME> , in 1441 , sailed as far as <NAME> , " a feat , " says <NAME> y Souza " that is generally looked upon as being little short of the labours of <NAME> , " and they brought back with them to Lisbon some gold-dust taken from the <NAME> del Ouro .
In a second voyage <NAME> noticed some of the <NAME> de <NAME> , and went as far south as <NAME> .
In the course of this expedition , he bought from some Moors off the coast of <NAME> , ten negroes , whom he took back with him to <NAME> and parted with for a very high price , they having excited great curiosity .
This was the origin of the slave-trade in <NAME> , which for the next 400 years robbed <NAME> of so many of her people , and was a disgrace to humanity .
In 1441 , <NAME> doubled <NAME> , and explored a part of the coast below it .
About 1446 , the <NAME> , advancing further into the open sea than their predecessors , came upon the group of the <NAME> .
From this time all fear vanished , for the formidable line had been passed , beyond which the air was said to scorch like fire ; expeditions succeeded each other without intermission , and each brought home accounts of newly-discovered regions .
It seemed as if the <NAME> continent was really endless , for the further they advanced towards the south , the further the cape they sought appeared to recede .
Some little time before this King <NAME> .
had added the title of <NAME> of <NAME> to his other titles , and to the discovery of <NAME> had been added that of some stars in the southern hemisphere hitherto unknown , when <NAME> , in three successive voyages , went further south than any preceding navigator , and bore away from <NAME> the honour of being the discoverer of the southern point of the <NAME> continent .
This cape is called <NAME> , and here he raised a monument called a padrao or padron in memory of his discovery , which is still standing .
On his way back , he visited the King of <NAME> in his capital , and took back with him an ambassador and numerous suite of natives , who were all baptized , and taught the elements of the <NAME> religion , which they were to propagate on their return to <NAME> .
A short time after <NAME> 's return in the month of <NAME> , 1487 , three caravels left the <NAME> under the command of <NAME> , a gentleman attached to the king 's household , and an old sailor on the <NAME> seas .
He had an experienced mariner under him , and the smallest of the three vessels freighted with provisions , was commanded by his brother <NAME> .
We have no record of the earlier part of this expedition ; we only know , from <NAME> de <NAME> , to whom we owe nearly all we learn of <NAME> navigation , that beyond Congo he followed the coast for some distance , and came to an anchorage that he named " <NAME> " on account of the manner in which he had to tack to reach it , and there he left the smallest of the caravels under the care of nine sailors .
After having been detained here five days by stress of weather , <NAME> stood out to sea , and took a southerly course , but for thirteen days his vessels were tossed hither and thither by the tempest .
As he went further south the temperature fell and the air became very cold ; at last the fury of the elements abated , and <NAME> took an easterly course hoping to sight the land , but after several days had passed , and being in about 42 degrees south latitude , he anchored in the bay " dos <NAME> , " so named from the numbers of horned animals and shepherds , who fled inland at the sight of the two vessels .
At this time <NAME> was about 120 miles east of the Cape of <NAME> , which he had doubled without seeing it .
They then went to <NAME> ( now <NAME> ) bay , and coasted as far as <NAME> bay and to an island called <NAME> where they set up a padrao .
But here the crews being much discouraged by the dangers they had passed through , and feeling much the scarcity and bad quality of the provisions , refused to go any farther .
" Besides , " they said , " as the land is now on our left , let us go back and see the <NAME> , which we have doubled without knowing it . "
<NAME> called a council , and decided that they should go forwards in a north-easterly direction for two or three days longer .
We owe it to his firmness of purpose that he was able to reach a river , 75 miles from <NAME> that he called <NAME> , but then the crew refusing to go farther , <NAME> was obliged to return to <NAME> .
<NAME> says , " When <NAME> left the pillar that he had erected , it was with such sorrow and so much bitterness , that it seemed almost as though he were leaving an exiled son , and especially when he thought of all the dangers that he and his companions had passed through , and the long distance which they had come with only this memorial as a remembrance : it was indeed painful to break off when the task was but half completed . "
At last they saw the Cape of <NAME> , or as <NAME> and his followers called it then , the " Cape of <NAME> , " in remembrance of all the storms and tempests they had passed through before they could double it .
With the foresight which so often accompanies genius , <NAME> .
substituted for the " Cape of <NAME> , " the name of the " Cape of <NAME> , " for he saw that now the route to <NAME> was open at last , and his vast plans for the extension of the commerce and influence of his country were about to be realized .
On the 24th of <NAME> , 1488 , <NAME> returned to <NAME> das <NAME> , where he had left his smallest caravel .
He found six of his nine men dead , and the seventh was so overcome with joy at seeing his companions again that he died also .
No particular incident marked the voyage home ; they reached <NAME> in December , 1488 , after staying at <NAME> , where they traded , and at <NAME> to receive the money gained by the commerce of the colony .
It is strange but true , that Diaz not only received no reward of any kind for this voyage which had been so successful , but he seemed to be treated rather as though he had disgraced himself , for he was not employed again for ten years .
More than this the command of the expedition that was sent to double the cape which <NAME> had discovered , was given to <NAME> da Gama , and <NAME> was only to accompany it to <NAME> holding a subordinate position .
He was to hear of the marvellous campaign of his successful rival in <NAME> , and to see what an effect such an event would have upon the destiny of his country .
He took part in <NAME> 's expedition which discovered <NAME> , but he had not the pleasure of seeing the shores to which he had been the pioneer , for the fleet had only just left the <NAME> shore , when a fearful storm arose ; four vessels sank , and among them the one that <NAME> commanded .
It is in allusion to his sad fate that Camoens puts the following prediction into the mouth of <NAME> , the spirit of the Cape of <NAME> .
" I will make a terrible example of the first fleet that shall pass near these rocks , and I will wreak my vengeance on him who first comes to brave me in my dwelling . "
In fact it was only in 1497 , maybe five years after the discovery of <NAME> , that the southern point of <NAME> was passed by <NAME> da Gama , and it may be affirmed that if this latter had preceded <NAME> , the discovery of the new continent might have been delayed for several centuries .
The navigators of this period were very timorous , and did not dare to sail out into <NAME> ; not liking to venture upon seas that were but little known , they always followed the coast-line of <NAME> , rather than go further from land .
If the Cape of <NAME> had been doubled , the sailors would have gone by this route to <NAME> , and none would have thought of going to the " Land of <NAME> , " that is to say <NAME> , by venturing across the <NAME> .
Who , in fact , would have thought of seeking for the east by the route to the west ?
But in truth this _was_ the great idea of that day , for <NAME> says , " The principal object of <NAME> maritime enterprise in the fifteenth century was to search for a passage to <NAME> by the <NAME> . "
The most learned men had not gone so far as to imagine the existence of another continent to complete the equilibrium and balance of the terrestrial globe .
Some parts of the <NAME> continent had been already discovered , for an <NAME> navigator <NAME> had landed on <NAME> in 1487 , and the Scandinavians had certainly disembarked on this unknown land .
The colonists of <NAME> , too had explored <NAME> , but so little disposition was there at this time to believe in the existence of a new world , that <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> were all thought to be a continuation of the <NAME> continent .
The main question before the navigators of the fifteenth century was the opening up of an easier communication with the shores of <NAME> .
The route to <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> ( countries already known through the wonderful narrative of <NAME> ) , viâ , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , was long and dangerous .
The transport of goods was too difficult and costly for these " ways terrestrial " ever to become roads for commerce .
A more practicable means of communication must be found .
Thus all the dwellers on the coasts , from <NAME> to <NAME> , as well as the people living on the shores of the <NAME> , seeing the great <NAME> ocean open to their vessels , began to inquire , whether indeed this new route might not conduct them to the shores of <NAME> .
The sphericity of the Globe being established , this reasoning was correct , for going always westward , the traveller must necessarily at last reach the east , and as to the route across the ocean , it would certainly be open .
Who could , indeed , have suspected the existence of an obstacle 9750 miles in length , lying between <NAME> and <NAME> , and called <NAME> ?
We must observe also that the scientific men of the <NAME> believed that the shores of <NAME> were not more than 6000 miles distant from those of <NAME> .
<NAME> supposed the terrestrial globe to be smaller than it really is .
<NAME> said " How far is it from the shores of <NAME> to <NAME> ?
_A very few days ' sail_ , should the wind be favourable . "
This was also the opinion of <NAME> .
So it seemed that the route between <NAME> and <NAME> _must_ be short , and there being such places for ships to touch at as the <NAME> and <NAME> , of which the existence was known in the fifteenth century , the transoceanic communication promised not to be difficult .
This popular error as to distance had the happy effect of inducing navigators to try to cross the <NAME> , a feat which , had they been aware of the 15,000 miles of ocean separating <NAME> from <NAME> , they would scarcely have dared to attempt .
We must in justice allow that certain facts gave , or seemed to give , reason to the partisans of <NAME> and <NAME> for their belief in the proximity of the eastern shores .
Thus , a pilot in the service of the King of <NAME> , while sailing at 1350 miles ' distance from <NAME> , the south-western point of the <NAME> province of <NAME> , met with a piece of wood ornamented with ancient sculptures , which he considered must have come from a continent not far off .
<NAME> , some fishermen had found near the island of <NAME> , a sculptured post and some bamboos , which in shape resembled those found in <NAME> .
The inhabitants of the <NAME> also , often picked up gigantic pine-trees , of an unknown species , and one day two human bodies were cast upon their shores , " corpses with broad faces , " says the chronicler <NAME> , " and not resembling Christians . "
These various facts tended to inflame imagination .
As in the fifteenth century men had no knowledge of that great Gulf-stream , which , in nearing the <NAME> coasts , brings with it waifs and strays from <NAME> , so they could only imagine that these various débris must come from <NAME> .
Therefore , they argued , <NAME> could not be far off , and the communication between these two extremes of the old continent must be easy .
One point must be clearly borne in mind , no geographer of this period had any notion of the existence of a new world ; it was not even a desire of adding to geographical knowledge which led to the exploration of the western route .
It was the men of commerce who were the leaders in this movement , and who first undertook to cross the <NAME> .
Their only thought was of traffic , and of carrying it on by the shortest road .
The mariner 's compass , invented , according to the generally received opinion , about 1302 , by one <NAME> of <NAME> , enabled vessels to sail at a distance from the coasts , and to guide themselves when out of sight of land .
<NAME> <NAME> , with two physicians in the service of <NAME> of <NAME> , had also added to nautical science by discovering the way of directing the voyager 's course according to the position of the sun in the heavens , and by applying the astrolabe to the purposes of navigation .
These improvements being adopted , the commercial question of the western route increased daily in importance in <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , countries in which three-quarters of the science is made up of imagination .
There was discussion , there were writings .
The excited world of commerce disputed with the world of science .
Facts , systems , doctrines , were grouped together .
The time was come when there was needed one single intelligence to collect together and assimilate the various floating ideas .
At length all the scattered notions were gathered together in the mind of one man , who possessed in a remarkable degree genius , perseverance , and boldness .
This man was no other than <NAME> , born , probably near <NAME> , about the year 1436 .
We say " probably , " for the towns of <NAME> and <NAME> dispute with <NAME> and <NAME> , the honour of having given him birth .
The date of his birth varies , with different biographers , from 1430 to 1445 , but the year 1436 would appear to be the correct one , according to the most reliable documents .
The family of <NAME> was of humble origin ; his father , <NAME> , a manufacturer of woollen stuffs , seems , however , to have been in sufficiently easy circumstances to enable him to give his children a more than ordinarily good education .
The young Christopher , the eldest of the family , was sent to the <NAME> of <NAME> , there to study <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
At fourteen years of age <NAME> left school and went to sea ; from this time until 1487 , very little is known of his career .
It is interesting to give the remark of <NAME> on this subject , as reported by M. <NAME> ; he said , " that he regretted the more this uncertainty about the early life of <NAME> when he remembered all that the chroniclers have so minutely preserved for us upon the life of the dog <NAME> , or the elephant Aboulababat , which Haroun-al-Raschid sent to Charlemagne ! "
The most probable account to be gathered from contemporary documents and from the writings of <NAME> himself , is that the young sailor visited the <NAME> , the west , the north , <NAME> several times , <NAME> , the coast of <NAME> , and the islands of <NAME> , perhaps even <NAME> , for , by the age of forty " he had sailed to every part that had ever been sailed to before . "
He was looked upon as a thoroughly competent mariner , and his reputation led to his being chosen for the command of the <NAME> galleys , in the war which that <NAME> was waging against <NAME> .
He afterwards made an expedition , in the service of <NAME> , king of <NAME> , to the coasts of <NAME> , and in 1477 , he went to explore the countries beyond <NAME> .
This voyage being successfully terminated , <NAME> returned to his home at <NAME> .
He there married the daughter of an <NAME> gentleman , <NAME> , a sailor like himself and deeply interested in the geographical ideas of the day .
The wife of <NAME> , <NAME> , was without fortune , and <NAME> , having none himself , felt he must work for the support of himself and his family .
The future discoverer , therefore , set to work to make picture-books , terrestrial globes , maps , and nautical charts , and continued in this employment until 1481 , but without at the same time abandoning his scientific and literary pursuits .
It seems probable even , that during this period he studied deeply , and attained to knowledge far beyond that possessed by most of the sailors of his time .
Can it have been that at this time " the <NAME> " first arose in his mind ?
It may well have been so .
He was following assiduously the discussions relative to the western routes , and the facility of communication by the west , between <NAME> and <NAME> .
His correspondence proves that he shared the opinion of <NAME> as to the relatively short distance separating the extreme shores of the old Continent .
He wrote frequently to the most distinguished savants of his time .
<NAME> <NAME> , of whom we have already spoken , was amongst his correspondents , and also the celebrated Florentine astronomer , <NAME> , whose opinions in some degree influenced those of <NAME> .
At this time <NAME> , according to the portrait of him given by his biographer <NAME> , was a tall man , of robust and noble presence .
His face was long , he had an aquiline nose , high cheek bones , eyes clear and full of fire ; he had a bright complexion , and his face was much covered with freckles .
He was a truly <NAME> man , and it was with the liveliest faith that he fulfilled all the duties of the <NAME> religion .
At the time when <NAME> was in correspondence with the astronomer <NAME> , he learnt that the latter , at the request of <NAME> V. , King of <NAME> , had sent to the king a learned Memoir upon the possibility of reaching the Indies by the western route .
<NAME> was consulted , and supported the ideas of <NAME> with all his influence ; but without result , for the King of <NAME> , who was engaged at the time in war with <NAME> , died , without having been able to give any attention to maritime discoveries .
His successor , <NAME> , adopted the plans of <NAME> and <NAME> with enthusiasm .
At the same time , with most reprehensible cunning , he tried to deprive these two savants of the benefit of their proposition ; without telling them , he sent out a caravel to attempt this great enterprise , and to reach <NAME> by crossing the <NAME> .
But he had not reckoned upon the inexperience of his pilots , nor upon the violence of the storms which they might encounter ; the result was , that some days after their departure , a hurricane brought back to <NAME> the sailors of the <NAME> king .
<NAME> was justly wounded by this unworthy action , and felt that he could not reckon upon a king who had so deceived him .
His wife being dead , he left <NAME> with his son <NAME> , towards the end of the year 1484 .
It is thought that he went to <NAME> and to <NAME> , where his projects of transoceanic navigation were but badly received .
[ Illustration : Columbus knocks at a convent door . ]
However it may have been , in 1485 we find him again in <NAME> .
This great man was poor , without resources .
He travelled on foot , carrying <NAME> his little son of ten years old , in his arms .
From this period of his life , history follows him step by step ; she no more loses sight of him , and she has preserved to posterity the smallest incidents of this grand existence .
We find <NAME> arrived in <NAME> , only half a league from the port of <NAME> .
<NAME> , and dying of hunger , he knocked at the door of a <NAME> convent , dedicated to <NAME> de <NAME> , and asked for a little bread and water for his poor child and for himself .
The superior of the convent , <NAME> de <NAME> , gave hospitality to the unfortunate traveller .
He questioned him , and was surprised by the nobleness of his language , but still more astonished was he , by the boldness of the ideas of <NAME> , who made the good Father the confidant of his aspirations .
For several months the wandering sailor remained in this hospitable convent ; some of the monks were learned men , and interested themselves about him and his projects ; they studied his plans ; they mentioned him to some of the well-known navigators of the time ; and we must give them the credit of having been the first to believe in the genius of <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> showed still greater kindness ; he offered to take upon himself the charge of the education of <NAME> , and he gave to Columbus a letter of recommendation addressed to the confessor of the Queen of <NAME> .
This confessor , prior of the monastery of <NAME> , was deep in the confidence of <NAME> and <NAME> ; but he did not approve of the projects of the <NAME> navigator , and he rendered him no service whatever with his royal penitent .
<NAME> must still resign himself to wait .
He went to live at <NAME> , where the court was soon to come , and for livelihood he resumed his trade of picture-seller .
Is it possible to quote from the lives of illustrious men an instance of a more trying existence than this of the great navigator ?
Could ill-fortune have assailed any man with more cruel blows ?
But this indomitable , indefatigable man of genius , rising up again after each trial , did not despair .
He felt within him the sacred fire of genius , he worked on unceasingly , he visited influential persons , spreading his ideas and defending them , and combating all objections with the most heroic energy .
At length he obtained the protection of the great cardinal-archbishop of <NAME> , <NAME> de <NAME> , and thanks to him , was admitted into the presence of the King and Queen of <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> must have imagined himself now at the end of all his troubles .
<NAME> and <NAME> received his project favourably , and caused it to be submitted for examination to a council of learned men , consisting of bishops and monks who were gathered together _ad hoc_ in a <NAME> convent at <NAME> .
But the unfortunate pleader was not yet at the end of his vicissitudes .
In this meeting at <NAME> all his judges were against him .
The truth was , that his ideas interfered with the intolerant religious notions of the fifteenth century .
The <NAME> had denied the sphericity of the earth , and since the earth was not round they declared that a voyage of circumnavigation was absolutely contrary to the <NAME> , and could not therefore , on any logical theory , be undertaken .
" Besides , " said these theologians , " if any one should ever succeed in descending into the other hemisphere , how could he ever mount up again into this one ? "
This manner of arguing was a very formidable one at this period ; for <NAME> saw himself , in consequence , almost accused of heresy , the most unpardonable crime which could be committed in these intolerant countries .
He escaped any evil consequences from the hostile disposition of the <NAME> , but the execution of his project was again adjourned .
The unfortunate man of genius , despairing of success in <NAME> , sent his brother to <NAME> to make an offer of his services to the king , <NAME> .
But it is probable that the king gave no answer .
Then <NAME> turned again with unabated perseverance to <NAME> , but <NAME> was at this time engaged in a war of extermination against the <NAME> , and it was not until 1492 , when he had chased the Moors from <NAME> , that he was able again to listen to the solicitations of the <NAME> sailor .
This time the affair was thoroughly considered , and the king consented to the enterprise .
But <NAME> , as is the manner of proud natures , wished to impose his own conditions .
They bargained over that which should enrich <NAME> !
<NAME> , in disgust , was without doubt ready to quit , and for ever , this ungrateful country , but <NAME> , touched by the thought of the unbelievers of <NAME> , whom she hoped to convert to the <NAME> faith , ordered <NAME> to be recalled , and then acceded to all his demands .
<NAME> was in the fifty-sixth year of his age when he signed a treaty with the King of <NAME> at <NAME> on the 17th of April , 1492 , being eighteen years after he had first conceived his project , and seven years from the time of his quitting the monastery of <NAME> .
By this solemn convention , the dignity of high admiral was to belong to <NAME> in all the lands which he might discover , and this dignity was to descend in perpetuity to his heirs and successors .
He was named viceroy and governor of the new possessions which he hoped to conquer in the rich countries of <NAME> , and one-tenth part of the pearls , precious stones , gold , silver , spices , provisions , and merchandise of whatever kind , which might be acquired in any manner whatsoever , within the limits of his jurisdiction , was of right to belong to him .
All was arranged , and at length <NAME> was to put his cherished projects in execution .
But let us repeat , he had no thought of meeting with the <NAME> , of the existence of which he had not the faintest suspicion .
His aim was " to explore the <NAME> by the <NAME> , and to pass by the way of the <NAME> to the <NAME> whence come the spices . "
One may even aver that <NAME> died in the belief that he had arrived at the shores of <NAME> , and never knew himself that he had made the discovery of <NAME> .
But this in no way lessens his glory ; the meeting with the new Continent was but an accident .
The real cause of the immortal renown of <NAME> was that audacity of genius which induced him to brave the dangers of an unknown ocean , to separate himself afar from those familiar shores , which , until now , navigators had never ventured to quit , to adventure himself upon the waves of the <NAME> in the frail ships of the period , which the first tempest might engulf , to launch himself , in a word , upon the deep darkness of an unknown sea .
The preparations began , <NAME> entering into an arrangement with some rich navigators of <NAME> , the three brothers <NAME> , who made the necessary advances for defraying the expenses of fitting out the ships .
Three caravels , named the <NAME> , the <NAME> , and the <NAME> , were equipped in the port of <NAME> .
The <NAME> was destined to carry the admiral , who changed her name to the _Santa-Maria_ .
The <NAME> was commanded by <NAME> , and the _Nina_ by his two brothers , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
It was difficult to man the ships , sailors generally being frightened at the enterprise , but at last the captains succeeded in getting together one hundred and twenty men , and on Friday , August 3rd , 1492 , the admiral crossing at eight o'clock in the morning the bar of <NAME> , off the town of <NAME> , in <NAME> , adventured himself with his three half-decked caravels upon the <NAME> waves .
First voyage : The <NAME> Canary -- Gomera -- <NAME> variation -- Symptoms of revolt -- <NAME> , land -- <NAME> -- Taking possession -- Conception -- <NAME> or <NAME> -- <NAME> , or <NAME> -- The <NAME> -- Cuba -- Description of the island -- Archipelago of Notre-Dame -- Hispaniola or <NAME> -- <NAME> -- The cacique on board the _Santa-Maria_ -- The caravel of <NAME> goes aground and can not be floated off -- <NAME> of Monte-Christi -- Return -- Tempest -- Arrival in <NAME> -- <NAME> rendered to <NAME> .
During the first day 's voyage , the admiral -- the title by which he is usually known in the various accounts of his exploits -- bearing directly southwards , sailed forty-five miles before sunset ; turning then to the south-east , he steered for the Canaries , in order to repair the <NAME> , which had unshipped her rudder , an accident caused perhaps by the ill-will of the steersman , who dreaded the voyage .
Ten days later <NAME> cast anchor before the <NAME> Canary <NAME> , where the rudder of the caravel was repaired .
Nineteen days afterwards he arrived before <NAME> , where the inhabitants assured him of the existence of an unknown land in the west of the <NAME> .
He did not leave <NAME> until the 6th of September .
He had received warning that three <NAME> ships awaited him in the open sea , with the intention of barring his passage ; however , without taking any heed of this news , he put to sea , cleverly avoided meeting his enemies , and steering directly westward , he lost all sight of land .
During the voyage the admiral took care to conceal from his companions the true distance traversed each day ; he made it appear less than it really was in the daily abstracts of his observations , that he might not add to the fear already felt by the sailors , by letting them know the real distance which separated them from <NAME> .
Each day he watched the compasses with attention , and it is to him we owe the discovery of the magnetic variation , of which he took account in his calculations .
The pilots , however , were much disturbed on seeing the compasses all " north-westers , " as they expressed it .
[ Illustration : <NAME> on board his caravel . ]
On the 14th of September the sailors saw a swallow and some tropic-birds .
The sight of these birds was an evidence of land being near , for they do not usually fly more than about seventy miles out to sea .
The temperature was very mild , the weather magnificent ; the wind blew from the east and wafted the caravels in the desired direction .
But it was exactly this continuance of east wind which frightened the greater part of the sailors , who saw in this persistence , so favourable for the outward voyage , the promise of a formidable obstacle to their return home .
On the 16th of September some tufts of seaweed , still fresh , were seen floating on the waves .
But no land was to be seen , and this seaweed might possibly indicate the presence of submarine rocks , and not of the shores of a continent .
On the 17th , thirty-five days after the departure of the expedition , floating weeds were frequently seen , and upon one mass of weed was found a live cray-fish , a sure sign this of the proximity of land .
During the following days a large number of birds , such as gannets , sea-swallows , and tropic-birds , flew around the caravels .
<NAME> turned their presence to account as a means of reassuring his companions , who were beginning to be terribly frightened at not meeting with land after six weeks of sailing .
His own confidence never abated , but putting firm trust in <NAME> , he often addressed energetic words of comfort to those around him , and made them each evening chant the <NAME> , or some other hymn to the <NAME> .
At the words of this heroic man , so noble , so sure of himself , so superior to all human weaknesses , the courage of the sailors revived , and they again went onwards .
We can well imagine how anxiously both officers and men scanned the western horizon towards which they were steering .
Each one had a pecuniary motive for wishing to be the first to descry the <NAME> , King Ferdinand having promised a reward of 10,000 maravédis , or 400 pounds sterling , to the first discoverer .
The latter days of the month of September were enlivened by the presence of numerous large birds , petrels , man-of-war birds , and damiers , flying in couples , a sign that they were not far away from home .
So <NAME> retained his unshaken conviction that land could not be far off .
On the 1st of October , the admiral announced to his companions that they had made 1272 miles to the west since leaving <NAME> ; in reality , the distance traversed exceeded 2100 miles , and of this <NAME> was quite aware , but persisted in his policy of disguising the truth in this particular .
On the 7th of October , the crews were excited by hearing discharges of musketry from the <NAME> , the commanders of which , the two brothers <NAME> , thought they had descried the land ; they soon found , however , that they had been mistaken .
Still , on their representing that they had seen some parroquets flying in a south-westerly direction , the admiral consented to change his route so far as to steer some points to the south , a change which had happy consequences in the future , for had they continued to run directly westward , the caravels would have been aground upon the great <NAME> , and would probably have been altogether destroyed .
Still the ardently desired land did not appear .
Each evening the sun as it went down dipped behind an interminable horizon of water .
The crews who had several times been the victims of an optical illusion , now began to murmur against <NAME> , " the <NAME> , the foreigner , " who had enticed them so far away from their country .
Some symptoms of mutiny had already shown themselves on board the vessels , when , on the 10th of October , the sailors openly declared that they would go no further .
In treating of this part of the voyage , the historians would seem to have drawn somewhat upon their imagination ; they narrate scenes of serious import which took place upon the admiral 's caravel , the sailors going so far as even to threaten his life .
They say also , that the recriminations ended by a kind of arrangement , granting a respite of three days to <NAME> , at the end of which time , should land not have been then discovered , the fleet was to set out on its return to <NAME> .
All these statements we may look upon as pure fiction ; there is nothing in the accounts given by <NAME> himself which lends them the smallest credibility .
But it has been needful to touch upon them , for nothing must be omitted relating to the great Genoese Navigator , and some amount of legend mixed up with history does not ill beseem the grand figure of <NAME> .
Still , it is an undoubted fact that there was much murmuring on board the caravels , but it would seem that the crews , cheered by the words of the admiral , and by his brave attitude in the midst of uncertainty , did not refuse to do their duty in working the ships .
On the 11th of October , the admiral noticed alongside of his vessel , a reed still green , floating upon the top of a large wave : at the same time the crew of the <NAME> hoisted on board another reed , a small board , and a little stick , which appeared to have been cut with an instrument of iron ; it was evident that human hands had been employed upon these things .
Almost at the same moment , the men of the <NAME> perceived a branch of some thorny tree covered with blossoms .
At all this every one rejoiced exceedingly ; there could be no doubt now of the proximity of the coast .
<NAME> fell over the sea .
The <NAME> , the best sailor of the three vessels , was leading .
Already , <NAME> himself , and one Rodrigo <NAME> , comptroller of the expedition , had thought they had seen a light moving amidst the shadows of the horizon , when a sailor named <NAME> , on board the <NAME> , cried out , " <NAME> , land . "
[ Illustration : What must have been the feelings in the breast of <NAME> at that moment ? ]
What must have been the feelings in the breast of <NAME> at that moment ?
Never had any man , since the first creation of the human race experienced a similar emotion to that now felt by the great navigator .
Perhaps even it is allowable to think that the eye which first saw this New Continent , was indeed that of the admiral himself .
The glory of <NAME> consisted not in the having arrived , his glory was in the having set out .
It was at two o'clock in the morning that the land was first seen , when the caravels were not two hours ' sail away from it .
At once all the crews deeply moved , joined in singing together the <NAME> .
With the first rays of the sun they saw a little island , six miles to windward of them .
It was one of the <NAME> group ; <NAME> named it <NAME> , and immediately falling on his knees , he began to repeat the hymn of <NAME> and <NAME> : " Te Deum laudamus , <NAME> confitemur . "
At this moment , some naked savages appeared upon the newly discovered coast .
<NAME> had his long boat lowered , and got into it with <NAME> and <NAME> , the comptroller <NAME> , the secretary <NAME> , and some others .
He landed upon the shore , carrying in his hand the royal banner , whilst the two captains bore between them the green banner of the <NAME> , upon which were interlaced , the initials of <NAME> and <NAME> .
Then the admiral solemnly took possession of the island in the name of the King and Queen of <NAME> , and caused a record of the act to be drawn up .
During this ceremony the natives came round <NAME> and his companions .
M. <NAME> gives the account of the scene in the very words of <NAME> : " Desiring to inspire them ( the natives ) with friendship for us , and being persuaded , on seeing them , that they would confide the more readily in us , and be the better disposed towards embracing our <NAME> , if we used mildness in persuading them , rather than if we had recourse to force , I caused to be given to several amongst them , coloured caps , and also glass beads , which they put around their necks .
I added various other articles of small value ; they testified great joy , and showed so much gratitude that we marvelled greatly at it .
When we were re-embarking , they swam towards us , to offer us parroquets , balls of cotton thread , zagayes ( or long darts ) , and many other things ; in exchange we gave them some small glass beads , little bells , and other objects .
They gave us all they had , but they appeared to me to be very poor .
The men and women both were as naked as when they were born .
<NAME> those whom we saw , one woman was rather young , and none of the men appeared to be more than thirty years of age .
They were well made , their figures handsome , and their faces agreeable .
Their hair , coarse as that of a horse 's tail , hung down in front as low as their eyebrows , behind it formed a long mass , which they never cut .
There are some who paint themselves with a blackish pigment ; their natural colour being neither black nor white , but similar to that of the inhabitants of the Canary islands ; some paint themselves with white , some with red , or any other colour , either covering the whole body with it , or the whole face , or perhaps only the eyes , or the nose .
They do not carry arms like our people , and do not even know what they are .
When I showed them some swords , they laid hold of them by the blades , and cut their fingers .
They have no iron ; their zagayes are sticks , the tip is not of iron , but sometimes made of a fish tooth , or of some other hard substance .
They have much grace in their movements .
I remarked that several had scars upon their bodies , and I asked them by means of signs , how they had been wounded .
They answered in the same manner , that the inhabitants of the neighbouring islands had come to attack them , and make them prisoners , and that they had defended themselves .
I thought then and I still think that they must have come from the mainland to make them prisoners for slaves ; they would be faithful and gentle servants .
They seem to have the power of repeating quickly what they hear .
I am persuaded that they might be converted to Christianity without difficulty , for I believe that they belong to no sect . "
When <NAME> returned on board , several of the savages swam after his boat ; the next day , the 13th , they came in crowds around the ships , on board of enormous canoes shaped out of the trunks of trees ; they were guided by means of a kind of baker 's shovel , and some of the canoes were capable of holding forty men .
Several natives wore little plates of gold hanging from their nostrils ; they appeared much surprised at the arrival of the strangers , and quite believed that these white men must have fallen from the skies .
It was with a mixture of respect and curiosity that they touched the garments of the <NAME> , considering them doubtless , a kind of natural plumage .
The scarlet coat of the admiral excited their admiration above everything , and it was evident they looked upon <NAME> as a parroquet of a superior species ; at once they seemed to recognize him as the chief amongst the strangers .
So <NAME> and his followers visited this new island of <NAME> .
They were never tired of admiring the beauty of its situation , its magnificent groves , its running streams , and verdant meadows .
The fauna of the island offered little variety ; parroquets of radiant plumage abounded amongst the trees , but they appeared to be the only species of birds upon the island .
<NAME> <NAME> presented an almost flat plateau of which no mountain broke the uniformity ; a small lake occupied the centre of the island .
The explorers imagined that <NAME> must contain great mineral riches , since the inhabitants were adorned with ornaments of gold .
But was this precious metal derived from the island itself ?
Upon this point the admiral questioned one of the natives , and succeeded in learning from him by means of signs , that in turning the island and sailing towards the south , the admiral would find a country of which the king possessed great vessels of gold and immense riches .
The next morning , at daybreak , <NAME> gave orders to have the ships prepared for sea ; he set sail , and steered towards the continent of which the natives had spoken , which , as he imagined , could be none other than <NAME> .
Here an important observation must be made , showing the state of geographical knowledge at this period : viz .
that Columbus now believed himself to have arrived at <NAME> , <NAME> being the name given by <NAME> to <NAME> .
This error of the admiral , shared in by all his companions , was not rectified for many years afterwards , and thus , as we have already remarked , the great navigator after four successive voyages to the islands , died , without knowing that he had discovered a new world .
It is beyond doubt that the sailors of <NAME> , and <NAME> himself , imagined that they had arrived , during that night of the 12th October , 1492 , either at <NAME> , or <NAME> , or the <NAME> .
This is the reason why <NAME> so long bore the name of the " Western Indies , " and why the aborigines of this continent , in <NAME> and in <NAME> , as well as in the <NAME> , are still classed under the general appellation of " Indians . "
So <NAME> dreamt only of reaching the shores of <NAME> .
He coasted along <NAME> , exploring its western side .
The natives , running down to the shore , offered him water and cassava bread , made from the root of a plant called the " Yucca . "
Several times the admiral landed upon the coast at different points , and with a sad want of humanity , he carried away some of the natives , that he might take them with him to <NAME> .
already the strangers began to tear them from their country ; it would not be long before they began to sell them !
At last the caravels lost sight of <NAME> , and were again upon the wide ocean .
Fortune had favoured <NAME> in thus guiding him into the centre of one of the most beautiful archipelagos which the world contains .
These new lands which he discovered were as a casket of precious stones , which needed only to be opened , and the hands of the discoverer were full of treasures .
On the 15th October , at sunset , the flotilla came to anchor near the western point of a second island , at a distance of only fifteen miles from <NAME> ; this island was named <NAME> ; on the morrow the admiral landed upon the shore , having his men well armed for fear of surprise ; the natives , however , proved to be of the same race as those of <NAME> , and gave a kind welcome to the <NAME> .
A south-easterly wind having arisen , <NAME> soon put to sea again , and twenty-seven miles further westward , he discovered a third island , which he called <NAME> , but which now goes by the name of the <NAME> .
All night they lay-to , and next day , the 17th October , large native canoes came off to the vessels .
The relations with the natives were excellent , the savages peacefully exchanging fruit , and small balls of cotton for glass beads , tambourines , needles , which took their fancy greatly , and some molasses , of which they appeared very fond .
These natives of <NAME> wore some clothing , and appeared altogether more civilized than those of <NAME> ; they inhabited houses made in the shape of tents and having high chimneys ; the interiors of these dwellings were remarkably clean and well kept .
The western side of the island , with its deeply indented shore , formed a grand natural harbour , capable of containing a hundred vessels .
But <NAME> did not afford the riches so much coveted by the <NAME> as spoils to take back to <NAME> ; there were no gold-mines here ; the natives who were on board the flotilla always spoke , however , of a larger island , situated to the south and called <NAME> , in which the precious metal was found .
<NAME> steered in the direction indicated , and during the night of Friday , the 19th of October , he cast anchor near this Saometo , calling it <NAME> ; in modern maps it goes by the name of <NAME> .
According to the natives of <NAME> , there was a powerful king in this island , but the admiral for several days awaited in vain the advent of this great personage ; he did not show himself .
The island of <NAME> was beautiful of aspect , with its clear lakes , and thick forests ; the <NAME> were never tired of admiring the new type of nature presented to their view , and of which the intense verdure was wonderful to <NAME> eyes .
Parroquets in innumerable flocks were flying amongst the thick trees , and great lizards , doubtless iguanas , glided with rapid movements in the high grass .
The inhabitants of the island fled at first at the sight of the foreigners , but soon becoming bolder , they trafficked with the Spaniards in the productions of their country .
Still <NAME> held firmly to the notion of reaching the shores of <NAME> .
The natives had mentioned to him a large island a little to the west which they called <NAME> , and this the admiral supposed must form part of the kingdom of <NAME> ; he felt little doubt but that he would soon arrive at the town of <NAME> , or Hang-tchoo-foo , formerly the capital of <NAME> .
With this object , as soon as the winds permitted , the fleet weighed anchor .
On Thursday , the 25th of October , seven or eight islands lying in a straight line were sighted , these were probably the <NAME> .
<NAME> did not stop to visit them , and on the Sunday he came in sight of <NAME> .
The caravels were moored in a river , to which the <NAME> gave the name of <NAME> ; after a short stay , they sailed again towards the west , and entered a harbour situated at the mouth of a large river which was afterwards called the harbour of <NAME> del Principe .
<NAME> palm-trees were growing upon the shores of the island , having leaves so broad that only one was required for roofing a native hut .
The natives had fled at the approach of the <NAME> , who found upon the shore idols of female form , tame birds , bones of animals , also dumb dogs , and some fishing instruments .
The <NAME> savages , however , were ready to be enticed like the others , and they consented to barter their goods with the Spaniards .
<NAME> believed himself to be now on the mainland , and only a few leagues from <NAME> ; this idea being so rooted in his mind , that he even busied himself in despatching some presents to the great Khan of <NAME> .
On the 2nd of November he desired one of the officers of his ship , and a Jew who could speak <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , to set out to seek this native monarch .
The ambassadors , carrying with them strings of beads , and having six days given to them for the fulfilment of their mission , started , taking a route leading towards the interior of this so-called continent .
In the meantime , <NAME> explored for nearly six miles a splendid river which flowed beneath the shade of woods of odoriferous trees .
The inhabitants freely bartered their goods with the <NAME> , and frequently mentioned to them a place named <NAME> , where gold and pearls might be obtained in abundance .
They added that men lived there who had dogs ' heads , and who fed upon human flesh .
The admiral 's envoys returned to the port on the 6th of November , after a four days ' absence .
Two days had sufficed to bring them to a village composed of about fifty huts , where they were received with every mark of respect ; the natives kissing their feet and hands , and taking them for deities descended from the skies .
Among other details of native customs , they reported that both men and women smoked tobacco by means of a forked pipe , drawing up the smoke through their nostrils .
These savages were acquainted with the secret of obtaining fire by rubbing briskly two pieces of wood against each other .
<NAME> was found in large quantities in the houses , made up into the form of tents , one of these containing as much as 11,000 pounds of the material .
As to the grand khan they saw no vestige of him .
Another consequence of the error of <NAME> must be noticed here , one which , according to <NAME> , changed the whole series of his discoveries .
He believed himself to be on the coast of <NAME> , and therefore looked upon Cuba as a portion of that continent .
In consequence , he never thought of making the tour of <NAME> , but decided on returning towards the east .
Now , had he not been deceived on this occasion , and had he continued to follow the same direction as at first , the results of his enterprise would have been greatly modified .
He might then have drifted towards <NAME> at the south-eastern point of <NAME> , or he might have run direct to <NAME> .
In this latter case , instead of ignorant and savage natives , what would he have found ?
The inhabitants of the great <NAME> , of the half-civilized kingdom of <NAME> .
There he would have seen towns , armies , enormous wealth , and his rôle would no doubt have been the same as that afterwards played by <NAME> .
But it was not to be thus , and the admiral , persevering in his mistake , directed his flotilla towards the east , weighing anchor on the 12th of November , 1492 .
<NAME> tacked in and out along the <NAME> coast ; he saw the two mountains -- <NAME> and <NAME> ; he explored a harbour to which he gave the name of <NAME> del Principe , and an archipelago which he called the <NAME> of <NAME> .
Each night the fishermen 's fires were seen upon the numerous islands , the inhabitants of which lived upon spiders and huge worms .
Several times the <NAME> landed upon different points of the coast , and there planted the cross as a sign of taking possession of the country .
The natives often spoke to the admiral about a certain island of <NAME> , where gold abounded , and thither <NAME> resolved to go , but Martin-Alonzo Pinzon , the captain of the <NAME> , the best sailer of the three ships , was beforehand with him , and at day-break on the 21st of November , he had completely disappeared from sight .
The admiral was very angry at this separation , his feelings on the subject appearing plainly in his narrative , where he says , " <NAME> has said and done to me many like things . "
Continuing his exploration of the coast of <NAME> , <NAME> discovered the <NAME> of <NAME> , the <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> , and the harbour of <NAME> , but nowhere did he meet with cannibals , although the huts of the natives were often to be seen adorned with human skulls , a sight which appeared to give great satisfaction to the islanders on board the fleet .
On the following days , they saw the <NAME> , and the caravels , doubling the point of <NAME> , found themselves upon the eastern part of the island , whose coast they had now reconnoitred for a distance of 375 miles .
But <NAME> instead of continuing his route to the south turned off to the east , and on the 5th of December perceived a large island , called by the natives <NAME> .
This was <NAME> , or <NAME> .
In the evening , the _Nina_ by the admiral 's orders , entered a harbour which was named <NAME> ; it is situated at the north-western extremity of the island , and , with the cape near which it lies , is now called <NAME> .
The next day the <NAME> discovered a number of headlands , and an islet , called <NAME> .
Everywhere on the appearance of the ships , the <NAME> canoes took to flight .
The island , along which they were now coasting , appeared very large and very high , from which latter peculiarity it gained , later on , its name of <NAME> , which signifies <NAME> .
The coast was explored by the <NAME> as far as <NAME> ; its natural features , its plains and hills , its plants and the birds which fluttered amongst the beautiful trees of the island , all recalled to the memory the landscapes of <NAME> , and for this reason <NAME> named it Hispaniola , or <NAME> .
The inhabitants were extremely timid and distrustful ; they fled away into the interior and no communication could be held with them .
Some sailors , however , succeeded in capturing a young woman , whom they carried on board with them .
She was young and rather pretty .
The admiral gave her , besides rings and beads , some clothing , of which she had great need , and after most generous treatment , he sent her back to shore .
This good conduct had the result of taming the natives , and the next day , when nine of the sailors , well armed , ventured as far as sixteen miles inland , they were received with respect , the savages running to them in crowds , and offering them everything which their country produced .
The sailors returned to the ships enchanted with their excursion .
The interior of the island they had found rich in cotton plants , mastic-trees and aloes , while a fine river , named afterwards the <NAME> , flowed gently along its limpid course .
On December 15th , <NAME> again set sail , and was carried by the wind towards <NAME> , upon which he saw a navigable stream of water , and a valley so beautiful that he called it the <NAME> of <NAME> .
The day following , having tacked into a deep gulf , an <NAME> was seen who , notwithstanding the violence of the wind , was skilfully manoeuvring a light canoe .
This <NAME> was invited to come on board , was loaded with presents by the admiral , and then put on shore again , at one of the harbours of <NAME> , now called the <NAME> de Paz .
This kindness tended to attach the natives to the admiral , and from that day they came in numbers round the caravels ; their king came with them , a strong , vigorous , and somewhat stout young man of twenty years of age ; he was naked , like his subjects of both sexes , who showed him much respect , but with no appearance of servility .
<NAME> ordered royal honours to be rendered to him , and in return , the king , or rather cacique , informed the admiral that the provinces to the east abounded in gold .
[ Illustration : <NAME> named it the <NAME> of <NAME> . ]
Next day another cacique arrived , offering to place all the treasures of his country at the service of the <NAME> .
He was present at a fête in honour of the <NAME> , that <NAME> caused to be celebrated with great pomp on board his vessel , which was gaily dressed with flags on the occasion .
The cacique dined at the admiral 's table , apparently enjoying the repast ; after he had himself tasted of the different viands and beverages , he sent the dishes and goblets to the members of his suite ; he had good manners , spoke little , but showed great politeness .
After the feast , he gave the admiral some thin leaves of gold , while <NAME> , on his side , presented him with some coins , upon which were engraved the portraits of <NAME> and <NAME> , and after explaining to him by signs that these were the representations of the most powerful sovereigns in the world , he caused the royal banners of <NAME> to be displayed before the savage prince .
When night fell , the cacique retired , highly delighted with his visit ; and on his departure he was saluted with a salvo of artillery .
On the day following , the crews before quitting this hospitable coast , set up a large cross in the middle of the little town .
In issuing from the gulf formed by <NAME> and <NAME> , they discovered several harbours , capes , bays , and rivers ; at the point of <NAME> , a small island which <NAME> named <NAME> , and finally , an enormous harbour safe and sheltered , hidden between the island and the <NAME> of <NAME> , and to which access was given by a canal surrounded by high mountains covered with trees .
The admiral often disembarked upon this coast , the natives receiving him as an ambassador from heaven , and imploring him to remain among them .
<NAME> gave them quantities of little bells , brass rings , glass beads , and other toys , which they eagerly accepted .
A cacique named <NAME> , reigning over the province of <NAME> , sent to the admiral a belt adorned with the figure of an animal with large ears , of which the nose and tongue were made of beaten gold .
<NAME> appeared to be abundant in the island , and the natives soon brought a considerable quantity of it to the strangers .
The inhabitants of this part of <NAME> seemed to be superior in intelligence and appearance to those of that portion of the island which had been first visited ; in the opinion of <NAME> , the paint , red , black , or white , with which the natives covered their bodies , served to protect them from sunstroke .
The huts of these savages were pretty and well built .
Upon <NAME> questioning them as to the country which produced gold , they always indicated one towards the east , a country which they called <NAME> , and which the admiral continued to identify with <NAME> or <NAME> .
On <NAME> Day a serious accident occurred to the admiral 's caravel , the first damage sustained in this hitherto prosperous voyage .
An inexperienced steersman was at the helm of the _Santa-Maria_ during an excursion outside the Gulf of <NAME> ; night came on , and he allowed the vessel to be caught in some currents which threw her upon the rocks ; the caravel grounded and her rudder stuck fast .
The admiral , awakened by the shock , ran upon deck ; he ordered an anchor to be fastened forward , by which the ship might warp herself off and so float again .
The master and some of the sailors charged with the execution of this order , jumped into the long boat , but seized with a sudden panic , they rowed away in haste to the <NAME> .
Meantime the tide fell , and the _Santa-Maria_ ran further aground ; it became necessary to cut away the masts to lighten her , and soon it was evident that everything on board must be removed to the other ship .
The cacique Guacanagari , quite understanding the dangerous situation of the caravel , came with his brothers and other relations , accompanied by a great number of the <NAME> , and helped in unlading the ship .
<NAME> to this prince , not a single article of the cargo was stolen , and during the whole night armed natives kept watch around the stores of provisions .
The next day <NAME> went on board the <NAME> , to console the admiral , and to place all his own possessions at his disposal , at the same time offering him a repast of bread , doe 's flesh , fish , roots , and fruit .
<NAME> , much moved by these tokens of friendship , formed the design of founding an establishment on this island .
With this purpose in view , he addressed himself to gain the hearts of the Indians by presents and kindness , and wishing also to give them an adequate notion of his power , he ordered the discharge of an arquebuse and a small cannon , of which the reports frightened the poor savages terribly .
On December 26th , the <NAME> commenced the construction of a fort upon this part of the coast , the intention of the admiral being to leave there a certain number of men , with a year 's provision of bread , wine , and seed , and to give them the long boat belonging to the _Santa-Maria_ .
The works at the fort were pushed forward with rapidity .
It was also on the 26th that they received news of the <NAME> , which had been separated from the flotilla since November 21st .
The natives announced that she was at anchor in a river at the extreme point of the island , but a canoe despatched by <NAME> returned without having found her .
Then <NAME> , not wishing to continue his explorations under the present conditions , since the loss of the _Santa-Maria_ , which could not be floated again , left him but one caravel , decided to return to <NAME> , and preparations for the departure began .
On the 2nd of January <NAME> caused his soldiers to act a mimic battle , greatly to the admiration of the cacique and his subjects .
Afterwards the admiral chose out thirty-nine men to form the garrison of the fortress during his absence , naming <NAME> de Escovedo as their commander .
The greater part of the cargo of the _Santa-Maria_ was to be left behind with them , for their year 's provision .
<NAME> these first colonists of the <NAME> World were included a writer , an alguazil , a cooper , a doctor , and a tailor .
These Spaniards were charged with the mission of seeking for gold-mines , and of choosing a suitable site for the building of a town .
On the 3rd of January , after solemn leave-takings of the cacique and the new colonists , the <NAME> weighed anchor and sailed out of the harbour .
An island was soon discovered , having upon it a very high mountain ; to this was given the name of Monte-Christi .
<NAME> had already sailed for two days along the coast , when he was aware of the approach of the <NAME> , and very soon her captain , <NAME> , came on board the <NAME> , endeavouring to excuse his conduct .
The real truth was that <NAME> had taken the lead with the view of being the first to reach the pretended island of <NAME> , of which the riches had been described in glowing colours by the natives .
The admiral was very ready to accept the bad reasons given him by <NAME> , and learnt from him that the <NAME> had done nothing but coast along the shores of <NAME> , without discovering any new island .
On the 7th of January the ships lay to , to stop a leak which had sprung in the hold of the <NAME> .
<NAME> profited by this delay to explore a wide river , situated about three miles from Monte-Christi , and which carried so much gold-dust along with it , that he gave it the name of the <NAME> .
The admiral would have desired to visit this part of <NAME> with greater care , but the crews were in haste to return home , and under the influence of the brothers <NAME> , began to murmur against his authority .
On the 9th of January the caravels set sail and steered towards the east-south-east , skirting the coast , and distinguishing by names even its smallest sinuosities ; of such were point Isabella , the cape of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and the <NAME> of <NAME> , situated at the eastern extremity of the island , where was a port , in which the fleet , being becalmed , came to anchor .
At first the relations between the foreigners and the natives were excellent , but a change was suddenly perceived , the savages ceasing to barter , and making some hostile demonstrations , which left no doubt of the bad intentions entertained by them .
On the 13th of January the savages made a sudden and unexpected attack upon the <NAME> , who , however , put a bold face on the matter , and by the aid of their weapons , put their enemies to flight after a few minutes ' combat .
Thus , for the first time , the blood of the <NAME> flowed beneath the hand of the <NAME> .
On the morrow <NAME> again set sail , having on board four young natives , whom , notwithstanding their objections , he persisted in carrying off with him .
His crews , embittered and fatigued , caused him great uneasiness , and in his narrative of the voyage , this great man , superior though he were to all human weaknesses , and a being whom adverse fate could not humble , bemoans himself bitterly over this trial .
It was on the 16th of January that the homeward voyage commenced in good earnest , and <NAME> , the extreme point of <NAME> , disappeared below the horizon .
The passage proved a quick one , and no incident is recorded until the 12th of February , when the vessels encountered a fearful storm lasting three days , with furious wind , enormous waves , and much lightning from the north-north-east .
Three times did the terrified sailors make a vow of pilgrimage to <NAME> Mary of <NAME> , to our Lady of <NAME> , and to <NAME> Clara of <NAME> , and at length , in extremity of fear , the whole crew swore to go and pray in their shirts and with naked feet in some church dedicated to the <NAME> .
But in spite of all , the storm raged with redoubled fury , and even the admiral feared for the result .
In case of a catastrophe , he thought it well hastily to write upon a parchment an abstract of his discoveries , with a request that who ever should find the document would forward it to the King of <NAME> ; wrapping the parchment in oil-cloth , he enclosed it in a wooden barrel , which was thrown into the sea .
At sunrise on the 15th of February the hurricane abated , the two caravels which had been separated by the storm again joined company , and after three days they cast anchor at the island of <NAME> , one of the <NAME> ; as soon as they arrived there , the admiral sought to further the accomplishment of the vows made during the storm , and with this object , sent half of his people on shore ; but these were unhappily made prisoners by the <NAME> , who did not restore them to liberty for five days , notwithstanding the urgent remonstrances made by <NAME> .
The admiral put to sea again on the 23rd of <NAME> ; again the winds were contrary , and again , amidst a violent tempest , he took fresh vows in company with all his crew , promising to fast on the first Saturday which should follow their arrival in <NAME> .
At last , on the 4th of March , the pilots sighted the mouth of the <NAME> , in which the <NAME> took refuge , whilst the <NAME> , caught by the wind , was carried away into the <NAME> of <NAME> .
The <NAME> welcomed the admiral kindly , the king even admitting him to an audience .
<NAME> was in haste to return to <NAME> ; as soon as the weather permitted , the <NAME> again set sail , and at mid-day on the 15th of March , she cast anchor in the port of <NAME> , after seven months and a half of navigation , during which <NAME> had discovered the islands of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , the <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
The court of <NAME> and <NAME> was then at <NAME> , whither the admiral was summoned .
He set out immediately , taking with him the Indians whom he had brought from the <NAME> .
The enthusiasm he excited was extreme ; from all parts the people ran to look at him as he passed , rendering him royal honours .
His entry into <NAME> was magnificent .
The king and queen , with the grandees of <NAME> , received him with great pomp at the palace of the Deputation .
He there gave an account of his wonderful voyage , and presented the specimens of gold which he had brought with him ; then all the assembly knelt down and chanted the Te Deum .
<NAME> <NAME> was afterwards ennobled by letters patent , and the king granted him a coat of arms bearing this device : " To <NAME> and <NAME> , <NAME> gives a <NAME> . "
The fame of the <NAME> navigator rang through the whole of <NAME> ; the Indians whom he had brought with him were baptized in presence of the whole court ; and thus , the man of genius , so long poor and unknown , had now risen to the highest point of celebrity .
Second Voyage : Flotilla of seventeen vessels -- <NAME> of <NAME> -- Dominica -- Marie-Galante -- Guadaloupe -- The Cannibals -- Montserrat -- Santa-Maria-la-Rodonda -- St. <NAME> and <NAME> -- Archipelago of the <NAME> Virgins -- The island of <NAME> <NAME> , or <NAME> -- Hispaniola -- The first Colonists massacred -- Foundation of the town of <NAME> -- Twelve ships laden with treasure sent to <NAME> -- Fort St. Thomas built in the Province of <NAME> -- <NAME> , <NAME> ' brother , named Governor of the <NAME> -- <NAME> -- The Coast of <NAME> -- The <NAME> -- <NAME> to <NAME> -- The <NAME> made prisoner -- Revolt of the <NAME> -- <NAME> -- <NAME> traduced in <NAME> -- <NAME> sent as <NAME> to <NAME> -- Gold-mines -- Departure of <NAME> -- His arrival at <NAME> .
The narrative of the adventures of the great Genoese navigator had over-excited the minds of the hearers .
Imagination already caught glimpses of golden continents situated beyond the seas .
All the passions which are engendered by cupidity were seething in the people 's hearts .
The admiral , under pressure of public opinion , must set forth again with the most brief delay .
He was himself also , eager to return to the theatre of his conquests , and to yet enrich the maps of the day with more new discoveries .
He declared himself , therefore , ready to start .
The king and queen placed at his disposal a flotilla composed of three large ships and fourteen caravels .
Twelve hundred men were to sail in them .
Several <NAME> nobles , with firm faith in the lucky star of <NAME> , decided to try their fortune with him beyond seas .
In the holds of the vessels were horses , cattle , instruments of all kinds for collecting and purifying gold , grain of various kinds ; in a word , everything that might be needful in the establishing an important colony .
Of the ten natives brought to <NAME> , five returned to their country , three , who were ill , remained behind in <NAME> , the other two were dead .
<NAME> was named captain-general of the squadron , with unlimited powers .
On the 25th of September , 1493 , the seventeen ships left <NAME> , with all sails set , amidst the acclamations of an immense crowd of people and on the 1st of October , they cast anchor at the island of <NAME> , the most westerly of the Canary group .
On sailing again , the fleet was favoured by wind and sea , and after twenty-three days of navigation came in sight of new land .
At sunrise on the 3rd of November , being the Sunday in the octave of <NAME> , the pilot of the flag-ship , the _Marie-Galante_ , cried out , " <NAME> news , there is land . "
This land proved to be an island covered with trees ; the admiral , thinking it uninhabited , did not stop ; but , after passing several scattered islets , he arrived before a second island .
The first he named <NAME> , the second Marie-Galante , names which they retain to the present day .
The next day a still larger island was in sight , and , says the narrative of this voyage given by <NAME> , the contemporary of <NAME> , " When they were arrived , they saw it was the island of the infamous cannibals , or <NAME> , of whom they had only heard a rumour during the first voyage . "
The <NAME> , well armed , landed upon the shore , where they found about thirty circular houses built of wood and covered with palm leaves .
In the interior of the huts were suspended hammocks made of cotton .
In the centre of the village were placed two trees or posts around which were entwined the dead bodies of two serpents .
At the approach of the strangers the natives fled in haste , leaving behind them several prisoners whom they were preparing to devour .
The sailors searched the houses , and found both leg and arm bones , heads so newly cut off that the blood was still moist , and other human remains , which left no doubt as to the food consumed by these Caribbees .
This island , which , with its principal rivers , the admiral caused to be partially explored , was named <NAME> , on account of the resemblance it bore to one of the <NAME> provinces .
Some <NAME> women were carried off by the sailors , but , after having been kindly treated on board the admiral 's ship , they were sent back to land , <NAME> hoping that this conduct towards the females would induce the men of the place to come on board , but in this he was disappointed .
[ Illustration : The sailors find some recently-severed heads . ]
On the 8th of November the signal for departure was given , and the whole fleet sailed for <NAME> , the present <NAME> , and the island upon which <NAME> had left thirty-nine of the companions of his first voyage .
In turning again towards the north , a large island was discovered , to which the natives who had been kept on board after having been saved from the jaws of the <NAME> , gave the name of <NAME> .
They declared that it was inhabited only by women , and as <NAME> had mentioned an <NAME> country which possessed an exclusively feminine population , <NAME> was confirmed in the idea that he was sailing upon the coast of <NAME> .
He felt a great desire to explore this island , but the contrary winds completely prevented his doing so .
<NAME> miles from thence an island was seen surrounded by high mountains ; it received the name of <NAME> ; on the next day another , which was called <NAME> la <NAME> ; and on the day following two more islands , <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> .
The squadron anchored before <NAME> , to take in water .
There occurred a scene of grave import , reported by <NAME> in such expressive words , that we can not do better than quote them : " The admiral , " he says , " ordered thirty men from his ship to go ashore and explore the island ; and these men , being landed on the coast , were aware of four dogs and as many young men and women coming towards them , extending their arms in supplication , and praying for help and deliverance from the cruel people .
The cannibals on seeing this fled , as in the island of <NAME> , and all retired into the forests .
And our people remained two days on the island to visit it .
" During that time , those who had remained with the boat saw a canoe coming towards them from a distance , containing eight men and as many women ; to these our people made signs ; but they on approaching , began to transpierce ours with their arrows , before they had time to cover themselves with their bucklers , so that one <NAME> was killed by a shaft aimed by a woman , who also transfixed another with a second arrow .
These savages had poisoned arrows , the poison being contained in the tip ; amongst them was a woman whom all the others obeyed , bowing before her .
And this was , as they conjectured , a queen , having a son of cruel appearance , robust , and with the face of a lion , who followed her .
" Ours then , considering that it was better to fight hand to hand , than to wait for greater evils in thus fighting at a distance , advanced their boat by rowing , and by so great violence did they make it move forward , that the stern of the said boat came with such velocity , it caused the enemies ' canoe to founder .
" But these Indians , being very good swimmers , without moving themselves either more slowly or more rapidly , did not cease , both men and women , to shoot arrows with all their might , at our people .
And they succeeded in reaching , by swimming , a rock covered with the water , upon which they mounted , and still fought manfully .
Nevertheless , they were finally taken , and one of them slain , and the son of the queen , pierced in two places ; when they were taken to the admiral 's ship they showed no less ferociousness and atrocity of mien , than if they had been lions of <NAME> who felt themselves taken in the net .
And such were they that no man could have even looked upon them without his heart trembling with horror , so greatly was their look hideous , terrible , and infernal . "
From all this it is clear that the strife between the <NAME> and the <NAME> was beginning to be serious .
<NAME> sailed again towards the north , going in the midst of islands " pleasant and innumerable , " covered with forests overshadowed by mountains of various hues .
This collection of islands was called the <NAME> of the <NAME> .
Soon appeared the island of <NAME> <NAME> ( now <NAME> ) , a place infested by <NAME> , but cultivated with care , and appearing truly superb from its immense woods .
Some sailors landed upon the shore , but only found there a dozen uninhabited huts .
The admiral put to sea again , and sailed along the southern coast of <NAME> for about one hundred and fifty miles .
On Friday , the 12th of November , <NAME> at last reached the island of <NAME> .
With what emotions must he not have been agitated in revisiting the theatre of his first success , in seeking to behold that fortress in which he had left his companions !
What might not have happened in the course of a year to those Europeans left alone in this barbarous land ?
Soon a great canoe , bringing the brother of the <NAME> , came alongside of the _Marie-Galante_ , and the <NAME> prince springing on board , offered two images of gold to the admiral .
Still <NAME> sought for his fortress , but , although he had anchored opposite its site , there was no trace whatever to be seen of it .
With feelings of the deepest anxiety as to the fate of his companions , he went on shore .
What was his dismay , when he found nothing left of the fortress but a few ashes !
What could have become of his compatriots ?
Had their lives been the forfeit of this first attempt at colonization ?
The admiral ordered the simultaneous discharge of the cannon from all the ships to announce his arrival at <NAME> .
But none of his companions appeared .
<NAME> , in despair , immediately despatched messengers to the <NAME> ; who , on their return brought sad news .
If <NAME> might be believed , some other caciques , irritated by the presence of the foreigners in their island , had attacked the unfortunate colonists , and had massacred them to the last man .
Guacanagari himself had received a wound in endeavouring to defend them , and to corroborate his story he showed his leg enveloped in a cotton bandage .
<NAME> did not believe in this intervention of the cacique , but , resolving to dissimulate , he welcomed <NAME> kindly when he came on board the next day ; the cacique accepted an image of the <NAME> , suspending it on his bosom .
He appeared astonished at the sight of the horses which they showed him , these animals having been hitherto quite unknown to himself and his companions .
When his visit was over , he returned to the shore , regained the region of mountains , and was seen no more .
The admiral then despatched one of his captains with three hundred men under his orders , to scour the country and carry off the cacique .
This captain penetrated far into the interior , but found no traces of the cacique , nor of the unfortunate colonists .
During this excursion , a great river was discovered , and also a fine sheltered harbour , which was named <NAME> .
However , in spite of the bad success of his first attempt , <NAME> had resolved to found a new colony upon this island , which appeared to be rich both in gold and silver .
The natives constantly spoke of mines situated in the province of <NAME> , and in the month of January two gentlemen , <NAME> de <NAME> and <NAME> , set out accompanied by a numerous escort to verify these assertions .
They discovered four rivers having auriferous sands , and brought back with them a nugget which weighed nine ounces .
The admiral on seeing these riches was confirmed in his idea that <NAME> was the famous Ophir , spoken of in the <NAME> of <NAME> .
After looking for a site upon which to build a town , he laid the foundation of <NAME> in a spot at the mouth of a river which formed a harbour , and at a distance of thirty miles east from <NAME> .
On the Feast of the <NAME> , thirteen priests officiated in the church in presence of an immense crowd of natives .
<NAME> was now anxious to send news of the colony to the King and Queen of <NAME> .
<NAME> ships laden with gold collected in the island , and with various specimens of the produce of the soil , were prepared to return to <NAME> under the command of <NAME> .
This flotilla set sail on the 2nd of February , 1494 , and a short time afterwards <NAME> sent back one more of the five ships which remained to him , with the <NAME> of <NAME> , against whom he had cause of complaint .
As soon as order was established in the colony of <NAME> , the admiral , leaving his brother behind as governor , set out , accompanied by five hundred men , to visit the mines of <NAME> .
The country they traversed seemed to be splendidly fertile ; vegetables came to perfection in thirteen days ; corn sown in February was in full ear in <NAME> , and each year yielded two abundant harvests .
They crossed successively mountains and valleys , where often the pick-axe had to be used to clear a way over these still virgin lands ; at last the <NAME> arrived at <NAME> .
There the admiral caused a fort to be constructed of wood and stone on a hill near the brink of a large river ; it was surrounded with a deep ditch , and <NAME> bestowed upon it the name of <NAME> , in derision of some of his officers who were incredulous upon the subject of the gold-mines .
It ill became them to doubt , for from all parts the natives brought nuggets and gold dust , which they were eager to exchange for beads , and above all for the hawks ' bells , of which the silvery sound excited them to dance .
This country was not only a land of gold , it was also a country rich in spices and aromatic gums , the trees which bore them forming quite large forests .
The <NAME> considered the conquest of this wealthy island a cause of unmixed congratulation .
<NAME> left fifty-six men to guard the <NAME> of <NAME> , under the command of <NAME> de <NAME> , while he returned to <NAME> , towards the beginning of April , being much hindered on the road by excessive rain .
On his arrival he found the infant colony in great disorder ; famine was threatening from the want of flour , which could not be obtained , for there were no mills ; both soldiers and workmen were exhausted with fatigue .
<NAME> sought to oblige the gentlemen to aid them ; but these proud Hidalgos , anxious as they were to conquer fortune , would not stoop to pick it up , and refused to perform any manual labour .
The priests upholding them in this conduct , <NAME> , who was forced to act with vigour , was obliged to place the churches under an interdict .
He could not spare time to remain any longer at <NAME> , but was in haste to make further discoveries ; therefore , having formed a council , composed of three gentlemen and the chief of the missionaries , under the presidency of <NAME> , to govern the colony , he set out on the 24th of April with three vessels , to complete the cycle of his discoveries .
The flotilla sailing towards the south , a new island was soon discovered , which was called by the natives <NAME> .
The highest point of the island was a mountain of which the sides sloped gently down .
The inhabitants appeared clever , and much given to the mechanical arts , but they were far from pacific in character , and several times opposed the landing of the <NAME> , who , however , repulsed them , and at length the savages were induced to conclude a treaty of alliance with the admiral .
From <NAME> pushed his researches more towards the west .
He imagined himself to be arrived at the point where the old geographers placed the golden region of the west , <NAME> .
<NAME> currents carried him towards <NAME> , along whose coast he sailed for a distance of six hundred and sixty-six miles .
During this dangerous navigation amongst shallows and narrow passages , he named more than seven hundred islands , discovered a great number of harbours , and often entered into communication with the natives .
[ Illustration : Fishermen on the coast of <NAME> . ]
In the month of May , the look-out-men on board the ships descried a large number of grassy islands , fertile and inhabited .
<NAME> , on approaching the shore , entered a river , of which the water was so warm that the hand could not remain in it , a fact evidently of exaggeration , and one which later researches have not authenticated .
The fishermen of this coast employed a certain fish called the <NAME> or sucking-fish , " which fulfilled for them the same office as the dog does for the hunter .
This fish was of an unknown species , having a body like a great eel , and upon the back of his head a very tenacious skin , in fashion like a purse , wherewith to take the fishes .
They keep this fish fastened by a cord to the boat , always in the water , for it can not bear the _look_ of the air .
And when they see a fish or a turtle , which there are larger than great bucklers , then they loose the fish by slackening the rope .
And when he feels himself at liberty , suddenly , and more rapidly than the flight of an arrow , he ( the remora ) assails the said fish or turtle , throws over him his skin in the manner of a purse , and holds his prey so firmly , be it fish or turtle , by the part visible beyond the shell , that none can wrest it from him , if he be not drawn to the surface of the water ; the cord is therefore pulled up , and gathered in little by little ; and no sooner does he see the splendour of the air , than incontinent he lets go of his prey .
And the fishermen descend as far as is necessary to take the prey , and they put it on board the boat , and fasten the fish-hunter with as much of rope as is necessary for him to regain his old position and place ; then , by means of another rope , they give him for reward a small piece of the flesh of his prey . "
The exploration of the coasts continued towards the west .
The admiral visited several countries , in which abounded goslings , ducks , herons , and those dumb dogs which the natives eat , as we should kids , and which were probably either almigui or racoons .
As the ships advanced , the sandy channels became narrower and narrower , and navigation more and more difficult , but the admiral adhered to his resolution of continuing the exploration of these coasts .
One day , he imagined he saw upon a point of land some men dressed in white , whom he took for brothers of the order of <NAME> de la Merced ; he sent some sailors to open communication with them , when it proved to be simply an optical illusion ; these so-called monks turning out to be great tropical herons , to whom distance had lent the appearance of human beings .
During the first days of June , <NAME> was obliged to stop to repair the ships , of which the keels were much damaged by the shallow water on the coast .
On the seventh day of the month he caused a solemn mass to be celebrated on the shore : during the service an old cacique arrived , who , the ceremony being over , offered the admiral some fruits , and then this native sovereign pronounced some words which the interpreters thus translated : -- " It hath been told us after what manner thou hast invested and enveloped with thy power these lands , which were to you unknown , and how thy presence has caused great terror to the people and the inhabitants .
But I hold it my duty to exhort and to warn thee that two roads present themselves before the souls , when they are separated from the bodies : the one , filled with shadows and sadness destined for those who are harmful and hurtful to the human species ; the other , pleasant and delightful , reserved for those who in their life-time have loved peace and the repose of the people .
Therefore , if thou rememberest that thou art mortal , and that the future retribution will be meted out according to the works of the present life , thou wilt take care to do harm to nobody . "
What philosopher of ancient or modern time could have spoken better or in sounder language !
All the human side of <NAME> is expressed in these magnificent words , and they came from the mouth of a savage !
<NAME> and the cacique separated , charmed with one another , and the more astonished of the two was not , perhaps , the old native .
The rest of his tribe appeared to live in the practice of the excellent precepts indicated by their chief .
<NAME> was common property amongst the natives , as much so as sun , air , and water .
The <NAME> and <NAME> , cause of all strife , did not exist amongst them , and they lived content with little .
" They enjoy the <NAME> , " says the narrative , " they protect not their possessions with ditches and hedges , they leave their gardens open ; without laws , without books , without judges , they by nature follow what is right , and hold as bad and unjust whatever sins against , or causes harm to another . "
Leaving <NAME> , <NAME> returned towards <NAME> , and sailed along the whole of the southern coast as far as the eastern extremity of the island .
His intention was to attack the islands of the <NAME> , and destroy that mischievous brood .
But the admiral was at this time seized with an illness , brought on by watching and fatigue , which obliged him to suspend his projects .
He was forced to return to <NAME> , where , under the influence of good air and repose , and the care of his brother and his friends , he recovered his health .
The colony greatly needed his presence .
The governor of <NAME> <NAME> had aroused the indignation of the natives by his cruel exactions , and had refused to listen to the remonstrances upon the subject addressed to him by <NAME> , the brother of <NAME> ; he had returned to <NAME> from <NAME> Thomas during the absence of the admiral and he embarked for <NAME> upon one of the ships which had just brought <NAME> , the second brother of <NAME> , to <NAME> .
When the admiral regained his health he resolved to punish the cacique who had revolted against the governor of <NAME> , feeling that it would be unwise to allow his authority , in the person of his delegates , to be set at nought .
In the first place he sent nine men well armed to take prisoner a bold cacique named <NAME> .
The leader <NAME> , with an intrepidity of which we shall have further instances in the future , carried off the cacique from the midst of his own people , and brought him prisoner to <NAME> .
<NAME> afterwards sent <NAME> to <NAME> , but the ship in which he sailed was wrecked during the voyage , and he was never heard of more .
In the meantime , <NAME> de <NAME> , sent by the King and Queen of <NAME> to compliment <NAME> in their names , arrived at <NAME> with four vessels .
<NAME> declared himself highly content with the successes of the admiral , and informed him that he was about to establish a monthly service of transport between <NAME> and <NAME> .
The carrying off of <NAME> had excited a general revolt amongst the natives , who burned to revenge the chief , so deeply insulted and unjustly carried away .
The <NAME> , notwithstanding the share he had had in the murder of the first colonists , alone remained faithful to the <NAME> .
<NAME> , accompanied by his brother <NAME> and the cacique , marched against the rebels and soon met with an army of natives , the numbers of which , with manifest exaggeration , he places at 100,000 men .
However numerous it may have been , this army was quickly routed by a small detachment , composed of 200 infantry , twenty-five cavalry , and twenty-five dogs .
This victory to all appearance re-established the admiral 's authority .
The Indians were condemned to pay tribute to the <NAME> , those living near the mines were ordered to furnish every three months a small quantity of gold , while the others , more distant , were to contribute twenty-five pounds of cotton .
But rebellion had been only curbed , not extinguished .
At the voice of a woman , <NAME> , widow of <NAME> , the natives rose a second time ; and even succeeded in drawing over the hitherto faithful Guacanagari to their side ; the rebels destroyed all the fields of maize , and everything else which had been planted , and then retired into the mountains .
The <NAME> , seeing themselves thus reduced to all the horrors of famine , indulged their anger by terrible reprisals against the natives ; it is calculated that one-third of the island population perished from hunger , sickness , and the weapons of the companions of <NAME> .
These unfortunate Indians paid dearly indeed for their intercourse with the conquering Europeans .
The good fortune of <NAME> was by this time on the wane .
While his authority in <NAME> was continually more and more compromised , his reputation and his character were the objects of violent attack in <NAME> .
The officers whom he had sent back to the mother country , loudly accused him of injustice and cruelty ; they even insinuated that he sought to render himself independent of the king ; and against all these attacks , <NAME> , being absent , could not defend himself .
<NAME> , influenced by this unworthy discourse , chose a commissioner , whom he ordered to proceed to the <NAME> Indies and to examine into the truth of the accusations .
This gentleman was named <NAME> d'Aguado , and the choice of such a man to fulfil such a mission , possessing as he did a mind both prejudiced and partial , was not a happy one .
<NAME> arrived at <NAME> in the month of October , at the time when the admiral was absent on an exploring expedition , and began at once to treat the brother of <NAME> with extreme haughtiness , while <NAME> on his side , relying upon his title of governor-general , refused to submit to the commands of the royal commissioner .
<NAME> soon considered himself ready to return to <NAME> , although the examination he had made was a most incomplete one , when a fearful hurricane occurred , which sank the vessels which had brought him over in the harbour .
There now remained only two caravels at <NAME> , but <NAME> , who had returned to the colony , acting with a greatness of soul which can not be too much admired , placed one of these ships at the disposal of the commissioner , with the proviso that he himself would embark in the other , to plead his cause in person before the king .
So matters stood , when the news arriving of the discovery of fresh gold-mines in <NAME> , caused the admiral to put off his departure .
<NAME> was a power strong enough to cut short all discussions ; there was no longer any mention of the King of <NAME> , nor of the inquiry which he had ordered ; officers were sent off to the new auriferous ground , finding there nuggets of which some weighed as much as twenty ounces , and a lump of amber of the weight of 300 pounds .
<NAME> ordered two fortresses to be erected for the protection of the miners , one on the boundary of the province of <NAME> , the other upon the banks of the <NAME> .
Having taken this precaution , he set out for <NAME> , full of eagerness to justify himself .
The two caravels sailed from the harbour of <NAME> on the 10th of March , 1496 .
On board of the admiral 's ship were 225 persons and thirty Indians .
On the 9th of April he touched at Marie-Galante , and on the 10th at <NAME> , to take in water ; here there occurred a sharp skirmish with the natives .
On the 20th he left this inhospitable island , and for a whole month he had to contend with contrary winds .
On the 11th of June land was sighted in <NAME> , and on the next day the caravels entered the harbour of <NAME> .
This second return of the great navigator was not welcomed , as the first had been , by the acclamations of the populace .
To enthusiasm had succeeded coldness and envy ; the companions even of the admiral took part against him .
Discouraged as they were , with illusions destroyed , and not bringing back that wealth , for the acquisition of which they had encountered so many dangers , and submitted to so much fatigue , they became unjust , and forgot that it was not the fault of <NAME> if the mines hitherto worked had been a source of expense rather than of profit .
However , the admiral was received at court with a certain measure of favour , the narrative of his second voyage doing much to reinstate him in public opinion .
And who could deny that during that expedition he had discovered the islands of <NAME> , Marie-Galante , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> ?
Had he not also carried out a new survey of <NAME> and <NAME> ?
<NAME> fought bravely against his adversaries , even employing against them the weapon of irony .
To those who denied the merit of his discoveries , he proposed the experiment of making an egg remain upright while resting upon one end , and when they could not succeed in doing this , the admiral , breaking the top of the shell , made the egg stand upon the broken part .
" You had not thought of that , " said he ; " but behold !
Third Voyage : <NAME> -- <NAME> in the <NAME> Archipelago -- Trinidad -- First sight of the <NAME> in <NAME> , beyond the <NAME> , now the Province of <NAME> -- Gulf of <NAME> -- The <NAME> -- <NAME> -- <NAME> -- <NAME> -- Cubaga -- Hispaniola during the absence of <NAME> -- Foundation of the town of <NAME> Domingo -- Arrival of <NAME> -- Insubordination in the <NAME> -- Complaints in <NAME> -- Bovadilla sent by the king to inquire into the conduct of <NAME> -- <NAME> sent to <NAME> in fetters with his two brothers -- His appearance before <NAME> and <NAME> -- <NAME> of royal favour .
<NAME> had not yet given up the hope of pursuing his conquests on the further side of the <NAME> .
No fatigue , no injustice from his fellow-men could stop him .
After having triumphed , although not without difficulty , over the malice of his enemies , he succeeded in organizing a third expedition under the auspices of the <NAME> government .
The king granted him eight vessels , forty cavalry soldiers , and one hundred infantry , sixty sailors , twenty miners , fifty labourers , twenty workmen of various trades , thirty women , some doctors , and even some musicians .
The admiral obtained the concession besides , that all the punishments in use in <NAME> should be changed into transportation to the islands .
He was thus the precursor of the <NAME> in the intelligent idea of peopling new colonies with convicts , whom labour was to reform .
[ Illustration : Embarkation of <NAME> . ]
<NAME> put to sea on the 30th of May , 1498 , although he was still suffering from gout , and from the various mental trials which he had experienced since his return .
Before starting , he learnt that a <NAME> fleet was lying in wait off <NAME> , with the purpose of hindering the expedition .
To avoid it , <NAME> made for <NAME> , and anchored there ; from that island he dispatched all his vessels , except three , to <NAME> under the command of the <NAME> de <NAME> , <NAME> of <NAME> , and <NAME> , one of his own relations , while he , with a large ship and two caravels bore down to the south with the intention of crossing the equator , and seeking for more southern countries , which , according to the general opinion , must be even richer in all kinds of productions .
On the 27th of June the small flotilla touched at the islands of <NAME> and of <NAME> , which form part of the <NAME> group .
It sailed again on the 4th of July , and made 360 miles to the south-west , experiencing long calms and intense heat ; on arriving abreast of <NAME> , it steered due west , and at mid-day on the 31st of July , one of the sailors raised the cry of " land . "
It was an island situated at the north-eastern extremity of <NAME> , and very near the coast .
The admiral gave it the name of <NAME> , and all the crews chanted the <NAME> in sign of thankfulness .
On the morrow , the 1st of <NAME> , at fifteen miles from the part of the land which had been first seen , the three vessels were moored near to the <NAME> of <NAME> , and the admiral sent some of his sailors ashore to obtain water and wood .
The coast appeared to be uninhabited , but numerous footprints of animals were observed , made , as was thought , by goats .
On the 2nd of August a long canoe , manned by twenty-four natives , came towards the ships .
These Indians , tall of stature , and paler in colour than those of <NAME> , wore upon the head a turban formed of a cotton scarf of brilliant colours , and a small skirt of the same material around the body .
The <NAME> endeavoured to entice them on board , by showing them mirrors and glass trinkets ; the sailors even executing lively dances , in the hope of inspiring them with confidence ; but the savages , taking fright at the sound of a tambourine , which seemed to them a sign of hostility , discharged a flight of arrows , and directed their canoe towards one of the caravels , whose pilot endeavoured to reassure them by steering towards them ; but in vain , the canoe soon made off , and was seen no more .
<NAME> again set sail , and discovered a new island which he called <NAME> ; but what he imagined to be an island , was , in reality , a portion of the <NAME> coast , and that part of the shore of <NAME> , which , being intersected by the numerous branches of the <NAME> , forms the <NAME> of that river .
On this day the <NAME> , although unknown to him , was really discovered by <NAME> , in that part of <NAME> which goes by the name of the Province of <NAME> .
Between this coast and the <NAME> of <NAME> there is a dangerous gulf , the Gulf of <NAME> , in which a ship can with difficulty resist the currents which flow towards the west with great rapidity .
The admiral , who believed himself to be in the open sea , was exposed to great peril in this gulf , where the rivers , falling into the sea from the continent , and being swollen at that time by an accidental flood , poured great masses of water upon the ships .
<NAME> , in writing to the king and queen , describes this incident in the following terms : -- " Being up on deck , at an advanced hour of the night , I heard a kind of terrible roaring ; I tried to see through the darkness , and all at once I beheld a sea like a hill , as high as the ship , advancing slowly from the south towards my vessels .
Opposing this great wave was a current , which met it with a frightful noise .
I had no doubt then that we should be engulfed , and even now the remembrance causes me a feeling of horror .
By good fortune , however , the current and the wave passed us , going towards the mouth of the canal , where , after long strife , they gradually sank to rest . "
Notwithstanding the difficulties of the navigation , <NAME> continued to explore this sea , of which the waters became gradually calmer as he sailed northwards ; he discovered various headlands , one of them was to the east of the <NAME> of <NAME> , and called the Cape of <NAME> .
Another was on the west of the promontory of <NAME> , and named <NAME> .
Several harbours were also noticed , amongst others one situated at the mouth of the <NAME> , to which was given the name of the <NAME> of <NAME> .
<NAME> landed on the shore , west of <NAME> , and received a kindly welcome from the numerous inhabitants .
Towards the west , beyond the point of <NAME> , the country was magnificent , and there according to the natives , much gold and pearls were to be obtained .
Here the admiral would gladly have remained for some time if he could have found a safe anchorage .
But as this was impossible , he felt it best to make for <NAME> , especially as his crews were worn down by fatigue , and his own health much affected , besides the sufferings he experienced from the bad state of his eyesight .
So he sailed onwards along the <NAME> coast , making friends as far as possible with the natives .
These Indians were agreeable in feature , and of magnificent physique ; their dwellings displayed a certain amount of taste , their houses being built with façades in front , and containing articles of furniture ingeniously made .
The natives wore plates of gold as ornaments upon their necks .
As to the country , it was superb ; the rivers , the mountains , the immense forests made it a real land of delight .
So the admiral gave this beautiful country the name of <NAME> , and by many arguments he tried to prove that in this spot was situated that terrestrial <NAME> once inhabited by <NAME> and <NAME> , being the cradle of the whole human race .
To explain to a certain degree this idea of the great navigator , we must not forget that he imagined himself all this time to be on the shores of <NAME> .
This spot which delighted him so much , he called " the <NAME> . "
On the 23rd of <NAME> , after having at the expense of much danger and fatigue , overcome the perils of this bay , <NAME> issued from the Gulf of <NAME> by the narrow strait to which he gave the name , retained to this day , of the <NAME> 's <NAME> .
Arrived in the open sea , the <NAME> discovered the <NAME> of <NAME> situated to the north-east of <NAME> , and then , more to the north , the <NAME> of <NAME> , now known as <NAME> .
They next steered to the south-west and returned towards the <NAME> coast ; after sailing along which for 120 miles , they discovered , on the 25th of <NAME> , the populous <NAME> of <NAME> , and afterwards the <NAME> of <NAME> , situated very close to the mainland .
At this place the natives had established a pearl-fishery , and busied themselves in collecting this valuable product .
<NAME> sent a boat on shore , when a very profitable traffic was carried on , the natives giving in exchange for broken pottery or hawks ' bells , pounds ' weight of pearls , some of which were very large , and of the finest water .
The admiral stopped at this point of his discoveries ; the temptation was strong to explore this country , but both officers and crews were exhausted .
Orders were therefore given to start for <NAME> , where matters of the gravest moment demanded the presence of <NAME> .
Before his departure from Hispaniola he had authorized his brother to lay the foundations of a new town .
With this end <NAME> had explored the different portions of the island , and having discovered at the distance of 150 miles from <NAME> a magnificent harbour at the mouth of a fine river , he there marked out the first streets of a town which became later on the city of <NAME> .
Here <NAME> fixed his residence , while <NAME> remained as Governor of <NAME> .
By this arrangement <NAME> ' two brothers had the whole administration of the colony in their hands .
But there were many malcontents who were ready to revolt against their authority , and it was while this bad spirit was abroad that the admiral arrived at <NAME> .
He approved of all that his brothers had done , their administration having been in fact , marked by great wisdom , and he published a proclamation recalling to their obedience the Spaniards who had revolted .
On the 18th of October he despatched five ships to <NAME> , and with them an officer commissioned to inform the king of the new discoveries , and of the state of the colony , endangered by the fomenters of disorder .
Meanwhile , the affairs of <NAME> had taken a bad turn in <NAME> .
Since his departure calumnies against himself and his brothers had been ever on the increase .
Some rebels who had been expelled the colony , denounced the encroaching dynasty of the <NAME> family , thus exciting the jealousy of a vain and ungrateful monarch .
Even the queen , until now the constant patroness of the <NAME> navigator , was indignant at the arrival on board the vessels of three hundred Indians who had been torn from their country , and who were treated as slaves .
<NAME> did not know that this abuse of power had been carried out unknown to <NAME> and during his absence ; he was held responsible for it , and to inquire into his conduct , the <NAME> sent to Hispaniola a commander of the order of <NAME> , named <NAME> de <NAME> , to whom were given the titles of Governor-general , and <NAME> of <NAME> .
He was in reality meant to supersede <NAME> .
<NAME> , invested with discretionary powers , set out with two caravels towards the end of June , 1500 .
On the 23rd of <NAME> , the colonists sighted the two ships , which were then endeavouring to enter the harbour of <NAME> .
At this time <NAME> and his brother <NAME> were absent , engaged in superintending the erection of a fort in the province of <NAME> ; <NAME> was commanding in their absence .
<NAME> landed and went to hear mass , displaying during the ceremony a very significant ostentation ; then , having summoned <NAME> before him , he ordered him to resign his office into his hands .
The admiral , warned by a messenger of what was occurring , arrived in great haste .
He examined the letters patent brought by <NAME> , and having read them , he declared his willingness to recognize him as intendant of justice , but not as governor-general of the colony .
Then <NAME> gave him a letter from the king and queen , couched in the following terms : -- " <NAME> , our Admiral in the ocean , " We have ordered <NAME> Bovadilla to explain to you our intentions .
We command you to give credit to , and to execute , whatever he shall order on our part .
In this letter , the title of <NAME> appertaining to <NAME> by the solemn conventions signed by <NAME> and <NAME> , was not even mentioned .
<NAME> , suppressing his just indignation , quietly submitted .
Then arose against the fallen admiral a whole host of false friends .
All those who owed their fortune to <NAME> turned against him ; accusing him of having desired to render himself independent .
How could this idea have occurred to the mind of a foreigner , a <NAME> , alone in the midst of a <NAME> colony !
<NAME> found the moment propitious for harsh measures .
<NAME> <NAME> was already imprisoned , and the governor soon ordered <NAME> and <NAME> himself to be put in fetters .
The admiral , accused of high treason , was placed with his two brothers on board a vessel bound for <NAME> , under the command of <NAME> de <NAME> .
That officer , a man of feeling , and ashamed of the treatment to which <NAME> was exposed , wished to strike off his chains ; but <NAME> refused .
He , the conqueror of a new world , would arrive loaded with chains in that kingdom of <NAME> , which he had so greatly enriched !
[ Illustration : Columbus bound like a felon . ]
The admiral judged rightly in thus acting , for public opinion was revolted by the sight of him in this depth of humiliation , bound like a felon , and treated as a criminal .
<NAME> towards the man of genius asserted itself against the bad passions which had been so unjustly excited , and there arose a cry of indignation against <NAME> .
The king and queen , swayed by the feelings of the people , loudly blamed the conduct of the commander , and addressed an affectionate letter to <NAME> , inviting him to present himself at court .
Thus a bright day again dawned for <NAME> .
He appeared before <NAME> , not as the accused , but as himself the accuser ; then , his fortitude giving way under the remembrance of the unworthy treatment he had experienced , this unfortunate great man wept , and caused those around to weep with him .
He pointed proudly to the story of his life .
He showed himself to be almost without resources , he whom they accused of ambition , and of enriching himself out of the government of the colony !
Verily , the man who had made the discovery of a world , did not possess a roof to shelter his own head !
<NAME> , ever good and compassionate , wept in company with the old sailor , and for sometime could not make him any answer , so choked was she with her tears .
At length she was able to utter some affectionate words ; in assuring <NAME> of her protection , she promised to avenge him of his enemies ; she excused the bad choice they had made in sending this Bovadilla to the islands , and she declared he should expiate his guilt by an exemplary punishment .
In addition , she desired the admiral to allow some time to elapse before returning to his government , in order that the minds prejudiced against him might return to sentiments of honour and justice .
The mind of <NAME> was calmed by the gracious words of the queen ; he showed himself content with his reception , and admitted the necessity of the delay enjoined upon him by <NAME> .
The chief wish of his heart was again to serve his adopted country and its sovereigns , and he sketched out grand designs of what still remained to be attempted in the way of discovery .
His third voyage , in spite of its short duration , had not been without fruit , but had enriched the map with such new names as <NAME> , the Gulf of <NAME> , the coast of <NAME> , the <NAME> of <NAME> , of <NAME> , of <NAME> , and of <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> : A Flotilla of four vessels -- Canary Islands -- Martinique -- Dominica -- Santa-Cruz -- Porto-Rico -- Hispaniola -- <NAME> -- <NAME> -- <NAME> -- <NAME> of <NAME> -- Cape Honduras -- The <NAME> of <NAME> on the Gulf of <NAME> -- The <NAME> -- Huerta -- The Coast of <NAME> -- Auriferous Strata -- Revolt of the <NAME> -- The <NAME> of <NAME> -- Porto-Bello -- The <NAME> -- Putting into port at <NAME> -- Distress -- Revolt of the <NAME> against <NAME> -- <NAME> -- Arrival of <NAME> at <NAME> -- Return of <NAME> to <NAME> -- His death , on the 20th of March , 1506 .
<NAME> <NAME> saw himself now reinstated in favour , as he deserved to be , at the court of <NAME> and <NAME> .
Perhaps the king may have still evinced a certain degree of coldness towards him , but the queen was his avowed and enthusiastic protectress .
His official title as viceroy had not , however , been restored to him , but the admiral , with his usual magnanimity , did not demand it .
He had the satisfaction of seeing <NAME> deposed , partly for his abuse of power , and partly because his conduct towards the <NAME> had become atrocious ; his inhuman proceedings towards them being pushed to such a length , that under his administration the native population of <NAME> , sensibly decreased .
During this time the island began to fulfil the hopes of <NAME> , who had prophesied that in three years the crown would derive from it a revenue of sixty millions .
<NAME> was obtained in abundance from the best worked mines ; a slave had dug up on the banks of the <NAME> , a mass , equal in weight to 3600 golden crowns ; it was easy to foresee that the new colonies would yield incalculable riches .
The admiral , who could not bear to remain inactive , earnestly demanded to be sent on a fourth voyage , although he was by this time sixty-six years of age .
In support of his request he adduced some very plausible reasons .
One year before the return of <NAME> , the <NAME> navigator , <NAME> da Gama , had returned from the <NAME> , after having doubled the Cape of <NAME> .
<NAME> felt certain that by sailing to <NAME> by the much safer and shorter western route , the <NAME> might enter into profitable competition with the <NAME> traders .
He constantly maintained , believing as he did that he had been alongside the <NAME> territory , that the islands and continents discovered by him were only separated by a strait from the <NAME> .
He therefore wished , without even returning to <NAME> and the colonies already settled , to direct his course at once to the <NAME> .
It is evident that the ex-Viceroy had again become the hardy navigator of his earlier years .
The king agreed to the admiral 's request , and placed him in command of a flotilla composed of four vessels , the <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and a caravel , as admiral 's galley .
These ships were of small tonnage , the largest being only of seventy tons , and the smallest of fifty ; they were in fact , little better than coasting-vessels .
<NAME> left <NAME> on the 9th of May , 1502 , with crews numbering in all 150 men .
He took with him his brother <NAME> , and his son <NAME> , the child of his second marriage , and at this time scarcely thirteen years old .
On the 20th of May , the vessels stopped at <NAME> , and on the 15th of June arrived at <NAME> , one of the <NAME> ; afterwards they touched at <NAME> , Santa-Cruz , and <NAME> , and at length , after a prosperous voyage , reached <NAME> , on the 29th of June .
The intention of <NAME> , acting on the queen 's advice , was not to land upon the island whence he had been so unworthily expelled ; but his badly-constructed ship was scarcely sea-worthy , and repairs to the keel were greatly needed .
Therefore the admiral demanded permission of the governor to enter the harbour .
The new governor , successor to <NAME> , was a just and moderate man , a knight of the order of <NAME> , named <NAME> .
His excessive caution , however , made him fear that the presence of <NAME> in the colony might be a cause of disorder ; he therefore thought it right to refuse the request .
The admiral concealed the indignation which such treatment could not but cause him , and returned good for evil , by offering wise counsel to the governor in the following instance .
The fleet which was to take <NAME> back to <NAME> , and to bear with it , besides the enormous lump of gold already mentioned , other treasures of great value , was ready to put to sea .
But the weather was very threatening , and <NAME> , with a sailor 's penetration , having observed the signs of an approaching storm , implored the governor not to expose the ships and passengers to such danger .
<NAME> would not listen to the advice , and the ships put to sea ; scarcely had they reached the eastern point of the island before a terrible hurricane arose , causing twenty-one of the ships to founder with all on board .
<NAME> was drowned , and with him the greater part of the enemies of <NAME> , but by an exception which may be called providential , the ship which carried the poor remains of the admiral 's fortune , escaped destruction .
In this storm ten millions ' worth of gold and precious stones was engulfed by the ocean .
Meanwhile , the four caravels of <NAME> , denied access to the harbour , had been driven before the storm .
They were separated one from the other , and disabled , but they succeeded in meeting together again , and by the 14th of July , the squall had carried them within sight of <NAME> .
<NAME> there , strong currents bore them towards the islands called the <NAME> 's <NAME> , and then in the direction of east-south-east .
The little flotilla contended for sixty days against the wind without making more than 210 miles , and at length was driven towards the coast of <NAME> , which led to the discovery of <NAME> and <NAME> .
<NAME> then steered to the south-west , sailing upon seas hitherto unvisited by any <NAME> ship , and throwing himself once more into the course of discovery with all the passionate ardour of a navigator .
<NAME> conducted him towards the southern coast of <NAME> ; he discovered the island of <NAME> , on the 30th of July , and on the 14th of August he touched at <NAME> , that narrow strip of land , which , prolonged by the <NAME> of <NAME> , unites the two continents of <NAME> .
Thus , for the second time <NAME> , without being aware of it , approached the real soil of <NAME> .
For more than nine months he followed the windings of these shores , in the face of all kinds of perils and difficulties , and succeeded in laying down the chart of the coast from the part since named <NAME> , as far as the Gulf of <NAME> .
Each night he cast anchor , that he might not be driven far from the shore , and at length reached that eastern extremity of the coast where it ends abruptly in the <NAME> Gracias a Dios .
This cape was doubled on the 14th of September , but the ships encountered contrary winds so violent , that even the admiral , himself the oldest sailor of the crews , had never before experienced the like .
He relates this terrible episode in his letter to the king of <NAME> in the following terms : " During eighty-four days the waves continued their assaults , nor did my eyes perceive sun , nor stars , nor any planet ; the seams of my vessels gaped , my sails were torn ; tackle , boats , rigging , all were lost ; my sailors , ill and frightened , devoted themselves to the pious duties of religion ; no one failed to promise pilgrimages , and all confessed to each other , thinking that each moment might prove their last .
I have seen many tempests , but never have I experienced any of such duration and violence .
Many of my men who passed for intrepid sailors , lost courage ; but that which broke my heart , was the pain of my son , whose tender age added to my despair , and whom I saw the prey of greater suffering , greater torments , than fell to the lot of any one amongst us ; but it was doubtless no other than God , who bestowed upon him such energy , that it was He alone who animated the courage , and reawakened the patience of the sailors under their severe toil ; in a word , looking upon him , one might have fancied him a sailor who had grown old in contending with storms , an astonishing fact , almost incredible , but one which awakened some gleam of joy amidst the sorrows which overwhelmed me .
I was ill , and several times I thought my last hour was near ... . To complete my misery comes the thought that twenty years of service , of fatigues and perils , have brought me no profit , and I find myself to-day unpossessed of even a roof to shelter me in <NAME> , and forced to betake myself to an inn when I would obtain repose or food ; and when there I often find myself unable to pay my reckoning . "
Do not these lines indicate clearly the intensity of sorrow which overwhelmed the soul of <NAME> ?
In the midst of such dangers and anxieties , how could he preserve the energy needful to command an expedition ?
Throughout the duration of the storm , the ships had been following the line of coast which successively bears the names of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , Costa-Rica , <NAME> , and <NAME> , the twelve <NAME> being also discovered at this time , and at last , on the 25th of September , <NAME> cast anchor between the small island of <NAME> and the continent .
On the 5th of October he again set sail , and after having taken the bearings of the <NAME> of <NAME> , he anchored opposite to the village of <NAME> .
There he remained until the 15th of October , the repairs of the vessels meanwhile going actively forward .
<NAME> now believed himself to be arrived near the mouth of the <NAME> , and from the natives speaking of a certain province of <NAME> , which was surrounded by the sea , he felt himself confirmed in this opinion .
They declared that it was a country containing rich gold-mines , of which the most important was situated seventy-five miles to the south .
When the admiral again set sail , he followed the wooded coast of <NAME> , where the <NAME> appeared to be very wild .
On the 26th of November , the flotilla entered the harbour of <NAME> , which is now the port of <NAME> .
The ships battered by the winds , were now in a most miserable plight ; it was absolutely necessary to repair the damage they had sustained , and for this purpose to prolong the stay at <NAME> .
Upon quitting this harbour <NAME> was met by a storm even more dreadful than those which had preceded it : " During nine days , " he says , " I remained without hope of being saved .
Never did any man see a more violent or terrible sea ; it was covered with foam , the wind permitted no ships to advance , nor to steer towards any cape ; I was kept in that sea , of which the waves seemed to be of blood , and the surges boiled as though heated by fire .
Never have I seen so appalling an aspect of the heavens : on fire during one whole day and night like a furnace , they sent forth thunder and flame incessantly , and I feared each moment that the masts and sails would be carried away .
The growling of the thunder was so horrible that it appeared sufficient to crush our vessels ; and during the whole time the rain fell with such violence that one could scarcely call it rain , but rather a second Deluge .
My sailors , overcome by so much trouble and suffering , prayed for death as putting a term to their miseries ; my ships opened in all directions , and boats , anchors , ropes , and sails were once again lost . "
During this long and painful navigation , the admiral had sailed one thousand and fifty miles .
His crews were by this time quite exhausted ; he was therefore obliged to turn back and to regain the river of <NAME> , but not being able to find safe shelter there for his ships , he went a short distance off to the mouth of <NAME> river , now called the <NAME> , in which he cast anchor on the feast of the Epiphany in the year 1503 .
On the morrow the tempest was again renewed , and on the 24th of January , a sudden increase of water in the river caused the cables which held the ships to snap , and the vessels were only saved with great trouble .
In spite of all this , the admiral , who never forgot the principal object of his mission in these new countries , had succeeded in establishing regular intercourse with the natives .
The cacique of <NAME> showed a friendly disposition , and pointed out a country fifteen miles inland , where he said the gold-mines were very rich .
On the 6th of February , <NAME> despatched a force of seventy men to the spot indicated , under the command of his brother <NAME> .
After travelling through a very undulating country , watered by rivers so winding that one of them had to be crossed thirty-nine times , the <NAME> arrived at the auriferous tracts .
They were immense , and extended quite out of sight .
<NAME> was so abundant that one man alone could collect enough of it in ten days to fill a measure .
In four hours , <NAME> and his men had picked up gold to an enormous amount .
They returned to the admiral , who , when he heard their narrative , resolved to settle upon this coast , and to have some wooden barracks constructed .
The mines of this region were indeed of incomparable richness ; they appeared to be inexhaustible , and quite made <NAME> forget <NAME> and <NAME> .
His letter to King Ferdinand evinces his enthusiasm on the subject ; one may feel some astonishment at reading the following sentiment from the pen of this great man , one indeed which is neither that of a philosopher nor of a <NAME> .
It is from gold that spring riches !
it is by means of gold that everything in the world is done , and its power suffices often to place souls in <NAME> . "
The <NAME> set to work with ardour to store up this gold in their ships .
Hitherto the relations with the natives had been peaceable , although these people were of fierce disposition .
But after a time the cacique , irritated by the usurpation of the foreigners , resolved to murder them and burn their dwellings .
One day the natives suddenly attacked the <NAME> in considerable force , and a very severe battle ensued , ending in the repulse of the <NAME> .
The cacique had been taken prisoner with all his family , but he succeeded with his children in escaping from custody , and took refuge in the mountains in company with a great number of his followers .
In the month of April , a considerable troop of the natives again attacked the <NAME> , who exterminated a large proportion of them .
Meanwhile , the health of <NAME> became more and more enfeebled ; the wind failed him for quitting the harbour , and he was in despair .
One day , exhausted by fatigue , he fell asleep , and heard a pitying voice which addressed him as follows : -- words which shall be given verbatim , for they bear the imprint of that kind of ecstatic religious fervour which gives a finishing touch to the picture of the great navigator .
why such unwillingness to believe in and to serve thy God , the God of the <NAME> ?
What did He more for Moses His servant , and for <NAME> ?
Since thy birth , has He not had for thee the most tender solicitude ; and when he saw thee of an age in which His designs for thee could be matured , has He not made thy name resound gloriously through the world ?
Has He not bestowed upon thee the <NAME> , the richest part of the earth ?
Has He not set thee free to make an offering of them to Him according to thine own will ?
Who but He has lent thee the means of executing His designs ?
Bounds were placed at the entrance of the ocean ; they were formed of chains which could not be broken through .
To thee were given the keys .
<NAME> power was recognized in distant lands , and thy glory was proclaimed by all Christians .
<NAME> God even show Himself more favourable to the people of <NAME> , when He rescued them from <NAME> ?
Did He favour <NAME> more , when from a shepherd boy He made him king of <NAME> ?
<NAME> to <NAME> , confessing thy fault , for His compassion is infinite .
<NAME> old age will prove no obstacle in the great actions which await thee : He holds in His hands a heritage the most brilliant .
<NAME> not Abraham a hundred years old , and had not <NAME> already passed the flower of her youth when <NAME> was born ?
<NAME> seekest an uncertain help .
Answer me : who has exposed thee so often to so many dangers ?
Is it God , or the world ?
God never withholds the blessings promised to His servants .
It is not His manner after receiving a service to pretend that His intentions have not been carried out , and to give a new interpretation to His desires ; it is not He who seeks to give to arbitrary acts a favourable colour .
His words are to be taken literally ; all that He promises He gives with usury .
I have told thee all that the <NAME> has done for thee ; at this very moment He is showing thee the prize and the reward of the perils and sufferings to which thou hast been exposed in the service of thy fellow-men . '
And I listened to this voice , overcome though I were with suffering ; but I could not muster strength to reply to these assured promises ; I contented myself by deploring my fault with tears .
The voice concluded with these words : -- 'Take confidence , hope on ; the record of thy labours will , with justice , be engraved on marble . ' "
<NAME> , as soon as he recovered , was anxious to leave this coast .
He had desired to found a colony here , but his crews were not sufficiently numerous to justify the risk of leaving a part of them on land .
The four caravels were full of worm-holes , and one of them had to be left behind at <NAME> .
On Easter day the admiral put to sea , but scarcely had he gone ninety miles before a leak was discovered in one of the ships ; it was necessary to steer for the coast with all speed , and happily Porto-Bello was reached in safety , where the ship was abandoned , her injuries being irreparable .
The flotilla consisted now of but two caravels , without boats , almost without provisions , and with 7000 miles of ocean to traverse .
It sailed along the coast , passed the port of <NAME> , discovered the group of islands called the <NAME> , and at length entered the Gulf of <NAME> .
This was the farthest point east reached by <NAME> .
On the 1st of May the admiral steered for <NAME> ; by the 10th he was in sight of the <NAME> , but he found it impossible to make head against the winds which drove him to the north-west nearly as far as <NAME> .
There , while in shallow water , he encountered a storm , during which anchors and sails were carried away , and the two ships came into collision during the night .
The hurricane then drove them southwards , and the admiral at length reached <NAME> with his shattered vessels , casting anchor on the 23rd of June in the harbour of <NAME> , now called the bay of <NAME> .
<NAME> wished to have gone to <NAME> , where he would have found the stores needful for revictualling the ships , resources which were absolutely wanting in <NAME> ; but his two caravels , full of worm-holes , " like to bee-hives , " could not without danger attempt the ninety miles ' voyage ; the question now arose , how to send a message to <NAME> , the governor of <NAME> .
[ Illustration : The <NAME> is obliged to run the caravels aground . ]
The caravels let in water in every direction , and the admiral was obliged to run them aground ; he then tried to organize a life in common upon shore .
The Indians at first gave him assistance , and furnished the crews with the provisions of which they were in need , but the miserable and much tried sailors showed resentment against the admiral ; they were ready for revolt , while the unfortunate <NAME> , exhausted by illness , was confined to a bed of pain .
It was in these trying circumstances that two brave officers , <NAME> and <NAME> , proposed to the admiral to attempt to cross from <NAME> to <NAME> in <NAME> canoes .
This was in reality a voyage of six hundred miles , for it was necessary to row along the coast as far as the port where the colony was established .
But these courageous officers were ready to face every peril , when it was a question of saving their companions .
<NAME> , appreciating the boldness of a proposal , which under other circumstances he would himself have been the first to make , gave the required permission to <NAME> and <NAME> , who set out , while he , without ships , almost without provisions , remained with his crew upon this uncultivated island .
Soon the misery of the shipwrecked people -- for so we may fairly call them -- became so great that a revolt ensued .
The admiral 's companions , blinded by their sufferings , imagined that their chief dared not return to the harbour in <NAME> , to which <NAME> had already denied him entrance .
They thought this proscription applied to them equally with the admiral , and said among themselves that the governor , in excluding the flotilla from the harbours of the colony , must have acted under orders from the king .
These absurd reasonings irritated minds already badly disposed , and at length on the 2nd of January , 1504 , two brothers named <NAME> , one the captain of one of the caravels and the other the military treasurer , placed themselves at the head of the malcontents .
Their wish was to return to <NAME> , and they rushed towards the admiral 's tent , crying , " Castille !
<NAME> was ill and in bed .
His brother and his son threw themselves between him and the mutineers to defend him .
At the sight of the aged admiral , the rebels stopped , and their violence abated ; but they would not listen to the admiral 's remonstrances and counsels ; they did not understand that nothing could save them but general concord , and each , in unselfish forgetfulness , working for the public good .
their decision was taken to quit the island , no matter by what means .
<NAME> and his followers ran down to the shore , took possession of the canoes of the natives , and steered for the eastern extremity of the island .
<NAME> there , with no respect left for anything , and drunk with fury , they pillaged the <NAME> ' dwellings -- thus rendering the admiral responsible for their deeds of violence -- and they dragged some unfortunate natives on board of the canoes which they had stolen .
<NAME> and his companions continued their navigation ; but when several leagues from shore , they were struck by a gust of wind which placed them in peril : with the object of lightening the canoes , they threw their prisoners overboard .
After this barbarous execution , the canoes endeavoured , following the example of <NAME> and <NAME> , to gain the island of <NAME> , but in vain , they were continually thrown back upon the coasts of <NAME> .
Meanwhile the admiral , left alone with his friends and the sick , succeeded in establishing order in his little world .
But the distress increased , and famine threatened .
The natives wearied of providing food for these foreigners , whose sojourn upon their island was so prolonged ; besides , they had seen the <NAME> fighting amongst themselves , a sight which had much destroyed their prestige , and convinced the Indians that these Europeans were nothing more than ordinary mortals ; thus , they no longer respected nor feared them .
The authority of <NAME> over the native population was diminishing day by day , and an accidental circumstance was needed , of which the admiral cleverly took advantage , to bring back a renown which was necessary for the safety of his companions .
A lunar eclipse , foreseen and calculated by <NAME> , was due on a certain day .
On the morning of this day , the admiral sent to request an interview with the caciques of the island .
They accepted the invitation , and when they were assembled in the tent of <NAME> , the latter announced to them that <NAME> , desirous of punishing them for their inhospitable conduct , and their bad feeling towards the <NAME> , would that evening refuse them the light of the moon .
All came to pass as the admiral had foretold ; the shadow of the earth began to conceal the moon , whose disc had the appearance of being eaten away by some formidable monster .
The savages in terror cast themselves at the feet of <NAME> , praying him to intercede with <NAME> on their behalf , and promising to place all they had at his disposal .
<NAME> , after some well feigned hesitation , pretended to yield to the prayers of the natives .
Under pretext of supplicating the <NAME> , he remained in his tent during the whole time of the eclipse , only reappearing at the moment when the phenomenon was nearly over .
Then he told the caciques that <NAME> had heard his prayer , and extending his arm he commanded the moon to reappear .
Soon the disc was seen to issue from the cone of the shadow , and the queen of night shone forth in all her splendour .
From that day forward , the grateful and submissive Indians accepted the admiral 's authority as one manifestly delegated to him by the celestial powers .
While these events were passing at <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> had long ago arrived at their destination .
These brave officers had reached <NAME> after a voyage of four days , little short of miraculous , accomplished as it was in a frail canoe .
They immediately made the governor acquainted with the desperate condition of <NAME> and his companions .
<NAME> , in a spirit of malice and injustice , detained these officers , and after a delay of eight months , under pretext of ascertaining the real condition of affairs , he despatched to <NAME> one of his own followers , a man named <NAME> , who was an especial enemy to <NAME> .
<NAME> , on his arrival at <NAME> , would not communicate with <NAME> ; he did not even land , but contented himself with putting on shore , for the use of the distressed crews , " a side of pork and a barrel of wine ; " then he again set sail without having allowed a single person to come on board .
This infamous behaviour is but too real , although humanity almost refuses to believe in it .
The admiral was indignant over this cruel mockery ; but he showed no violence , used no recrimination .
The arrival of <NAME> somewhat reassured the shipwrecked men , for at least it proved that their situation was known .
<NAME> was therefore only a matter of time , and the _morale_ of the <NAME> gradually improved .
The admiral was desirous of bringing about a reconciliation with <NAME> and the rebels , who , since their separation , had incessantly ravaged the island , and been guilty of odious cruelties towards the unfortunate natives .
<NAME> proposed to restore them to favour , but these foolish people only answered his generous overtures by advancing to attack him in his retreat .
Those Spaniards who had remained faithful to the cause of order , were obliged to take up arms , and they valiantly defended the admiral , losing but one man in this sad affair .
They took both the brothers <NAME> prisoners , and remained masters of the field of battle : then the rebels threw themselves on their knees before <NAME> , who , in compassion for their sufferings , granted them pardon .
At length , just one year after the departure of <NAME> and <NAME> , a ship appeared , equipped by them at the expense of <NAME> , which was destined to restore the shipwrecked company to their homes .
On the 24th of June , 1504 , every one went on board , and quitting <NAME> , the theatre of accumulated miseries , both moral and physical , they set sail for <NAME> .
Arrived in harbour , after a prosperous voyage , <NAME> , to his no small surprise , found himself at first received with much respect , the governor <NAME> , as a shrewd man not willing to go against public opinion , doing him honour .
But this happy temper did not last .
Soon the quarrels recommenced , and then <NAME> , unable as well as unwilling to hear more , humiliated , and even maltreated , freighted two ships , of which he shared the command with his brother <NAME> , and on the 12th of September , 1504 , he for the last time set out for <NAME> .
His fourth voyage had increased geographical knowledge by the discovery of the <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , the <NAME> , with the coasts of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , Costa-Rica , <NAME> , and <NAME> , the <NAME> , and the Gulf of <NAME> .
During this , his last voyage across the ocean , <NAME> was destined to be again tried by storms .
His own vessel was disabled , and he and his crew were obliged to go on board his brother 's ship .
On the 19th of October , another fearful hurricane broke the mast of this vessel , which had then to make more than two thousand miles with incomplete sails .
At last , on the 7th of November , the admiral entered the harbour of San-Lucar .
Here a sad piece of news was awaiting him .
<NAME> , his generous protectress , was dead .
Who was there now to take an interest in the old Genoese ?
The admiral was coldly received by the ungrateful and jealous king <NAME> , who did not even disdain to use subterfuges and delays , hoping thus to evade the solemn treaties given under his sign manual ; he ended by proposing to <NAME> the acceptance of a small <NAME> town , <NAME> de los Condes , in exchange for his titles and dignities .
This ingratitude and faithlessness overwhelmed the aged man ; his health , already so much impaired , did not improve , and grief carried him to the grave .
On the 20th of May , at <NAME> , at the age of seventy , he rendered up his soul to God with these words : " O Lord , into <NAME> hands I resign my soul and body . "
The remains of <NAME> were at first laid in the monastery of <NAME> ; in 1513 , they were removed to the <NAME> monastery of <NAME> .
But it seemed as if , even after death , repose were to be denied to the great navigator , for in 1536 his body was transported to the cathedral of <NAME> .
<NAME> tradition affirms that when , after the <NAME> of <NAME> in 1795 , the <NAME> government , before giving up to <NAME> the eastern portion of the island of <NAME> , ordered the removal of the ashes of the great sailor to <NAME> , a canon substituted some other remains for those of <NAME> , and that the latter were deposited in the choir of the cathedral , to the left of the altar .
<NAME> to this manoeuvre of the canon , whether dictated by a sentiment of local patriotism or by respect to the last wishes of <NAME> who had indicated <NAME> as his chosen place of sepulture , it is not the dust of the illustrious navigator which <NAME> possesses at <NAME> , but probably that of his brother <NAME> .
The discovery so lately made in the cathedral of <NAME> , on the 10th of September , 1877 , of a leaden chest containing human bones , and bearing an inscription stating that it encloses the remains of the <NAME> , seems to confirm in every particular the tradition which has been just mentioned .
But after all , it matters little whether the body of <NAME> be at <NAME> or at <NAME> ; his name and his glory are everywhere .
<NAME> and <NAME> -- <NAME> da Gama -- The Cape of <NAME> is doubled -- <NAME> at Sam-Braz -- <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> -- <NAME> at <NAME> -- <NAME> of the <NAME> -- <NAME> -- <NAME> to <NAME> -- The scurvy -- Death of <NAME> da Gama -- <NAME> at <NAME> .
At the same time that the King of <NAME> , <NAME> , despatched <NAME> to seek in the south of <NAME> the route to the <NAME> , he ordered two gentlemen of his court to find out if it would not be possible to attain the same end by an easier , safer , and more rapid means ; by way of the isthmus of <NAME> , the <NAME> , and the <NAME> <NAME> .
For carrying out such a mission there was needed a clever , enterprising man , well acquainted with the difficulties of a journey in those regions , and possessing a knowledge of the <NAME> languages , or at the very least , of <NAME> .
This agent must be of a versatile disposition , and able to dissemble ; capable , in a word , of concealing the real meaning of projects which aimed at nothing less than withdrawing all the commerce of <NAME> from the hands of the <NAME> and <NAME> , and through them from the Venetians , in order to enrich <NAME> with it .
There was living at this time an experienced navigator , <NAME> de <NAME> , who had served with distinction under <NAME> in the war with <NAME> , and who had made a long stay in <NAME> .
It was upon him that <NAME> .
cast his eye , and <NAME> de <NAME> was given him as a colleague .
They left <NAME> in the month of May , 1487 , furnished with detailed instructions , and with a chart drawn according to <NAME> 's map of the World , by the help of which the tour of <NAME> might be made .
The two travellers reached <NAME> and <NAME> , where they were much gratified at meeting with some <NAME> traders from <NAME> and <NAME> , who conducted them to Tor -- the ancient Ezion-geber -- at the foot of <NAME> , where they were able to procure some valuable information upon the trade of <NAME> .
<NAME> resolved to take advantage of this fortunate circumstance to visit a country which , for more than a century , had been regarded by <NAME> with covetous longing , while <NAME> set out to penetrate into those regions then so vaguely designated as <NAME> , in quest of the famous Prester <NAME> , who , according to old travellers , reigned over a marvellously rich and fertile country in <NAME> .
<NAME> doubtless perished in his adventurous enterprise , being never again heard of .
As for <NAME> , he travelled to <NAME> , whence he embarked for the <NAME> coast .
He visited in succession <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , and collected accurate information upon the commerce and productions of the countries bordering on the <NAME> , without arousing the fears of the <NAME> , who could not suspect that the kind and friendly welcome they accorded to the traveller would bring about in the future the enthralment and ruin of their country .
<NAME> , not considering that he had yet done enough for his country , quitted <NAME> , and went to the eastern coast of <NAME> , where he visited <NAME> , <NAME> -- long famous for its gold-mines , of which the reputation , by means of the <NAME> , had even reached <NAME> -- and <NAME> , the _Avalites portus_ of the ancients , and the principal town of the <NAME> coast , upon the Gulf of <NAME> , at the entrance of the <NAME> .
After a somewhat long stay in that country , he returned by <NAME> , then the principal entrepôt of the commerce of the east , went as far as <NAME> , at the entrance of the <NAME> , and then again passing up the <NAME> , he arrived at <NAME> .
had sent to Cairo two learned Jews to await the arrival of <NAME> , and to one of these , the <NAME> , the traveller gave his notes , the itinerary of his journey , and a map of <NAME> given to him by a Mussulman , charging <NAME> to carry them all to <NAME> with the least possible delay .
For himself , not content with all that he had done hitherto , and wishing to execute the mission which death had prevented <NAME> from accomplishing , he went into <NAME> , where the " negus " or king , known by the name of Prester <NAME> , flattered by seeing his alliance sought by one of the most powerful sovereigns of <NAME> , received him with the greatest kindness , and gave him a high position at his court , but to make sure of retaining his services , he constantly refused him permission to leave the country .
Although he had married there and had some children , <NAME> still longed for his native country , and when , in 1525 , a <NAME> embassy , of which <NAME> was a member , came into <NAME> , he witnessed the departure of his countrymen with the deepest regret , and the chaplain of the expedition has naïvely re-echoed his complaints and his grief .
M. Ferdinand <NAME> says , " By furnishing precise information upon the possibility of circumnavigating <NAME> , by indicating the route to the Indies , by giving more positive and extended ideas upon the commerce of these countries , and above all , by describing the gold-mines of <NAME> , and so exciting the cupidity of the <NAME> , <NAME> contributed greatly to accelerate the expedition of <NAME> . "
If one may believe an old tradition , but one which is unsupported by any authentic document , <NAME> was descended by an illegitimate line from <NAME> , King of <NAME> .
His father , <NAME> da Gama , grand alcalde of <NAME> and of <NAME> , in the kingdom of <NAME> , and commander of <NAME> , occupied a high position at the court of <NAME> .
He enjoyed great reputation as a sailor , so much so , that just at the moment when his own unexpected death occurred , King <NAME> was thinking of giving Gama the command of the fleet which he was desirous of sending to the <NAME> .
By his marriage with <NAME> , daughter of <NAME> de <NAME> , proveditore of the fortifications of <NAME> , he had several children , and amongst them <NAME> , who first reached <NAME> by doubling the Cape of <NAME> , and <NAME> , who accompanied him in that memorable expedition .
It is known that <NAME> was born at <NAME> , but the date of his birth is uncertain ; the year 1469 is that generally given , but besides the fact that if this be the correct date , <NAME> would have been very young -- not more than eight and twenty -- when the important command of the expedition to the <NAME> was confided to him , there was discovered twenty years ago , amongst the <NAME> archives , a safe-conduct to <NAME> granted in 1478 to two persons , <NAME> da Gama and <NAME> .
It is scarcely probable that such a passport would have been given to a child of nine years of age , so that this discovery would appear to carry back the birth of the celebrated voyager to an earlier date .
It seems that from an early period of his life , <NAME> da Gama was destined to follow the career of a sailor , in which his father had distinguished himself .
The first historian of the <NAME> , <NAME> de <NAME> , delights in recalling the fact that he had signalized himself upon the <NAME> seas .
At one time he was ordered to seize all the <NAME> ships lying in the <NAME> ports , in revenge for the capture by <NAME> pirates during a time of peace of a rich <NAME> galleon returning from <NAME> .
Such a mission would only have been confided to an active , energetic and well-tried captain , a clear proof that <NAME> 's valour and cleverness were highly appreciated by the king .
About this time he married <NAME> de <NAME> , one of the highest ladies about the court , and by her he had several children , amongst others <NAME> da Gama , who became governor of the <NAME> , and <NAME> , who , says <NAME> , by his struggle with <NAME> in <NAME> , and by his romantic death , deserves to be reckoned amongst the famous adventurers of the sixteenth century .
All doubt as to the precise date of <NAME> 's first voyage is now at an end , thanks to the document in the public library at <NAME> , a paper with which <NAME> must have been acquainted , and of which M. Ferdinand <NAME> has published a translation in the <NAME> and <NAME> of M. E. Charton .
The date may be fixed with certainty for Saturday , the 8th of July , 1497 .
This expedition had been long ago determined upon , and all its details were minutely arranged .
It was to be composed of four vessels of medium size , " in order , " says <NAME> , " that they may enter everywhere and again issue forth rapidly . "
They were solidly constructed , and provided with a triple supply of sails and hawsers ; all the barrels destined to contain water , oil , or wine had been strengthened with iron hoops ; large provisions of all kinds had been made , such as flour , wine , vegetables , drugs , and artillery ; the personnel of the expedition consisted of the best sailors , the cleverest pilots , and the most experienced captains .
<NAME> , who had received the title of <NAME> mõr_ , hoisted his flag upon the _Sam-Gabriel_ of 120 tons .
His brother <NAME> da <NAME> was on board the _Sam-Raphael_ of 100 tons .
A caravel of 50 tons , the <NAME> , so named in memory of the pilot <NAME> , who had sold her to <NAME> , was commanded by an experienced sailor , <NAME> , while <NAME> was the captain of a large barque , laden with provisions and merchandise , destined for exchange with the natives of the countries which should be visited .
<NAME> de <NAME> , who had been pilot to <NAME> , was to regulate the course of the vessels .
The crews , including ten criminals who were put on board to be employed on any dangerous service , amounted to one hundred and sixty persons .
What feeble means these , what almost absurd resources , compared with the grandeur of the mission which these men were to accomplish !
On the 8th of July , at sunrise , <NAME> advanced towards the vessels , followed by his officers through an immense crowd of people .
Around him were a number of monks and religious persons , who chanted sacred hymns , and besought <NAME> 's protection for the voyagers .
This departure from <NAME> must have been a singularly moving scene ; all , whether actors or spectators , mingling their chants , their cries , their adieux and their tears , while the sails , filled by a favourable breeze , bore away Gama and the fortune of <NAME> towards the open sea .
A large caravel and a smaller barque , which were bound for <NAME> under the command of <NAME> , sailed in company with <NAME> 's fleet .
On the following Saturday , the ships were in sight of the <NAME> , and passed the night windward of <NAME> .
When they arrived parallel with the <NAME> de <NAME> , a thick fog separated <NAME> da Gama , <NAME> , and <NAME> from the rest of the fleet , but they joined again near the <NAME> de <NAME> , which were soon reached .
At <NAME> fresh stores of meat , water , and wood were taken on board , and the ships were again put into good sailing order .
They quitted the shore of <NAME> on the 3rd of August .
The voyage was accomplished without any remarkable incidents , and on the 4th of November , anchors were dropped upon the <NAME> in a bay which received the name of _Santa-Ellena_ .
Eight days were spent there in shipping wood , and in putting everything in order on board the vessels .
It was there that they saw for the first time the <NAME> , a miserable and degraded race of people who fed upon the flesh of sea-wolves and whales , as well as upon roots .
The <NAME> carried off some of these natives , and treated them with kindness .
The savages knew nothing of the value of the merchandize which was offered to them , they saw the objects for the first time and were ignorant of their use .
<NAME> was the only thing which they appeared to prize , wearing in their ears small chains of that metal .
They understood well the use of the zagayes -- a kind of javelin , of which the point is hardened in the fire -- of which three or four of the sailors and even Gama himself had unpleasant experience , while endeavouring to rescue from their hands a certain Velloso , a man who had imprudently ventured into the interior of the country .
This incident has furnished Camoens with one of the most charming episodes of the " Lusiad . "
On leaving Santa-Ellena , <NAME> de <NAME> , formerly pilot to <NAME> , declared his belief that they were then ninety miles from the <NAME> , but in the uncertainty the fleet stood off to sea ; on the 18th of November the Cape of <NAME> was seen , and the next day it was doubled by the fleet sailing before the wind .
On the 25th the vessels were moored in the <NAME> of Sam-Braz , where they remained thirteen days , during which time the boat which carried the stores was demolished , and her cargo divided amongst the three other vessels .
During their stay the <NAME> gave the Bushmen some hawks ' bells and other objects , which , to their surprise , were accepted , for in the time of Diaz the negroes had shown themselves timid and even hostile , and had thrown stones to prevent the crews from procuring water .
Now they brought oxen and sheep , and to show their pleasure at the visit of the <NAME> , " they began , " says <NAME> , " to play upon four or five flutes , some set high , some low , a wonderful harmony for negroes , from whom one scarcely looks for music .
They danced also , as dance the blacks , and the <NAME> mõr commanded the trumpets to sound , and we in our boats danced too , the <NAME> mõr himself dancing , as soon as he had returned amongst us . "
What shall we say to this little fête and this mutual serenade between the <NAME> and the negroes ?
Would any one have expected to behold <NAME> , a grave man , as his portraits represent him , initiating the negroes into the charms of the pavane .
Unhappily these favourable dispositions were transient , and it was found necessary to have recourse to some hostile demonstrations by means of repeated discharges of artillery .
In this Bay of Sam-Braz Gama erected a padrao , which was thrown down as soon as he was gone .
The fleet soon passed the <NAME> , the furthest point reached by <NAME> .
Here the ships experienced the effects of a strong current , but of which the violence was neutralized thanks to a favourable wind .
On the 25th of December , <NAME> Day , the country of <NAME> was discovered .
The ships had sustained some damage , and fresh water was needed ; it was therefore urgent for them to find some harbour , which they succeeded in doing on the 10th of January , 1498 .
The blacks whom the <NAME> saw here upon landing were people of greater stature than those whom they had hitherto met with .
Their arms were a large bow with long arrows , and a zagaye tipped with iron .
They were <NAME> , a race very superior to the <NAME> .
Such happy relations were quickly established with them that <NAME> gave the country the name of the <NAME> of <NAME> People ( <NAME> da bon Gente_ ) .
[ Illustration : Map of the <NAME> of <NAME> , from the Cape of <NAME> to the Cape del Gado . ]
A little further on , while still sailing up the coast , two Mussulman traders , one wearing a turban , the other a hood of green satin , came to visit the <NAME> , with a young man who , " from what could be understood from their signs , belonged to a very distant country , and who said he had already seen ships as large as ours . "
<NAME> da Gama , took this as a proof that he was now approaching those <NAME> lands , which had been so long and so eagerly sought .
For this reason he named the river which flowed into the sea at this place <NAME> dos <NAME> ( River of good tokens ) .
Unhappily the first symptoms of scurvy appeared at this time amongst the crews , and soon there were many sailors upon the sick list .
On the 10th of March the expedition cast anchor before the <NAME> of <NAME> , where , as <NAME> learnt through his <NAME> interpreters , there were several merchants of <NAME> extraction , who carried on trade with <NAME> .
<NAME> and silver , cloth and spices , pearls and rubies , formed the staple of their commerce .
Gama at the same time was assured that in pursuing the line of the coast , he would find numerous cities ; " Whereat we were so joyful , " says <NAME> in his naïve and valuable narrative , " that we wept for pleasure , praying God to grant us health that we might see all that which we had so much desired . "
The <NAME> , who imagined he was dealing with <NAME> , came on board several times and was magnificently entertained ; he returned the civility by sending presents , and even furnished Gama with two skilful pilots , but when some <NAME> merchants who had traded in <NAME> told him that these foreigners , far from being <NAME> , were in reality the worst enemies of the Mahometans , the viceroy , disgusted at his mistake , made preparations for seizing the <NAME> by treachery , and killing them .
<NAME> was obliged to point his artillery at the town and threaten to reduce it to ashes before he could obtain the water needed for the prosecution of his voyage .
<NAME> flowed , and <NAME> da <NAME> captured two barques , whose rich cargo was divided amongst the sailors .
The ships quitted this inhospitable town , on the 29th of March , and the voyage continued , a close surveillance being kept over the <NAME> pilots , whom <NAME> was obliged to cause to be flogged .
On the 4th of April the coast was seen , and on the 8th Mombasa or <NAME> was reached , a town , according to the pilots , inhabited by <NAME> and <NAME> .
The fleet dropped anchor outside the harbour , and did not enter it , notwithstanding the enthusiastic reception given to them .
Already the <NAME> were reckoning upon meeting at mass the next day with the Christians of the <NAME> , when during the night , the flag-ship was approached by a _zacra_ , having on board a hundred armed men , who endeavoured to enter the ships in a body , which was refused them .
The king of <NAME> was informed of all that had occurred at <NAME> , but pretending ignorance , he sent presents to <NAME> , proposing to him to establish a factory in his capital , and assuring him that so soon as he should have entered the port , he might take on board a cargo of spices and aromatics .
The <NAME> mõr , suspecting nothing , immediately sent two men to announce his entry for the morrow ; already they were weighing anchor when the flag-ship refusing to tack , the anchor was let fall again .
In graceful and poetic fiction , <NAME> affirms that it was the <NAME> led by <NAME> , the protectress of the <NAME> , who stayed their ships when on the point of entering the port .
At this moment all the Moors on board the fleet quitted it simultaneously , whilst the <NAME> pilots threw themselves into the sea .
Two Moors who were put to the question with a drop of hot oil , confessed that the intention was to take all the <NAME> prisoners as soon as they should be inside the harbour .
During the night the <NAME> endeavoured several times to climb on board and to cut the cables in order to run the ships aground , but each time they were discovered .
Under these circumstances no prolonged stay was possible at <NAME> , but it had been long enough for all those ill of scurvy to recover their health .
At the distance of four-and-twenty miles from land , the fleet captured a barque richly laden with gold , silver , and provisions .
The next day <NAME> arrived at <NAME> , a rich and flourishing city , whose gilded minarets , sparkling in the sunshine , and whose mosques of dazzling whiteness , stood out against a sky of the most intense blue .
The reception of the <NAME> at <NAME> was at first very cold , the capture of the barque the evening before being already known there , but as soon as explanations had been given , the people became cordial .
The king 's son came to visit the admiral , accompanied by a train of courtiers splendidly dressed , and a choir of musicians , who played upon various instruments .
The greatest astonishment was shown at the artillery practice , for the invention of gunpowder was not yet known on the east coast of <NAME> .
A solemn treaty was made , ratified by oaths upon the <NAME> and the <NAME> , and cemented by an interchange of presents .
From this moment the ill-will , the treachery , the difficulties of all kinds which had hitherto beset the expedition , ceased as if by magic : this must be attributed to the generosity of the King of <NAME> , and to the aid which he furnished to the <NAME> .
<NAME> to the promise which he had made to <NAME> da Gama , the king sent him a Gujerat pilot named <NAME> , a man well instructed in navigation , understanding the use of charts , of the compass and the quadrant , and who rendered the most important service to the expedition .
After a stay of nine days the fleet weighed anchor for <NAME> .
The coasting plan hitherto pursued was now to be abandoned , and the time was come when , in reliance upon the blessing of <NAME> , the <NAME> must venture out upon the wide ocean , without other guide than an unknown pilot furnished by a king whose kind welcome had not sufficed to lull to sleep the suspicions of the foreigners .
And yet , thanks to the ability and loyalty of this pilot , thanks also to the clemency of the sea , and to the wind being constantly in its favour , the fleet , after a twenty-three days ' voyage , reached the land on the 17th May , and the next day anchored at the distance of six miles below <NAME> .
The enthusiasm on board was great .
At last they had arrived in those rich and wonderful countries .
<NAME> , dangers , sickness , all were forgotten .
The object of their long labours was attained !
Or rather , it seemed to be so , for there was still needed the possession of the treasures and rich productions of <NAME> .
Scarcely were the anchors dropped when four boats came off from the shore , performing evolutions around the fleet , and apparently inviting the sailors to disembark .
But <NAME> , rendered cautious by the occurrences at <NAME> and <NAME> , sent on shore one of the criminals who were on board , to act as a scout ; ordering him to walk through the town and endeavour to ascertain the temper of its inhabitants .
Surrounded by an inquisitive crowd , assailed by questions to which he could not reply , this man was conducted to the house of a Moor named <NAME> , who spoke <NAME> , and to whom he gave a short account of the voyage of the fleet .
<NAME> returned with him on board , and his first words on setting foot on the ship were " Good luck !
quantities of rubies , quantities of emeralds ! "
<NAME> , <NAME> was at once engaged as interpreter .
The King of <NAME> was at this time at a distance of forty-five miles from his capital , so the <NAME> mõr despatched two men to announce the arrival of an ambassador from the King of <NAME> , being the bearer of letters to him from his sovereign .
The king at once sent a pilot , with orders to take the <NAME> ships into the safer roadstead of <NAME> , and promised to return himself on the morrow to <NAME> ; this he did , and ordered his <NAME> or <NAME> to invite Gama to land and open negotiations .
In spite of the supplications of his brother , <NAME> da Gama , who represented to him the dangers which he might incur , and those to which his death would expose the expedition , the <NAME> mõr set out for the shore , upon which an enormous crowd of people were awaiting him .
The idea that they were in the midst of a <NAME> population was so rooted in the minds of all the members of the expedition , that <NAME> , on passing by a pagoda on the way , entered it to perform his devotions .
One of his companions , however , <NAME> de Saa , noticing the hideous pictures upon the walls , was less credulous , and whilst throwing himself upon his knees , said aloud , " If that be a devil , I intend nevertheless to adore only the true God ! "
A mental reservation which caused amusement to the admiral .
Near the gates of the town the crowd was even more closely packed .
<NAME> and his companions , under the guidance of the <NAME> , had some difficulty in reaching the palace , where the king , who in the narrative is called the " <NAME> , " was awaiting them with extreme impatience .
Ushered into halls splendidly decorated with silken stuffs and carpets , and in which burned the most exquisite perfumes , the <NAME> found themselves in the presence of the <NAME> .
He was magnificently attired , and loaded with jewels , the pearls and diamonds which he wore being of extraordinary size .
The king ordered refreshments to be served to the strangers , and permitted them to be seated , a peculiar mark of favour in a country where the sovereign is usually only addressed with the most lowly prostrations .
The <NAME> afterwards passed into another apartment , to hear with his own ears , as was proudly demanded by <NAME> , the reasons for the embassy and the desire felt by the King of <NAME> to conclude a treaty of commerce and alliance with the King of <NAME> .
The <NAME> listened to <NAME> 's discourse , and replied that he should be happy to consider himself the friend and brother of King Emmanuel , and that he would , by the aid of <NAME> , send ambassadors to <NAME> .
[ Illustration : <NAME> 's interview with the <NAME> .
There are certain proverbs of which the force is not affected by change of latitude , and the truth of that one which says , " The days succeed each other and have no similarity , " was proved the next day at <NAME> .
The enthusiasm which had been aroused in the mind of the <NAME> by the ingenious discourse of <NAME> , and the hope it had awakened of the establishment of a profitable trade with <NAME> , vanished at the sight of the presents which were to be given him .
" Twelve pieces of striped cloth , twelve cloaks with scarlet hoods , six hats , and four branches of coral , accompanied by a box containing six large basons , a chest of sugar , and four kegs , two filled with oil , and two with honey , " certainly did not constitute a very magnificent offering .
At sight of it , the prime minister laughed , declaring that the poorest merchant from <NAME> brought richer presents , and that the king would never accept of such ridiculous trifles .
After this affront Gama again visited the <NAME> , but it was only after long waiting in the midst of a mocking crowd , that he was admitted to the presence of the king .
The latter reproached him in a contemptuous manner for having nothing to offer him , while pretending to be the subject of a rich and powerful king .
<NAME> replied with boldness , and produced the letters of <NAME> , which were couched in flattering terms , and contained a formal promise to send merchandise to <NAME> .
The <NAME> , pleased at this prospect , then inquired with interest about the productions and resources of <NAME> , and gave permission to <NAME> to disembark and sell his goods .
But this abrupt change in the humour of the <NAME> was not at all agreeable to the <NAME> and <NAME> traders , whose dealings made the prosperity of <NAME> .
They could not look on quietly whilst foreigners were endeavouring for their own advantage to turn aside the commerce which had been hitherto entirely in their hands ; they resolved , therefore , to leave no stone unturned to drive away once for all these formidable rivals from the shores of <NAME> .
Their first care was to gain the ear of the <NAME> ; then they painted in the blackest colours these insatiable adventurers , these bold robbers , whose only object was to spy out the strength and resources of the town , that they might return in force to pillage it , and to massacre those who should venture to oppose their designs .
Upon arriving at the roadstead of <NAME> , <NAME> found no boat to take him off to the ships , and was forced to sleep on shore .
The <NAME> never left him , continually seeking to prove to him the necessity of bringing the ships nearer to the land ; and when the admiral positively refused to consent to this , he declared him to be his prisoner .
He had very little idea as yet of the firmness of <NAME> 's character .
Some armed boats were sent to surprise the ships , but the <NAME> , having received secret intelligence from the admiral of all that had happened , were on their guard , and their enemies dared not use open force .
<NAME> , still a prisoner , threatened the <NAME> with the anger of the <NAME> , whom he imagined could never thus have violated the duties of hospitality , but seeing that his menaces produced no effect , he tried bribery , presenting the minister with several pieces of stuff , who , thereupon at once altered his demeanour .
" If the <NAME> , " said he , " had but kept the promise they had made to the king , of disembarking their merchandise , the admiral would long ago have returned on board his ships . "
Gama at once sent an order to bring the goods to land , opened a shop for their sale , of which the superintendence was given to <NAME> , brother to the discoverer of the Cape of <NAME> , and was then allowed to go back to his ships .
The <NAME> placed obstacles in the way of the sale of the merchandise by depreciating its value ; <NAME> sent his agent <NAME> to the <NAME> to complain of the perfidy of the <NAME> and of the bad treatment to which he had been subjected , requesting at the same time permission to move his place of sale to <NAME> , where he hoped that the goods would be more easily disposed of .
This request was favourably received , and friendly relations were maintained , in spite of the <NAME> intrigues , until the 10th of <NAME> , 1498 .
On that day <NAME> went to announce <NAME> 's impending departure to the king , reminding him of his promise to send an embassy to <NAME> , and asking him to allow Gama a specimen of each of the productions of the country .
These were to be paid for on the first sale of goods which should take place after the departure of the fleet , it being intended that the employés of the factory should remain at <NAME> during <NAME> 's absence .
The <NAME> , instigated by the <NAME> traders , not only refused to execute his promise , but demanded the payment of 600 _seraphins_ as customs ' duty , ordering at the same time the seizure of the merchandise , and making prisoners of the men employed in the factory .
Such an outrage , such contempt for the rights of nations , called for prompt vengeance , but <NAME> understood the art of dissimulation ; however , on receiving a visit on board from some rich merchants , he detained them , and sent to the <NAME> to demand an exchange of prisoners .
The king 's reply not being sent within the time specified by the admiral , the latter set sail and anchored at the distance of sixteen miles from <NAME> .
After another fruitless attack by the <NAME> , the two agents returned on board , and a portion of the hostages whom <NAME> had secured were given up .
<NAME> brought back with him a curious letter from the <NAME> to the King of <NAME> .
It was written upon a palm leaf , and shall be quoted in all its strange laconicism , so different from the usual grandiloquence of the oriental style : -- " Vasco da Gama , a noble of thy palace , is come into my country which I have permitted .
In my kingdom there is much cinnamon , cloves , and pepper , with many precious stones , and what I desire from thy country is gold , silver , coral , and scarlet .
On the morrow , Mouçaïda the <NAME> of Tunis who had served as interpreter to the <NAME> , and had been a great assistance to them in their negotiations with the <NAME> , came to seek an asylum on board the ships .
The merchandise had not been brought back on the appointed day , and the <NAME> mõr now resolved to carry away with him the men whom he had kept as hostages , but the fleet was becalmed at several miles distance from <NAME> , and was attacked by twenty armed boats , which were with difficulty kept at a distance by the artillery , until they were forced by a violent storm to take shelter under the coast .
The admiral was sailing along the coast of the <NAME> , and had permitted some of the sailors to go on shore to gather fruit and collect cinnamon bark , when he perceived eight boats , which appeared to be coming towards him .
<NAME> recalled the men , and sailed forward to meet the <NAME> , who made the greatest haste to flee from him , but not without leaving a boat laden with cocoa , and provisions , in the hands of the <NAME> .
On arriving at the <NAME> , <NAME> had the <NAME> recalked , and his own ship drawn up on shore for repairs .
The sailors were busy over this work when they were again attacked , but without more success than heretofore .
The next day witnessed the arrival of an individual forty years of age , dressed in <NAME> style , who began to speak to the <NAME> in excellent <NAME> , telling them that he was a native of <NAME> , and had been torn from his country while still young , that he was a <NAME> , but without the possibility of practising his religion .
He was in a high position at the court of the king of the country , who had sent him to them , to place at their disposal all that the country contained which could minister to their comfort .
These offers of service , so different from the welcome accorded to them hitherto , excited the suspicions of the <NAME> , and they were not long in discovering that this adventurer was in command of the boats which had attacked them the day before .
Upon this they had him scourged until he confessed that he had come to discover whether it were possible to attack the fleet with advantage , and he ended by affirming that all the inhabitants of the sea-shore were in league to destroy the <NAME> .
He was retained on board , the work upon the ships was hurried forward , and as soon as water and provisions had been taken in , sail was made for a return to <NAME> .
In consequence of dead calms and contrary winds , the expedition was three months , all but three days , in reaching the <NAME> coast .
During this long voyage the crews suffered terribly from scurvy , and thirty sailors perished .
In each ship , only seven or eight men were in a condition to work the vessel , and very often the officers themselves were forced to lend a hand .
" Whence I can affirm , " says <NAME> , " that if the time in which we sailed across those seas had been prolonged a fortnight , nobody from hence would have navigated them after us ... . And the captains having held a council upon the matter , it was resolved that in case of similar winds catching us again , to return towards <NAME> , there to take refuge . "
On the 2nd of February , 1499 , the <NAME> found themselves at last abreast of a great town on the coast of <NAME> , called <NAME> , distant 300 miles from <NAME> .
<NAME> , dreading another reception like the one given to him at <NAME> , would not stop here , but while passing within sight of the town , ordered a general discharge of the guns .
A few days afterwards the rich and salubrious plains of <NAME> came in sight , and here they cast anchor .
The king hastened to send off fresh provisions and oranges for the invalids on board .
The reception given by him to the <NAME> was in every particular most affectionate , and the friendship which had arisen during <NAME> 's first visit to <NAME> was greatly strengthened .
The <NAME> of <NAME> sent for the King of <NAME> a horn made of ivory and a number of other presents , entreating Gama at the same time to receive a young <NAME> on board his ship , that through him the king might learn how earnestly he desired his friendship .
The five days ' rest at <NAME> was of the greatest benefit to the <NAME> , at its expiration they again set sail .
Soon after passing Mombaz they were obliged to burn the _Sam-Raphael_ , the crews being too much reduced to be able to work three ships .
They discovered the <NAME> of <NAME> , anchored in the <NAME> of Sam-Braz , and on the 20th February , a favourable wind enabled them to double the Cape of <NAME> , when they again found themselves upon the <NAME> .
The breeze remaining favourable , helped forward the return of the mariners , and at the end of twenty-seven days , they had arrived in the neighbourhood of the <NAME> of <NAME> .
On the 25th of April <NAME> , captain of the <NAME> , eager to be the first to carry to Emmanuel the news of the discovery of the <NAME> , separated himself from his chief , and without touching , as had been arranged , at the <NAME> de <NAME> , made sail direct for <NAME> , arriving there on the 10th of July .
During this time the unfortunate Gama was plunged in the most profound sorrow , for his brother , <NAME> da Gama , who had shared his fatigues and sufferings , and who was to be a partaker of his glory , seemed to be slowly dying .
At <NAME> , <NAME> da Gama , now returned to well known and much frequented seas , gave up the command of his ships to <NAME> da <NAME> , and chartered a fast-sailing caravel , to hasten as much as possible his beloved invalid 's return to his native country .
But all hope was vain , and the caravel only arrived at <NAME> in time to inter there the body of the brave and sympathizing <NAME> da Gama .
Upon his arrival in <NAME> , which must have taken place during the early part of September , the admiral was received with stately festivals .
Of the 160 <NAME> whom he had taken with him , fifty-five only returned with him .
The loss was great certainly , but what was it compared with the great advantages to be hoped for ?
The public realized this , and gave the most enthusiastic reception to <NAME> .
The King , <NAME> , added to his own titles that of <NAME> of the conquests and of the navigation of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and the <NAME> ; but he allowed two years to pass before rewarding Gama .
He then bestowed upon him the title of <NAME> of the <NAME> , and authorized him to use the prefix of <NAME> before his name , a privilege then rarely granted .
Also , doubtless to make <NAME> da Gama forget the tardiness with which his services had been rewarded , the king gave him 1000 crowns , a considerable sum for that period , and also conceded to him certain privileges in connexion with the commerce of the <NAME> , which were likely speedily to make his fortune .

On the 9th of March , 1500 , a fleet of thirteen vessels left <NAME> , under the command of <NAME> ; on board , as a volunteer , was <NAME> de <NAME> , who in his poem the " <NAME> , " was to render illustrious the valour and adventurous spirit of his countrymen .
But little is known of <NAME> , and nothing of the reason which had gained him the command of this important expedition .
<NAME> belonged to one of the most illustrious families in <NAME> , and his father , <NAME> , lord of <NAME> da <NAME> , was <NAME> mõr of <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> had married <NAME> de <NAME> , first lady in waiting to the <NAME> , daughter of <NAME> .
If it be asked whether <NAME> had made himself famous by some important maritime discovery , we answer there is no reason to think so , for in that case the historians would have recorded it .
But it is difficult to believe that he owed to court favour alone the command of an expedition in which such men as <NAME> , <NAME> the companion of <NAME> , and <NAME> de <NAME> sailed under his orders .
Why had not this mission been confided to <NAME> , who had been at home for six months , and whose knowledge of the countries to be visited and of the manners of their inhabitants , seemed to point him out as the fittest man for the service ?
Had he not yet recovered from the fatigues of his first voyage ?
Or had his grief for the loss of a brother who had died almost within sight of the coasts of <NAME> so deeply affected him , that he desired to remain in retirement ?
May it not rather have been that King <NAME> was jealous of the fame of <NAME> , and did not wish to give him the opportunity of increasing his renown ?
These are problems which perhaps history may be for ever unable to solve .
It is easy to believe in the realization of those things which we ardently desire .
<NAME> imagined that the <NAME> of <NAME> would not object to the establishment of <NAME> shops and factories in his country , and <NAME> , the bearer of presents of such magnificence as to obliterate the memory of the shabbiness of those offered by <NAME> , received orders to obtain from the <NAME> an interdict , forbidding any Moor to carry on trade in his capital .
The new Capitam mõr was in the first place to visit <NAME> , to offer rich presents to its king , and to restore to him the Moor who had come to <NAME> with <NAME> .
Sixteen friars were sent out on board the fleet , charged to carry the knowledge of the <NAME> to the distant countries of <NAME> .
The fleet had sailed for thirteen days and had passed the <NAME> de <NAME> , when it was discovered that one of the ships , under the command of <NAME> d'Ataïde , was no longer in company .
The rest of the ships lay to for some time to await her , but in vain , and the twelve vessels then continued their navigation upon the open sea , and not , as had been the manner hitherto , steering simply from cape to cape along the shores of <NAME> .
<NAME> hoped by this means to avoid the calms in the Gulf of <NAME> , which had proved so great a cause of delay to the preceding expeditions .
Perhaps even the <NAME> mõr , who must , in common with the rest of his countrymen , have been acquainted with the discoveries of <NAME> , may have had the secret hope , by keeping to the west , of arriving at some region unvisited by the great navigator .
The fact remains , whether it is to be accounted for by a storm or by some secret design , that the fleet was out of the right way for doubling the Cape of <NAME> when , on the 22nd of April , a high mountain was seen , and soon afterwards a long stretch of coast , which received the name of <NAME> , changed afterwards to that of <NAME> .
This was <NAME> , and the point where now stands <NAME> .
On the 28th , after a skilful reconnaissance of the coasts had been made by <NAME> , the <NAME> sailors landed upon the <NAME> shores , and became aware of a delicious mildness of temperature , with a luxuriance of vegetation greatly exceeding anything which they had seen on the coasts of <NAME> or of <NAME> .
The natives formed themselves in groups around the sailors , without showing the least sign of fear .
They were almost naked , and bore upon the wrist a tame parroquet , after the fashion in which the gentlemen of <NAME> carry their hawks or their gerfalcons .
On <NAME> Sunday , the 26th of April , a solemn mass was celebrated on the shore in sight of the <NAME> , whose silence and attitude of respect excited the admiration of the <NAME> .
On the 1st of May a large cross and a padrao were erected on the shore , and <NAME> formally took possession of the country in the name of the King of <NAME> .
His first care after this formality was accomplished was to despatch <NAME> de <NAME> to <NAME> , to announce the discovery of this rich and fertile country .
<NAME> took with him the narrative of the expedition written by <NAME> de <NAME> , and an important astronomical document , the work of <NAME> , in which was doubtless stated the exact situation of the new conquest .
Before setting out for <NAME> , <NAME> put on land two criminals , whom he ordered to ascertain the resources and riches of the country , as well as the manners and customs of the inhabitants .
These wise and far-sighted measures speak much for <NAME> 's prudence and sagacity .
[ Illustration : Cabral takes formal possession of <NAME> . ]
It was the 2nd of May when the fleet lost sight of <NAME> .
All on board , rejoicing over this happy commencement of the voyage , believed in the prospect of an easy and rapid success , when the appearance of a brilliant comet on eight consecutive days struck the ignorant and simple minds of the sailors with terror ; they considered it must be a bad omen , and for this once events appeared to justify superstition .
A fearful storm arose , waves mountains high broke over the ships , whilst the wind blew furiously and rain fell without ceasing .
When the sun at length succeeded in piercing the thick curtain of clouds which almost entirely intercepted his rays , a horrible scene was disclosed .
The water looked thick and black , large patches of a livid white colour flecked the foaming , crested waves , while during the night phosphorescent lights , streaking the immense plain of water , marked out the course of the ships with a train of fire .
For two-and-twenty days , without truce or mercy , the <NAME> ships were battered by the furious elements .
The terrified sailors were utterly prostrate ; they vainly exhausted their prayers and vows , and obeyed the orders of their officers only from the force of habit ; from the first day they had given up any hope of their lives being spared , and only awaited the moment when they should all be submerged .
When light at length returned and the billows became calm , each crew , thinking themselves to be perhaps the sole survivors , looked eagerly over the sea in search of their companions .
Three ships met together again with a joy which the sad reality soon abated .
Eight vessels were missing ; four had been engulfed by a gigantic water-spout during the last days of the storm .
One of these had been commanded by <NAME> , the discoverer of the Cape of <NAME> : he had been drowned by these murderous waves , the defenders , according to <NAME> , of the empire of the east against the nations of the west , who had for so many centuries coveted her marvellous riches .
During this long series of storms the <NAME> had been doubled and the fleet was approaching the coast of <NAME> .
On the 20th of July <NAME> was signalled .
The Moors of this place showed a more agreeable disposition than they had done when <NAME> was there , and furnished the <NAME> with two pilots , who conducted them to <NAME> , an island famed for the trade in gold-dust which was carried on with <NAME> .
There Cabral found two of the missing ships , which had been driven to this island by the wind .
A plot was on foot in <NAME> for a wholesale massacre of the <NAME> , but this was frustrated by a prompt departure from the island , and the ships arrived at <NAME> without any untoward incident .
The stay of the fleet in this port was the occasion of fêtes and rejoicings without number , and soon , revictualled , repaired , and furnished with excellent pilots , the <NAME> vessels sailed for <NAME> , where they arrived on the 13th of December , 1500 .
This time , thanks to the power of their arms as well as to the richness of the presents offered to the <NAME> , the reception was different , and the versatile prince agreed to all the demands of <NAME> : namely , a monopoly of the trade in aromatics and spicery , and the right of seizure upon all vessels which should infringe this privilege .
For some time the Moors dissembled their resentment , but when they had succeeded in thoroughly exasperating the population against the foreigners , they rushed at a given signal into the factory which was under the direction of <NAME> , and massacred fifty of the <NAME> , whom they surprised in it .
<NAME> for this outrage was not slow ; ten boats moored in the port were taken , pillaged , and burnt before the eyes of the <NAME> , who were powerless to render opposition ; afterwards the town was bombarded , and was half-buried under its ruins .
When this affair was concluded , <NAME> , continuing the exploration of the <NAME> coast , arrived at <NAME> , where the <NAME> , a vassal of the <NAME> , hastened to conclude an alliance with the <NAME> , eagerly seizing this opportunity to declare himself independent .
Although by this time his fleet was richly laden , <NAME> made a visit to <NAME> , where he entered into a treaty with the <NAME> of the country ; then , being impatient to return home , he set sail for <NAME> .
While coasting along that shore of <NAME> , which is washed by the <NAME> , he discovered <NAME> , a place which had escaped the observation of <NAME> .
On the 13th of July , 1501 , <NAME> arrived at <NAME> , where he had the joy of finding the two remaining ships which he had imagined to be lost .
It is pleasant to believe that he received the welcome merited by the important results obtained in this memorable expedition .
Although contemporary historians are silent upon the incidents of his life after his return , recent research has been rewarded by the discovery of his tomb at <NAME> , and M. Ferdinand <NAME> has happily proved that , like <NAME> da Gama , he received the title of <NAME> as a reward for his glorious deeds .
Whilst he was returning to <NAME> Alvarès Cabral might have encountered a fleet of four caravels under the command of <NAME> da Nova , which King <NAME> had despatched to give fresh vigour to the commercial relations which <NAME> had been charged to establish in the Indies .
This new expedition doubled the Cape of <NAME> without misadventure , discovered between <NAME> and <NAME> an unknown island , which was named after the commander of the fleet , and arrived at <NAME> , where <NAME> was informed of the events which had taken place at <NAME> .
He felt that he had not forces at his disposal sufficient to justify him in going to punish the <NAME> , and not wishing to endanger the prestige of <NAME> arms by the risk of a reverse , he steered for <NAME> and <NAME> , of which the kings , although tributaries of the <NAME> , had entered into alliance with <NAME> .
Da <NAME> had already taken on board 1000 hundredweights of pepper , 50 of ginger , and 450 of cinnamon , when he received warning that a considerable fleet , coming apparently from <NAME> , was advancing with hostile intentions .
If he had hitherto been more concerned with trade than with war , he did not the less in these critical circumstances display a bold and courageous spirit worthy of his predecessors .
He accepted the combat , notwithstanding the apparent superiority of the <NAME> , and partly by the skilful arrangements which he made , partly by the power of his guns , he managed to disperse , to take , or to sink the hostile vessels .
Perhaps Da Nova ought to have profited by the terror which his victory had spread along the coast , and the temporary exhaustion of the <NAME> resources , to strike a great blow by the taking of <NAME> .
But we are too far removed in time from the events , and know too little of their details , to appreciate with impartiality the reasons which induced the admiral to return immediately to <NAME> .
It was during this latter part of his voyage that <NAME> discovered the small island of <NAME> in the midst of the <NAME> .
A curious story attaches to this discovery .
A certain <NAME> had followed <NAME> to the <NAME> ; this man , wishing to marry a <NAME> , was forced for this purpose to renounce <NAME> and become a <NAME> .
Upon <NAME> 's visit , having had enough either of his wife or of her religion , he begged to be taken back to his country , and returned to his old creed .
Upon arriving at <NAME> , <NAME> , in obedience to a sudden idea , which he regarded as an inspiration from on high , requested to be landed there , in order , as he said , to expiate his detestable apostasy and to atone for it by his devotion to humanity .
His will appeared so fixed that <NAME> was forced to consent , and he left him there , having given him at his request various seeds of fruits and vegetables .
It must be added that this singular hermit worked for four years at the clearing and planting of the island with such success , that ships were soon able to call there to revictual during their long passage from <NAME> to the Cape of <NAME> .
The successive expeditious of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> had conclusively proved that an uninterrupted commerce must not be reckoned upon , nor a continued exchange of merchandise , with the population of the <NAME> , who , while their own independence and liberty were respected had each time leagued together against the <NAME> .
That trade with <NAME> which they so persistently refused , must be forced upon them , and for that purpose permanent military establishments must be formed , capable of overawing the malcontents , and even in case of necessity of taking possession of the country .
But to whom should such an important mission be entrusted ?
The choice could scarcely be doubtful , and <NAME> da Gama was unanimously chosen to take the command of the powerful armament which was in preparation .
<NAME> had ten ships under his own immediate command , while his second brother <NAME> da Gama , and his cousin <NAME> , had each five ships under his orders , but they were both to recognise <NAME> da Gama as their chief .
The ceremonies which preceded the departure of the fleet from <NAME> were of a particularly grave and solemn character .
King <NAME> , followed by the whole court , repaired to the cathedral in the midst of an enormous crowd , and there called down blessings from heaven upon this expedition , partly religious , partly military , while the <NAME> blessed the banner which was entrusted to <NAME> .
The admiral 's first care was to visit <NAME> and <NAME> , towns of which he had had reason to complain in the course of his first voyage .
Being anxious to establish harbours for refuge , and revictualling of ships , he established there merchants ' offices , and laid the foundations of forts .
He also levied a heavy tribute upon the <NAME> of <NAME> , and then sailed for the coast of <NAME> .
When <NAME> had arrived off <NAME> , he perceived on the 3rd of October a vessel of large tonnage , which appeared to him to be richly laden .
It was the _Merii_ bringing back from <NAME> a great number of pilgrims belonging to all the countries of <NAME> .
<NAME> attacked the ship without provocation , captured her and put to death more than three hundred men who were on board .
<NAME> children alone were saved and taken to <NAME> , where they were baptized , and entered the army of <NAME> .
This frightful massacre , besides being quite in accordance with the ideas of the period , was calculated according to <NAME> , to strike terror into the <NAME> mind : it did nothing of the sort .
This hateful and useless cruelty has left a stain of blood upon the hitherto pure fame of the admiral .
[ Illustration : Map of the Coasts of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> . ]
As soon as he arrived at <NAME> , <NAME> obtained an audience of the <NAME> , who authorized him to establish a counting-house , and to build a fort .
At the same time a treaty of alliance , offensive and defensive was concluded .
After setting the labourers to work , and installing his agent , the admiral set sail for <NAME> , where he intended to summon the <NAME> to a reckoning for his disloyalty , as well as for the murder of the <NAME> who had been surprised in the factory .
Although the <NAME> of <NAME> had been informed of the arrival in the Indies of his formidable enemies , he had taken no military precautions , and thus , when <NAME> presented himself before the town , he was able to seize some vessels anchored in the port and to make a hundred prisoners , without encountering any resistance ; afterwards he granted the Zamorin a respite of four days , in which to make atonement to the <NAME> for the murder of <NAME> , and to refund the value of the merchandise which had been stolen on that occasion .
The time specified had scarcely elapsed when the bodies of fifty of the prisoners were strung up at the yard-arms of the vessels , where they remained exposed to the view of the town during the whole day .
In the evening the feet and hands of these expiatory victims were cut off and taken on shore , with a letter from the admiral , declaring that his vengeance would not be limited to this execution .
Accordingly , under cover of the night , the broadsides of the vessels were brought to bear upon the town , which was bombarded for the space of three days .
It will never be known what was the exact number of the slain , but it must have been considerable .
Without reckoning those killed by the fire of the cannon and the muskets , a great number of <NAME> were buried beneath the ruins of the buildings , or perished in the conflagration , which destroyed a portion of the town of <NAME> .
The <NAME> had been one of the first to take flight , and fortunate was it for him that he had done so , for his palace was amongst the buildings which were demolished .
At length , satisfied with having transformed this heretofore rich and populous city into a heap of ruins , and considering his vengeance satiated , and that the lesson so taught would be profitable , <NAME> set sail for <NAME> , leaving behind him Vincent Sodrez , with several ships , to continue the blockade .
<NAME> , the sovereign of <NAME> , informed the admiral that he had been eagerly solicited by the <NAME> to take advantage of the confidence reposed in him by the <NAME> , to surprise and seize them , in consequence of which intelligence , and to reward the integrity of the king whose loyalty had exposed him to the enmity of the <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> , when starting for <NAME> with a valuable cargo , left with <NAME> ships sufficient to enable him to await in safety the arrival of another squadron .
During <NAME> 's return voyage the only noteworthy incident that occurred was the defeat of another <NAME> fleet .
The admiral arrived in <NAME> on the 20th of Once more the eminent services rendered by this great man went unrecognised , or rather they were not appreciated as they deserved .
<NAME> , who had just laid the foundations of the colonial empire of <NAME> in <NAME> , remained for one and twenty years without employment , and it was only through the intercession of the <NAME> of <NAME> , that he obtained the title of <NAME> de Vidigueyra .
A too common instance this of ingratitude , but one which it is never _mal à propos_ to stigmatize as it deserves .
Scarcely had <NAME> set out for <NAME> , before the <NAME> at the instigation of the <NAME> , who saw their commercial supremacy more and more compromised , assembled his allies at <NAME> with the object of attacking the King of <NAME> and of punishing him for the counsel and assistance which he had given to the <NAME> .
The unfortunate <NAME> 's fidelity was now put to a hard proof .
Besieged in his capital by a large force , he saw himself all at once deprived of the aid of those for whose advantage he had incurred so great a risk .
<NAME> and several of his captains had deserted the post , where both honour and gratitude required them to remain , and if need were , to die in the discharge of their duty ; they forsook <NAME> to go and cruise in the neighbourhood of <NAME> , and at the entrance to the <NAME> , where they calculated that the annual pilgrimage to <NAME> was likely to ensure them some rich booty .
The <NAME> agent vainly represented to them the unworthiness of their conduct , they set out in haste , to escape from these inconvenient reproaches .
The King of <NAME> , betrayed by some of the <NAME> ( military nobles ) of his palace , who had been gained over by the <NAME> , soon saw his capital carried by assault , and was obliged to seek refuge upon an inaccessible rock in the little <NAME> of <NAME> , with those Portuguese who had remained faithful to him .
When he was reduced to the last extremity , an emissary was sent to him by the <NAME> , to promise him pardon and oblivion of his offences if he would give up to him the <NAME> .
But <NAME> , whose fidelity can not be sufficiently commended , answered , " that the <NAME> might use his rights of victory ; that he was not ignorant of the perils by which he was menaced , but that it was not in the power of any man to make him a traitor and a perjurer . "
No one could have made a nobler return than this for the desertion and cowardice of <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> had arrived at the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb , when a fearful tempest occurred , in which his ship split upon the rocks , and he and his brother perished .
The survivors regarded this event as a judgment of <NAME> for their bad conduct , and they made haste , with all sails set to return to <NAME> .
They were detained by contrary winds at the <NAME> , and were there joined by another <NAME> squadron under the command of <NAME> d'Albuquerque , who had sailed from <NAME> almost at the same time as his cousin <NAME> d'Albuquerque the most distinguished captain of the period , who with the title of <NAME> mõr had started from <NAME> at the beginning of April , 1503 .
The arrival of <NAME> d'Albuquerque placed the <NAME> affairs , which had been so gravely compromised by the criminal conduct of <NAME> , upon a better footing , and at the same time effected the rescue of <NAME> , their sole and faithful ally .
The besiegers fled at the sight of the <NAME> squadron , without even a show of resistance , and the Europeans in conjunction with the troops of the King of <NAME> ravaged the <NAME> .
As a consequence of these events , <NAME> allowed his allies to construct a second fortress in his dominions , and authorised an augmentation of the number and importance of their mercantile houses .
This was the moment that witnessed the arrival of <NAME> d'Albuquerque , the man destined to be the real creator of the <NAME> Empire in the Indies .
<NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , had prepared the way , but <NAME> was the leader of large views who was needed to determine which were the principal towns that must be seized in order to place the <NAME> dominion upon a solid and lasting basis .
Thus every particular of the history of this man who showed so great a genius for colonisation , is of the deepest interest , and it is well worth while to record some particulars of his family , his education , and his early exploits .
<NAME> d'Alboquerque or d'Albuquerque , was born in 1453 at <NAME> , eighteen miles from <NAME> .
Through his father <NAME> d'Albuquerque , the <NAME> of <NAME> , he was descended , but illegitimately , from King Diniz ; and through his mother from the <NAME> , the great explorers .
Brought up at the court of <NAME> , he there received as liberal and thorough an education as was possible at the period .
He made an especial study of the great writers of antiquity , whose influence may be traced in the majesty and accuracy of his own style , and of mathematics of which he knew as much as could be learnt at that time .
After staying for some years at <NAME> , an <NAME> town which was under the dominion of <NAME> , he returned to <NAME> , and was appointed <NAME> of the Horse to <NAME> , a prince whose chief anxiety was to extend the name and power of <NAME> beyond the seas .
It is evident that it was to the constant attendance upon the king imposed upon him by the duties of his office , that <NAME> owed the inclination of his mind towards geographical studies , and his anxious desire to find the means of giving to his country the <NAME> of the <NAME> .
He had already taken part in an expedition sent to the succour of the King of <NAME> against an incursion of the <NAME> , and in 1489 , had been charged with the commission of revictualling and defending the fortress of <NAME> , upon the coast of <NAME> .
We must now return from this digression and take up the history of <NAME> , from the time of his arrival in <NAME> in 1503 .
It took him but a few days to become thoroughly aware of the position of affairs ; he perceived that the commerce of <NAME> must depend upon conquest for its power of development .
But his first enterprise was proportioned to the feebleness of his resources ; he laid siege to <NAME> , which he wished to make a military station for his countrymen , and then with two ships he undertook a reconnaissance of the coast of <NAME> .
Being attacked quite unexpectedly both by land and sea , he was on the point of yielding when the fortunate arrival of his cousin <NAME> turned the combat , and put the <NAME> 's troops to flight .
The importance of this victory was considerable ; the conquerors remained masters of an immense booty and quantities of precious stones , which had the result of stimulating the <NAME> spirit of covetousness ; at the same time it confirmed <NAME> in his designs , for the execution of which the consent of the king was needful , and also more considerable resources .
He therefore set out on his return to <NAME> , where he arrived in <NAME> , 1504 .
This same year , King Emmanuel wishing to organize a regular government in the <NAME> , had made <NAME> da Cunha his viceroy , but <NAME> having become temporarily blind was obliged to resign his power before he had exercised it .
The king 's choice next fell upon <NAME> d'Almeida , who set out with his son in 1505 .
It will be soon seen what were the means which he considered should be employed to assure the triumph of his countrymen .
On the 6th of March , 1506 , sixteen vessels left <NAME> under the command of <NAME> da <NAME> , who had by that time regained his health .
With him went <NAME> , carrying with him , but unknown to himself , his patent of <NAME> of <NAME> .
He was ordered not to open the sealed packet until three years should have expired , when <NAME> would have completed the term of his mission .
This numerous fleet , after having stopped at the <NAME> de <NAME> and discovered <NAME> in <NAME> , steered directly for the unexplored parts of the <NAME> , and went so far south that the old chroniclers assert that several sailors being too lightly clad died from cold , while the others were scarcely able to work the ships .
In 37 degrees 8 minutes south latitude , and 14 degrees 21 minutes west longitude , <NAME> discovered three small uninhabited islands , of which the largest still bears his name .
A storm prevented a landing there , and so completely dispersed the fleet that the admiral could not get his vessels together again before he arrived at <NAME> .
In sailing along this <NAME> coast he explored the island of <NAME> or Sam-Lorenzo , which had just been discovered by <NAME> , who was in command of eight vessels which <NAME> was sending back to <NAME> ; it was not thought advisable to make a settlement upon the island .
After having wintered at <NAME> , <NAME> landed three ambassadors at <NAME> , who were to reach <NAME> by travelling overland , then he anchored at <NAME> , which <NAME> , one of his lieutenants had been unable to subjugate .
The <NAME> now laid siege to this town , which resisted bravely but which yielded in the end , thanks to the courage of the enemy and the perfection of their arms .
The population was massacred without mercy , and the town pillaged and burnt .
Upon <NAME> , another town on the <NAME> , <NAME> tried but in vain , to impose his authority .
The strength of the town and the stubborn resolution shown by the numerous population as well as the approach of winter forced him to raise the siege .
He then turned his arms against <NAME> , at the entrance of the Gulf of <NAME> , where he carried the fortress .
The whole of the garrison were put to the sword , the only man spared being an old blind soldier , who was discovered hidden in a well .
When asked how he had been able to get down there , he answered , -- " The blind only see the road which leads to liberty . "
At <NAME> , the two <NAME> chiefs constructed the fort of <NAME> , intended by <NAME> to command the Gulf of <NAME> and the <NAME> , by the <NAME> of Bab-el-Mandeb , thus cutting one of the lines of communication with the Indies , which was the most used by the Venetians .
Here Da Cunha and <NAME> separated , the former going to <NAME> to obtain a cargo of spices , the latter officially invested with the title of <NAME> mõr , and bent on the realization of his vast schemes , setting out on the 10th of <NAME> , 1507 , for <NAME> , having left his nephew Alfonzo da <NAME> in charge of the new fortress .
He took in succession , and as if to get his hand in for the work , <NAME> , where were found immense stores , <NAME> and <NAME> , which he gave up to pillage , fire , and destruction , in order to avenge a series of acts of treachery easily understood by those who know the duplicity of these eastern people .
The success which he had just gained at <NAME> , important as it was , did not content <NAME> .
He dreamed of other and grander projects , of which the execution was , however , much compromised by the jealousy of the captains under his orders , and notably of <NAME> da Nova , who contemplated abandoning his chief , and whom <NAME> was obliged to place under arrest on board his own ship .
After having suppressed these beginnings of disobedience and rebellion , the <NAME> mõr reached <NAME> , which was taken after a vigorous resistance .
It is a curious fact that <NAME> had long heard <NAME> spoken of , but that as yet he was ignorant of its position .
He knew that this town served as an entrepôt for all the merchandise passing from <NAME> into <NAME> .
Its riches and power , the number of its inhabitants and the beauty of its monuments were at that time celebrated throughout the <NAME> , so much so that there was a common saying , " If the world be a ring , <NAME> is the precious stone set in it . "
<NAME> had resolved to take this town , not only because in itself it was a prize worth having , but also because it commanded the whole of the <NAME> , which was the second of the great commercial roads between the <NAME> and <NAME> .
Without saying anything to the captains of his fleet , who , without doubt , would have rebelled at the idea of attacking so strong a town , and the capital of a powerful empire , <NAME> gave orders to double <NAME> , and the fleet soon entered the <NAME> of <NAME> , the door of the <NAME> , from whence was seen rising in all its magnificence a busy town built upon a rocky island , provided with formidable artillery , and protected by an army amounting to not less than from fifteen to twenty thousand men , while its harbour enclosed a fleet more numerous than could have been suspected at first sight .
At this sight the captains made urgent representations upon the danger that <NAME> would run in attacking so well-prepared a town , and made the most of the plea how very bad an influence a reverse would exercise .
To this discourse <NAME> answered , that indeed " it was a very great affair , but that it was too late to draw back , and that he had greater need of determination than of good advice . "
Scarcely was the anchor dropped before <NAME> declared his ultimatum .
Although the forces under his orders were very disproportionate in numbers , the <NAME> mõr imperiously demanded that <NAME> should recognize the suzerainty of the King of <NAME> and submit to his envoy , if it did not wish to share the same fate as <NAME> .
The King , Seif-Ed-din , who was then reigning over <NAME> , was still a child , and his Prime Minister , Kodja-Atar , a skilful and cunning diplomatist , governed in the king 's name .
Without denying in principle the pretensions of <NAME> , the Prime Minister wished to gain time , to allow contingents to arrive for the help of the capital ; but the admiral , who guessed his object , did not hesitate , after waiting three days , to attack the formidable fleet at anchor under the guns of <NAME> , with his five vessels and the <NAME> la <NAME> , the finest and largest ship of that time .
The combat was bloody and long undecided , but when they saw fortune was against them the <NAME> , abandoning their vessels , endeavoured to swim on shore .
The <NAME> upon this jumped into their boats , pursuing the Moors vigorously , and causing horrible carnage .
<NAME> next directed his efforts against a large wooden jetty defended by numerous guns and by archers , whose well-aimed arrows wounded a number of the <NAME> and the general himself , who , however , was not hindered thereby from landing and proceeding to burn the suburbs of the town .
Convinced that resistance would soon be impossible , and that their capital was in danger of being destroyed , the Moors hoisted a flag of truce , and signed a treaty , by which Seif-Ed-din declared himself the vassal of King Emmanuel , promised to pay him an annual tribute of 15,000 seraphins or xarafins , and gave to the conquerors a site for a fortress , which , in spite of the repugnance and reproaches of the <NAME> captains , was soon put into a condition of resistance .
Unfortunately some deserters quickly brought these unworthy dissensions to the knowledge of Kodja-Atar , who profited by them to avoid , under various pretexts , fulfilling the execution of the articles of the new treaty .
Some days afterwards <NAME> da <NAME> and two other captains , jealous of the successes of <NAME> , and trampling in the dust every sentiment of honour , discipline , and patriotism , left him to go to the <NAME> ; while <NAME> was obliged by this cowardly desertion to withdraw without being able even to guard the fortress which he had been at so much pains to construct .
He went to <NAME> , where the garrison was in need of help , and then returned to cruise before <NAME> , but thinking himself too weak to undertake anything , he retired for a time to <NAME> , arriving there at the end of the year 1508 .
What had been occurring on the <NAME> coast during this long and adventurous campaign ?
The answer may be summed up in a few lines .
It will be remembered that <NAME> had set out from <NAME> in 1505 with a fleet of twenty-two sail , carrying soldiers to the number of 1500 men .
First he seized <NAME> and then <NAME> , of which the " cavaliers , as the inhabitants loved to repeat , did not yield as easily as the chicken hearts of <NAME> . "
Out of the enormous booty , which by the fall of this town fell into the hands of the <NAME> , <NAME> only took one arrow as his share of the spoil , thus giving a rare example of disinterestedness .
After having stopped at Melinda he went on to <NAME> , where he delivered to the Rajah the golden crown sent to him by <NAME> , whilst he himself , with the presumptuous vanity of which he gave so many proofs , assumed the title of viceroy .
Then , after commencing a fortress at <NAME> , destined to overawe the <NAME> of that coast , <NAME> and his son , <NAME> , scoured the <NAME> , destroying the <NAME> fleets , capturing some trading vessels , and causing great injury to the enemy , whose accustomed commercial roads were thus intercepted .
But for this cruising warfare a numerous fleet of light vessels was needed , for there was scarcely any other harbour of refuge except <NAME> upon the <NAME> coast .
How preferable was <NAME> 's system of establishing himself in the country in a permanent manner , by constructing fortresses in all directions , by seizing upon the most powerful cities , whence it was easy to branch off into the interior of the country , by rendering himself master of the keys of the straits , and thus ensuring with much less risk , and more solidity , the monopoly of the <NAME> commerce .
Meantime the victories of <NAME> , and the conquests of <NAME> had much disquieted the <NAME> of <NAME> .
The abandonment of the <NAME> route caused a great diminution in the amount of imposts and dues of customs , anchorage , and transit , which were laid upon the merchandise of <NAME> as it passed through his states .
Therefore , with the help of the Venetians , who furnished him with the wood for ship-building as well as with skilful sailors , he fitted out a squadron of twelve large ships , which came as far as <NAME> , seeking the fleet of <NAME> d'Almeida , and defeating it in a bloody combat in which <NAME> was killed .
If the sorrow of the viceroy were great at this sad news , at least he did not let it appear outwardly , but set to work to make all preparations for taking prompt vengeance upon the <NAME> , -- an appellation which shows the lasting terror attaching to the name of the <NAME> , and commonly used at this time upon the <NAME> coast , for all Mussulman soldiers coming from <NAME> .
With nineteen sail <NAME> appeared before the fort where his son had been killed , and gained a great victory , but one sullied , it must be confessed , by most frightful cruelties , so much so that it soon became a common saying : " May the anger of the <NAME> fall upon thee as it fell upon <NAME> . "
Not content with this first success , <NAME> , some weeks later , annihilated the combined forces of the <NAME> of <NAME> , and the <NAME> of <NAME> , before Diu .
This victory made a profound impression in <NAME> , and put an end to the power of the _Mahumetists_ of <NAME> .
<NAME> da <NAME> and the other captains , who had abandoned <NAME> before <NAME> , had decided to rejoin <NAME> ; they had excused their disobedience by calumnies , in consequence of which a judicial process was about to be instituted against <NAME> , when the viceroy received the news of his being replaced in his office by <NAME> .
At first <NAME> declared that obedience must be rendered to this sovereign decree , but afterwards influenced by the traitors , who feared that they would be severely punished when the power had passed into the hands of <NAME> , he repaired to <NAME> in the month of March , 1509 , with the fixed determination not to give up the command to his successor .
There were disagreeable and painful disputes between these two great men , in which all the wrong done was on the side of <NAME> .
<NAME> was about to be sent to <NAME> with chains on his feet , when a fleet of fifteen sail entered the harbour , under the command of the grand Marshal of <NAME> , <NAME> .
The latter took the part of the prisoner , whom he immediately released , notifying again to Almeida the powers held by <NAME> from the king , and threatening him with the great anger of <NAME> if he refused to obey .
<NAME> could do nothing but yield , and he then did it nobly .
As for <NAME> da <NAME> , the author of these sad misunderstandings , he died some time afterwards , forsaken by everybody , and had scarcely any one to follow him to the grave except the new viceroy , who thus generously forgot the injuries done to <NAME> .
Immediately after the departure of <NAME> , the grand <NAME> declared that , having come to <NAME> with the intention of destroying <NAME> , he intended to turn to account the absence of the <NAME> from his capital .
In vain the new viceroy endeavoured to modify his zeal and induce him to take the wise measures recommended by experience .
<NAME> would listen to nothing , and <NAME> was obliged to follow him .
<NAME> , taken by surprise , was easily set on fire ; but the <NAME> , having lingered to pillage the <NAME> 's palace , were fiercely attacked in rear by the <NAME> , who had succeeded in rallying their troops .
<NAME> , whose impetuous valour led him into the greatest danger , was killed , and it required all the skill and coolness of the viceroy to effect a re-embarkation of the troops under the enemy 's fire , and to preserve the soldiers of the King of <NAME> from total destruction .
On his return to <NAME> , a sea-port which was a dependency of the King of <NAME> , with whom the <NAME> had been able to form an alliance , <NAME> learnt that <NAME> , the capital of a powerful kingdom , was a prey to political and religious anarchy .
Several chiefs were contending there for power .
One of them , <NAME> , was just on the point of seizing the throne , and it was important to profit by the circumstances of the moment , and attack the town before he should have been able to gather a force capable of resisting the <NAME> .
The viceroy perceived all the importance of this counsel .
The situation of <NAME> , giving access as it did to the kingdom of <NAME> and to the <NAME> , had already struck him forcibly .
He did not delay , and soon the <NAME> reckoned one conquest more .
Goa the <NAME> , a cosmopolitan town , where were mingled with all the various sects of <NAME> , the worshippers of <NAME> , and even some Christians , submitted to <NAME> , and soon became , under a wise and strict government which understood how to conciliate the sympathies of opposing sects , the capital , the chief fortress , and the principal seat of trade of the <NAME> empire of the <NAME> .
By degrees and with the course of years the knowledge of these rich countries had increased .
<NAME> information had been gathered together by all those who had ploughed these sunny seas in their gallant vessels , and it was now known what was the centre of production of those spices which people went so far to seek , and for whose acquisition they encountered so many perils .
It was already several years since <NAME> had founded the first <NAME> factories in <NAME> , the ancient Taprobane .
The <NAME> of <NAME> , and the <NAME> of <NAME> , were now exciting the desires of King Emmanuel , who had already been surnamed " the fortunate . "
He resolved to send a fleet to explore them , for <NAME> had enough to do in <NAME> to restrain the trembling <NAME> , and the <NAME> -- Moors as they were then called -- who were always ready to shake off the yoke .
This new expedition was under the command of <NAME> , and according to the traditional policy of the <NAME> , was at first amicably received at <NAME> ; but when the suspicions of <NAME> had been lulled to sleep by reiterated protestations of alliance , the whole population suddenly rose against him , and he was forced to return on board , but not without leaving thirty of his companions in the hands of the <NAME> .
These events had already happened some time when the news of the taking of <NAME> arrived at <NAME> .
The _bendarra_ , or Minister of <NAME> , who exercised regal power in the name of his nephew who was still a child , fearing the vengeance which the <NAME> would doubtless exact for his treachery , resolved to pacify them .
He went to visit his prisoners , excused himself to them by swearing that all had been done unknown to him and against his will , for he desired nothing so much as to see the <NAME> establish themselves in <NAME> ; also he was about to order the authors of the treason to be sought out and punished .
The prisoners naturally gave no credence to these lying declarations , but profiting by the comparative liberty which was henceforth granted to them , they cleverly succeeded in conveying to <NAME> some valuable information upon the position and strength of the town .
<NAME> with much trouble collected a fleet of nineteen men of war , carrying fourteen hundred men , amongst whom there were only eight hundred <NAME> .
This being the case , ought he to venture in obedience to the wish of King <NAME> to steer for <NAME> , the key of the <NAME> , which it was important to master in preparation for opposing the passage of a new squadron , which the <NAME> of <NAME> was intending to send to <NAME> ?
<NAME> hesitated , when a change in the trade-winds occurred which put an end to his irresolution .
In fact , it was impossible to reach <NAME> in the teeth of the prevailing wind , while it was favourable for a descent upon <NAME> .
This town , at that time in its full splendour , did not contain less than 100,000 inhabitants .
If many of the houses were built of wood , and roofed with the leaves of the palm-tree , yet they were equalled in number by the more important buildings , such as mosques and towers built of stone , which stretched out in a long panorama for the distance of three miles .
The ships of <NAME> , <NAME> , and of the <NAME> kingdoms of the <NAME> , met in its harbour , where numerous vessels coming from the <NAME> coast , the <NAME> , the <NAME> , and the coast of <NAME> traded in merchandise of all kinds and of every country .
When the <NAME> of <NAME> saw the <NAME> fleet arrive in his waters , he felt that it was necessary to appear to give satisfaction to the foreigners by sacrificing the minister who had excited their anger and caused their arrival .
His ambassador therefore came to the viceroy to announce the death of the _bendarra_ , and to find out what were the intentions of the <NAME> .
<NAME> answered by demanding the prisoners who had remained in the hands of the <NAME> , but the latter , desirous of gaining time to allow for the expected change in the trade-wind , -- a change which would force the <NAME> to regain the <NAME> coast , or else would oblige them to remain at <NAME> , where he hoped to be able to exterminate them , -- invented a thousand pretexts for delay , and in the meantime according to the old narratives , he prepared a battery of 8000 cannon , and collected troops to the number of 20,000 .
At length <NAME> lost his patience , and ordered some houses and several Gujerat vessels to be set on fire , a beginning of execution which speedily brought about the restoration of the prisoners ; he then claimed 20,000 crusades as indemnity for the damage caused to the fleet of <NAME> , and finally he demanded to be allowed to build a fortress within the town itself , which should also serve as a counting-house for the merchants .
This demand could not be complied with as <NAME> well knew ; but upon the refusal he resolved to seize the town , fixing upon <NAME> <NAME> ' day for the attack .
The town was taken quarter by quarter , house by house , after a truly heroic struggle and a most vigorous defence , which lasted for nine whole days , notwithstanding the employment of extraordinary devices , such as elephants of war , poisoned sabres and arrows , barricades , and skilfully concealed troops .
An enormous booty was divided amongst the soldiers , <NAME> only reserving to himself six lions , of gold according to some accounts , of iron according to others , which he intended for the adornment of his tomb , to perpetuate the memory of his victory .
The door which gave access to <NAME> , and to <NAME> , was henceforth open .
Many nations unknown till this time would now have intercourse with <NAME> .
The strange manners and fabulous history of many people were about to be disclosed to the astonished <NAME> .
A new era had commenced , and these great results were due to the unbridled audacity , and indomitable courage of a nation whose country was scarcely discernible upon the map of the world !
It was in part owing to the religious toleration which <NAME> displayed , a toleration which contrasts strangely with the cruel fanaticism of the <NAME> , and in part to the skilful measures which he took , that the prosperity of <NAME> resisted the rude shock which it had received .
In the course of a few months no trace remained of the trials which the town had experienced , except the sight of the <NAME> banner floating proudly over this great city , which had now become the head and vanguard of the colonial empire of this people , small in numbers , but rendered great by their courage and their spirit of enterprise .
<NAME> and wonderful as this new conquest might be , it had not made <NAME> forget his former projects .
If he had appeared to have renounced them , it was only because circumstances had not hitherto seemed favourable for their execution .
With that tenacity of determination which formed the basis of his character , while still at the southern extremity of the empire which he was founding , his thoughts were fixed upon the northern part of it , upon <NAME> , which the jealousy and treachery of his subordinates had obliged him to abandon at the beginning of his career , at the very moment when success was about to crown his persevering efforts ; it was <NAME> which tempted him still .
[ Illustration : The <NAME> of <NAME> . ]
The fame of his exploits and the terror inspired by his name had decided Kodja-Atar to make some advances to <NAME> , to ask for a treaty , and to send the arrears of the tribute which had been formerly imposed .
Although the viceroy placed no belief on these repeated declarations of friendship -- on that <NAME> faith which deserves to be as notorious as <NAME> faith , -- he nevertheless welcomed them , whilst waiting for the power to establish his dominion after a permanent manner in these countries .
In 1513 or 1514 -- the exact date is not ascertained -- when his fleet and soldiers were set at liberty by the conquest of <NAME> and the tranquillity of his other possessions , <NAME> set sail for the <NAME> .
Immediately upon his arrival , although a series of revolutions had changed the government of <NAME> and the power was then in the hands of a usurper named Rais-Nordim or <NAME> , <NAME> demanded that the fortress , which had been formerly begun , should be immediately placed in his hands .
After having had it repaired and finished , he took part against the pretender <NAME> , in the quarrel which was then dividing the town of <NAME> and preparing it to fall under the dominion of <NAME> .
He seized upon the town and bestowed it upon the aspirant who had accepted his conditions beforehand , and who appeared to <NAME> to present the most solid guarantees of submission and fidelity .
Besides , it would not be difficult in the future to make this certain , for <NAME> left in the new fortress a garrison perfectly able to bring Rais-Nordim to repentance for the slightest attempt at revolt , or the least desire of independence .
A well-known anecdote is related of this expedition to <NAME> , but one which , even from its notoriety , we should be blamed for omitting .
When the King of <NAME> sent to <NAME> to demand the tribute which the sovereigns of <NAME> had been in the habit of paying to him , <NAME> gave orders that a quantity of bullets , cannon-balls and shells , should be brought from his ships , and showing them to the ambassadors he told them that such was the coin in which the King of <NAME> was accustomed to pay tribute .
It does not appear that the <NAME> ambassadors repeated their demand .
[ Illustration : <NAME> had a quantity of bullets brought from his vessels . ]
With his usual wisdom , the viceroy did not wound the feelings of the inhabitants , who speedily returned to the town .
Far from squeezing all he could from them , as his successors were destined soon to do , he established an upright system of government which caused the <NAME> name to be loved and respected .
At the same time that he was himself accomplishing these marvellous labours , <NAME> had desired some of his lieutenants to explore the unknown regions to which access had been given by the taking of <NAME> .
For this purpose he gave to <NAME> and <NAME> d'Abreu the command of a small squadron carrying 220 men , with which they explored the whole of the <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , & c. ; then being not far from the coast of <NAME> they sailed back again to the north and arrived at the <NAME> of <NAME> and <NAME> , which form part of the <NAME> group .
After having made a voyage of more than 1500 miles amongst dangerous archipelagos strewn with rocks and coral reefs , and amidst populations often hostile , and after loading their ships there with cloves , nutmegs , sandal-wood , mace , and pearls , they set sail for <NAME> in 1512 .
This time the veritable land of spices had been reached , it now only remained to found establishments there and to take possession of it definitely , which was not likely to be long postponed .
It has been often remarked that the <NAME> rock is not far from the <NAME> ; of this <NAME> was destined to make experience , and his last days were to be saddened by unmerited disgrace , the result of calumnies and lies , and of a skilfully woven plot , which , although it succeeded in temporarily clouding his reputation with <NAME> , has not availed to obscure the glory of this great man in the eyes of posterity .
Already there had been an effort made to persuade the king that the taking possession of <NAME> had been a grave error ; its unhealthy climate must , it was said , decimate the <NAME> population in a short time , but the king , with perfect confidence in the experience and prudence of his lieutenant , had refused to listen to his enemies , for which <NAME> had publicly thanked him , saying , -- " I think more is owing to King Emmanuel for having defended <NAME> against the <NAME> , than to myself for having twice conquered it . "
But in 1514 <NAME> had asked the king to bestow upon him as a reward for his services the title of <NAME> of <NAME> , and it was this imprudent step which gave an advantage to his adversaries .
<NAME> d'Albergavia and <NAME> , whom <NAME> had sent as prisoners to <NAME> after they had publicly declared themselves his enemies , had succeeded not only in clearing themselves from the accusation brought against them by the viceroy , but in persuading <NAME> that he wished to constitute an independent duchy of which <NAME> should be the capital , and they ended by obtaining his disgrace .
The news of the appointment of <NAME> to the post of Captain-General of <NAME> , reached <NAME> as he was issuing from the <NAME> of <NAME> on his return to the <NAME> coast , and at a time when he was suffering much from disease .
" He raised his hands towards heaven , " says M. F. <NAME> , in his excellent History of <NAME> , " and pronounced these few words : Behold I am in disgrace with the king on account of my love to men , and with men on account of my love to the king .
<NAME> thee , old man , to the <NAME> , and prepare to die , for it behoves thine honour that thou shouldest die , and never hast thou neglected to do aught which thine honour demands . "
<NAME> , being arrived in the roadstead of <NAME> , <NAME> set in order the affairs of his conscience with the <NAME> , caused himself to be clad in the dress of the Order of <NAME> of which he was a commander , and then " on Sunday the 16th of December , an hour before daybreak , he rendered up his soul to God .
Thus ended all his labours , without their having ever brought him any satisfaction . "
<NAME> was buried with great pomp .
The soldiers who had been the faithful companions of his wonderful adventures , and the witnesses of his manifold tribulations , disputed amidst their tears for the honour of carrying his remains to their last resting-place , which their commander had himself chosen .
The <NAME> in their grief refused to believe that he was dead , declaring that he was gone to command the armies of the sky .
A letter of King <NAME> has been comparatively lately discovered which proves that , although he were deceived for a time by the false reports of the enemies of <NAME> , he soon discovered his mistake , and rendered him full and entire justice .
Unfortunately this letter of reparation never reached the unfortunate second Viceroy of the <NAME> ; it would have sweetened his last moments , whereas he had the pain of dying in the belief that the sovereign for whose glory and the increase of whose power he had consecrated his life , had in the end proved ungrateful towards him .
" With <NAME> , " says <NAME> , " all humanity and all justice disappeared from amongst the conquerors .
<NAME> years after his death the <NAME> would repair to the tomb of the great <NAME> , to demand justice of him against the oppressions of his successors . "
Many causes may be adduced as bringing about the rapid decay and dismemberment of that great colonial empire with which <NAME> had enriched his country , and which even amidst its ruins has left ineffaceable traces upon <NAME> .
With <NAME> we may cite the distance and dispersion of the various factories , the smallness of the population of <NAME> , but little suited to the wide extension of her establishments , the love of brigandage , and the exactions of a bad government , but beyond all , that indomitable national pride which forbade any mingling of the victors with the vanquished .
The fall of the colonial empire was hindered for a time by the influence of two heroic men , the first was <NAME> de <NAME> , who after having had the control of untold riches , remained so poor that he had not even the wherewithal to buy a fowl in his last illness ; and the second , <NAME> , who once again gave the corrupt eastern populations an example of the most manly virtues , and of the most upright administration .
But after their time the empire began to drop to pieces , and fell by degrees into the hands of the <NAME> and the <NAME> , who in their turn were unable to preserve it intact .
All passes away , all is changed .
What can be said but to repeat the <NAME> saw , in applying it to the case of empires , " Life is but a dream " ?
<NAME> -- <NAME> -- The <NAME> World named after him -- <NAME> de la Cosa -- <NAME> -- Bastidas -- <NAME> de Lepe -- <NAME> de Solis -- <NAME> de <NAME> and <NAME> -- <NAME> discovers the <NAME> -- <NAME> explores the coast of <NAME> .
The letters and narratives of <NAME> and his companions , especially those dwelling upon the large quantity of gold and pearls found in the recently discovered countries , had inflamed the imagination of eager traders , and of numbers of gentlemen who loved adventure .
On the 10th of April , 1495 , the <NAME> government had issued an order allowing any one who might wish to do so , to go and discover new countries ; but this privilege was so much abused , and <NAME> complained so bitterly of its trenching upon established rights , that the permission was withdrawn on the 2nd of June , 1497 , and four years later it became necessary to repeat the prohibition with more severe penalties attached to its infringement .
The effect of the royal decree was at once to produce a kind of general rush to the <NAME> , and this was favoured by <NAME> of <NAME> , through whose hands passed all business connected with the Indies , and of whom <NAME> had had so much reason to complain .
The admiral had but just left San-Lucar on his third voyage , when four expeditions of discovery were fitted out almost at the same moment , at the cost of some rich ship-owners , foremost among whom we find the <NAME> and <NAME> .
The first of these expeditions , which left the port of <NAME> on the 20th of May , 1499 , consisted of four vessels , and was commanded by <NAME> .
<NAME> de la <NAME> sailed with him as pilot ; <NAME> <NAME> was also on board , without any very clearly defined duties , but he would seem to have been astronomer to the fleet .
_Fac-simile of an old print_ . ]
Before entering on a brief account of this voyage , we will glance for a few moments at the three men whom we have just named ; the last of the three especially , plays a most important part in the discovery of the <NAME> , which received its name from him .
<NAME> , born at <NAME> about 1465 , and brought up in the household of the <NAME> of <NAME> , had gained his first experience in arms in the wars against the Moors .
<NAME> enrolled him amongst the adventurers whom he recruited for his second voyage , when <NAME> distinguished himself alike by his cool courage and his readiness in surmounting all difficulties .
What caused his complete rupture with <NAME> remains a mystery ; it appears still more inexplicable when we think of the distinguished services that <NAME> had rendered , especially in 1495 , at the battle of <NAME> , when the <NAME> Confederation was annihilated .
All we know is , that on <NAME> 's return to <NAME> he found shelter and protection with <NAME> .
It is said even that the <NAME> minister supplied him with the journal of the admiral 's last voyage , and the map of the countries which <NAME> had discovered .
The first pilot employed by <NAME> was <NAME> de la Cosa , born probably at <NAME> , in the <NAME> country .
He had often sailed along the coast of <NAME> before accompanying <NAME> on his first voyage , while in the second expedition he filled the post of hydrographer ( _maestro de hacer cartas_ ) .
As specimens of <NAME> 's talent in drawing maps may be mentioned two very curious ones still extant ; one showing all the territory that had been acquired in <NAME> in 1500 , the other on vellum , and enriched with colour like the first , giving the discoveries made by <NAME> and his successors .
The second pilot was <NAME> , who had likewise sailed with <NAME> on his voyage to <NAME> .
As to <NAME> , his duties were not , as we have said , very clearly defined , he was there to aid in making discoveries ( _per ajutare a discoprire_ , says the <NAME> text of his letter to <NAME> ) .
Born at <NAME> on the 9th of March , 1451 , <NAME> belonged to a family of distinction and wealth .
He had made mathematics , natural philosophy , and astrology ( as it was then called ) his special studies .
His knowledge of history and literature , judging from his letters , appears to have been somewhat vague and ill-digested .
He left <NAME> in 1492 without any special aim in view , and went to <NAME> , where he occupied himself at first in commercial pursuits .
We hear of him in <NAME> acting as factor in the powerful trading house of his fellow countryman , <NAME> .
As this house had advanced money to <NAME> for his second voyage , it is not unlikely that <NAME> had become acquainted with the admiral at this period of his career .
On <NAME> 's death in 1495 , <NAME> was placed by his heirs at the head of the financial department of the house .
Whether he may have been tired of a situation that he thought below his powers , or been seized in his turn with the fever for making new discoveries , or whether he hoped to make his fortune rapidly in the new countries reputed to be so rich ; whatever in short may have been the motive that actuated him , at least this we know , that he joined <NAME> 's expedition in 1499 , this fact being so stated in <NAME> 's deposition in the law-suit instituted by the <NAME> with the heirs of <NAME> .
The flotilla , consisting of four vessels , set sail on the 20th of May from <NAME> , taking a south-westerly course , and in twenty-seven days the <NAME> continent was sighted at the place which was named <NAME> , because the houses being built upon piles reminded the beholders of <NAME> .
<NAME> , after some ineffectual attempts to hold intercourse with the natives , with whom he had several skirmishes , next saw the <NAME> of <NAME> ; after sailing about 250 miles to the east of the river Orinoco he reached the Gulf of <NAME> , and entered a bay called the <NAME> of <NAME> , from the natives of that part being employed in the pearl fisheries .
Guided by the maps of <NAME> , <NAME> passed by the Dragon's-Mouth , which separates <NAME> from the continent , and returned westward to <NAME> .
Then , after touching at the <NAME> , where he made a number of prisoners , whom he hoped to sell for slaves in <NAME> , he was obliged to cast anchor at <NAME> , in <NAME> , on the 5th of September , 1499 .
<NAME> , knowing <NAME> 's courage and his restless spirit only too well , feared that he would introduce a new element of discord into the colony .
He therefore despatched <NAME> with two caravels to inquire into his motives in coming to the island , and if necessary to prevent his landing .
The admiral 's fears were but too well grounded ; <NAME> had scarcely landed before he had an interview with some of the malcontents , inciting them to a rising at <NAME> , and to a determination to expel <NAME> .
After some skirmishes , which had not ended to <NAME> 's advantage , a meeting was arranged for him with <NAME> , <NAME> d'Escobar , and <NAME> la Cosa , when they prevailed upon him to leave the island .
" He took with him , " says <NAME> , " a prodigious cargo of slaves , whom he sold in the market at <NAME> for enormous sums of money . "
He returned to <NAME> in February , 1500 , where he had been preceded by <NAME> and B. Roldan on the 18th of October , 1499 .
The most southerly point that <NAME> had reached in this voyage was 4 degrees north latitude , and he had only spent fourteen weeks on the voyage of discovery , properly so called .
If we appear to have dwelt at some length upon this voyage , it is because it was the first one made by <NAME> .
Some authors , <NAME> for instance , and quite recently , <NAME> , in his history of <NAME> Henry the Navigator , assert that <NAME> ' first voyage was in 1497 , and consequently that he must have seen the <NAME> continent before <NAME> , but we prefer to follow <NAME> , who spent so many years in studying the history of the discovery of <NAME> , in his opinion that 1499 was the right date , also M. Ed .
<NAME> and M. Jules Codine , the latter of whom discussed this question in the <NAME> of the <NAME> for 1873 , _apropos_ of <NAME> 's book .
" If it were true , " says <NAME> , " that <NAME> had discovered the <NAME> , yet the glory would not be his ; it belongs undoubtedly to the man who had the genius and courage to undertake the first voyage , to <NAME> . "
As <NAME> says in his argument with <NAME> , " the glory is due only to the inventor . "
But we agree with M. Codine when he says , " How can we allow that there was an expedition in 1497 which resulted in the discovery of above 2500 miles of the coast-line of the mainland , when there is no trace of it left either among the great historians of that time , or in the legal depositions in connexion with the claims made by the heir of <NAME> against the <NAME> Government , in which the priority of the discoveries of each leader of an expedition is carefully mentioned , with the part of the coast explored by each ? "
Finally , the authentic documents extracted from the archives of the <NAME> de contratacion_ make it evident that <NAME> was entrusted with the preparation of the vessels destined for the third voyage of <NAME> at <NAME> and at <NAME> from the middle of <NAME> , 1497 , till the departure of <NAME> on the 30th of May , 1498 .
The narratives of the voyages of <NAME> are very diffuse and wanting in precision and order ; the information they give upon the places he visited is so vague , that it might apply to one part of the coast as well as to another ; as to the localities treated of , as well as of the companions of <NAME> , there are no indications given of a nature to aid the historian .
Not a single name is given of any well-known person , and the dates are contradictory in those famous letters which have given endless work to commentators .
<NAME> says of them " There is an element of discord in the most authentic documents relating to the <NAME> navigator . "
We have given an account of <NAME> 's first voyage , which coincides with that of <NAME> according to <NAME> , who has compared the principal incidents of the two narratives .
<NAME> asserts that <NAME> , having started on the 10th of May , 1497 , entered the Gulf of <NAME> on the 10th of June , coasted by <NAME> and <NAME> , sailed up the <NAME> , and at the end of February , 1498 , doubled the Cape of <NAME> .
After anchoring for thirty-seven days at the mouth of the <NAME> , he returned to <NAME> in October , 1498 .
If <NAME> had really made this marvellous voyage , he would have far outstripped all the navigators of his time , and would have fully deserved that his name should be given to the newly-discovered continent , whose coast-line he had explored for so great a distance .
But nothing is less certain , and <NAME> 's opinion has hitherto appeared to the best writers to offer the largest amount of probability .
<NAME> <NAME> made three other voyages .
<NAME> identifies the first with that of <NAME> , and M. d'Avezac with that of <NAME> de <NAME> ( 1499-1500 ) .
At the close of this latter year , <NAME> di <NAME> induced <NAME> to enter the service of <NAME> , King of <NAME> , and he accomplished two more voyages at the expense of his new master .
On the first of these two voyages , he was no higher in command than he had been in his earlier ones , and only accompanied the expedition as one whose intimate acquaintance with all nautical matters might prove of service under certain circumstances .
During this voyage the ships coasted along the <NAME> shores from <NAME> to 52 degrees of south latitude .
The fourth voyage of <NAME> was marked by the wreck of the flag-ship off the <NAME> of <NAME> de <NAME> , which prevented the other vessels from continuing their voyage towards <NAME> by way of the Cape of <NAME> , and obliged the crews to land at <NAME> ' <NAME> , in <NAME> .
This fourth voyage was unquestionably made with <NAME> , but we are quite ignorant as to who was in command on the third voyage .
These various expeditions had not tended to enrich <NAME> , while his position at the <NAME> court was so far from satisfactory that he determined to re-enter the service of the King of <NAME> .
By him he was made <NAME> on the 22nd of March , 1508 .
There were some valuable emoluments attached for his advantage to this appointment , which enabled him to end his days , if not as a rich man , at least as one far removed from want .
He died at <NAME> on the 22nd of February , 1512 , with the same conviction as <NAME> , that he had reached the shores of <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> is especially famous from the <NAME> World having been named after him , instead of being called <NAME> , as in all justice it should have been , but with this <NAME> had nothing to do .
He was for a long time charged , though most unjustly , with impudence , falsehood , and deceit , it being alleged that he wished to veil the glory of <NAME> and to arrogate to himself the honour of a discovery which did not belong to him .
This was an utterly unfounded accusation , for <NAME> was both loved and esteemed by <NAME> and his contemporaries , and there is nothing in his writings to justify this calumnious assertion .
Seven printed documents exist which are attributed to <NAME> ; they are -- the abridged accounts of his four voyages , two narratives of his third and fourth voyages , in the form of letters , addressed to <NAME> de <NAME> , and a letter addressed to the same nobleman , relative to the <NAME> discoveries in the Indies .
These documents , printed and bound up as small thin volumes , were soon translated into various languages and distributed throughout <NAME> .
It was in the year 1507 that a certain Hylacolymus , whose real name was <NAME> , first proposed to give the name of <NAME> to the new part of the world .
He did so in a book printed at <NAME> and called <NAME> introductio_ .
In 1509 a small geographical treatise appeared at <NAME> adopting the proposal of <NAME> ; and in 1520 an edition of <NAME> was printed at <NAME> , giving a map of the <NAME> World with the name of <NAME> .
From this time the number of works employing the denomination proposed by <NAME> increased perpetually .
Some years later , when <NAME> was better informed as to the real discoverer of <NAME> and of the value to be placed upon the voyages of <NAME> , he eliminated from his book all that related to the latter , and substituted everywhere the name of <NAME> for that of <NAME> , but it was too late , the same error has prevailed ever since .
As to <NAME> himself , it seems very unlikely that he was at all aware of the excitement which prevailed in <NAME> , nor of what was passing at <NAME> .
The testimony that has been unanimously borne to his honourable and upright conduct should surely clear him from the unmerited accusations which have for too long a time clouded his memory .
Three other expeditions left <NAME> almost at the same time as that of <NAME> .
The first of these , consisting of but one vessel , sailed from <NAME> in June 1499 .
<NAME> <NAME> , who had served under <NAME> in his two last voyages , was its commander , and he was accompanied by <NAME> , a merchant of <NAME> , who probably defrayed the expenses of the expedition .
This voyage to the coast of <NAME> seems to have been dictated more by the hope of lucrative commerce than by the interests of science .
No new discoveries were made , but the two voyagers returned to <NAME> in <NAME> , 1500 , bringing with them so large a quantity of valuable pearls as to excite the cupidity of their countrymen , who became anxious to try their own fortunes in the same direction .
The second expedition was commanded by <NAME> , the younger brother of <NAME> who had been captain of the <NAME> and had shown so much jealousy of <NAME> , even adopting the following mendacious device : -- _A <NAME> , y a <NAME> dio <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> , whose devotion to the admiral equalled his brother 's jealousy , had advanced an eighth part of the funds required for the expedition of 1492 , and had on that occasion been in command of the <NAME> .
He set out in December , 1499 , with four vessels , of which only two returned to <NAME> at the end of September , 1500 .
He touched the coast of the newly discovered continent at a point near the shore visited by <NAME> some months before , and explored the coast for some 2400 miles , discovering <NAME> at 8 degrees 20 minutes south latitude , following the coast-line in a north-westerly direction to _Rio <NAME> , which he named _Santa-Maria de la <NAME> dulce_ , and continuing in the same direction as far as <NAME> .
<NAME> de <NAME> explored the same coasts with two caravels from January to June , 1500 ; there is nothing particular to record of this voyage beyond the very important observation that was made on the direction of the coast-line of the continent starting from <NAME> .
<NAME> had but just returned to <NAME> when two vessels left <NAME> , equipped by <NAME> , a wealthy and highly respectable man , with the view of making some fresh discoveries , but above all with the object of collecting as large a quantity of gold and pearls as possible , for which were to be bartered glass beads and other worthless trifles .
<NAME> de la Cosa , whose talents as a navigator were proverbial , and who knew these coasts well from having explored them , was really at the head of this expedition .
The sailors went on shore and saw the <NAME> , the Gulf of <NAME> , and reached the <NAME> del Retrete_ or _de los <NAME> , in the <NAME> of <NAME> .
This harbour was not visited by <NAME> till the 26th of November , 1502 ; it is situated about seventeen miles from the once celebrated , but now destroyed town of <NAME> de Dios_ .
In fact this expedition , which had been organized by a merchant , became , thanks to <NAME> la Cosa , one of the voyages the most fertile in discoveries ; but alas !
it came to a sad termination ; the vessels were lost in the Gulf of <NAME> , and <NAME> and <NAME> were obliged to make their way by land to <NAME> .
When they arrived there , <NAME> , the upright man and model governor , whose infamous conduct to Columbus we have already mentioned , had them arrested , on the plea that they had bought some gold from the Indians of <NAME> ; he sent them off to <NAME> , which was only reached after a fearfully stormy voyage , some of the vessels being lost on the way .
After this expedition , so fruitful in results , voyages of discovery became rather less frequent for some years ; the Spaniards being occupied in asserting their supremacy in the countries in which they had already founded colonies .
[ Illustration : Indians devoured by <NAME> .
The colonization of <NAME> had commenced in 1493 , when the town of <NAME> was built .
Two years afterwards <NAME> had travelled over the island and had subjugated the poor savages , by means of those terrible dogs which had been trained to hunt <NAME> , and unaccustomed as the natives were to any hard work , he had forced them to toil in the mines .
Both Bovadilla and <NAME> treating the Indians as a herd of cattle , had divided them among the colonists as slaves .
The cruelty with which this unfortunate people was treated became more and more unbearable .
By means of a despicable ambush , <NAME> seized the Queen of <NAME> and 300 of her principal subjects , and at a given signal they were all put to the sword without there being any crime adduced against them .
" For some years , " says <NAME> , " the gold brought into the royal treasury of <NAME> amounted to about 460,000 _pesos_ ( 2,400,000 livres of the currency of <NAME> ) an enormous sum if we take into consideration the great increase in the value of money since the beginning of the sixteenth century . "
In 1511 Diego <NAME> conquered <NAME> with 300 men , and here again were enacted the terrible scenes of bloodshed and pillage which have rendered the <NAME> name so sadly notorious .
They cut off the thumbs of the natives , put out their eyes , and poured boiling oil or melted lead into their wounds , even when they did not torture them by burning them over a slow fire to extract from them the secret of the treasures of which they were believed to be the possessors .
It was only natural under these circumstances that the population rapidly decreased , and the day was not far off when it would be wholly exterminated .
To understand fully the sufferings of this race thus odiously persecuted , the touching and horrible narrative of <NAME> must be read , himself the indefatigable defender of the <NAME> .
In <NAME> , the <NAME> was made prisoner and condemned to be burnt .
When he was tied to the stake , a <NAME> monk tried to convert him , promising him that if he would only embrace the <NAME> faith , he would be at once admitted to all the joys of <NAME> .
" Are there any Spaniards in that land of happiness and joy of which you speak ? "
" Yes , " replied the monk , " but only those who have been just and good in their lives . "
" The very best among them can have neither justice nor mercy ! "
said the poor cacique , " I do not wish to go to any place where I should meet a single man of that accursed race . "
Does not this fact suffice to paint the degree of exasperation to which these unfortunate people had been driven ?
And these horrors were repeated wherever the <NAME> set foot !
We will throw a veil over these atrocities practised by men who thought themselves civilized , and who pretended that they wished to convert to <NAME> , the religion pre-eminently of love and mercy , a race who were in reality less savage than themselves .
In 1504 and 1505 four vessels explored the Gulf of <NAME> .
This was the first voyage in which <NAME> de la <NAME> had the supreme command .
This seems , too , to have been about the date of <NAME> 's third voyage , when he went to the territory of <NAME> , a voyage that certainly was made , as <NAME> says , but of which we have no clear account .
In 1509 Juan Diaz de <NAME> , in concert with <NAME> , discovered a vast province , since known by the name of <NAME> .
" Though this expedition was not a very remarkable one in itself , " says <NAME> , " it deserves to be noticed as it led to discoveries of the utmost importance . "
For the same reason we must mention the voyage of <NAME> d'Ocampo , who being charged to sail round <NAME> , was the first to ascertain the fact that it was a large island , <NAME> having always regarded it as part of the continent .
Two years later <NAME> de <NAME> and <NAME> Pinzon sailing southwards towards the equinoctial line , advanced as far as the 40 degrees of south latitude , and found , to their surprise , that the continent extended on their right hand even to this immense distance .
They landed several times , and took formal possession of the country , but could not found any colonies there , on account of the small resources they had at their command .
The principal result of this voyage was the more exact knowledge which it gave of the extent of this part of the globe .
<NAME> de <NAME> , whose adventures we have narrated above , was the first to think of founding a colony on the mainland ; although he had no means of his own , his courage and enterprising spirit soon gained him associates , who furnished him with the funds needed for carrying out his plans .
With the same object Diego de <NAME> , a rich colonist of <NAME> , organized an expedition in 1509 .
King <NAME> , who was always lavish of encouragements which cost little , gave both Hojeda and <NAME> honourable titles and patents of nobility , but not a single maravédis ( a <NAME> coin ) .
He also divided the newly-discovered continent into two governments , of which one was to extend from <NAME> to the Gulf of <NAME> , and the other from the Gulf of <NAME> to <NAME> _Gracias a Dios_ .
The first was given to <NAME> , the second to <NAME> .
These two " conquistadores " had to deal with a population far less easy to manage than that of the <NAME> .
Determined to resist to the utmost the invasion of their country , they adopted means of resistance hitherto unknown to the <NAME> .
Thus the strife became deadly .
In a single engagement seventy of <NAME> 's companions fell under the arrows of the savages , fearful weapons steeped in " curare , " so fatal a poison that the slightest wound was followed by death .
<NAME> on his side , had much difficulty in defending himself , and in spite of two considerable reinforcements from <NAME> , the greater number of his followers perished during the year from wounds , fatigue , privations , or sickness .
The survivors founded the small colony of <NAME> el <NAME> upon the Gulf of <NAME> , and placed it under the command of <NAME> .
Before we speak of <NAME> 's wonderful expedition , we must notice the discovery of a country that forms the most northerly side of that arc , cut so deeply into the continent , and which bears the name of the Gulf of <NAME> .
In 1502 Juan Ponce de <NAME> , a member of one of the oldest families in <NAME> , had arrived in <NAME> with <NAME> .
He had assisted in its subjugation , and in 1508 had conquered the island of <NAME> de <NAME> .
Having learnt from the Indians that there existed a fountain in the island of <NAME> which possessed the miraculous power of restoring youth to all who drank of its waters , <NAME> de <NAME> resolved to go in search of it .
Infirmities must have been already creeping on him at fifty years of age , or he would scarcely have felt the need of trying this fountain .
<NAME> de <NAME> equipped three vessels at his own expense , and set out from <NAME> in <NAME> on the 1st of March , 1512 .
He went first to the <NAME> , which he searched in vain , and then to the <NAME> .
If he did not succeed in finding the fountain of youth which he sought so credulously , at least he had the satisfaction of discovering an apparently fertile tract of country , which he named <NAME> , either from his landing there on <NAME> Sunday , ( Pâques-Fleuries ) , or perhaps from its delightful aspect .
Such a discovery would have contented many a traveller , but <NAME> went from one island to another , tasting the water of every stream that he met with , without the satisfaction of seeing his white hair again becoming black or his wrinkles disappearing .
After spending six months in this fruitless search , he was tired of playing the dupe , so giving up the business he returned to <NAME> on the 5th of October , leaving <NAME> de <NAME> and the pilot <NAME> de Alaminos to continue the search .
<NAME> <NAME> says , " He was the object of great ridicule when he returned in much suffering , and looking older than when he set out . "
This voyage , so absurd in its motive but so fertile in its results , might well be considered to be simply imaginary , were it not vouched for by historians of such high repute as <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> la Vega .
<NAME> <NAME> de <NAME> , who was fifteen years younger than <NAME> de <NAME> , had come to <NAME> with <NAME> and had settled in <NAME> .
He was only anxious for a safe refuge from his numerous creditors , being , as were so many of his fellow-countrymen , deeply in debt , in spite of the _repartimiento_ of <NAME> which had been allotted to him .
Unfortunately for <NAME> a law had been passed forbidding any vessels bound for the mainland taking insolvent debtors on board , but his ingenuity was equal to this emergency , for he had himself rolled in an empty barrel to the vessel which was to carry <NAME> to <NAME> .
The chief of the expedition had no choice but to receive the brave adventurer who had joined him in this singular manner , and who never fled except from duns , as he soon proved on landing .
The <NAME> , accustomed to find but little resistance from the natives of the <NAME> , could not subjugate the fierce inhabitants of the mainland .
On account of the dissensions that had arisen among themselves , they were obliged to take refuge at <NAME> el <NAME> , a settlement which <NAME> , now elected commandant in place of <NAME> , founded in <NAME> .
If the personal bravery of <NAME> , or the ferocity of Leoncillo his blood-hound -- who was more dreaded than twenty armed men and received the same pay as a soldier , -- could have awed the <NAME> , <NAME> would have also won their respect by his justice and comparative moderation , for he allowed no unnecessary cruelty .
In the course of some years he collected a great mass of most useful information with regard to that El Dorado , that land of gold , which he was destined never to reach himself , but the acquisition of which he did much to facilitate for his successors .
It was in this way that he learnt the existence six suns away ( six days ' journey ) , of another sea , the <NAME> , which washed the shores of <NAME> , a country where gold was found in large quantities .
<NAME> 's character , which was as grand as those of <NAME> and <NAME> , but who had not , as they , the time or opportunity to show the extraordinary qualities which he possessed , felt convinced that this information was most valuable , and that if he could carry out such a discovery , it would shed great lustre on his name .
He assembled a body of 190 volunteers , all valiant soldiers , and like himself , accustomed to all the chances of war , as well as acclimatised to the unhealthy effluvia of a marshy country , where fever , dysentery , and complaints of the liver were constantly present .
Though the <NAME> of <NAME> is only sixty miles in width , it is divided into two parts by a chain of high mountains ; at the foot of these the alluvial soil is marvellously fertile , and the vegetation far more luxuriant than any <NAME> can imagine .
It consists of an inextricable mass of tropical plants , creepers , and ferns , among trees of gigantic size which completely hide the sun , a truly virgin forest , interspersed here and there with patches of stagnant water , where live multitudes of birds , insects , and animals , never disturbed by the foot of man .
A warm , moist atmosphere exists here which exhausts the strength and speedily saps the energy of any man , even the most robust .
With all these obstacles which <NAME> seemed to have rejoiced in placing in <NAME> 's path , there was yet another no less formidable , and this was the resistance which the savage inhabitants of this inhospitable shore would offer to his progress .
<NAME> set out without caring for the risk he ran in the event of the guides and native auxiliaries proving faithless ; he was escorted by a thousand Indians as porters , and accompanied by a troop of those terrible bloodhounds which had acquired the taste for human flesh in <NAME> .
Of the tribes that he met with on his route , some fled into the mountains carrying their provisions with them , and others , taking advantage of the difficulties the land presented , tried to fight .
<NAME> marching in the midst of his men , never sparing himself , sharing in their privations and rousing their courage , which would have failed more than once , was able to inspire them with so much enthusiasm for the object that was before them , that after twenty-five days of marching and fighting , they could see from the top of a mountain that vast <NAME> , of which , four days later , <NAME> , his drawn sword in one hand and the banner of <NAME> in the other , took possession in the name of the King of <NAME> .
The part of the <NAME> which he had reached is situated to the east of <NAME> , and still bears the name of the Gulf of <NAME> , given to it by <NAME> .
The information he obtained from the neighbouring caciques , whom he subjugated by force of arms , and from whom he obtained a considerable booty , agreed in every particular with what he had heard before he set out .
A vast empire lay to the south , they said , " so rich in gold , that even the commonest instruments were made of it , " where the domestic animals were llamas that had been tamed and trained to carry heavy burdens , and whose appearance in the native drawings resembled that of the camel .
These interesting details , and the great quantity of pearls offered to <NAME> , confirmed him in his idea , that he must have reached the <NAME> countries described by <NAME> , and that he could not be far from the empire of <NAME> or <NAME> , of which the <NAME> traveller had described the marvellous riches which were perpetually dazzling the eyes of these avaricious adventurers .
[ Illustration : Balboa discovering the <NAME> . ]
<NAME> several times crossed the <NAME> of <NAME> , and always in some fresh direction .
<NAME> might well say that this country was better known in the beginning of the sixteenth century than in his own day .
Beyond this <NAME> had launched some vessels built under his orders on the newly-discovered ocean , and he was preparing a formidable armament , with which he hoped to conquer <NAME> , when he was odiously and judicially murdered by the orders of <NAME> , the governor of <NAME> , who was jealous of the reputation <NAME> had already gained , and of the glory which would doubtless recompense his bravery if he carried out the expedition which he had arranged .
Thus the conquest of <NAME> was retarded by at least twenty-five years , owing to the culpable jealousy of a man whose name has acquired , by <NAME> 's assassination , almost as wretched a celebrity as that of <NAME> .
If we owe to Balboa the first authentic documents regarding <NAME> , another explorer was destined to furnish some not less important touching that vast <NAME> , which had extended its sway over almost the whole of <NAME> .
In 1518 , <NAME> de <NAME> had been placed in command of a flotilla , consisting of four vessels , armed by <NAME> , the conqueror of <NAME> , which were destined to collect information upon <NAME> , sighted the year before by <NAME> de <NAME> .
<NAME> , accompanied by the pilot <NAME> , who had made the voyage to <NAME> with <NAME> de <NAME> , had two hundred men under his command ; amongst the volunteers was <NAME> del <NAME> , the clever author of a very interesting history of the conquest of <NAME> , from which we shall borrow freely .
After thirteen days ' sailing , <NAME> reached the <NAME> of <NAME> on the coast of <NAME> , doubled the Cape of <NAME> , and entered the <NAME> of <NAME> .
He disembarked on the 10th of May at <NAME> , of which the inhabitants defended the town and citadel vigorously , in spite of their astonishment at the vessels , which they took for some kind of marine monsters , and their fear of the pale-faced men who hurled thunderbolts .
Fifty-seven Spaniards were killed in the engagement , and many were wounded .
This warm reception did not encourage <NAME> to make any long stay amongst this warlike people .
He set sail again after anchoring for four days , took a westerly course along the coast of <NAME> , and on the 19th of May entered a river named by the natives the <NAME> , where he soon found himself surrounded by a fleet of fifty native boats filled with warriors ready for the conflict , but thanks to <NAME> 's prudence and the amicable demonstrations which he made , peace was not disturbed .
" We made them understand , " writes <NAME> , " that we were the subjects of a powerful emperor called <NAME> , and that it would be greatly to their advantage if they also would acknowledge him as their master .
They replied that they had a sovereign already , and were at a loss to understand why we , who had only just arrived , and who knew so little of them , should offer them another king . "
This reply was scarcely that of a savage !
In exchange for some worthless <NAME> trinkets , the <NAME> obtained some Yucca bread , copal gum , pieces of gold worked into the shape of fishes or birds , and garments made of cotton , which had been woven in the country .
As the natives who had been taken on board at <NAME> did not perfectly understand the language spoken by the inhabitants of <NAME> , the stay here was but of short duration , and the ships again put to sea .
They passed the mouth of the <NAME> , the snowy peaks of the <NAME> mountains being seen in the distance , and they anchored at the mouth of a river which was called <NAME> de las Banderas_ , from the number of white banners displayed by the natives to show their friendly feeling towards the new comers .
When <NAME> landed , he was received with the same honour as the <NAME> paid to their gods ; they burnt copal incense before him , and laid at his feet more than 1500 piastres ' worth of small gold jewels , as well as green pearls and copper hatchets .
After taking formal possession of the country , the <NAME> landed on an island called <NAME> , from a sort of altar which they found there placed at the top of several steps , upon which lay the bodies of five Indians sacrificed since the preceding evening ; their bodies were cut open , their hearts torn out , and both legs and arms cut off .
Leaving this revolting spectacle , they went to another small island , which received the name of <NAME> , being discovered on St. <NAME> 's Day ; to this they added the word <NAME> , which they heard used by the natives of these shores .
But <NAME> was the ancient name for <NAME> , and this <NAME> of <NAME> de Culua is now known as <NAME> <NAME> d'Ulloa .
<NAME> put all the gold which he had collected on board one of the ships and despatched it to <NAME> , while he continued his exploration of the coast , discovered the <NAME> of <NAME> and <NAME> , and collected a large amount of useful information regarding this populous country ; on arriving at the <NAME> , he was attacked by a flotilla of native vessels , and had much difficulty in defending himself against their attacks .
This expedition was nearly over , for provisions were running short , and the vessels were in a very bad state , the volunteers were many of them sick and wounded , and even had they been in good health their numbers were too small to make it safe to leave them among these warlike people , even under the shelter of fortifications .
Besides , the leaders of the expedition no longer acted in concert , so after repairing the largest of the vessels in the <NAME> , where <NAME> boasts of having sown the first orange-pips which were ever brought to <NAME> , the <NAME> set out for <NAME> in <NAME> , where they arrived on the 15th of November , after a cruise of seven months , not forty-five days , as M. Ferdinand <NAME> asserts in the <NAME> , and as M. Ed .
<NAME> repeats in his <NAME> et <NAME> .
The results obtained from this voyage were considerable .
For the first time the long line of coast which forms the peninsula of <NAME> , the <NAME> of <NAME> , and the base of the Gulf of <NAME> , had been explored continuously from cape to cape .
Not only had it been proved beyond doubt that <NAME> was not an island as they had believed , but much and reliable information had been collected with regard to the existence of the rich and powerful empire of <NAME> .
The explorers had been much struck with the marks of a more advanced civilization than that existing in the <NAME> , with the superiority of the architecture , the skilful cultivation of the land , the fine texture of the cotton garments , and the delicacy of finish of the golden ornaments worn by the <NAME> .
All this combined to increase the thirst for riches among the <NAME> of <NAME> , and to urge them on like modern Argonauts to the conquest of this new golden fleece .
<NAME> was not destined to reap the fruits of his perilous and at the same time intelligent voyage , which threw so new a light on <NAME> civilization .
The _sic vos , non vobis_ of the poet was once again to find an exemplification in this circumstance .
<NAME> <NAME> -- His character -- His appointment -- Preparations for the expedition , and attempts of <NAME> to stop it -- Landing at Vera-Cruz -- <NAME> and the <NAME> Montezuma -- The republic of <NAME> -- March upon <NAME> -- The <NAME> is made prisoner -- <NAME> defeated -- The <NAME> -- Battle of <NAME> -- The second siege and taking of <NAME> -- Expedition to <NAME> -- Voyage to <NAME> -- Expeditions on the <NAME> -- Second Voyage of <NAME> to <NAME> -- His death .
<NAME> had not waited for <NAME> 's return before sending off to <NAME> the rich products of the countries discovered by the latter , and at the same time soliciting from the council of the <NAME> , as well as from the <NAME> of <NAME> , an addition to his authority , that he might attempt the conquest of these countries .
At the same time he fitted out a new armament proportioned to the dangers and importance of the undertaking that he proposed .
But though it was comparatively easy for <NAME> to collect the necessary material and men , it was far more difficult for him -- whom an old writer describes as niggardly , credulous , and suspicious in disposition -- to choose a fit leader .
He wished indeed , to find one who should combine qualities nearly always incompatible , high courage and great talent , without which there was no chance of success , with at the same time sufficient docility and submissiveness , to do nothing without orders , and to leave to him who incurred no risk , any glory and success which might attend the enterprise .
Some who were brave and enterprising would not be treated as mere machines ; others who were more docile or more cunning lacked the qualities required to insure the success of so vast an enterprise ; among the former were some of <NAME> 's companions who wished that he should be made commander , while the latter preferred Augustin Bermudez or <NAME> .
While this was pending , the governor 's secretary , <NAME> de <NAME> , and <NAME> de Larez , the <NAME> of <NAME> , both favourites of <NAME> , made an arrangement with a <NAME> nobleman named <NAME> , that if they could obtain the appointment for him , they should be allowed a share in his gains .
<NAME> <NAME> says , " They praised <NAME> so highly , and pointed him out in such flattering terms as the very man fitted to fill the vacant post , adding that he was brave and certainly very faithful to <NAME> ( to whom he was son-in-law ) , that he allowed himself to be persuaded , and <NAME> was nominated captain-general .
As <NAME> de <NAME> was the governor 's secretary , he hastened to formulate the powers in a deed , making them very ample , as <NAME> desired , and brought it to him duly signed . "
<NAME> <NAME> been gifted with the power of looking into the future , <NAME> was certainly not the man he would have chosen .
<NAME> was born at <NAME> in <NAME> in 1485 , of an ancient , but slenderly-endowed family ; after studying at <NAME> for some time , he returned to his native town , but the quiet monotonous life there was little suited to his restless and capricious temper , and he soon started for <NAME> , reckoning upon the protection of his relation <NAME> , the Governor of <NAME> .
His expectations were fully realized , and he held several honourable and lucrative posts , without counting that between times he joined in several expeditions against the natives .
If he became in this manner initiated into the <NAME> system of tactics , so also , unfortunately , did he grow familiar with those acts of cruelty which have too often stained the <NAME> name .
He accompanied <NAME> de Velasquez in his <NAME> expedition in 1511 , and here he distinguished himself so highly , that notwithstanding certain disagreements with his chief , a large grant of land as well as of <NAME> was made to him as a recognition of his services .
<NAME> amassed the sum of 3000 castellanos in the course of a few years by his industry and frugality , a large sum for one in his position , but his chief recommendations in the eyes of <NAME> de <NAME> and <NAME> de <NAME> his two patrons , were his activity , his well-known prudence , his decision of character , and the power of gaining the confidence of all with whom he was brought into contact .
In addition to all this , he was of imposing stature and appearance , very athletic , and possessed powers of endurance , remarkable even among the hardy adventurers who were accustomed to brave all kinds of hardships .
As soon as <NAME> had received his commission , which he did with every mark of respectful gratitude , he set up a banner at the door of his house , made of black velvet embroidered in gold , bearing the device of a red cross in the midst of blue and white flames , and below , this motto in <NAME> , " Friends , let us follow the <NAME> , and if we have faith , we shall overcome by this sign . "
He concentrated the whole force of his powerful mind upon the means to make the enterprise a success ; even his most intimate friends were astonished at his enthusiasm in preparing for it .
He not only gave the whole of the money which he possessed towards arming the fleet , but he charged part on his estate , and borrowed considerable sums from his friends to purchase vessels , provisions , munitions of war , and horses .
In a few days 300 volunteers had enrolled themselves , attracted by the fame of the general , the daring nature of the enterprise , and the profit that would probably accrue from it .
<NAME> , always suspicious , and doubtless instigated by some who were jealous of <NAME> , tried to put a stop to the expedition at its outset .
<NAME> being warned by his two patrons that <NAME> would probably try to take the command from him , acted with his customary decision ; he collected his men and , in spite of the vessels not being completed and of an insufficient armament , he weighed anchor and sailed during the night .
When <NAME> discovered that his plans had been check-mated he concealed his indignation , but at the same time , he made every arrangement to stop the man who could thus throw off all dependence upon him with such consummate coolness .
<NAME> anchored at <NAME> , to complete his stores , and found many of those who had accompanied <NAME> now hasten to serve under his banner : <NAME> de <NAME> and his brothers , <NAME> , <NAME> de <NAME> , <NAME> de Puerto-Carrero , <NAME> de <NAME> , and <NAME> del <NAME> , who was to write a valuable account of these events " _quorum pars magna fuit_ . "
<NAME> <NAME> , on the south coast of <NAME> was the next resting-place , and here a further supply of provisions was taken on board , but while <NAME> lay at anchor for this purpose , <NAME> the governor , received letters from <NAME> , desiring him to arrest the captain-general , the command of the fleet having been just taken from him .
This bold step would have endangered the safety of the town , so <NAME> refrained from executing the order .
<NAME> sailed away to <NAME> in order to enlist some new adherents , while his lieutenant <NAME> went over land to the port where the last preparations were made .
Although <NAME> was unsuccessful in his first attempt , he again sent an order to arrest <NAME> , but <NAME> the governor , felt the impossibility of executing the order in the midst of soldiers who , as <NAME> says , " would willingly have given their lives to save <NAME> . "
At length , having recalled the volunteers by beat of drum , and taken on board all that appeared necessary , <NAME> set sail on the 18th February , 1519 , with eleven ships ( the largest being of 100 tons ) , 110 sailors , 553 soldiers , -- 13 of whom were arquebusiers , -- 200 Indians from the island , and some women for domestic work .
The real strength of the armament lay in the ten pieces of artillery , the four falconets provided with an ample supply of ammunition , and the sixteen horses which had been obtained at great expense .
It was with these almost miserable means , which , however , had given <NAME> much trouble to collect , that he prepared to wage war with a sovereign whose dominions were of greater extent than those appertaining to the King of <NAME> -- an enterprise from which he would have turned back if he had foreseen half its difficulties .
But long ago a poet said , " Fortune smiles on those who dare . "
After encountering a very severe storm , the fleet touched at the island of <NAME> , where they found that the inhabitants had embraced Christianity , either from fear of the <NAME> , or from finding the inability of their gods to help them .
Just as the fleet was about to leave the island , <NAME> had the good fortune to meet with a <NAME> named <NAME> d'Aguilar , who had been kept a prisoner by the <NAME> for eight years .
During that time he had learnt the <NAME> language perfectly ; he was as prudent as he was clever , and when he joined the expedition he was of the greatest use as an interpreter .
After doubling <NAME> , <NAME> sailed down the <NAME> of <NAME> , passed <NAME> , and entered the <NAME> , hoping to meet with as friendly a reception there as <NAME> had done , and also to collect an equally large quantity of gold ; but he found a great change had taken place in the feelings of the natives , and he was obliged to employ force .
In spite of the bravery and numerical superiority of the <NAME> , the <NAME> overcame them in several engagements , thanks to the terror caused by the reports of their fire-arms and the sight of the cavalry , whom the <NAME> took for supernatural beings .
The <NAME> lost a large number of men in these engagements , while among the Spaniards two were killed , and fourteen men and several horses wounded ; the wounds of the latter were dressed with fat taken from the dead bodies of the <NAME> .
At last peace was made , and the natives gave <NAME> provisions , some cotton clothing , a small quantity of gold , and twenty female slaves , among whom was the celebrated <NAME> , who rendered such signal services to the <NAME> as an interpreter , and who is mentioned by all the historians of the conquest of the <NAME> .
[ Illustration : <NAME> receives provisions , clothing , a little gold , and twenty female slaves . ]
<NAME> continued on a westerly course , seeking a suitable place for landing , but he could find none until he reached <NAME> d'Ulloa .
The fleet had scarcely cast anchor before a canoe made its way fearlessly to the admiral 's vessel , and here <NAME> ( who was of <NAME> origin ) was of the greatest use , in telling <NAME> that the Indians of this part of the country were the subjects of a great empire , and that their province was one recently added to it by conquest .
Their monarch , named <NAME> , better known under the name of <NAME> , lived in <NAME> , or <NAME> , nearly 210 miles away in the interior .
<NAME> offered the Indians some presents , assuring them of his pacific intentions , and then disembarked upon the torrid and unhealthy shore of Vera-Cruz .
Provisions flowed in immediately , but the day after the landing , <NAME> , governor of the province , and ambassador of <NAME> to the <NAME> , had much difficulty in answering <NAME> when he asked him to conduct him to his master without delay , knowing as he did all the anxiety and fears which had haunted the mind of the Emperor since the arrival of the <NAME> .
However , he caused some cotton stuffs , feather cloaks , and some articles made of gold to be laid at the feet of the general , a sight which simply excited the cupidity of the <NAME> .
To give these poor Indians an adequate idea of his power , <NAME> called out his soldiers , and put them through their drill , he also ordered the discharge of some pieces of artillery , the noise of which froze the hearts of the savages with terror .
During the whole time of the interview , some painters had been employed in sketching upon pieces of white cotton , the ships , the troops , and everything which had struck their fancy .
These drawings very cleverly executed , were to be sent to <NAME> .
Before beginning the history of the heroic struggles which shortly commenced , it will be useful to give some details as to that <NAME> empire which , powerful as it appeared , nevertheless contained within itself numerous elements of decay and dissolution , which fact explains the cause of its conquest by a mere handful of adventurers .
That part of <NAME> which was under the dominion of <NAME> was called <NAME> and lay between 14 degrees and 20 degrees north latitude .
This region presents great varieties of climate on account of its difference of altitude ; towards the centre , and rather nearer to the <NAME> than to the <NAME> , there is a huge basin at an elevation of 7500 feet above the sea , and about 200 miles in circumference , in the hollow of which there were at that time several lakes ; this depression is called the valley of <NAME> , taking its name from the capital of the empire .
As may be easily supposed , we possess very few authentic details about a people whose written annals were burnt by the ignorant " conquistadores " and by fanatical monks , who jealously suppressed everything which might remind the conquered race of their ancient religious and political traditions .
Arriving from the north in the seventh century the <NAME> had overspread the plateau of <NAME> .
They were an intelligent race of people , addicted to agriculture and the mechanical arts , understanding the working in metals , and to whom is due the construction of the greater part of the sumptuous and gigantic edifices of which the ruins are found in every direction in <NAME> .
After four centuries of power , the <NAME> disappeared from the country as mysteriously as they had come .
A century later they were replaced by a savage tribe from the north-west , who were soon followed by more civilized races , speaking apparently the <NAME> language .
The most celebrated of these tribes were the <NAME> , and the <NAME> or Tezcucans , who assimilated themselves easily with the tincture of civilization which remained in the country with the last of the <NAME> .
The <NAME> , after a series of migrations and wars , settled themselves in 1326 in the valley of <NAME> , where they built their capital <NAME> .
A treaty of alliance both offensive and defensive was entered into between the states of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , and was rigorously observed for a whole century ; in consequence of this the <NAME> civilization , which had been at first bounded by the extent of the valley , spread on all sides , and soon was limited only by the <NAME> and <NAME> .
In a short time these people had reached a higher degree of civilization than any other tribe in the <NAME> .
The rights of property were recognized in <NAME> , commerce flourished there , and three kinds of coin in circulation provided the ordinary mechanism of exchange .
There was a well-organized police , and a system of relays which worked with perfect regularity , and enabled the sovereign to transmit his orders with rapidity from one end of the empire to the other .
The number and beauty of the towns , the great size of the palaces , temples , and fortresses indicated an advanced civilization , which presented a singular contrast to the ferocious manners of the <NAME> .
Their polytheistic religion was in the highest degree barbarous and sanguinary ; the priests formed a very numerous body , and exercised great influence even over political affairs .
<NAME> by side with rites similar to those of <NAME> , such as baptism and confession , the religion presented a tissue of the most absurd and bloody superstitions .
The offering up of human sacrifices , adopted at the beginning of the 14th century , and used at first very sparingly , had soon become so frequent , that the number of victims immolated each year , and drawn chiefly from the conquered nations , amounted to 20,000 , while under certain circumstances the number was much larger .
Thus in 1486 , at the inauguration of the temple of <NAME> , 70,000 captives perished in a single day .
The Government of <NAME> was monarchical ; at first the imperial power had been carefully limited , but it had increased with the various conquests , and had become despotic .
The sovereign was always chosen out of the same family , and his accession was marked by the offering up of numerous human sacrifices .
The <NAME> belonged to the sacerdotal caste , and in consequence his power received some unwonted development .
The result of his numerous wars had been the extension of his frontiers , and the subjugation of various nations ; these latter welcomed the Spaniards with eagerness , thinking that their dominion must surely be less oppressive and less cruel than that of the <NAME> .
It is certain that if <NAME> , with the large force which he had at his disposal , had fallen upon the Spaniards when they were occupying the hot and unhealthy shore of Vera-Cruz , they would have been unable , in spite of the superiority of their arms and discipline , to resist such a shock ; they must all have perished , or been obliged to re-embark , and the fate of the <NAME> World would have been completely changed .
But the decision which formed the most salient point in the character of <NAME> , was completely wanting in that of <NAME> , a prince who never could at any time adopt a resolute policy .
<NAME> ambassadors from the emperor had arrived at the <NAME> camp , bringing to <NAME> an order to quit the country , and upon his refusal all intercourse between the natives and the invaders had immediately ceased .
The situation was becoming critical , and this <NAME> felt .
After having overcome some hesitation which had been shown by the troops , he laid the foundations of Vera-Cruz , a fortress designed to serve as a basis of operations , and a shelter in case of a possible re-embarkation .
He next organized a kind of civil government , a _junta_ , as it would be called in the present day , to which he resigned the commission which had been revoked by <NAME> , and then he made the junta give him one with new provisions and more extended powers .
After this he received the envoys from the town of <NAME> , who were come to solicit his alliance , and his protection against <NAME> , whose dominion they bore with impatience .
<NAME> was indeed fortunate in meeting with such allies so soon after landing , and not wishing to allow so golden an opportunity to slip , he welcomed the <NAME> kindly , went with them to their capital , and after having caused a fortress to be constructed at <NAME> on the sea-shore , he persuaded his new friends to refuse the payment of tribute to <NAME> .
He took advantage of his stay at <NAME> to exhort these people to embrace Christianity , and he threw down their idols , as he had already done at <NAME> , to prove to them the powerlessness of their gods .
Meanwhile a plot had been forming in his own camp , and <NAME> , feeling convinced that as long as there remained any way of returning to <NAME> , there would be constant lukewarmness and discontent among his soldiers , caused all his ships to be run aground , under the pretext of their being in too shattered a condition to be of any further use .
This was an unheard-of act of audacity , and one which forced his companions either to conquer or to die .
Having no longer anything to fear from the want of discipline of his troops , <NAME> set out for <NAME> on the 16th of <NAME> , with five hundred soldiers , fifteen horses , and six field cannon , and also two hundred <NAME> porters , who were intended to perform all menial offices .
The little army soon reached the frontiers of the small republic of <NAME> , of which the fierce inhabitants , impatient of servitude , had long been engaged in strife with <NAME> .
<NAME> flattered himself that his oft-proclaimed intention of delivering the Indians from the <NAME> yoke would induce the Tlascalans to become his allies and at once to make common cause with him .
He therefore asked for leave to cross their territory on his way to <NAME> ; but his ambassadors were detained , and as he advanced into the interior of the country , he was harassed for fourteen consecutive days and nights by continual attacks from several bodies of <NAME> , amounting in all to 30,000 men , who displayed a bravery and determination such as the <NAME> had never yet seen equalled in the <NAME> .
But the arms possessed by these brave men were very primitive .
What could they effect with only arrows and lances tipped with obsidian or fish-bones , stakes hardened in the fire , wooden swords , and above all with an inferior system of tactics ?
When they found that each encounter cost them the lives of many of their bravest warriors , while not a single <NAME> had been killed , they imagined that these strangers must be of a superior order of beings , while they could not tell what opinion to form of men who sent back to them the spies taken in their camp , with their hands cut off , and who yet after each victory not only did not devour their prisoners , as the <NAME> would have done , but released them , loading them with presents and proposing peace .
Upon this the <NAME> declared themselves vassals of the <NAME> crown , and swore to assist <NAME> in all his expeditions , while he on his side promised to protect them against their enemies .
It was time that peace should be made , for many of the <NAME> were wounded or ill , and all were worn out with fatigue , but the entry in triumph into <NAME> , where they were welcomed as supernatural beings , quickly made them forget their sufferings .
After twenty days of repose in this town , <NAME> resumed his march towards <NAME> , having with him an auxiliary army of six thousand Tlascalans .
He went first to <NAME> , a town regarded as sacred by the <NAME> , and as the sanctuary and favoured residence of their deities .
<NAME> felt much satisfaction in the advance of the <NAME> to this town , either from the hope that the gods would themselves avenge the desecration of their temples , or that he thought a rising , and massacre of the <NAME> might be more easily organized in this populous and fanatical town .
<NAME> had been warned by the Tlascalans that he must place no trust in the protestations of friendship and devotion made by the Cholulans .
However , he took up his quarters in the town , considering that he would lose his prestige if he showed any signs of fear , but upon being informed by the Tlascalans that the women and children were being sent away , and by <NAME> that a considerable body of troops was massed at the gates of the city , that pitfalls and trenches were dug in the streets , whilst the roofs of the houses were loaded with stones and missiles , <NAME> anticipated the designs of his enemies , gave orders to make prisoners of all the principal men of the town , and then organized a general massacre of the population , thus taken by surprise and deprived of their leaders .
For two whole days the unhappy Cholulans were subject to all the horrors which could be invented by the rage of the <NAME> , and the vengeance of their allies the Tlascalans .
A terrible example was made , six thousand people being put to the sword , temples burned to the ground , and the town half destroyed , a work of destruction well calculated to strike terror into the hearts of <NAME> and his subjects .
<NAME> miles now separated <NAME> from the capital , and everywhere as he passed along he was received as a liberator .
There was not a cacique who had not some cause of complaint against the imperial despotism , and <NAME> felt confirmed in the hope that so divided an empire would prove an easy prey .
As the <NAME> descended from the mountains of <NAME> , they beheld with astonishment the valley of <NAME> , with its enormous lake , deeply sunk and surrounded by large towns , the capital city built upon piles , and the well-cultivated fields of this fertile region .
<NAME> did not trouble himself about the continued tergiversations of <NAME> , who could not make up his mind to the last moment whether he would receive the <NAME> as friends or enemies .
The <NAME> general advanced along the causeway which leads to <NAME> across the lake , and was already within a mile of the town , when some Indians , who , from their magnificent costume were evidently of high rank , came to greet him and to announce to him the approach of the emperor .
<NAME> soon appeared , borne upon the shoulders of his favourites in a kind of litter adorned with gold and feathers , while a magnificent canopy protected him from the rays of the sun .
As he advanced the <NAME> prostrated themselves before him , with their heads downwards , as though unworthy even to look at their monarch .
This first interview was cordial , and <NAME> himself conducted his guests to the abode which he had prepared for them .
It was a vast palace , surrounded by a stone wall , and defended by high towers .
<NAME> immediately took measures of defence , and ordered the cannon to be pointed upon the roads leading to the palace .
At the second interview , magnificent presents were offered both to the general and soldiers .
<NAME> related that according to an old tradition , the ancestors of the <NAME> had arrived in the country under the leadership of a man of white complexion , and bearded like the <NAME> .
After laying the foundations of their power , he had embarked upon the ocean , promising them that one day his descendants would come to visit them and to reform their laws -- and if , as <NAME> said , he now received the <NAME> rather as fathers than as foreigners , it was because he felt convinced that in them he beheld the descendants of his people 's ancient chief , and he begged them to regard themselves as the masters of his country .
The following days were employed in visiting the town , which appeared to the <NAME> as larger , more populous , and more beautiful than any city which they had hitherto seen in <NAME> .
Its distinguishing peculiarity consisted in the causeways which formed a means of communication with the land , and which were cut through in various places to allow a free passage to vessels sailing on the waters of the lake .
Across these openings were thrown bridges which could be easily destroyed .
On the eastern side of the town there was no causeway and no means of communication with the land except by canoes .
This arrangement of the town of <NAME> caused some anxiety to <NAME> , who saw that he might be at any moment blockaded in the town , without being able to find means of egress .
He determined , therefore , to prevent any seditious attempt by securing the person of the emperor , and using him as a hostage .
The following news which he had just received furnished him with an excellent pretext : Qualpopoca , a <NAME> general , had attacked the provinces which had submitted to the <NAME> , and <NAME> and seven of his soldiers had been mortally wounded ; besides this , a prisoner had been beheaded and the head carried from town to town , thus proving that the invaders could be conquered , and were nothing more than ordinary mortals .
<NAME> profited by these events to accuse the emperor of perfidy .
He declared that although <NAME> appeared friendly to him and to his soldiers , it was only that he might wait for some favourable opportunity to treat them in the same manner as <NAME> , a proceeding quite unworthy of a monarch , and very different from the confidence which <NAME> had shown in coming , as he had done , to visit him .
He went on to say that if the suspicions of the Spaniards were not justified , the emperor could easily exonerate himself by having <NAME> punished , and finally , to prevent the recurrence of aggressions which could but destroy the existing harmony , and to prove to the Mexicans that he harboured no ill-design against the <NAME> , <NAME> could not do otherwise than come to reside amongst them .
It may be easily imagined that the emperor was not very ready to decide upon this course , but was at last obliged to give in to the violence and threats of the <NAME> .
Upon announcing his resolution to his subjects , he was made to assure them several times over that he put himself into the hands of the <NAME> of his own free will ; these words were needed to calm the <NAME> , who threatened to make an attack upon the foreigners .
The success of <NAME> in this bold scheme was quite beyond his expectations .
<NAME> , with his son and five of the chief ringleaders in the revolt , were seized by the <NAME> , and brought before a <NAME> tribunal , which was at the same time judge and prosecutor ; the Indians were condemned and burnt alive .
Not content with having punished men who had committed no crime but that of executing the orders of their emperor , and of opposing an armed resistance to the invasion of their country , <NAME> imposed a new humiliation upon <NAME> , in placing fetters upon his feet , under the pretext that the culprits in their last moments had made accusations against him .
For six months the " Conquistador " exercised the supreme government in the name of the emperor , now reduced to a puppet-show of authority .
<NAME> changed the governors who displeased him , collected the taxes , presided over all the details of the administration , and sent <NAME> into the various provinces of the empire with orders to examine their productions , and to take particular notice of the mining districts and the processes in use for collecting gold .
<NAME> also turned to account the curiosity evinced by <NAME> to see <NAME> ships , to have rigging and other appurtenances brought from Vera-Cruz , and to order the construction of two brigantines destined to ensure his communications with terra-firma by the waters of the lake .
Emboldened by receiving so many proofs of submission and humility , <NAME> took another step in advance , and required that <NAME> should declare himself the vassal and tributary of <NAME> .
The act of fidelity and homage was accompanied , as may be easily imagined , with presents both rich and numerous , as well as by a heavy tax which was levied without much difficulty .
The opportunity was now taken to gather together everything in gold and silver , which had been extorted from the <NAME> , and to melt them down , except certain pieces which were kept as they were , on account of the beauty of the workmanship .
The whole did not amount to more than 600,000 pesos , or 100,000_l._ Thus , although the <NAME> had made use of all their power , and <NAME> had exhausted his treasures to satisfy them , the whole product amounted to an absurdly small sum , very little in accordance with the idea which the conquerors had formed of the riches of the country .
After reserving one-fifth of the treasure for the king , and one-fifth for <NAME> and subtracting enough to reimburse the sums which had been advanced for the expenses of the expedition , the share of each soldier did not amount to 100 _pesos_ , and they considered that it would have been more worth their while to have remained in <NAME> , than to have experienced such fatigues , encountered such great dangers , and suffered so many privations , all for the reward of 100 _pesos_ !
If the promises of <NAME> ended in this beggarly result , and if the partition had been made with fairness , of which they did not feel certain , they argued that it was absurd to remain longer in so poor a country , while under a chief less prodigal in promises , but more generous , they might go to countries rich in gold and precious stones , where brave warriors would find an adequate compensation for their toils .
So murmured these greedy adventurers ; some accepting what fell to their share while fuming over its small amount , others disdainfully refusing it .
<NAME> had succeeded in persuading <NAME> to conform to his will in everything which concerned politics , but it was otherwise in regard to religion .
He could not persuade him to change his creed , and when <NAME> wished to throw down the idols , as he had done at <NAME> , a tumult arose which would have become very serious , had he not immediately abandoned his project .
From that time the <NAME> , who had offered scarcely any resistance to the subjugation and imprisonment of their monarch , resolved to avenge their outraged deities , and they prepared a simultaneous rising against the invaders .
It was at this juncture , when the affairs in the interior seemed to be taking a less favourable turn , that <NAME> received news from Vera-Cruz , that several ships were cruising off the harbour .
At first he thought this must be a fleet sent to his aid by <NAME> , in answer to a letter which he had sent to him on the 16th of July , 1519 , by <NAME> and <NAME> .
But he was soon undeceived , and learnt that this expedition was organized by <NAME> , who knew by experience how lightly his lieutenant could shake off all dependence upon him ; he had sent this armament with the object of deposing <NAME> from his command , of making him a prisoner , and of carrying him off to <NAME> , where he would be speedily placed upon his trial .
The fleet thus sent was under the command of <NAME> de Narvaez ; it consisted of eighteen vessels , and carried eighty horse-soldiers , and 100 infantry ( of whom eighty were musketeers ) , 120 cross-bowmen , and twelve cannons .
<NAME> disembarked without opposition , near to the fort of <NAME> d'Ulloa , but upon summoning the Governor of Vera-Cruz , <NAME> , to give up the town to him , <NAME> seized the men who were charged with the insolent message , and sent them off to <NAME> , where <NAME> at once released them , and then gained from them circumstantial information as to the forces , and the projects of <NAME> .
The personal danger of <NAME> at this moment was great ; the troops sent by <NAME> were more numerous and better furnished with arms and ammunition than were his own , but his deepest cause of anxiety was not the possibility of his own condemnation and death , it was the fear lest all fruit of his efforts might be lost , and the knowledge of the hurtfulness of these dissensions to his country 's cause .
The situation was a critical one , but after mature reflection and the careful weighing of arguments for and against the course he meditated , <NAME> determined to fight , even at a disadvantage , rather than to sacrifice his conquests and the interests of <NAME> .
Before proceeding to this last extremity , he sent his chaplain <NAME> to <NAME> , but he was very ill-received , and saw all his proposals for an accommodation disdainfully rejected .
<NAME> met with more success amongst the soldiers , who most of them knew him , and to whom he distributed a number of chains , gold rings , and other jewels , which were well calculated to give them a high idea of the riches of the conqueror .
But when <NAME> heard of what was going on , he determined not to leave his troops any longer exposed to temptation ; he set a price upon the heads of <NAME> and his principal officers , and advanced to the encounter .
<NAME> , however , was too skilful to be enticed into giving battle under unfavourable circumstances .
He temporized and succeeded in tiring out <NAME> and his troops , who retired to <NAME> .
Then <NAME> , having taken his measures with consummate prudence , and the surprise and terror of a nocturnal attack which he organized compensating for the inferiority of his troops , he made prisoners of his enemy and all his soldiers , his own loss amounting to but two men .
The conqueror treated the vanquished well , and gave them the choice between returning to <NAME> , or remaining to share his fortune .
This latter proposal , backed up as it was by gifts and promises , appeared so seductive to the new arrivals , that <NAME> found himself at the head of 1000 soldiers , the day after he had been in danger of falling into the hands of <NAME> .
This rapid change of fortune was turned to the greatest advantage by the skilful diplomacy of <NAME> , who hastened to return to <NAME> .
The troops whom he had left there under the command of <NAME> , to guard the emperor and the treasure , were reduced to the last extremity by the natives , who had killed or wounded a great number of soldiers , and who kept the rest in a state of close blockade , while threatening them constantly with a general assault .
It must be confessed that the imprudent and criminal conduct of the <NAME> , and notably the massacre of the most distinguished citizens of the empire during a fête , had brought about the rising which they dreaded , and which they had hoped to prevent .
After having been joined by 2000 Tlascalans , <NAME> pressed forward by forced marches towards the capital , where he arrived in safety , and found that the <NAME> had not destroyed the bridges belonging to the causeways and dikes which joined <NAME> to the land .
In spite of the arrival of this reinforcement , the situation did not improve .
Each day it was necessary to engage in new combats , and to make sorties to clear the avenues leading to the palace occupied by the <NAME> .
<NAME> now saw but too plainly the mistake which he had made in shutting himself up in a town where his position might be stormed at any moment , and from which it was so difficult to extricate himself .
In this difficulty he had recourse to <NAME> , who , by virtue of his authority and of the prestige which still clung to him , could appease the tumult , give the Spaniards some respite , and enable them to prepare for their retreat .
But when the unfortunate emperor , now become a mere toy in the hands of the <NAME> , appeared upon the walls decked out with regal ornaments , and implored his subjects to cease from hostilities , murmurs of discontent arose , and threats were freely uttered .
Hostilities began afresh , and before the soldiers had time to protect him with their shields , <NAME> was pierced with arrows , and hit upon the head by a stone which knocked him down .
At this sight the <NAME> , horrified at the crime which they had just committed , at once ceased fighting , and fled in all directions , while the emperor , understanding but too late all the baseness of the part which <NAME> had forced him to play , tore off the bandages which had been applied to his wounds , and refusing all nourishment , he died cursing the <NAME> .
After so fatal an event , there was no more room to hope for peace with the <NAME> , and it became necessary to retire in haste , and at whatever cost , from a town in which the <NAME> were threatened with blockade and starvation .
For this retreat <NAME> was preparing in secret .
He saw his troops each day more and more closely hemmed in , whilst several times he was forced himself to take his sword in his hand and to fight like a common soldier .
<NAME> even relates , but upon what authority is not known , that during an assault which was made upon one of the edifices commanding the <NAME> quarter , two young Mexicans , recognizing <NAME> , who was cheering on his soldiers , resolved to sacrifice themselves in the hope of killing the man who had been the author of their country 's calamities .
They approached him in a suppliant attitude , as though they would ask for quarter , then seizing him round the waist they dragged him towards the battlements , over which they threw themselves , hoping to drag him over with them .
But thanks to his exceptional strength and agility <NAME> managed to escape from their embrace , and these two brave Mexicans perished in their generous but vain attempt to save their country .
The retreat being determined upon , it was necessary to decide upon whether it should be carried out by night or by day .
If in the daytime the enemy would be more easily resisted , any ambuscades which might be prepared would be more easily avoided , while they could better take precautions to repair any bridges broken by the <NAME> .
On the other hand , it was known that the <NAME> will seldom attack an enemy after sunset , but what really decided <NAME> in favour of a nocturnal retreat was , that a soldier who dabbled in astrology had declared to his comrades that success was certain if they acted in the night .
They therefore began their march at midnight .
Besides the <NAME> troops , <NAME> had under his orders detachments from <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , which , notwithstanding the serious losses which had been sustained , still numbered 7000 men .
<NAME> commanded the vanguard , and Cortès the centre , where were the cannon , baggage , and prisoners , amongst whom were a son and two daughters of <NAME> ; <NAME> and <NAME> de <NAME> led the rearguard .
With the army was carried a flying bridge , which had been constructed to throw over any gaps there might be in the causeway .
Scarcely had the <NAME> debouched upon the dike leading to <NAME> , which was the shortest of all , when they were attacked in front , flank , and rear by solid masses of the enemy , whilst from a fleet of numberless canoes , a perfect hailstorm of stones and missiles fell upon them .
Blinded and amazed , the allies knew not against whom to defend themselves first .
The wooden bridge sank under the weight of the artillery and fighting men .
Crowded together upon a narrow causeway where they could not use their fire-arms , deprived of their cavalry who had not room to act , mingled with the Indians in a hand-to-hand combat , not having strength to kill , and surrounded on all sides , the <NAME> and their allies gave way under the ever renewed numbers of the assailants .
Officers and soldiers , infantry and cavalry , <NAME> and Tlascalans were confounded together , each defended himself to the best of his ability , without caring about discipline or the common safety .
All seemed lost , when <NAME> with one hundred men succeeded in crossing the breach in the dike upon the mass of corpses which filled it up .
He drew up his soldiers in order as they arrived , and putting himself at the head of those least severely wounded , plunged wedge-fashion into the mêlée , and succeeded in disengaging from it a portion of his men .
Before day dawned all those who had succeeded in escaping from the massacre of the _noche triste_ , as this terrible night was called , found themselves reunited at <NAME> .
It was with eyes full of tears that <NAME> passed in review his remaining soldiers , all covered with wounds , and took account of the losses which he had sustained ; 4000 Indians , <NAME> , and <NAME> , and nearly all the horses were killed , all the artillery and ammunition , as well as the greatest part of the baggage , were lost , and amongst the dead were several officers of distinction -- <NAME> de <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and many others ; one of those most dangerously hurt was <NAME> , but not one man , whether officer or soldier , was without a wound .
The fugitives did not delay at <NAME> , and by accident they took the road to <NAME> , where they did not know what reception might await them .
Ever harassed by the <NAME> , the Spaniards were again obliged to give battle upon the plains of <NAME> to a number of warriors , whom some historians reckon at two hundred thousand .
<NAME> to the presence of some cavalry soldiers who still remained to him , <NAME> was able to overthrow all who were in front of him , and to reach a troop of persons whose high rank was easily discerned by their gilded plumes and luxurious costumes , amongst whom was the general bearing the standard .
Accompanied by some horsemen , <NAME> threw himself upon this group and was fortunate enough , or skilful enough , to overturn by a lance-thrust the <NAME> general , who was then despatched by the sword by a soldier named <NAME> de <NAME> .
From the moment when the standard disappeared the battle was gained , and the <NAME> , panic-stricken , fled hastily from the field of battle .
" Never had the Spaniards incurred greater danger , " says <NAME> , " and had it not been for the lucky star of <NAME> , not one would have survived to transmit to posterity the history of the sanguinary battle of <NAME> . "
The booty was considerable , and sufficed in part , to indemnify the <NAME> for the loss they had sustained in leaving <NAME> , for this army which they had just defeated was composed of the principal warriors of the nation , who , having been quite confident of success , had adorned themselves with their richest ornaments .
[ Illustration : Cortès at the <NAME> of <NAME> . ]
The day after the battle the <NAME> entered the territory of <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> says , " I shall now call the attention of curious readers to the fact that when we returned to <NAME> to the relief of <NAME> , we were in all 1300 men , including in that number ninety-seven horsemen , eighty cross-bowmen , and the same number armed with carbines ; besides , we had more than 2000 Tlascalans , and much artillery .
Our second entry into <NAME> took place on St. <NAME> 's Day , 1520 ; our flight from the city was on the 10th day of the month of July following , and we fought the memorable battle of <NAME> on the 14th day of this same month of July .
And now I would draw attention to the number of men who were killed at <NAME> during the passage of the causeways and bridges , in the battle of <NAME> , and in the other encounters upon the route .
I declare that in the space of five days 860 of our men were massacred , including ten of our soldiers and five <NAME> women , who were killed in the village of <NAME> ; we lost besides 1200 Tlascalans during the same time .
It is to be noticed also that if the number of dead in the troop of <NAME> were greater than in the troop of <NAME> , it was because the former soldiers set out on the march laden with a quantity of gold , the weight of which hindered them from swimming , and from getting out of the trenches . "
The troops with <NAME> were reduced to four hundred and forty men , with twenty horses , twelve cross-bowmen , and seven carabineers ; they had not a single charge of gunpowder , they were all wounded , lame , or maimed in the arms .
It was the same number of men that had followed <NAME> when he first entered <NAME> , but how great a difference was there between that conquering troop , and the vanquished soldiers who now quitted the capital .
As they entered the <NAME> territory <NAME> recommended his men , and especially those of <NAME> , not to do anything which could vex the natives , the common safety depending upon not irritating the only allies which remained to them .
Happily the fears which had arisen as to the fidelity of the <NAME> proved groundless .
They gave the Spaniards a most sympathizing welcome , and their thoughts seemed to be wholly bent upon avenging the death of their brothers massacred by the <NAME> .
While in their capital <NAME> heard of the loss of two more detachments , but these reverses , grave as they were , did not discourage him ; he had under his orders troops inured to war and faithful allies , Vera-Cruz was intact , he might once more reckon upon his good fortune .
But before undertaking a new campaign or entering upon another siege , help must be sought and preparations made , and with these objects in view the general set to work .
He sent four ships to <NAME> to enrol volunteers and purchase powder and ammunition , and meanwhile he caused trees to be cut down in the mountains of <NAME> , and with the wood thus obtained twelve brigantines were constructed , which were to be carried in pieces to the <NAME> of <NAME> , to be launched there at the moment when needed .
After suppressing some attempts at mutiny amongst the soldiers , in which those who had come with <NAME> were the most to blame , <NAME> again marched forwards , and , with the help of the Tlascalans , first attacked the people of <NAME> and of other neighbouring provinces , a measure which had the advantage of exercising anew his own troops in war , and of training his allies .
While this was going on , two brigantines bringing ammunition and reinforcements fell into the hands of <NAME> ; these ships had been sent to <NAME> by <NAME> , in ignorance of his misadventures ; at this time also some Spaniards sent by <NAME> de <NAME> , governor of <NAME> , joined the army .
In consequence of these reinforcements the troops with <NAME> , after he had rid himself of several partisans of <NAME> with whom he was dissatisfied , amounted to five hundred infantry , of whom eighty carried muskets , and forty horse-soldiers .
With this small army , and with one thousand Tlascalans , <NAME> set out once more for <NAME> on the 28th of December , 1520 , six months after he had been forced to abandon the city .
This campaign had for its theatre countries already described , and must therefore be passed over somewhat rapidly here , notwithstanding the interest attaching to it ; to enter fully into the history of the conquest of <NAME> would not be in accordance with the primary object of this work .
After the death of <NAME> his brother <NAME> was raised to the throne , and he adopted all the measures of precaution compatible with <NAME> strategic science .
But he died of the smallpox , the sad gift of the <NAME> to the <NAME> , at the very moment when his brilliant qualities of foresight and bravery were the most needed by his country .
His successor was <NAME> , the nephew of <NAME> , a man distinguished by his talents and courage .
<NAME> had no sooner entered the <NAME> territory than fighting began .
He speedily captured the town of <NAME> , which was situated at twenty miles ' distance , upon the edge of the great central lake , that lake upon whose waters the Spaniards were to see an imposing flotilla floating three months later .
At this time a fresh conspiracy , which had for its object the assassination of <NAME> and his principal officers , was discovered , and the chief culprit executed .
At this moment fate seemed in every way to smile upon <NAME> ; he had just received the news of the arrival of fresh reinforcements at Vera-Cruz , and the greater part of the towns under the dominion of <NAME> had submitted to the force of his arms .
The actual siege of <NAME> began in the month of May , 1521 , and continued with alternate success and reverse until the day when the brigantines were launched upon the water of the lake .
The Mexicans did not hesitate to attack them ; from four to five thousand canoes , each bearing two men , covered the lake and advanced to the assault of the <NAME> vessels , which carried in all nearly three hundred men .
These nine brigantines were provided with cannon , and soon dispersed or sunk the enemy 's fleet , who thenceforth left them in undisputed possession of the water .
But this success and certain other advantages gained by <NAME> had no very marked consequences , and the siege dragged slowly on , until the general made up his mind to capture the town by force .
Unfortunately the officer who was charged with protecting the line of retreat by the causeways while the Spaniards were making their way into the town , abandoned his post , thinking it unworthy of his valour , and went to join in the combat .
<NAME> was informed of the fault which had been committed , and at once took advantage of it .
His troops attacked the Spaniards on all sides with such fury that numbers of them were killed in a short time , while sixty-two of the soldiers fell alive into the hands of the <NAME> , a fate which <NAME> , who was severely wounded in the thigh , narrowly escaped sharing .
During the night following , the great temple of the war-god was illuminated in sign of triumph , and the <NAME> listened in profound sadness to the beating of the great drum .
From the position they occupied they could witness the end of the prisoners , their unfortunate countrymen , whose breasts were opened and their hearts torn out , and whose dead bodies were hurled down the steps ; they were then torn in pieces by the <NAME> , who quarrelled over the pieces with the object of using them for a horrible festival .
This terrible defeat caused the siege to go on slowly , until the day came when three parts of the city having been taken or destroyed , <NAME> was obliged by his councillors to quit <NAME> and to set out for the mainland , where he reckoned upon organizing his resistance , but the boat which carried him being seized he was made prisoner .
In his captivity he was destined to display much greater dignity and strength of character than his uncle <NAME> had done .
From this time all resistance ceased , and <NAME> might take possession of the half-destroyed capital .
After a heroic resistance , in which 120,000 Mexicans according to some accounts , but 240,000 according to others , had perished , after a siege which had lasted not less than seventy days , <NAME> , and with the city all the rest of the empire , succumbed , less indeed to the blows dealt against it by the Spaniards than to the long-standing hatred and the revolts of the subjugated people , and to the jealousy of the neighbouring states , fated soon to regret the yoke which they had so deliberately shaken off .
<NAME> and rage soon succeeded amongst the <NAME> to the intoxication of success ; the immense riches upon which they had reckoned either had no existence , or they had been thrown into the lake .
<NAME> found it impossible to calm the malcontents , and was obliged to allow the emperor and his principal minister to be put to the torture .
Some historians , and notably <NAME> , report that whilst the Spaniards were stirring the fire which burnt below the gridiron upon which the two victims were extended , the minister turned his head towards his master and apparently begged him to speak , in order to put an end to their tortures ; but that <NAME> reproved this single moment of weakness by these words , " And I , am I assisting at some pleasure , or am I in the bath ? "
an answer which has been poetically changed into , " And I , do I lie upon roses ? "
[ Illustration : The <NAME> stir the fire burning below the gridiron . ]
The historians of the conquest of <NAME> have usually stopped short at the taking of <NAME> , but it remains for us to speak of some other expeditions undertaken by <NAME> with different aims , but which resulted in casting quite a new light upon some portions of <NAME> ; besides we could not leave this hero , who played so large a part in the history of the <NAME> and in the development of its civilization , without giving some details of the end of his life .
With the fall of the capital was involved , properly speaking , that of the <NAME> empire ; if there were still some resistance , as notably there was in the province of <NAME> , it was of an isolated character , and a few detachments of troops sufficed to reduce to submission the last remaining opponents of the <NAME> , terrified as the Mexicans were by the punishments which had been dealt out to the people of <NAME> , who had revolted .
At the same time ambassadors were sent by the people of the distant countries of the empire , to convince themselves of the reality of that wonderful event , the taking of <NAME> , to behold the ruins of the abhorred town , and to tender their submission to the conquerors .
<NAME> was at length confirmed in the position he held after incidents which would take too long to relate , and which caused him to say , " It has been harder for me to fight against my countrymen than against the <NAME> . "
It now remained to him to organize the conquered country , and he began by establishing the seat of government at <NAME> , which he rebuilt .
He attracted <NAME> to the city by granting them concessions of lands , and the <NAME> , by allowing them at first to remain under the authority of their native chiefs , although he speedily reduced them all , except the Tlascalans , to the condition of slaves , by the vicious system of _repartimientos_ , in vogue in the <NAME> colonies .
But if it is justifiable to reproach <NAME> with having held cheaply the political rights of the <NAME> , it must be conceded that he manifested the most laudable solicitude for their spiritual well-being .
To further this object he brought over some Franciscans , who by their zeal and charity in a short time gained the veneration of the natives , and in a space of twenty years brought about the conversion of the whole population .
At the same time <NAME> sent some troops into the state of <NAME> , who penetrated as far as the <NAME> , and as they returned visited some of the rich provinces situated in the north .
<NAME> founded settlements in all the parts of the country which appeared to him advantageous : at <NAME> upon the shores of the <NAME> , at <NAME> in <NAME> , at <NAME> near <NAME> , at <NAME> near Vera-Cruz , & c. Immediately after the pacification of the country , <NAME> entrusted <NAME> de <NAME> with the command of a considerable force , in order to establish a colony in <NAME> , and at the same time <NAME> was to explore the southern coast of that province , and to seek for a strait which should form a communication between the <NAME> and <NAME> .
But , carried away by the pride of command , <NAME> had no sooner reached his destination than he declared himself independent , whereupon Cortès immediately despatched one of his relations to arrest the culprit , and set out himself , accompanied by <NAME> , at the head of one hundred horsemen and fifty foot-soldiers , on the 12th of October , 1524 .
After crossing the provinces of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , and enduring all kinds of privations in the course of a most trying march over marshy and shifting ground , and across a perfect ocean of undulating forests , the detachment was approaching the province of <NAME> , when <NAME> was told of the existence of a plot , formed , as was said , by <NAME> and the principal <NAME> chiefs .
Its aim was to seize the first opportunity to massacre both officers and soldiers , after which the march to <NAME> was to be continued , the settlements were to be destroyed , and then there was to be a return to <NAME> , where during a general rising there would doubtless be small difficulty experienced in getting rid of the invaders .
<NAME> in vain protested his innocence , in which there is every reason to believe ; he was hung , as well as several of the <NAME> nobles , upon the branches of a <NAME> tree , which shaded the road .
<NAME> <NAME> del <NAME> says , " The execution of <NAME> was very unjust , and we were all agreed in condemning it . "
But <NAME> says , " If <NAME> had consulted but his own interest and his renown , he should have spared him , for he was the living trophy of his victory , as a man keeps gold in the lining of his coat . "
At length the <NAME> reached <NAME> , a flourishing town , where they refreshed themselves after their journey in excellent quarters ; when they set out again , it was in the direction of the <NAME> of <NAME> , a part of the country where the population was easily converted to <NAME> .
We shall not dwell upon the sufferings and misery which tried the expedition in these sparsely-peopled countries , until it arrived at <NAME> de Buena-Vista , upon the <NAME> , where <NAME> , after receiving the news of the execution of <NAME> and the re-establishment of the central authority , embarked upon his return to <NAME> .
At this time he entrusted to Alvarado the command of three hundred infantry , one hundred and sixty cavalry , and four cannon , with a body of <NAME> auxiliaries , with which he set out for the south of <NAME> , to conquer <NAME> .
He reduced to submission the provinces of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and laid the foundations of the town of <NAME> la Vieja ; when , some time afterwards he made a voyage to <NAME> , he was named by <NAME> governor of the countries which he had conquered .
Three years had not expired after the conquest , before a territory 1200 miles in length upon the sea-board of the <NAME> , and 1500 miles upon that of the <NAME> , had submitted to the <NAME> crown , and with but few exceptions , was in a state of perfect tranquillity .
The return of <NAME> to <NAME> from the useless expedition to <NAME> -- which had wasted so much time and caused almost as great sufferings to the <NAME> as the conquest of <NAME> -- had taken place but a few days , when he received the news that he was temporarily replaced by another commander , and was invited to repair to <NAME> to exculpate himself from certain charges .
He was not in any haste to comply with this order , hoping that it might be revoked , but his indefatigable calumniators and his implacable enemies , both in <NAME> and <NAME> , preferred accusations against him after such a manner , that he found himself obliged to go and make his defence , to state his wrongs , and boldly to claim the approval of his conduct .
<NAME> therefore started accompanied by his friend <NAME> , as well as by <NAME> und several Aztec chiefs , amongst whom was a son of <NAME> .
He disembarked at <NAME> , in May , 1528 , at the same place where <NAME> had landed thirty-five years before , and he was welcomed with the same enthusiasm and rejoicings as the discoverer of <NAME> had been ; here <NAME> met with <NAME> , then at the outset of his career , who was come to solicit the support of the <NAME> government .
<NAME> afterwards set out for <NAME> , where the court then was .
The mere announcement of his return had produced a complete change in public opinion .
His unexpected arrival at once contradicted the idea that he harboured any projects of revolt and independence .
<NAME> V. saw that public feeling would be outraged at the thought of punishing a man who had added its greatest gem to the crown of <NAME> , and so the journey of <NAME> became one continual triumph in the midst of crowds of people greater than had been ever known before .
" The houses and streets of the large towns and of the villages , " says <NAME> , " were filled with spectators impatient to contemplate the hero whose single arm might be said , in some sort , to have conquered an empire for <NAME> , and who , to borrow the language of an old historian , marched in all the pomp and glory , not of a great vassal , but of an independent monarch . "
<NAME> V. , after having granted several audiences to <NAME> , and bestowed upon him those particular marks of favour which are termed important by courtiers , deigned to accept from him the empire which he had conquered for him , and the magnificent presents which he brought .
But he considered that he had fully recompensed him when he had given Cortès the title of <NAME> della <NAME> , and the post of captain-general of <NAME> , without , however , restoring to him the civil government , a power which had been formerly delegated to him by the junta of Vera-Cruz .
<NAME> , after his marriage with the niece of the <NAME> de <NAME> , who belonged to one of the first families in <NAME> , accompanied the emperor , who was on his way to <NAME> , to the port of embarkation ; but the general , soon becoming tired of the frivolities of a court , so little in accordance with the active habits of his past life , set out again for <NAME> in 1530 , and landed at <NAME> .
After his arrival he underwent some annoyance caused by the <NAME> , which had exercised the power in his absence , and which had instituted law-suits against him , and he also found himself in conflict with the new civil junta on the subject of military affairs .
The <NAME> della <NAME> withdrew himself to <NAME> , where he had immense estates , and busied himself with agriculture .
He was the means of introducing the sugar-cane and the mulberry into <NAME> , he also encouraged the cultivation of hemp and flax , and the breeding , on a large scale , of merino sheep .
But this peaceable life without adventures could not long satisfy the enterprising spirit of <NAME> .
In 1532 and 1533 , he equipped two squadrons destined to make voyages of discovery in the north-west of the <NAME> .
The latter expedition reached the southern extremity of the peninsula of <NAME> without attaining the object sought , namely the discovery of a strait uniting the <NAME> with the <NAME> .
<NAME> himself met with no better success in 1536 in the <NAME> ( Gulf of <NAME> ) .
Three years later a concluding expedition , of which <NAME> gave the command to <NAME> , penetrated to the farthest extremity of the gulf , and then , sailing along the exterior side of the peninsula , reached the 29 degrees of north latitude .
From thence the chief of the expedition sent back one of his ships to <NAME> , while the rest proceeded northwards , but from that time nothing more is heard of them .
<NAME> was the unhappy result of the expeditions of <NAME> , which , while they did not bring him in a single ducat , cost him not less than 300,000 gold castellanos .
But they at least had the result of making known the coast of the <NAME> , from the <NAME> of <NAME> as far as <NAME> .
The tour of the <NAME> <NAME> was made , and it was thus discovered that what had been imagined to be an island , was in reality a part of the continent .
The whole of the <NAME> , or Sea of <NAME> , as the <NAME> justly named it , was carefully explored , and it was ascertained that , instead of having an outlet as was supposed to the north , it was in reality only a gulf deeply hollowed into the continent .
<NAME> had not been able to fit out these expeditions without coming into antagonism with the viceroy <NAME> de <NAME> , whom the emperor had sent to <NAME> , an appointment which had wounded the feelings of the <NAME> della <NAME> .
Wearied with these continual , annoyances , and indignant at finding his prerogative as captain-general , if not absolutely ignored , at least perpetually questioned , <NAME> left <NAME> , and once more set out for <NAME> .
But this journey was not destined at all to resemble the first .
<NAME> old , disgusted with life , and betrayed by fortune , the " conquistador " had no longer anything to expect from government .
He had not to wait long before receiving proof of this ; one day he pressed through the crowd which surrounded the emperor 's coach , and mounted upon the step of the door .
<NAME> V. pretended not to recognize him , and asked who this man was .
<NAME> answered proudly , " It is the man who has given you more States than your father left you Towns . "
By this time public interest was diverted from <NAME> , which had not yielded as much as had been expected from it , and was centred upon the marvellous riches of <NAME> .
<NAME> was , however , received with honour by the supreme council of the <NAME> , and permitted to state his complaints before it , but the debates upon the subject were endlessly drawn out , and he could obtain no redress .
In 1541 , during the disastrous expedition of <NAME> against <NAME> , <NAME> , who was serving in it as a volunteer , but whose counsels had not been listened to , had the misfortune to lose three great carved emeralds , jewels which would have sufficed for the ransom of an empire .
Upon his return he renewed his solicitations , but with the same want of success .
His grief over this injustice and these repeated disappointments was so deep , that his health suffered severely ; he died far from the scene of his exploits , on the 10th of November , 1547 , at <NAME> de la <NAME> , at the very moment when he was making preparations to return to <NAME> .
" He was a true knight errant , " says <NAME> ; " of all that glorious troop of adventurers which the <NAME> of the sixteenth century sent forth to a career of discovery and conquest , there was not one more deeply imbued with the spirit of romantic enterprise than <NAME> .
<NAME> was his delight , and he loved to attempt an enterprise by its most difficult side . " ...
This passion for the romantic might have reduced the conqueror of <NAME> to the part of a common adventurer , but <NAME> was certainly a profound politician and a great captain , if one is justified in giving this name to a man who accomplished great actions by his own unassisted genius .
There is no other example in history of so great an enterprise having been carried to a successful end with such inadequate means .
It may be said with truth that <NAME> conquered <NAME> with his own resources alone .
His influence over the minds of his soldiers was the natural result of their confidence in his ability , but it must be attributed also to his popular manners , which rendered him eminently fit to lead a band of adventurers .
When he had attained to a higher rank , if <NAME> displayed more of pomp , his veterans at least continued on the same terms of intimacy with him as before .
In finishing this portrait of the " conquistador , " we shall quote the upright and veracious <NAME> , with whose sentiments we fully agree .
" He preferred his name of <NAME> to all the titles by which he might be addressed , and he had good reasons for it , for the name of <NAME> is as famous in our days as that of <NAME> amongst the <NAME> , or Hannibal amongst the Carthaginians . "
The old chronicler ends by a touch which vividly depicts the religious spirit of the sixteenth century : " Perhaps he was destined to receive his reward only in a better world , and I fully believe it to be so ; for he was an honest knight , very sincere in his devotions to the <NAME> , to the <NAME> , and to all the saints . "
The triple alliance -- <NAME> and his brothers -- <NAME> d'Almagro -- First attempts -- <NAME> , its extent , people , and kings -- Capture of <NAME> , his ransom and death -- <NAME> d'Alvarado -- Almagro in <NAME> -- Strife among the conquerors -- Trial and execution of <NAME> -- Expeditions of <NAME> and <NAME> -- Assassination of <NAME> -- Rebellion and execution of his brother <NAME> .
The information which had been gained by <NAME> as to the riches of the countries situated to the south of <NAME> had scarcely become known to the <NAME> before several expeditions were organized to attempt the conquest of them .
But all had failed , either from the means used being insufficient , or from the commanders not being equal to the greatness of the undertaking .
It must be confessed also that the localities explored by these first adventurers -- these pioneers , as they would be called now-a-days -- did not at all come up to what <NAME> greed had expected from them , and for this reason , that all the attempts had been hitherto made upon what was then called " <NAME> , " a country pre-eminently unhealthy , mountainous , marshy , and covered with forests ; the inhabitants were few , but of so warlike a disposition that they had added another obstacle to all those which nature had strewn with so prodigal a hand in the path of the invaders .
<NAME> by little , therefore , the enthusiasm had cooled , and the wonderful narratives of <NAME> were mentioned only to be turned into ridicule .
There lived , however , in <NAME> a man well able to weigh the truth of the reports which had been circulated concerning the richness of the countries bathed by the <NAME> ; this man was <NAME> , who had accompanied <NAME> de <NAME> to the southern sea , and who now associated with himself two other adventurers , <NAME> de <NAME> and <NAME> .
A few words must be said about the chiefs of the enterprise .
<NAME> <NAME> , born near <NAME> between the years 1471 and 1478 , was the natural son of a certain Captain <NAME> , who had taught the boy nothing but to take care of pigs ; he was soon tired of this occupation , and took advantage of his having allowed one of the animals who were in his charge to stray , not to return to the paternal roof , where he was accustomed to be cruelly beaten for the smallest peccadillo .
The young <NAME> enlisted , and after passing some years amidst the <NAME> wars , he followed <NAME> to <NAME> in 1510 .
He served there with distinction , and also in <NAME> ; afterwards he accompanied <NAME> to <NAME> , discovered , as has been already mentioned , the <NAME> , with <NAME> , and after the execution of the latter , he assisted <NAME> , whose favourite he had become , in the conquest of all the country known as <NAME> d'Or .
While <NAME> was an illegitimate child , <NAME> de <NAME> was a foundling , picked up according to some in 1475 at <NAME> del Rey , but according to others at <NAME> , from which circumstance , as they maintain , he derived his name .
He was educated in the midst of soldiers , and while still young went to <NAME> , where he had succeeded in amassing a small fortune .
<NAME> de <NAME> was a rich ecclesiastic of <NAME> , who exercised the calling of a schoolmaster at <NAME> .
The youngest of these adventurers was by this time more than fifty years of age , and <NAME> la <NAME> relates that upon their project being known , they became the objects of general derision ; <NAME> de <NAME> was the most laughed at , and was called by no other name than _Hernando el <NAME> , <NAME> the <NAME> .
The terms of partnership were soon agreed upon between these three men , of whom two at least were without fear , if they were not all three without reproach .
<NAME> furnished money needed for the armament of the vessels and the pay of the soldiers , and <NAME> bore an equal part in the expense , but <NAME> , who possessed nothing but his sword , was to pay his contribution in another manner .
It was he who took the command of the first attempt , upon which we shall dwell in some detail , because it was then that the perseverance and inflexible obstinacy of the " conquistador " first came fully into sight .
One of the historians of the conquest of <NAME> , <NAME> de <NAME> , relates as follows : -- " Having then asked and obtained the permission of <NAME> d'Avila , <NAME> after much trouble equipped a vessel upon which he embarked with 140 men .
At the distance of 150 miles from Panama he discovered a small and poor province named <NAME> , which caused the same name to be henceforward improperly bestowed upon all the country which was discovered along that coast for the space of more than 3600 miles in length .
Passing onwards he discovered another country , which the <NAME> called _the burnt people_ .
The <NAME> slew so many of his men that he was constrained to retire in great disorder to the country of <NAME> , which is not far distant from the place whence he had started .
<NAME> , however , who had remained at <NAME> , fitted out a ship there , upon which he embarked with seventy Spaniards , and descended the coast as far as the <NAME> , 300 miles from <NAME> .
Not having met with <NAME> , he went back northwards as far as _the burnt people_ , where , having ascertained by certain indications that <NAME> had been there , he landed his men .
But the <NAME> , puffed up by the victory which they had gained over <NAME> , resisted bravely , forced the entrenchments with which <NAME> had covered his position , and obliged him to re-embark .
He returned therefore , still following the coast-line until he arrived at <NAME> , where he found <NAME> .
They were much rejoiced at meeting again , and having added to their followers some fresh soldiers whom they had levied , they found their troops amounted to 200 Spaniards , and once more they descended the coast .
They suffered so much from scarcity of provisions and from the attacks of the <NAME> , that <NAME> returned to <NAME> to collect more recruits and to obtain provisions .
He took back with him eighty men , with whom and with those who remained to them , they went as far as the country called <NAME> , a country moderately peopled and where they found abundance of provisions .
They noticed that the Indians of these parts who attacked them and made war against them , had their faces studded with nails of gold inserted in holes which they had made expressly for receiving these ornaments .
<NAME> de <NAME> returned once again to <NAME> , whilst his companion waited for him and for the reinforcements which he was to bring with him , in a small island called <NAME> , where he suffered much from the scarcity of all the necessaries of life . "
[ Illustration : The <NAME> kill many of the <NAME> . ]
Upon his arrival in <NAME> , <NAME> could not obtain permission from <NAME> , the successor of <NAME> , to make new levies , for he had no right , <NAME> <NAME> said , to allow a greater number of people to go and perish uselessly in a rash enterprise ; he even sent a boat to <NAME> to bring away <NAME> and his companions .
But such a decision could not be pleasing to <NAME> and <NAME> .
It meant expense thrown away ; and it meant the annihilation of the hopes which the sight of the ornaments of gold and silver of the inhabitants of <NAME> had caused them to entertain .
They sent therefore a trusty person to <NAME> , to recommend him to persevere in his resolution , and to refuse to obey the orders of the Governor of <NAME> .
But <NAME> in vain held out the most seductive promises ; the remembrance of the fatigues which had been endured was too recent , and all his companions except twelve abandoned him .
With these intrepid men , whose names have been preserved , and amongst whom was <NAME> de <NAME> , one of the historians of the expedition , <NAME> retired to an uninhabited island at a greater distance from the coast , to which he gave the name of <NAME> .
There the <NAME> lived miserably on mangles , fish , and shell-fish , and awaited for five months the succour that <NAME> and <NAME> were to send them .
At length , vanquished by the unanimous protestations of the whole colony , -- who were indignant that people whose only crime was that they had not despaired of success , should be left to perish miserably and as though they were malefactors , -- <NAME> sent to Pizarro a small vessel to bring him back .
With the object of presenting no temptation to <NAME> to make use of this ship to renew his expedition , not a single soldier was placed on board of her .
At the sight of the help which had arrived , and oblivious of all their privations , the thirteen adventurers thought of nothing but persuading the sailors who came to seek them to participate in their own hopes .
<NAME> , instead of starting again on the route to <NAME> , they sailed all together , towards the south-east , in spite of contrary winds and currents , until , after having discovered the <NAME> of <NAME> , they arrived at the port of <NAME> , situated beyond the 3 degrees of south latitude , where they saw a magnificent temple and a palace belonging to the <NAME> , the sovereigns of the country .
The country was populous and fairly well-cultivated , but what proved beyond all else seductive to the <NAME> , and made them think that they had reached the marvellous countries of which so much had been said , was the sight of so great an abundance of gold and silver , that these metals were employed not only as finery and ornament by the inhabitants , but also for making vases and common utensils .
<NAME> caused the interior of the country to be explored by <NAME> de <NAME> and <NAME> , who brought back an enthusiastic description of it , and he caused some gold vases to be given up to him , as well as some llamas , a quadruped domesticated by the Peruvians .
He took two natives on board his vessel , to whom he proposed to teach the <NAME> language , and to use them as interpreters when he should return to the country .
He anchored successively at <NAME> , <NAME> , and in the <NAME> of Santa-Cruz , of which the sovereign , <NAME> , received the strangers with such friendly demonstrations , that several of them were unwilling to re-embark .
After having sailed down the coast as far as <NAME> , <NAME> set out on his return to <NAME> , where he arrived after three whole years spent in dangerous explorations , which had completely ruined <NAME> and <NAME> .
[ Illustration : <NAME> received by <NAME> ] <NAME> resolved to apply to <NAME> before undertaking the conquest of the country which he had discovered , for he could not obtain leave from <NAME> to engage fresh adventurers ; so he borrowed the sum required for the voyage , and in 1528 he went to <NAME> to inform the emperor of the work which he had undertaken .
He painted the picture of the countries that were to be conquered in the most pleasing light , and as a reward for his labours the titles of governor , captain-general , and alguazil-major of <NAME> were bestowed upon him and his heirs in perpetuity .
At the same time he was ennobled , and a pension of 1000 crowns was bestowed upon him .
His jurisdiction , independent of the governor of <NAME> , was to extend over a tract of 600 miles along the coast to the south of the <NAME> river ; it was to be called <NAME> , and he was to be the governor ; concessions that cost nothing to <NAME> , for <NAME> had yet to conquer the country .
On his side he undertook to raise a body of 250 men , and to provide himself with the necessary ships , arms , and ammunition .
<NAME> then repaired to <NAME> , where he persuaded his three brothers <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> to accompany him , as well as one of his half-brothers <NAME> d'Alcantara .
He took advantage of his stay in his native town , and at <NAME> , to try to raise recruits , both there and throughout <NAME> ; they did not , however , come forward in large numbers , in spite of the title of _Caballeros de la <NAME> dorada_ which he promised to bestow upon all who would serve under him .
Then he returned to <NAME> , where affairs were not going so smoothly as he had hoped .
He had succeeded in getting <NAME> named <NAME> _protector de los <NAME> ; but for <NAME> , whose talents he knew , and whose ambition he feared , he had only asked that he should be ennobled and a gratuity of 500 ducats bestowed upon him , with the government of a fortress which was to be built at <NAME> .
<NAME> refused to take part in this new expedition ; he was not pleased with the meagre portion given to him after spending all his money on the earlier expeditions ; he wished now to organize one on his own account .
It required all <NAME> 's address , aided by the promise to give up to Almagro the office of _adelantado_ , to appease him and make him consent to renew the old partnership .
The resources of the three partners were so limited at this time , that they could only get together three small ships and 124 soldiers , of whom thirty-six were horse-soldiers ; the expedition set out in February , 1531 , under the command of <NAME> and his four brothers , whilst <NAME> remained at <NAME> to organize an expedition of supplies .
At the end of thirteen days ' sailing , and after having been carried by a storm 300 miles more to the south than he had intended , <NAME> was forced to disembark both men and horses on the shores of the <NAME> of <NAME> , and to follow the line of the coast on land .
This march was a difficult one in a very mountainous country , thinly-peopled , and intersected by rivers which had to be crossed at their mouths .
At last a place called <NAME> was reached , where was found a great booty , which decided <NAME> to send back two of his ships .
They carried to <NAME> and <NAME> spoils to the amount of 30,000 _castellanos_ , as well as a great number of emeralds , a rich booty , which would , according to <NAME> , determine many adventurers to come and join him .
Then the conqueror continued his march southwards as far as <NAME> , where he was joined by <NAME> and <NAME> , who brought him twelve horsemen and thirty foot-soldiers .
The effect which had been produced in <NAME> by the sight of the horses and the reports of the fire-arms was repeated in <NAME> , and <NAME> was able to reach the <NAME> of <NAME> in the Gulf of <NAME> without encountering any resistance .
But the islanders were more numerous and more warlike than their brothers of the mainland , and for six months they valiantly resisted all the attacks of the <NAME> .
Although <NAME> had received some aid from <NAME> , brought by <NAME> , and although he had beheaded the cacique <NAME> and sixteen of the principal chiefs , he could not overcome their resistance .
He was , therefore , obliged to regain the continent , where the maladies peculiar to the country tried his companions so cruelly , that he was forced to stay three months at <NAME> , exposed to the perpetual attacks of the natives .
From Tumbez he went next to the <NAME> , discovered the harbour of <NAME> , the best on this coast , and founded the colony of San-Miguel , at the mouth of the <NAME> , in order that vessels coming from <NAME> might find a safe shelter .
It was here that <NAME> received some envoys from <NAME> , who informed him of the revolt of <NAME> , the brother of <NAME> , and asked his aid .
At the period when the <NAME> landed to conquer <NAME> , it extended along the shore of the <NAME> for 1500 miles , and stretched into the interior as far as the imposing chain of the Andes .
Originally the population was divided into savage and barbarous tribes , having no idea of civilization , and living in a perpetual state of warfare with one another .
For many centuries affairs had continued in the same state , and there appeared no presage of the coming of a better era , when , on the shores of <NAME> , there appeared to the Indians a man and woman , who pretended that they were the <NAME> of the <NAME> .
They called themselves Manco-Capac and Mama-Oello , and were of majestic appearance ; according to <NAME> la Vega , towards the middle of the twelfth century they united together a number of wandering tribes , and laid the foundations of the town of <NAME> .
Manco-Capac had taught the men agriculture and mechanical arts , whilst Mama-Oello instructed the women in spinning and weaving .
When Manco-Capac had satisfied these first needs of all societies , he framed laws for his subjects , and constituted a regular political state .
It was thus that the dominion of the <NAME> or Lords of <NAME> was established .
At first their empire was limited to the neighbourhood of <NAME> , but under their successors it rapidly increased , and extended from the Tropic of <NAME> to the <NAME> , a length of thirty degrees .
The power of the incas was as absolute as that of the ancient <NAME> sovereigns .
" Also , " says <NAME> , " there was perhaps no other country in the world where the obedience and submission of the subjects was carried further .
The incas were to them quasi-divinities ; they had but to place a thread drawn from the royal head-fillet in the hands of any one , and the man so distinguished , was certain to be everywhere respected and obeyed , and to find such absolute deference paid to the king 's order which he carried , that he could alone exterminate a whole province without any assistance from soldiers , and cause to be put to death all the inhabitants , both male and female , because at the mere sight of this thread , taken from the royal crown , the people voluntarily and without any resistance , offered themselves up to die . "
However , the old chroniclers all agree in saying that this unlimited power was always used by the incas for the well-being of their subjects .
Out of a series of twelve kings , who in succession sat on the throne of <NAME> , there was not one who did not leave behind him the memory of a just prince adored by his subjects .
Should we not search in vain through the annals of any other country in the world for facts analogous to these ?
Must it not be regretted that the <NAME> should have brought war with all its attendant horrors , and the maladies and vices of a different climate , along with what they in their pride called civilization , amongst a rich and happy people , whose descendants , impoverished and debased as they are , have not even the recollection of their ancient prosperity to console them in their irremediable decay ?
" The Peruvians , " says <NAME> in his admirable _Précis d'Histoire <NAME> , " handed down the principal facts to posterity by knots , which they made in ropes .
They had obelisks and exact gnomons to mark the equinoxes and solstices .
Their year consisted of 365 days .
They had erected prodigies of architecture , and they carved statues with amazing art .
They formed the most polished and industrious nation of the <NAME> . "
The inca Huayna-Capac , father of <NAME> , under whom this vast empire was destroyed , had done much to increase and embellish it .
This inca , who conquered all the country of <NAME> , had made , by the hands of his soldiers and of the vanquished people , a great road 1500 miles in length from <NAME> to <NAME> , across precipices which had been filled up and mountains which had been levelled .
Relays of men , stationed at intervals of a mile and a half from each other , carried the emperor 's orders throughout the empire .
<NAME> was their police , and if we wish to judge of <NAME> magnificence , we need only instance the fact that the king when he travelled was carried on a throne of gold which weighed 25,000 ducats , and the golden litter upon which the throne rested was borne by the highest personages of the realm .
In 1526 , when the <NAME> appeared on the coast for the first time , the twelfth inca had lately married -- in defiance of the ancient law of the kingdom -- the daughter of the vanquished king of <NAME> , and had had a son of this marriage named <NAME> , to whom he left this kingdom on his death , which happened about 1529 .
His eldest son <NAME> , whose mother was descended from the incas , had the remainder of his states .
But this partition , so contrary to the customs established from time immemorial , caused such great discontent at <NAME> , that <NAME> , encouraged by his subjects , determined to march against his brother , who would not acknowledge him for his lord and master .
<NAME> , in his turn , had too lately tasted power to be willing to abandon it .
He managed by bribes to attach to himself the greater part of the warriors who had accompanied his father during the conquest of <NAME> , and when the two armies met , fortune favoured the usurper .
Is it not curious to remark how both in <NAME> and <NAME> the <NAME> were aided by entirely exceptional circumstances ?
In <NAME> some of the people who had recently submitted to the <NAME> race , being mercilessly trampled upon by their conquerors , welcome the <NAME> as deliverers ; in Peru the strife between two brothers , furious against each other , hinders the Indians from turning all their forces against the invaders whom they might easily have crushed .
<NAME> upon receiving the envoys sent by <NAME> , to ask his aid against his brother <NAME> , whom he represented as a rebel and usurper , saw at once all the advantages that might accrue to him from these circumstances .
He saw that by espousing the cause of one of the brothers , he could more easily crush them both , therefore he advanced at once into the interior of the country , at the head of a very inconsiderable force , consisting of sixty-two cavalry and one hundred and twenty foot-soldiers , of whom only twenty were armed with arquebuses and muskets ; he was obliged to leave part of his troops to guard San-Miguel , in which <NAME> reckoned upon finding a refuge in case of his being unsuccessful , and where in any case all supplies which might arrive could be landed .
<NAME> first made for <NAME> , a small town situated at about twenty days ' march from the coast .
To reach it he had to cross a desert of burning sand , without vegetation and without water , which extended for sixty miles in length as far as the province of <NAME> , and where the slightest attack of the enemy , joined to the sufferings endured by the little army , would have been sufficient to crush the whole expedition at one blow .
Next the troops plunged into the mountains and became entangled in narrow defiles where a small force might have annihilated them .
During this march <NAME> received an envoy from <NAME> bringing him some painted shoes and gold bracelets , which he was requested to wear at his approaching interview with the inca .
Naturally <NAME> was lavish in his promises of friendship and devotion , and assured the <NAME> ambassador that he should be only following the orders given him by the king his master in respecting the lives and property of the inhabitants .
From the moment of his arrival at <NAME> prudently lodged his soldiers in a temple and a palace belonging to the inca , where they were sheltered from any surprise .
Then he sent one of his brothers with <NAME> and twenty horse-soldiers to the camp of <NAME> , which was distant only three miles , to announce to him his arrival .
The envoys of the governor were received with magnificence , and were astonished at the multiplicity of the ornaments and vases made of gold and silver which they saw throughout the <NAME> camp .
They returned , bringing a promise from <NAME> that he would come on the next day to visit <NAME> , to bid him welcome to his kingdom .
At the same time the envoys gave an account of the wonderful riches they had seen , which confirmed <NAME> in the project which he had formed of seizing the unfortunate Atahualpa and his treasures by treachery .
Several <NAME> authors , and notably <NAME> , disguise these facts , which no doubt appeared to them too odious , and altogether deny the treachery towards <NAME> .
But at the present day there are extant many documents which force the historian to believe , with <NAME> and <NAME> , in the perfidy of <NAME> .
It was very important for him to have the inca in his own hands , and to employ him as a tool , just as <NAME> had done with <NAME> .
He therefore took advantage of the honesty and simplicity of <NAME> , who placed entire confidence in <NAME> 's protestations of friendship and so was thrown off his guard , to arrange an ambuscade into which <NAME> was certain to fall .
There was not a scruple in the disloyal soul of the conqueror ; he was as cool as though he were about to offer battle to enemies who had been forewarned of his approach ; this infamous treason must be an eternal dishonour to his memory .
<NAME> divided his cavalry into three small squadrons , left all his infantry in one body , hid his arquebusiers on the road by which the inca must pass , and kept twenty of his most determined companions near himself .
<NAME> , wishing to give the Spaniards a great idea of his power , advanced with the whole of his army .
He himself was borne upon a kind of bed , decorated with feathers , covered with plates of gold and silver , and ornamented with precious stones .
He was accompanied by his principal nobles , carried like himself on the shoulders of their servants , and he was surrounded by dancers and jesters .
Such a march was more that of a procession than of an army .
As soon as the inca had nearly reached the <NAME> quarters ( according to <NAME> ) , <NAME> , the chaplain of the expedition , who was afterwards made a bishop as a reward for his conduct , advanced with the crucifix in one hand and his breviary in the other .
In an interminable discourse he set forth to the monarch the doctrine of the creation , the fall of the first man , the <NAME> , <NAME> , and Resurrection of our <NAME> , the choice made by God of <NAME> Peter to be His vicar upon earth , the power transmitted through him to the <NAME> , and the gift made by <NAME> to the King of <NAME> of all the regions of the <NAME> .
When he had expounded all these doctrines , he called upon <NAME> to embrace the <NAME> religion , to recognize the supreme authority of the <NAME> , and to submit to the King of <NAME> as his legitimate sovereign .
If he submitted immediately , <NAME> undertook to promise that the king his master would take <NAME> under his protection , and allow him to continue to reign there ; but he declared war against him and threatened him with fearful vengeance if he refused to obey , and persevered in his impiety .
To say the least of it , this was a singular scene and a very strange harangue , alluding to facts which were utterly unknown to the Peruvians , and of the truth of which a more skilful orator than <NAME> would not have succeeded in persuading them .
If we add that the interpreter knew so little of the <NAME> language that it was almost an impossibility for him to translate what he scarcely understood himself , and that the <NAME> language lacked words to express ideas so foreign to its genius , we shall not be much surprised to learn that <NAME> understood almost nothing of the <NAME> monk 's discourse .
Some sentences , however , which attacked his own power , filled him with surprise and indignation .
But he was none the less moderate in his reply .
He said that , as master of his own kingdom by right of succession , he could not see how any one had the power to dispose of it without his consent ; he added that he was not at all willing to renounce the religion of his fathers to adopt one of which he had only heard that day for the first time ; with regard to the other points touched upon in the discourse he understood nothing , it was a thing entirely new to him , and he would much like to know where <NAME> had learnt so many wonderful things .
" In this book , " replied <NAME> , handing him his breviary .
<NAME> received it with eagerness and turned over some of the leaves with much curiosity , then , putting it to his ear , he exclaimed , " What you show me there does not speak to me , and tells me nothing . "
With this he flung the book upon the ground .
This served as a signal for the combat , or rather for the massacre .
<NAME> and muskets came into play , the cavalry sprang forward , and the infantry fell sword in hand upon the stupefied Peruvians .
In a few moments the confusion was at its height .
The <NAME> fled on all sides , without attempting to defend themselves .
As to <NAME> , although his principal officers tried to make a rampart of their own bodies , while they carried him off , <NAME> sprang upon him , dispersed or overthrew his guards , and seizing him by his long hair , threw him down from the litter in which he was carried .
Only the darkness could arrest the carnage .
Four thousand Indians were killed , a greater number wounded , and 3000 were taken prisoners .
An incontestable proof that there was no real battle is , that of all the <NAME> alone was hit , and he received his wound from one of his own soldiers who was too precipitately endeavouring to seize upon the inca .
[ Illustration : <NAME> is made prisoner .
The booty collected in the camp and from the dead exceeded anything the <NAME> could have imagined , and their enthusiasm was proportioned to the conquest of such riches .
At first <NAME> bore his captivity with resignation , which may have been partly due to <NAME> 's doing all he could to soothe him , at least by words .
But the inca , soon understanding the unbridled covetousness of his jailors , made a proposal to Pizarro to pay him ransom , and to have a room of twenty-two feet in length by sixteen in width filled as high as the hand could reach with vases , utensils , and ornaments of gold .
<NAME> eagerly agreed to this , and the captive inca despatched the necessary orders at once to all the provinces ; these were carried out promptly and unmurmuringly .
Beyond this , the <NAME> troops were disbanded , and <NAME> was able to send <NAME> and five Spaniards to <NAME> , a town situated more than 600 miles from <NAME> , while he himself subjugated all the country within a circuit of 300 miles .
In the meantime <NAME> landed with 200 soldiers .
There had been set aside for him and his men -- with what regrets may easily be imagined -- 100,000 pesos ( a <NAME> coin ) ; a fifth was reserved for the king , and this left 1,528,500 pesos to be divided between <NAME> and his companions .
This product of pillage and massacre was solemnly divided between those entitled to it on the <NAME> of <NAME> , the patron saint of <NAME> , after fervent prayer to God .
A deplorable mixture this of religion and profanity , too common unfortunately , in these times of mingled superstition and avarice .
Each horse-soldier received 8000 pesos as his share , and each foot-soldier 4000 , which would be equivalent to about 1600_l._ and 800_l._ sterling .
This was enough to satisfy the most exacting soldier , after a campaign which had been neither long nor difficult .
Many of the adventurers wished to enjoy this unexpected good fortune in a peaceable manner in their own country , and eagerly asked for their dismissal .
This <NAME> granted without hesitation , for he felt sure that the news of their rapidly-acquired wealth would soon bring him new recruits .
With his brother <NAME> , who went to <NAME> to give the emperor an account of <NAME> 's triumph and some splendid presents , went sixty Spaniards , laden heavily indeed with money , but lightly with remorse .
As soon as <NAME> 's ransom was paid , he claimed his freedom ; but <NAME> , who had only saved his life that he might make all the treasures of Peru his own , and shelter himself under the prestige and authority which the inca still exercised over his subjects , was soon wearied by his entreaties .
He suspected him also of having for some time secretly given orders to levy troops in the distant provinces of the empire .
Besides , <NAME> having soon discovered that <NAME> was no better educated than one of the lowest of his soldiers , felt in consequence a contempt for the governor which , unfortunately , he could not conceal .
Such were the reasons , all trivial as they were , which determined <NAME> to prepare for the trial of the inca .
Nothing could have been more hateful than this trial , in which <NAME> and <NAME> were at the same time both suitors and judges .
The heads of the accusation were so ridiculous and absurd , that one is in doubt whether to be most surprised by the effrontery or the wickedness of <NAME> , in subjecting the head of a powerful empire , over which he had no jurisdiction , to such an inquiry .
<NAME> , being found guilty , was condemned to be burnt alive ; but as he had at length asked to be baptized , that he might rid himself of the importunities of <NAME> , his enemies contented themselves with strangling him .
A worthy counterpart this , of <NAME> 's execution !
These were amongst the most atrocious and odious deeds committed by the Spaniards in <NAME> , where , however , they have sullied themselves with every imaginable crime .
Among this herd of adventurers there were still some men who had retained sentiments of honour and self-respect .
They protested loudly against this perversion of justice , but their generous pleadings were stifled by the selfish declamations of <NAME> and his worthy assistants .
The governor now raised one of <NAME> 's sons to the throne , under the name of <NAME> ; but the civil war between the two brothers , and the events which had occurred since the arrival of the <NAME> , had done much to loosen the ties which bound the Peruvians to their kings , and this young man , destined soon to die an ignominious death , had scarcely more authority than Manco-Capac , the son of <NAME> , who was acknowledged by the inhabitants of <NAME> .
Soon after this , some of the principal people in the country even tried to carve for themselves kingdoms out of the empire of <NAME> .
<NAME> was <NAME> , the commandant of <NAME> , who caused the brother and the children of <NAME> to be massacred , and declared himself independent .
<NAME> reigned in the <NAME> camp , and the <NAME> resolved to take advantage of it .
<NAME> advanced rapidly upon <NAME> , the small number of his forces having been the only reason which had prevented him from doing so sooner .
Now that a crowd of adventurers , attracted by the treasures which had been brought back to <NAME> , vied with each other in hastening to <NAME> , now that he could assemble 500 men -- after leaving an important garrison at <NAME> under <NAME> 's command , -- <NAME> had no further reason for delay .
On the way some skirmishes took place with large bodies of troops , but they ended as always , with severe loss to the natives , and a very insignificant one to the <NAME> .
When they entered <NAME> , and took possession of the town , the invaders showed surprise at the small quantity of gold and precious stones which they found there , although it far exceeded <NAME> 's ransom .
Was this because they were becoming accustomed to the riches of the country , or because there was a larger number to share in them ?
Meanwhile , <NAME> , being weary of inaction , took advantage of the arrival of a reinforcement from <NAME> and <NAME> , to set out for <NAME> , where according to the Peruvians , <NAME> had left the greater part of his treasure .
He placed himself at the head of eighty horse-soldiers and 120 infantry , defeated on several occasions <NAME> , who disputed his passage , and thanks to his prudence and cleverness , he entered <NAME> victorious ; but he did not find there what he sought , that is to say , the treasures of <NAME> .
At the same time , <NAME> d'Alvarado , who had so signally distinguished himself under <NAME> , and who had been made governor of <NAME> , as a reward for his services , pretended to believe that the province of <NAME> was not included in <NAME> 's command , and organized an expedition consisting of 500 men , 200 of whom were cavalry .
Landing at <NAME> , he wished to reach <NAME> without a guide , by going up the <NAME> and crossing the Andes .
This road has always been one of the worst and most trying that it is possible to choose .
Before they had reached the plain of <NAME> , after horrible sufferings from hunger and thirst , without speaking of the burning cinders hurled from the crater of <NAME> , a volcano near <NAME> , and the snow-storms which assailed them , the fifth part of the band of adventurers , and half the horses , had perished ; the remainder were completely discouraged and quite unfit for fighting .
It was therefore with the greatest surprise , and some uneasiness , that they found themselves face to face , not with a body of <NAME> as they had expected , but with a party of <NAME> , under the command of <NAME> .
The latter were preparing to charge , when some of the more moderate among the officers caused an arrangement to be entered into , by virtue of which <NAME> was to withdraw to his own province after receiving 100,000 pesos to defray the expenses of the armament .
<NAME> <NAME> had set sail for <NAME> , while these events were happening in <NAME> , feeling sure that the immense quantity of gold , silver , and precious stones which he took with him , would secure him a warm welcome .
He obtained for his brother Francisco the confirmation of his appointment as governor , with more extended powers ; he himself was made a knight of the order of <NAME> ; as for <NAME> , he was confirmed in his title of _adelantado_ , and his jurisdiction was extended 600 miles , without , however , its limits being very strictly defined , which left the door open for many contests and all kinds of arbitrary interpretations .
<NAME> <NAME> had not reached <NAME> again , when <NAME> , having learnt that a special government had been assigned to him , pretended that <NAME> formed part of it , and made preparations for its conquest .
But <NAME> and <NAME> had no intention of allowing themselves to be robbed , and the parties were on the point of coming to blows when <NAME> , who is often called _the <NAME> or _the great <NAME> , arrived at the capital .
<NAME> had never forgiven <NAME> the duplicity which he had displayed in his negotiations with <NAME> , nor the coolness with which he had claimed for himself , at the expense of his two friends , the principal share of authority , and the most extended government .
But as <NAME> met with great opposition to his designs , and as he was not the stronger , he concealed his vexation , put a good face on the matter , and seemed delighted at a reconciliation .
" They renewed their partnership , therefore , " says <NAME> , " on condition that <NAME> d'Almagro should go and discover the country on the south side , and if he found any that was really good , they should ask his Majesty to make him the governor of it ; but that if he found nothing to suit him , they should share <NAME> 's government between them . "
This arrangement was made very solemnly , and they took their oath upon the consecrated wafer , that for the future they would undertake nothing against one another .
Some say that <NAME> swore that he would never encroach either upon <NAME> or on the surrounding country within 390 miles , even if his Majesty should give him the government of it .
They add that turning towards the holy sacrament , he pronounced these words , " Lord , if I violate the oath that I now take , I pray that <NAME> wilt confound me , and punish me both in my body and my soul ! "
[ Illustration : <NAME> and <NAME> take an oath upon the <NAME> . ]
After this solemn agreement , which was destined to be observed with as little fidelity as the first , <NAME> made his preparations for departure .
<NAME> to his well-known liberality , as much as to his reputation for courage , he gathered together 570 men , of about equal numbers of cavalry and infantry , with which he set out by land for <NAME> .
The journey was an extremely trying one , and the adventurers suffered severely from intense cold whilst crossing the <NAME> ; they had also to deal with very warlike tribes , unsoftened by any civilization , who assailed them with a _furia_ of which nothing they had seen in <NAME> had given them any idea .
<NAME> could make no settlement , for he had scarcely been two months in the country when he heard that the Indians in <NAME> had revolted , and massacred the greater part of the <NAME> , whereupon he immediately retraced his steps .
After the new partnership had been signed between the conquerors ( 1534 ) , <NAME> had returned to the provinces bordering on the sea , in which he could establish a regular government , there being no longer anything to dread from resistance .
For a man who had never studied legislation , he had drawn up some very wise rules for the administration of justice , for the collection of taxes , the apportionment of the <NAME> , and the working of the mines .
Some parts of the " conquistador 's " character were doubtless very open to criticism , but it is only just to recognize that he was not wanting in enlarged ideas , and that he was conscientious in playing his part as the founder of a great empire .
This it was which made him hesitate long before choosing the future capital of the <NAME> possessions .
<NAME> had the recommendation of having been the residence of the incas ; but this town , situated more than 400 miles from the sea , was very distant from <NAME> , of which the importance seemed to Pizarro to be extreme .
Before long he was struck with the beauty and fertility of a great valley , watered by a stream called the <NAME> , and there in 1536 , he established the seat of his dominion .
Soon , the <NAME> of <NAME> ( de <NAME> Reyes ) , or <NAME> , as it is called by a corruption of the name of the river which flows at its feet , assumed the aspect of a great city , owing to the magnificent palace and the sumptuous residences for officers , which <NAME> caused to be built there .
While these cares kept <NAME> far from his capital , small bodies of troops , sent in different directions , penetrated into the most distant provinces of the empire , with the object of extinguishing the last smouldering embers of resistance ; so many of the soldiers were employed in this way , that there remained in <NAME> itself but a very small body of troops .
The inca , who had remained in the hands of the <NAME> , thought this an opportune moment for fomenting a general rising , in which he earnestly hoped that the foreign government might be overthrown .
Although closely guarded , he contrived to take his measures with so much skill that he did not arouse the suspicions of his oppressors .
He obtained permission even to be present at a grand fête , which was to be held at several miles ' distance from <NAME> , and for which the most distinguished persons in the empire had met together .
As soon as the inca appeared , the standard of revolt was raised .
The country was soon in arms from the confines of the province of <NAME> as far as <NAME> , and a number of small detachments of Spaniards were surprised and destroyed .
<NAME> , defended by the three brothers <NAME> with but 170 Spaniards , was exposed for eight consecutive months to the incessant attacks of the Peruvians , who had now become expert in the use of the arms which they had taken from their enemies .
The conquerors made a most valiant resistance , but experienced some severe losses , especially that of <NAME> .
<NAME> left <NAME> in the greatest haste , crossed the stony and sandy desert of <NAME> , where he suffered as severely from heat and drought as he had done in the Andes from cold and snow , penetrated into the <NAME> territory , defeated Manco-Capac in a great battle , and succeeded in approaching the town of <NAME> , after having driven away the <NAME> .
He then tried to get the town given up to him , on the pretext that it was not included in <NAME> 's government , and violating a truce , during which the followers of the marquis were taking a short rest , he entered <NAME> , seized both <NAME> and <NAME> , and had himself acknowledged as governor .
While this was going on , a considerable body of <NAME> invested <NAME> , intercepted all communications , and annihilated the various small bodies of troops which <NAME> sent at intervals to the aid of the <NAME> at <NAME> .
At this time he sent away all his vessels to <NAME> to compel his companions to make a desperate resistance ; he recalled from Truxillo the forces under the command of <NAME> d'Alvarado , and entrusted to the latter a column of 500 men , which advanced to within several miles of the capital without having the slightest suspicion that the town was now in the hands of fellow-countrymen , who were fully determined to bar their passage .
But <NAME> desired much rather to attract these new adversaries to himself than to destroy them ; he arranged therefore , to surprise them and make them prisoners .
He had now a fine opportunity in his hands of ending the war , and making himself master of the two governments by a single blow .
Several of his officers had observed this to him , and especially <NAME> , who proposed that the two brothers of the " conquistador " should be put to death , and that <NAME> should advance by forced marches with his victorious troops against <NAME> , where <NAME> , taken by surprise , would not be able to resist him .
But as a Latin poet says , " Jupiter makes dotards of those whom he means to ruin . "
<NAME> , who in so many other instances had thrown aside all scruples , did not wish to put himself in the wrong by invading <NAME> 's dominions as a rebel , and he quietly took the road back to <NAME> .
Looking at it only from the side of <NAME> 's own interests , he evidently committed in this a gross blunder , of which he was soon to repent ; but if we consider , what we should never lose sight of , the interest of the country , he had already committed a capital crime in the acts of aggression of which he had been guilty , and in kindling civil war in face of an enemy quite ready to take advantage of it .
His adversaries did not delay to remind him of it .
<NAME> prompt decision would have been necessary for <NAME> to make him master of the situation , <NAME> had everything to expect from time and opportunity .
While waiting for the promised reinforcements from <NAME> , he commenced negotiations with his adversary , lasting for several months , during which time one of his brothers , as well as <NAME> , found means to escape with more than seventy men .
Although <NAME> had been so often duped , he consented again to receive the licentiate <NAME> , who was ordered to represent to him , that if the emperor knew what was taking place between the two competitors , and learnt the condition to which their contests had reduced affairs , no doubt he would recall them both , and put some one else in their place .
At last , after the death of <NAME> , it was decided by the friar <NAME> , to whom <NAME> and <NAME> had referred their differences , that <NAME> should be immediately set free , that <NAME> should be given back to the marquis , and that they should send several officers on both sides to <NAME> , charged with representing the respective rights of the two parties and submitting them to the emperor 's decision .
Scarcely had the last of his brothers been set at liberty than <NAME> , rejecting all idea of peace and amicable arrangement , declared that arms alone should decide whether he or <NAME> was to be lord of <NAME> .
In a short time he had assembled a body of 700 men , of which he entrusted the command to his two brothers .
Finding it impossible to cross the mountains which would have been the most direct road to <NAME> , they followed the line of the sea-coast as far as <NAME> , and then penetrated into a branch of the Andes , by which they could reach the capital in a short time .
Possibly <NAME> ought to have defended the mountain defiles , but he had only 500 men , and he reckoned much on his splendid cavalry , whom he could not deploy in a confined space ; he therefore waited for the enemy in the plain of <NAME> .
The two parties encountered each other on the 26th of April , 1538 , with equal animosity ; but the victory was decided by two companies of musketeers which the emperor had sent to Pizarro when he heard of the revolt of the <NAME> .
One hundred and forty soldiers perished in this engagement , which received the name of _las salinas_ .
<NAME> and several officers of distinction were killed in cold blood after the battle , and <NAME> himself , aged and ill , could not escape from <NAME> .
The Indians who , assembled in arms on the surrounding mountains , had reckoned upon falling on the conqueror , had need instead to fly in all haste .
" Nothing , " says <NAME> , " more entirely proves the ascendancy gained by the <NAME> over the <NAME> , than seeing that the latter , witnesses of the defeat and dispersion of one of the parties , had not the courage to attack the other , even weakened and fatigued as they were by their victory , and dared not fall upon their oppressors when fortune offered them so favourable an opportunity for attacking them with advantage . "
At this period a victory not followed by pillage was incomplete , so the town of <NAME> was sacked , and all the riches that <NAME> 's companions found there did not suffice to content them .
They had such exalted ideas of their merits and of the services which they had rendered , that each would have desired an appointment as governor .
<NAME> <NAME> therefore dispersed them , and sent them to conquer fresh territories with some of the partisans of Almagro who had rallied , and whom it was important to send to a distance .
As for <NAME> himself , <NAME> , feeling convinced that his name constituted a focus of permanent agitation , resolved to get rid of him .
He caused him therefore to be put upon his trial , which ended , as it was easy to foresee , in a sentence of death .
When <NAME> received this news , after giving way for a few moments to a very natural grief , pleading his great age and the different way in which he had behaved with regard to <NAME> and <NAME> when they were his prisoners , he recovered his calmness and awaited his death with a soldier 's courage .
He was strangled in his prison , and afterwards publicly beheaded ( 1538 ) .
After several successful expeditions , <NAME> set out for <NAME> , to give the Emperor an account of what had taken place .
He found most minds there strangely prejudiced against him and his brothers .
Their cruelty , their violence , and their disregard of the most sacred engagements had been laid bare without reserve , by some friends of <NAME> 's .
<NAME> <NAME> needed the utmost cleverness to win the <NAME> round .
<NAME> V. had no means of judging fairly on which side the justice of the case lay , for he had only heard of it from the interested parties ; he could only discern the deplorable consequences to his own government of the civil war .
He decided , therefore , to send a commissioner to the country , to whom he gave most extensive powers , and who , after having inquired into all that had taken place , should establish whatever form of government he thought most advisable .
This delicate mission was confided to <NAME> , a judge of _audience_ at <NAME> , who proved not unequal to his task .
One fact is worthy of notice ; he was recommended to show the greatest respect towards <NAME> , at the very time when his brother <NAME> was arrested and thrown into a prison , where he was destined to remain forgotten for twenty years .
While these events were taking place in <NAME> , the <NAME> portioned out the conquered country , keeping for himself and his trustworthy friends the most fertile and best situated districts , and giving to <NAME> 's companions , the men of <NAME> as they were called , only the more sterile and distant territories .
Next he confided to <NAME> de <NAME> , one of his aides-de-camp the execution of the project which <NAME> had only been able to sketch out , the conquest of <NAME> .
<NAME> set out on the 28th of January , 1540 , with 150 Spaniards , amongst whom <NAME> , <NAME> de <NAME> , and <NAME> de <NAME> were destined especially to distinguish themselves ; he crossed first the desert of <NAME> , which even at the present day is considered a most troublesome enterprise , and reached <NAME> , standing in the midst of a beautiful valley .
Received at first with great cordiality , he had to sustain , as soon as harvest was over , several combats with the Araucanians , a race of brave , indefatigable warriors , very different from the Indians of <NAME> .
In spite of this , he laid the foundations of the town of <NAME> on the 12th of February , 1541 .
<NAME> spent eight years in <NAME> , presiding over the conquest and organization of the country .
Less greedy than the other " conquistadores " his contemporaries , he only sought for the mineral riches of the country that he might ensure the development of the prosperity of his colony , in which he had taken care first of all to encourage agriculture .
" The best mine that I know of , is one of corn and wine with nourishment for livestock .
Who has this , has money .
As for mines , we do not depend upon them for subsistence .
And often that which looks well outwardly is not really worth much . "
These wise words of <NAME> , in his <NAME> la <NAME> , might have been used by <NAME> , so exactly do they correspond with and express his sentiments .
His valour , prudence , and humanity , more especially the latter quality , which shines forth strangely in contrast with the cruelty of <NAME> , ensures for him a distinction all his own among the " conquistadores " of the sixteenth century .
[ Illustration : The shores of <NAME> . ]
At the time that <NAME> set out for <NAME> , <NAME> crossed the Andes at the head of 340 Spaniards , half of whom were mounted , and 4000 Indians , of whom the greater part of the <NAME> perished from cold ; then he penetrated eastwards into the interior , seeking for a country where spices and cinnamon were said to abound .
In these vast Savannahs , intersected by marshes and virgin forests , the <NAME> encountered torrents of rain , which lasted quite two months ; they found only a scattered population , who were not industrious and also hostile ; in consequence , the invaders often suffered from hunger in a country where there were then neither horses nor oxen , where the largest quadrupeds were tapirs and llamas , and even the latter were seldom met with on this slope of the Andes .
In spite of these difficulties , which would have discouraged any less energetic explorers than the _descubridores_ of the sixteenth century , they persevered in their attempt and descended the <NAME> or <NAME> , an affluent on the left of the <NAME> , as far as its confluence .
There , with great difficulty they built a brigantine , which was manned by fifty soldiers under the command of <NAME> .
But either the strength of the current carried him away , or else being no longer under the eyes of his chief , he wished in his turn to be the leader of an expedition of discovery ; he did not wait for <NAME> at the appointed rendezvous , but continued to descend the river until he reached the ocean .
Such a voyage is simply marvellous , through nearly 6000 miles of an unknown region , without guide , without compass , without provisions , with a crew who murmured more than once against the foolish attempt of their leader , and in the midst of populations almost invariably hostile .
From the mouth of the river , which he had just descended in his badly built and dilapidated vessel , <NAME> succeeded in reaching the <NAME> , whence he set sail for <NAME> .
If the proverb " He who comes from a distance tells many lies " were not of much earlier date , one might have thought it had been coined for <NAME> .
He invented the most preposterous fables as to the wealth of the countries he had traversed ; the inhabitants were so rich that the roofs of the temples were formed of plates of gold ; an assertion which gave rise to the legend of <NAME> .
<NAME> had heard of the existence of a <NAME> of female warriors who had founded a vast empire , which caused the river <NAME> to be called the _River of the <NAME> .
If , however , we strip this narrative of all that is ridiculous and grotesque , and calculated to please the imaginations of his contemporaries , it remains certain that <NAME> 's expedition is one of the most remarkable of this epoch , so fertile in gigantic enterprises ; and it furnishes the first information upon the immense zone of country lying between the Andes and the <NAME> .
But we must return to <NAME> .
His embarrassment and consternation had been great , when on arriving at the confluence of the <NAME> and <NAME> , he had not found <NAME> , who was to have been awaiting him .
Fearing that some accident might have befallen his lieutenant , he had descended the course of the river for 150 miles , until he met with an unfortunate officer , who had been left behind for having addressed some remonstrances to his chief upon his perfidy .
The bravest among <NAME> 's men were discouraged at the news of the cowardly way in which they had been abandoned , and at the destitute condition in which they were left .
<NAME> was obliged to yield to their entreaties and to return to <NAME> , from which they were more than 1200 miles away .
To give an idea of their sufferings on this return journey , it suffices to say that , after having eaten horses , dogs , and reptiles , roots , and wild beasts , and after having devoured every article made of leather in their accoutrements , the unfortunate survivors who reached <NAME> , lacerated by brambles , emaciated and utterly impoverished , numbered only twenty-four .
Four thousand Indians and two hundred and ten <NAME> had perished in this expedition , which had lasted less than two years .
While <NAME> was conducting the unfortunate expedition just related , the old partisans of <NAME> , who had never frankly joined <NAME> , gathered round the son of their old leader , and formed a plot for murdering the <NAME> .
In vain was <NAME> several times warned of what was threatening him , he would pay no heed to the report .
He said " Keep quiet , I shall be safe as long as there is no one in Peru who does not know that I can in a moment take the life of any one who should dare to form the project of attempting mine . "
On Sunday , the 26th of June , 1541 , at the hour of siesta , <NAME> de <NAME> and eighteen conspirators left the house of <NAME> 's son with drawn swords in their hands and armed from top to toe .
They ran towards the house of <NAME> , crying out , " Death to the tyrant !
death to the infamous wretch ! "
They entered the palace , killed <NAME> de <NAME> , who had appeared in haste on hearing the noise , and gained the hall , where was <NAME> , with his brother Francisco-Martin , the doctor <NAME> , and a dozen servants .
These jumped out of the windows , with the exception of <NAME> , two other gentlemen , and two tall pages , who were killed while defending the door of the governor 's apartment .
He himself had not had time to put on his cuirass , but he seized his sword and buckler and defended himself valiantly , killing four of his adversaries and wounding several others .
One of his assailants , in a spirit of self-devotion , attracted to himself the blows of <NAME> .
Meanwhile the other conspirators made their way in and attacked him with such fury that he could not parry all the blows , being so exhausted that he could scarcely wield his sword .
" Thus , " says <NAME> , " they made an end , and succeeded in killing him by a thrust in the throat .
Falling to the ground , he asked in a loud voice that he might be allowed to confess , and then not being able any longer to speak , he made the sign of the cross on the ground , which he kissed , and then yielded up his soul to God . "
Some negroes carried his body to the church , where <NAME> , his old servant , alone ventured to come and claim it .
This faithful servant secretly rendered to it funeral honours , for the conspirators had pillaged the house of <NAME> , not leaving enough even to pay for wax tapers .
Thus did <NAME> come to his end , assassinated even in the capital of the vast empire which <NAME> owed to his valour and indefatigable perseverance , but which he bestowed upon his country , it must be admitted , ravaged , decimated , and drowned in a deluge of blood .
<NAME> is often compared with <NAME> ; the one had as much ambition , courage , and military capacity as the other ; but the cruelty and avarice of the <NAME> della <NAME> were carried to an extreme in <NAME> , and united in him to perfidy and duplicity .
If we are inclined to excuse certain parts of <NAME> ' character which are not estimable , by the times in which he lived , we are at least charmed by that grace and nobility of manners , and by that way of a gentleman above prejudices , which made him so much beloved by the soldier .
In <NAME> , on the contrary , we find roughness , and a harsh , unsympathizing way of feeling , while his chivalrous qualities disappear entirely behind the rapacity and perfidy which are the salient features of his character .
If <NAME> found brave and resolute adversaries among the <NAME> , who opposed almost insurmountable difficulties to his progress , <NAME> had no trouble in vanquishing the Peruvians , who were timid and enervated , and who never made any serious resistance to his arms .
Of the conquests of <NAME> and <NAME> , the less difficult produced the greater metallurgic advantage to <NAME> , and thus it was the more appreciated .
The civil war was on the point of breaking out again after <NAME> 's death when the governor arrived , who was delegated by the metropolitan government .
As soon as he had collected the needful troops , he marched towards <NAME> .
He seized young Almagro without trouble , had him beheaded with forty of his confederates and governed the country with firmness , until the viceroy <NAME> , arrived .
It is not our intention to enter into the detail of the disputes which took place between the latter and <NAME> , who , profiting by the general discontent , caused by the new regulations as to the " repartimientos , " revolted against the <NAME> 's representative .
After many changes of fortune , for which we have not space , the struggle ended by the defeat and execution of <NAME> , which took place in 1548 .
His body was taken to <NAME> and buried fully dressed ; " No one , " says <NAME> la Vega , " being willing to give even a winding-sheet for it . "
Thus ended the judicial assassin of <NAME> .
Is not the text appropriate in this case : " They that take the sword shall perish with the sword " ?

No one as yet was aware of the immense size of the continent discovered by <NAME> .
Still was sought perseveringly on the coast of <NAME> -- which was thought to be a collection of several islands -- the famous strait which should lead at once to the <NAME> and to those Spice Islands the possession of which would have made the fortune of <NAME> .
While <NAME> and <NAME> were seeking for it in the <NAME> , and <NAME> in the furthest part of the Gulf of <NAME> , while <NAME> was coasting along <NAME> , and <NAME> was conquering <NAME> , the solution of this problem was found by a <NAME> in the service of <NAME> , <NAME> .
The son of a gentleman of <NAME> e <NAME> , <NAME> de <NAME> was born either at <NAME> , at <NAME> , at <NAME> de <NAME> , or at <NAME> de <NAME> , it is not actually known which ; the date of his birth is unknown , but it took place towards the end of the fifteenth century .
He had been brought up in the house of King <NAME> , where he received as complete an education as could then be given him .
After having made mathematics and navigation his special study -- for at this time in <NAME> there was an irresistible current which drew the whole country towards maritime expeditions and discoveries -- <NAME> early embraced a maritime career , and embarked in 1505 with <NAME> , who was on his way to the <NAME> .
He took part in the sacking of <NAME> , and in all the events of that campaign .
The following year he accompanied <NAME> to <NAME> ; then , on returning to the <NAME> coast , we find him assisting <NAME> at the taking of <NAME> , and bearing himself on that occasion with equal prudence and bravery .
He took part in the expedition sent by <NAME> about 1510 , to seek for the famous Spice Islands , under the command of <NAME> de <NAME> and of <NAME> , which discovered <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
During this time <NAME> had landed at the <NAME> , distant 1800 miles from <NAME> , and in the <NAME> of the Moluccas he had obtained the circumstantial information which gave birth in his mind to the idea of the voyage which he was destined to accomplish later on .
[ Illustration : <NAME> on board his caravel .
On his return to <NAME> , <NAME> obtained leave , though not without difficulty , to search through the royal archives .
He soon became certain that the <NAME> were situated in the hemisphere which the bull of demarcation adopted at <NAME> by the kings of <NAME> and <NAME> , and confirmed in 1494 by <NAME> VI. , had given to <NAME> .
In virtue of this line of demarcation , which was destined to give rise to so many impassioned debates , all the countries situated at 360 miles west of the meridian of the <NAME> de <NAME> were to belong to <NAME> , and all those lying to the east of the same meridian to <NAME> .
<NAME> was of too active a nature to remain long without again taking service ; he went next to fight in <NAME> at <NAME> , a town in <NAME> , where he received a slight wound in his knee , but one which by injuring a nerve made him lame for the remainder of his life , and obliged him to return to <NAME> .
Conscious of the superiority which his theoretical and practical knowledge and his services had earned for him above the herd of courtiers , <NAME> naturally felt more keenly than another would have done the unjust treatment he received from <NAME> with regard to certain complaints laid by the people of <NAME> against the <NAME> officers .
King <NAME> 's prejudices soon changed to a real dislike .
It showed itself by the outrageous imputation that <NAME> was pretending to suffer from a wound which was really of no consequence and was completely cured , that he might escape from accusations which he could not refute .
Such an assertion was a serious matter for the honour of <NAME> , so susceptible and suspicious ; he thereupon came to a desperate determination which corresponded moreover with the greatness of the insult which he had received .
That no one might be ignorant of it , he caused it to be legally set forth that he renounced his rights as a <NAME> citizen , and changed his nationality , and he then took out letters of naturalization in <NAME> .
This was to proclaim , as solemnly as could possibly be done , that he intended to be looked upon as a subject of the crown of <NAME> , to which henceforward he would consecrate his services and his whole life .
This was a serious determination , as we can see , which no one blamed , and which even the most severe historians , such as <NAME> and <NAME> y Sousa , have excused .
At the same time as <NAME> , the licentiate <NAME> left <NAME> with his brother <NAME> and a merchant named <NAME> de <NAME> ; the former was a man deeply versed in cosmographical knowledge , and had equally with <NAME> fallen under <NAME> 's displeasure .
<NAME> had entered into a treaty of partnership with <NAME> to reach the Moluccas by a new way , but one which was not otherwise specified , and which remained <NAME> 's secret .
As soon as they arrived in <NAME> , ( 1517 ) , the two partners submitted their project to <NAME> , who accepted it in principle ; but there remained the always delicate question touching the means for putting it into execution .
Happily , <NAME> found in <NAME> de <NAME> , the factor of the Chamber of <NAME> , an enthusiastic partisan of his theories , and one who promised to exert all his influence to make the enterprise a success .
He had an interview accordingly with the high Chancellor , the <NAME> and <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> .
He set forth with such skill the great advantage that <NAME> would derive from the discovery of a route leading to the very centre of the spice production , and the great prejudice which it would cause to the trade of <NAME> , that an agreement was signed on the 22nd of March , 1518 .
The <NAME> undertook to pay all the expenses of the expedition on condition that the greater part of the profits should belong to him .
But <NAME> had still many obstacles to surmount before taking to the sea .
In the first place there were the remonstrances of the <NAME> ambassador , <NAME> de <NAME> , who , seeing that his endeavours were in vain , even tried to compass the assassination of <NAME> , so says <NAME> y Sousa .
Then he encountered the ill-will of the employés of the <NAME> de contratacion_ at <NAME> , who were jealous of a stranger being entrusted with the command of such an important expedition , and envious of the least token of favour which had been accorded to <NAME> and <NAME> , who had been named commanders of the order of <NAME> .
But <NAME> had given his consent by a public act , which seemed to be irrevocable .
They tried , however , to make the Emperor alter his decision by organizing , on the 22nd of October , 1518 , a disturbance paid for with <NAME> gold .
It broke out on the pretext that <NAME> , who had just had one of his ships drawn on shore for repairs and painting , had decorated it with the <NAME> arms .
This last attempt failed miserably , and three statutes of the 30th of March , and 6th and 30th of April , fixed the composition of the crews and named the staff ; while a final official document dated from <NAME> the 26th of July , 1519 , confided the sole command of the expedition to <NAME> .
What had meanwhile been happening to <NAME> ?
But this man , who had up to this time been treated on the same footing as <NAME> , and who had perhaps first conceived the project , now found himself quite excluded from the command of the expedition , after some dissensions of which the cause is unknown .
His health , already shaken , received a last shock from this affront , and poor Rey Faleiro , who had become almost childish , having returned to <NAME> to see his family , was arrested there , and only released upon the intercession of <NAME> At last , after having sworn fidelity and homage to the crown of <NAME> , <NAME> received in his turn the oath of his officers and sailors , and left the port of <NAME> de <NAME> on the morning of the 10th of <NAME> , 1519 .
But before entering on the narrative of this memorable campaign , we must give a few particulars of the man who has left us the most complete account of it , <NAME> or <NAME> as he is often called in <NAME> .
Born at <NAME> about 1491 , of a noble family , <NAME> formed part of the suite of the <NAME> , sent by <NAME> X. to <NAME> , who was then at <NAME> .
His attention was no doubt aroused by the noise which the preparations for the expedition made at that time in <NAME> , and he obtained permission to take part in the voyage .
This volunteer proved an excellent recruit , for he showed himself in every respect as faithful and intelligent an observer as he was a brave and courageous companion .
He was wounded at the battle of <NAME> , fighting beside <NAME> , which prevented him from being present at the banquet during which so many of his companions were destined to lose their lives .
As to his narrative , with the exception of some exaggerations of detail according to the taste of that time , it is exact , and the greater part of the descriptions which we owe to him have been verified by modern travellers and learned men , especially by M. Alcide d'Orbigny .
Upon his return to <NAME> on the 6th of September , 1522 , after having fulfilled the vow which he had made to go bare-foot to return thanks to _Nuesta <NAME> de la Victoria_ , the <NAME> ( as they called him on board the <NAME> , ) presented to <NAME> , then at <NAME> , a complete journal of the voyage .
When he returned to <NAME> , by means of the original as well as of some supplementary notes , he wrote a longer narrative of the expedition , at the request of <NAME> .
and of <NAME> de l'Isle <NAME> , grand-master of the <NAME> of <NAME> .
He sent copies of this work to several distinguished personages , and notably to <NAME> of <NAME> , mother of <NAME> I .
But she not understanding , so thinks <NAME> , the very learned author of the <NAME> , the kind of patois used by <NAME> , and which resembles a mixture of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , employed a certain <NAME> to translate it into <NAME> .
Instead of giving a faithful translation , <NAME> made a kind of abridgment of it .
Some critics , however , suppose that this narrative must have been written originally in <NAME> ; they found their opinion upon the existence of three <NAME> manuscripts of the sixteenth century , which give very different readings , and of which two are deposited in the <NAME> at <NAME> .
<NAME> died at <NAME> about 1534 , in a house in the <NAME> de la Lune , which in 1800 was still to be seen , and which bore the well-known device , " No rose without a thorn . "
At the same time , not wishing to confine ourselves to <NAME> 's narrative entirely , we have compared and completed it with that of <NAME> , secretary to <NAME> , of which there is an <NAME> translation in <NAME> 's valuable collection .
The fleet of <NAME> consisted of the <NAME> , of 120 tons ' burden , which carried the flag of the commander of the expedition ; the _Sant'-Antonio_ , also of 120 tons , commanded by <NAME> de <NAME> , the second in rank , the _person joined with_ <NAME> , says the official document ; the <NAME> , of 90 tons , commanded by <NAME> ; the famous _Victoria_ , of 85 tons , commanded by <NAME> de <NAME> ; and lastly the <NAME> , of 75 tons , commanded by <NAME> , called by the <NAME> .
Four of these captains and nearly all the pilots were <NAME> .
<NAME> and <NAME> on board the <NAME> , <NAME> de <NAME> and <NAME> on the <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> de <NAME> on the <NAME> , <NAME> de <NAME> on the _Sant'-Antonio_ , and <NAME> on the <NAME> , with 25 sailors , formed a total of 33 <NAME> out of the whole body of 237 individuals whose names have all been handed down to us , and amongst whom are found a considerable number of <NAME> .
Of the officers whose names have been mentioned , it is to be remembered that <NAME> was brother-in-law to <NAME> and that <NAME> , who , by returning to <NAME> on the 6th of May , 1521 , did not participate in the conclusion of this memorable voyage , was afterwards sent by <NAME> to seek for the north-west passage , and in 1524 sailed along the coast of <NAME> from <NAME> to <NAME> , and perhaps as far as <NAME> .
Nothing could have been better arranged than this expedition , for the equipment of which the whole resources of the nautical science of that epoch had been taxed .
At the moment of departure <NAME> gave his last orders to his pilots and captains , and the code of signals which were to ensure unanimity in manoeuvres , and prevent a possible separation .
On Monday morning , the 10th of <NAME> , 1519 , the fleet weighed anchor and sailed down the Guadalquiver as far as <NAME> de <NAME> , which forms the port of <NAME> , where the victualling of the ships was completed , and it was the 20th of September before they were really off .
Six days afterwards the fleet anchored at <NAME> in the Canary Archipelago , where both wood and water were taken on board .
It was on leaving this island that the first symptoms appeared of the misunderstanding between <NAME> and <NAME> which was to prove so fatal to the expedition .
The latter claimed to be informed by the commander-in-chief of the route which he intended to take , a claim which was at once rejected by <NAME> , who declared that he was not called upon to give any explanation to his subordinate .
After having passed between the <NAME> de <NAME> and <NAME> , the ships reached the shores of <NAME> , where contrary winds and dead calms detained the fleet for twenty days .
[ Illustration : <NAME> de <NAME> placed in the stocks . ]
A painful incident now occurred .
During a council which was held on board the flag-ship , a sharp dispute arose , and <NAME> , who affected to treat the Captain-general with contempt , having answered him with pride and insolence , <NAME> felt obliged to arrest him with his own hand , and to have him put in the stocks , an instrument made of two pieces of wood placed one upon the other and pierced with holes , in which were placed the legs of the sailor who was to be punished .
The other captains remonstrated loudly with <NAME> against a punishment which was too degrading for a superior officer , and <NAME> in consequence was simply put under arrest , and guarded by one of the captains .
To the calms now succeeded rain , tempests , and heavy squalls , which obliged the vessels to lie-to .
During these storms the navigators several times witnessed an electric phenomenon of which the cause was not then known , but which they considered an undoubted sign of the protection of heaven , and which even at the present day is known by the name of <NAME> 's fire .
Once past the equinoctial line -- a passage which does not at that time seem to have been celebrated by the grotesque ceremony of baptism which is in vogue at the present day -- they steered for <NAME> , where , on the 13th of December , 1519 , the fleet cast anchor in the magnificent port of <NAME> , now known under the name of <NAME> .
This was not , however , the first time that this bay had been seen by <NAME> , as was long believed .
Since the year 1511 it had been known under the name of <NAME> do <NAME> .
It had been visited also , four years before <NAME> 's arrival , by <NAME> , and seems to have been frequented since the commencement of the sixteenth century by mariners from <NAME> who , inheritors of the passion for adventurous navigation of their ancestors the North-men , roamed over the world , and founded small establishments or factories in all directions .
Here the <NAME> expedition procured cheaply , in exchange for looking-glasses , pieces of ribbon , scissors , hawks ' bells or fish-hooks , a quantity of provisions , amongst which <NAME> mentions pine-apples , sugar-canes , sweet potatoes , fowls , and the flesh of the <NAME> , which is thought to be the tapir .
The account given in the same narrative of the manners of the inhabitants is sufficiently curious to be repeated .
" The Brazilians are not Christians , " he says , " but no more are they idolaters , for they worship nothing ; natural instinct is their only law . "
This is an interesting fact , and a singular avowal for an <NAME> of the sixteenth century , deeply imbued with superstition ; it offers one more proof that the idea of the <NAME> is not innate , as some theologians have imagined .
" These natives live to a great age , they go entirely naked , and sleep in cotton nets called hammocks , suspended by the two ends to beams .
As to their boats , called canoes , each is hollowed out of the single trunk of a tree and can hold as many as forty men .
They are anthropophagi ( cannibals ) , but only on special occasions , and scarcely ever eat any but their enemies taken in battle .
Their dress of ceremony is a kind of vest made of paroquets ' feathers , woven together , and so arranged that the large wing and tail-feathers form a sort of girdle round their loins , which gives them a whimsical and ridiculous appearance . "
We have already said that the feather cloak was in use on the shores of the <NAME> , among the <NAME> ; it is curious to ascertain that it was worn equally by the <NAME> .
Some specimens of this singular garment may be seen at the exhibition of the <NAME> .
This was not however the only ornament of these savages ; they suspended little stone cylinders from three holes pierced in the lower lip , a custom which is common among many of the <NAME> people , and which may be compared with our fashion of ear-rings .
These people were extremely credulous and of good disposition and thus , as <NAME> says , they could easily have been converted to <NAME> , for they assisted in silence , and with gravity , at the mass which was said on shore , a remark that <NAME> had already made .
[ Illustration : The Coast of <NAME> . ]
After remaining thirteen days in this place , the squadron continued its route to the south , coasting along the shore , and arrived at 34 degrees 40 minutes of south latitude in a country where flowed a large river of fresh water .
It was the <NAME> .
The natives , called <NAME> , were so frightened at the sight of the vessels that they hastily took refuge in the interior of the country , carrying with them all their valuables , and it was impossible to overtake any of them .
It was in this country that four years previously , <NAME> de <NAME> had been massacred by a tribe of <NAME> , armed with that terrible engine which is still in use at the present day among the _gauchos_ of the <NAME> , the _bolas_ , which are metal balls fastened to the two ends of a long leather thong , called a _lasso_ .
A little below the estuary of the <NAME> , once thought to be an arm of the sea opening into the <NAME> , the flotilla anchored at <NAME> .
Here they obtained an ample supply of penguins for the crews of the five vessels -- a bird which did not make a very delicious meal .
Then they anchored in 49 degrees 30 minutes in a beautiful harbour , where <NAME> resolved to winter , and which received the name of <NAME> 's Bay .
The <NAME> had been two months there , when one day they perceived a man who seemed to them to be of gigantic stature .
At sight of them he began dancing and singing and throwing dust upon his head .
This was a <NAME> , who allowed himself without resistance to be taken on board the vessels .
He showed the greatest surprise at all he saw around him , but nothing astonished him so much as a large steel mirror which was presented to him .
" The giant , who had not the least idea of the use of this piece of furniture , and who , no doubt , now saw his own face for the first time , drew back in such terror , that he threw to the ground four of our people who were behind him . "
He was taken back on shore loaded with presents , and the kind welcome which he had received induced eighteen of his companions , thirteen women and five men , to come on board .
They were tall , and had broad faces , painted red except the eyes , which were encircled with yellow ; their hair was whitened with lime , they were wrapped in enormous fur cloaks , and wore those large leather boots from which was given to them the name of Large-feet or Patagonians .
Their stature was not , however , so gigantic as it appeared to our simple narrator , for it varies from 5ft .
8in. , being somewhat above the middle height among <NAME> .
For arms they had a short massive bow , and arrows made of reed , of which the point was formed of a sharp pebble .
The captain , to retain two of these savages whom he wished to take to <NAME> , used a stratagem , which we should characterize as hateful in the present day , but which had nothing revolting about it for the sixteenth century , when <NAME> and negroes were universally considered to be a kind of brute beasts .
<NAME> loaded these Indians with presents , and when he saw them embarrassed with the quantity , he offered to each of them one of those iron rings used for chaining captives .
They would have desired to carry them away , for they valued iron above everything , but their hands were full .
It was then proposed to fasten the rings to their legs , to which they agreed without suspicion .
The sailors then closed the rings , so that the savages found themselves in fetters .
Nothing can give an idea of their fury when they discovered this stratagem , worthy rather of savages than of civilized men .
The capture of others was attempted , but in vain , and in the chase one of the <NAME> was wounded by a poisoned arrow , which caused his death almost instantaneously .
Intrepid hunters , these people wander about perpetually in pursuit of guanaquis and other game ; they are endowed with such wonderful voracity " that what would suffice for the nourishment of twenty sailors , can scarcely satisfy seven or eight of them . "
<NAME> , foreseeing that the stay here was likely to be prolonged , and perceiving that the country only presented meagre resources , gave orders to economize the provisions , and to put the men on fixed rations , that they might not experience too great privations before the spring , when they might reach a country where there was more game .
But the <NAME> , discontented at the sterility of the place , and at the length and rigour of the winter , began to murmur .
This land seemed to stretch southwards as far as the <NAME> pole , they said ; there did not seem to be any strait ; already several had died from the privations they had endured ; lastly it was time to return to <NAME> , if the commander did not wish to see all his men perish in this place .
<NAME> , fully resolved to die , or else to bring the enterprise he commanded to a successful issue , replied that the <NAME> had assigned him the course which the voyage was to take , and he neither could nor would depart from it under any pretext , and that in consequence , he should go straight forward to the end of this land , or until he met with some strait .
As to provisions , if they found them insufficient , his men might add to their rations the produce of their fishing or hunting .
<NAME> thought that so firm a declaration would impose silence on the malcontents , and that he would hear no more of privations , from which he suffered equally with his crews .
<NAME> of the captains , and <NAME> de Carthagena in particular , were interested in causing a revolt to break out .
These rebels therefore began by reminding the Spaniards of their old animosity against the <NAME> .
The captain-general being one of the latter nation , had never , according to them , tendered a whole-hearted allegiance to the <NAME> flag .
In order to be able to return to his own country and to gain pardon for what he had done wrong , he wished to commit some heinous crime , and nothing could be more advantageous to <NAME> than the destruction of this fine fleet .
Instead of leading them to the <NAME> of the <NAME> , of the riches of which he had boasted to them , he wished to take them into frozen regions , the dwelling-place of eternal snow , where he could easily manage that they should all perish ; then with the help of the <NAME> on board the squadron , he would take back to his own country the vessels which he had seized .
Such were the reports and accusations that the partisans of <NAME> de <NAME> , <NAME> de <NAME> , and <NAME> had disseminated among the sailors , when on <NAME> Sunday , the 1st of April , 1520 , <NAME> summoned the captains , officers , and pilots , to hear mass on board his vessel and to dine with him afterwards .
<NAME> de la <NAME> , a cousin of the captain-general , accepted this invitation with <NAME> de <NAME> and his officers , but neither Mendoza nor <NAME> , nor <NAME> , who was <NAME> 's prisoner , appeared .
The next night the malcontents boarded the _Sant'-Antonio_ with thirty of the men of the <NAME> , and desired to have <NAME> given up to them .
The pilot , <NAME> de <NAME> , while defending his captain , received four stabs from a poniard in the arm .
<NAME> cried out at the same time , " You will see that this fool will make our business fail . "
The three vessels , the <NAME> , _Sant'-Antonio_ , and <NAME> , fell without difficulty into the hands of the rebels , who reckoned more than one accomplice among the crews .
In spite of this success , the three captains did not dare openly to attack the commander-in-chief , and sent to him some proposals for a reconciliation .
<NAME> ordered them to come on board the <NAME> to confer with him ; but this they stoutly refused to do , whereupon <NAME> , having no further need of caution , had the boat seized which had brought him this answer , and choosing six strong and brave men from amongst his crew , he sent them on board the <NAME> under the command of the _alguazil_ Espinosa .
He carried a letter from <NAME> to <NAME> enjoining him to come on board the <NAME> , and when <NAME> smiled in a scornful manner , <NAME> stabbed him in the throat with a poniard , while a sailor struck him on the head with a cutlass .
While these events were taking place , another boat , laden with fifteen armed men , came alongside the <NAME> , and took possession of her without any resistance from the sailors , surprised by the rapidity of the action .
On the next day , the 3rd of April , the two other rebel vessels were taken , not however without bloodshed .
<NAME> 's body was divided into quarters , while a clerk read in a loud voice the sentence that blasted his memory .
Three days afterwards , <NAME> was beheaded and cut in pieces by his own servant , who undertook this sad task to save his own life .
As to <NAME> , the high rank which the royal edict had conferred upon him in the expedition saved him from death , but with <NAME> de la <NAME> , the chaplain , he was left behind on the shore , where some months afterwards he was found by <NAME> .
Forty sailors convicted of rebellion were pardoned because their services were considered indispensable .
After this severe lesson <NAME> might well hope that the mutinous spirit was really subdued .
When the temperature became milder the anchors were weighed ; the squadron put to sea on the 24th of <NAME> , following the coast , and carefully exploring all the gulfs to find that strait which had been so persistently sought .
At the level of <NAME> St. Croix , one of the vessels , the <NAME> , was lost on the rocks during a violent gale from the east .
Happily both the men and merchandise on board were saved , and they succeeded also in taking from the wrecked vessel the rigging and appurtenances of the ship , which they divided among the four remaining vessels .
At last on the 21st of October , according to <NAME> , the 27th of November according to <NAME> , the flotilla penetrated by a narrow entrance into a gulf , at the bottom of which a strait opened , which as they soon saw passed into the sea to the south .
First they called this the <NAME> of the <NAME> , because this was the day dedicated to them .
On each side of the strait rose high land covered with snow , on which they saw numerous fires , especially to the left , but they were unable to obtain any communication with the natives .
The details which <NAME> and <NAME> have given with regard to the topographical and hydrographical dispositions of this strait are rather vague , and as we shall have to mention it again when we speak of <NAME> 's expedition , we shall not dilate upon it now .
After sailing for twenty-two days across this succession of narrow inlets and arms of the sea , in some places three miles wide , in some twelve , which extends for a distance of 440 miles and has received the name of <NAME> 's <NAME> , the flotilla emerged upon a sea of immense extent and great depth .
The rejoicings were general when at last the sailors found themselves at the long-wished-for end of their efforts .
Henceforward the route was open and <NAME> 's clever conjectures were realized .
<NAME> is more extraordinary than the navigation of <NAME> upon this ocean , which he called <NAME> , because for four months no storm assailed him upon it .
The privations endured by the crews during this long space of time were excessive .
The biscuit was nothing more than dust mixed with worms , while the water had become bad and gave out an unbearable smell .
The sailors were obliged to eat mice and sawdust to prevent themselves from dying of hunger , and to gnaw all the leather that it was possible to find .
As it was easy to foresee under these circumstances , the crews were decimated by scurvy .
Nineteen men died , and thirty were seized with violent pains in their arms and legs , which caused prolonged sufferings .
At last , after having sailed over more than 12,000 miles without meeting with a single island , in a sea where so many and such populous archipelagos were destined to be discovered , the fleet came upon two desert and sterile islands , called for that reason the <NAME> , but of which the position is indicated in much too contradictory a manner , for it to be possible to recognize them .
In 12 degrees north latitude and 146 degrees longitude , on Wednesday the 6th of March , the navigators discovered successively three islands , at which they greatly desired to stop to recruit , and take in fresh provisions ; but the islanders who came on board stole so many things , without the possibility of preventing them , that the sailors were obliged to give up the idea of remaining there .
The natives contrived even to carry off a long boat .
<NAME> , indignant at such daring , made a descent with forty armed men , burned some houses and boats , and killed seven men .
These islanders had neither chief , king , nor religion .
Their heads were covered with palm-leaf hats , they wore beards , and their hair descended to their waists .
Generally of an olive tint , they thought they embellished themselves by colouring their teeth black and red , while their bodies were anointed with cocoa-nut oil , no doubt in order to protect themselves from the heat of the sun .
Their canoes of curious construction , carried a very large matting sail , which might have easily capsized the boat if the precaution had not been taken of giving a more stable trim by means of a long piece of wood kept at a certain distance by two poles ; this is what is called the " balance . "
These islanders were very industrious , but had a singular aptitude for stealing , which has gained for their country the name of the _Islands of <NAME> ( <NAME> ) .
On the 16th of <NAME> was seen , at about 900 miles from the <NAME> , some high ground ; this was soon discovered to be an island which now goes by the name of <NAME> .
There <NAME> , resolving to give his exhausted crews some rest , caused two tents to be pitched on land for the use of the sick .
The natives quickly brought bananas , palm wine , cocoa-nuts , and fish ; for which mirrors , combs , bells , and other similar trifles were offered in exchange .
The cocoa-nut , a tree which is valuable beyond all others , supplied these natives with their bread , wine , oil , and vinegar , and besides they obtained from it their clothing and the necessary wood for building and roofing in their huts .
The natives soon became familiar with the <NAME> , and told them that their archipelago produced cloves , cinnamon , pepper , nutmegs , ginger , maize or Indian-corn , and that even gold was found there .
<NAME> gave this archipelago the name of the <NAME> , afterwards changed to that of the <NAME> from the name of <NAME> of <NAME> , son of <NAME> This archipelago is formed of a great number of islands which extend in <NAME> , between 5 degrees 32 minutes and 19 degrees 38 minutes north latitude , and 114 degrees 56 minutes and 123 degrees 43 minutes longitude east of the meridian of <NAME> .
The most important are <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , the <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
When they were a little restored , the <NAME> put to sea again , in order to explore the archipelago .
They saw in succession the islands of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , as well as another island called <NAME> , of which the king <NAME> could make himself understood by a slave a native of <NAME> , whom <NAME> had taken to <NAME> from <NAME> , and who by his knowledge of <NAME> rendered signal service in several instances .
The king came on board with six or eight of his principal subjects .
He brought with him presents for the captain-general , and in exchange he received a vest of red and yellow cloth , made in <NAME> fashion , and a cap of fine scarlet , while mirrors and knives were given to the members of his suite .
The <NAME> showed him all their fire-arms and fired some shots from the cannon in his presence , at which he was much terrified .
" Then <NAME> caused one of our number to be fully armed , " says <NAME> , " and ordered three men to give him blows with the sword and stiletto , to show the king that nothing could wound a man armed in this manner , which surprised him greatly , and turning to the interpreter he said to the captain through him , 'that a man thus armed , could fight against a hundred . '
'Yes , ' replied the interpreter , in the name of the commandant , 'and each of the three vessels carries 200 men armed in this manner . ' "
The king , astonished by all that he had seen , took leave of the captain , begging him to send two of his men with him , to let them see something of the island .
<NAME> was chosen , and was much satisfied with the welcome that he received .
The king told him " that in this island they found pieces of gold as large as nuts , and even eggs , mixed with the earth which they passed through a sieve to find them ; all his vessels and even some of the ornaments of his house were of this metal .
He was very neatly dressed , according to the custom of the country , and was the finest man that I have seen among these people .
His black hair fell upon his shoulders ; a silk veil covered his head , and he wore two rings in his ears .
From his waist to his knees , he was covered with a cotten cloth embroidered in silk .
On each of his teeth there were three spots of gold , arranged in such a manner that one would have said all his teeth were fastened together with this metal .
He was perfumed with storax and benzoin .
His skin was painted , but its natural tint was olive . "
On <NAME> Day , the <NAME> went on shore to celebrate mass in a kind of little church which they had constructed on the sea-shore with sails and branches of trees .
An altar had been set up , and during the whole time that the religious ceremony lasted , the king with a large concourse of people , listened in silence and imitated all the motions of the <NAME> .
Then a cross having been planted on a hill with great solemnity , they weighed anchor and made for the port of <NAME> , as being the best for revictualling the vessels and trading .
They arrived there on Sunday , the 7th of April .
<NAME> sent one of his officers on shore at once with the interpreter , as ambassador to the king of <NAME> .
The envoy explained that the chief of the squadron was under the orders of the greatest king in the world .
The object of the voyage , he added , was the wish to pay him a visit , and at the same time to take in some fresh provisions in exchange for merchandise , and then to go to the <NAME> .
Such were the motives which caused them to tarry in a country where they came as friends .
" They are welcome , " replied the king ; " but if they intend to trade they should pay a duty to which all vessels are subject that enter my port , as did , not four days since , a junk from <NAME> , which came to seek for slaves and gold , to which a <NAME> merchant who has remained in this country can testify . "
The <NAME> replied that his master was too great a king to submit to such an unreasonable demand .
They had come with pacific intentions ; but if war were declared , it would be seen with whom they had to deal .
The king of <NAME> , warned by the <NAME> merchant , of the power of those who stood before him , and whom he took for <NAME> , at length consented to forego his claims .
Moreover the king of <NAME> , who had continued to serve as pilot to the <NAME> , so altered the inclinations of his brother sovereign , that the <NAME> obtained the exclusive privilege of trading in the island , and a loyal friendship was sealed between the king of <NAME> and <NAME> by an exchange of blood which each drew from his right arm .
From this moment , provisions were brought and cordial relations established .
The nephew of the king came with a numerous suite to visit <NAME> on board his ship , and the latter took this opportunity to relate to his visitors the wonderful history of the creation of the world , and of the redemption of the human race , and to invite him and his people to become converts to <NAME> .
They showed no repugnance to being baptized , and on the 14th of April the kings of <NAME> and <NAME> , and the <NAME> merchant , with 500 men and as many women received baptism .
But what was only a fashion at first , for it can not be said that the natives knew the religion which they embraced or were persuaded of its truth , became a real frenzy , after a wonderful cure had been effected by <NAME> .
Having learnt that the father of the king had been ill for two years and was on the point of death , the captain-general promised , that if he consented to be baptized and the natives would burn their idols , he would find himself cured .
" He added that he was so convinced of what he said , " relates <NAME> -- for it is as well to quote the author verbatim in such a matter -- " that he agreed to lose his head if what he promised did not happen immediately .
We then made a procession , with all possible pomp , from the place where we were to the sick man 's house , whom we found really in a very sad state in that he could neither speak nor move .
We baptized him with two of his wives and ten daughters .
The captain asked him directly after his baptism how he found himself , and he suddenly replied that thanks to our Lord he was well .
We were all witnesses of this miracle .
The captain above all rendered thanks to God for it .
He gave the prince a refreshing drink , and continued to send him some of it every day till he was quite restored .
On the fifth day the invalid found himself quite cured and got up .
His first care was to have burned , in the presence of the king and all the people , an idol for which he had great veneration , and which some old women guarded carefully in his house .
He also caused some temples which stood on the sea-shore , and in which the people assembled to eat the meat consecrated to their old divinities , to be thrown down .
All the inhabitants applauded these acts , and proposed themselves to go and destroy all the idols , even those which were in use in the king 's house , crying at the same time '_Vive la <NAME> ! _ ' in honour of the king of <NAME> . "
Near to the <NAME> of <NAME> is another island called <NAME> which had two chiefs , one of whom had recognized the authority of <NAME> , while the other having energetically resisted it , <NAME> resolved to impose it upon him by force .
On Friday , the 26th of April , three long boats left for the <NAME> of <NAME> containing sixty men wearing cuirasses and helmets , and armed with muskets ; and thirty _balangais_ bearing the king of <NAME> , his son-in-law , and a number of warriors .
The <NAME> waited for day and then to the number of forty-nine leapt into the water , for the boats could not approach the land on account of the rocks and shallow water .
More than 1500 natives awaited them , and at once threw themselves upon them , and attacked them in three troops , both in front and flank .
The musketeers and the crossbow-men fired on the multitude of warriors from a distance , without doing them much harm , they being protected by their bucklers .
The <NAME> , assailed by stones , arrows , javelins , and lances , and overwhelmed by numbers , set fire to some huts to disperse and intimidate the natives .
But these , made more furious by the sight of the fire , redoubled their efforts , and pressed the Spaniards on all sides , who had the greatest difficulty in resisting them , when a sad event took place which compromised the issue of the combat .
The natives were not slow in remarking that all the blows which they directed towards those parts of their enemies ' bodies which were protected by armour , caused no wounds ; they set themselves therefore to hurl their arrows and javelins against the lower part of the body , which was undefended .
<NAME> , wounded in the leg by a poisoned arrow , gave the order for retreat , which , begun in good order , soon changed into such a flight , that seven or eight Spaniards alone remained at his side .
With much difficulty they kept moving backwards , fighting as they went , in order to reach the boats .
They were already knee-deep in the water when several islanders rushed all together upon <NAME> , who , wounded in the arm , was unable to draw his sword ; they gave him such a sabre-cut upon his leg that he immediately fell down in the water , where he was speedily despatched .
His remaining companions , and among them <NAME> , every one of whom had been hit , hastily regained the boats .
Thus perished the illustrious <NAME> on the 27th of April , 1521 .
" He was adorned with every virtue , " says <NAME> , " and ever exhibited an unshaken constancy in the midst of the greatest adversity .
At sea he always condemned himself to greater privations than the rest of his crew .
Better versed than any one else in the knowledge of nautical charts , he was perfect in the art of navigation , as he proved by making the tour of the world , which none before him had ventured to do . "
<NAME> 's funeral eulogy , though a little hyperbolical , is not untrue in the main .
<NAME> had need of singular constancy and perseverance to penetrate , despite the fears of his companions , into regions peopled by the superstitious spirit of the time with fantastic dangers .
<NAME> nautical science was also necessary to achieve the discovery at the extremity of that long coast of the strait which so justly bears his name .
He was obliged to give unceasing attention to avoid all untoward accidents while exploring those unknown parts without any exact instruments .
That one of the vessels was lost must be imputed to pride and a spirit of revolt in her own captain , more than to any incapacity or want of caution in the captain-general .
Let us add with our enthusiastic narrator , " The glory of <NAME> will survive his death . "
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> 's brother-in-law , and <NAME> were elected commanders by the <NAME> , who were destined to meet with further catastrophes .
The slave who had acted as interpreter up to this time had been slightly wounded during the battle .
From the time of his master 's death he had kept aloof , not rendering any further service to the <NAME> , and remaining extended upon his mat .
After some rather sharp reproofs from <NAME> , who told him that his master 's death did not make him a free man , he disappeared all at once .
He was gone to the newly-baptized king , to whom he declared that if he could allure the <NAME> into some trap and then kill them , he would make himself master of all their provisions and merchandise .
<NAME> , <NAME> , and twenty-seven Spaniards were accordingly invited to a solemn assembly to receive the presents destined by the king of <NAME> for the <NAME> ; during the banquet they were attacked unexpectedly , and were all massacred except <NAME> , who was led bound to the sea-shore , where he besought his companions to ransom him , for if they did not he would be murdered .
But <NAME> and the others , fearing that the insurrection would become general , and that they might be attacked during the negotiations by a numerous fleet which they would not be able to resist , turned a deaf ear to the unfortunate <NAME> 's supplications .
The ships set sail and reached the <NAME> of <NAME> , which was not far distant .
When there , thinking that their numbers were too much reduced to navigate three vessels , they burnt the <NAME> , after having transshipped all that was most precious on board the other vessels .
Then , after having coasted along the <NAME> of Panilongon they stopped at <NAME> , which forms part of <NAME> , a magnificent island , with numerous ports , and rivers abounding in fish , to the north-west of which lies the <NAME> of <NAME> , the most considerable of the <NAME> .
The ships touched also at <NAME> , where they found pigs , goats , fowls , different kinds of bananas , cocoa-nuts , sugar-canes , and rice , with which they provisioned the ships .
This was for them , as <NAME> expresses it , " a promised land . "
Among the things which he thought worthy of notice , the <NAME> traveller mentions the cocks kept by the natives for fighting ; a passion which after so many years is still deeply-rooted amongst the population of the whole <NAME> .
From <NAME> , the <NAME> next went to the <NAME> of <NAME> , the centre of <NAME> civilization .
From that time they had no longer to deal with poverty-stricken people , but with a rich population , who received them with magnificence .
Their reception by the rajah is sufficiently curious to warrant a few words being devoted to it .
At the landing-place they found two elephants with silk trappings , who bore the strangers to the house of the governor of the town , while twelve men carried the presents which were to be offered to the rajah .
From the governor 's house where they slept , to the palace of the king , the streets were kept by armed men .
Upon descending from their elephants the <NAME> were admitted to a room filled with courtiers .
At the end of this room opened another smaller room , hung with cloth of gold , in which were 300 men of the king 's guard armed with poniards .
Through a door they could then see the rajah , sitting by a table with a little child , chewing betel-nut .
Behind him there were only some women .
<NAME> required that the petition to be made must pass in succession through the mouths of three nobles , each of higher rank than the last , before being transmitted , by means of a hollow cane placed in a hole in the wall , to one of the principal officers , who submitted it to the king .
Then there was an exchange of presents , after which the <NAME> Ambassadors were conducted back to their vessels with the same ceremony as on their arrival .
The capital is built on piles in the sea ; so that when the tide rises , the women who sell provisions go about the town in boats .
On the 29th of July more than 100 canoes surrounded the two vessels , whilst at the same time some junks weighed anchor to approach them more nearly .
The <NAME> , fearing to be treacherously attacked , took the initiative and fired off their artillery , which killed a number of people in the canoes , upon which the king excused himself , saying that his fleet had not been directed against them , but against the <NAME> with whom the <NAME> had daily combats .
This island produces arrack ( the alcohol of rice ) , camphor , cinnamon , ginger , oranges , citrons , sugar-canes , melons , radishes , onions , & c. The articles of exchange are copper , quicksilver , cinnabar , glass , woollen cloths , and canvas , and above all iron and spectacles , without mentioning porcelain , and diamonds , some of which were of extraordinary size and value .
The _fauna_ comprises elephants , horses , buffaloes , pigs , goats , and domestic poultry .
The money in use is of bronze , it is called _sapèque_ and consists of small coins which are perforated with holes , that they may be strung together .
On leaving Borneo the travellers sought for a suitable spot in which to repair their vessels , which were in such great need of it that the men were not less than forty-two days over the work .
" The oddest things which I have found in this island , " says <NAME> , " are the trees of which all the leaves are animated .
These leaves resemble those of the mulberry , but are not so long ; the stalk is short and pointed , and near the stalk on both sides there are two feet .
If you touch the leaves , they escape ; but when crushed no blood comes from them .
I have kept one of them in a box for nine days ; when I opened the box , the leaf was walking about in it ; I believe they must live upon air . "
These very curious animals are well known at the present day , and are commonly called leaf-flies ( _mouches-feuille_ ) ; they are of a grey-brown , which makes them more easily mistaken for dead leaves , which they exactly resemble in appearance .
It was while in these parts that the <NAME> expedition , which , during <NAME> 's life had preserved its scientific character , began perceptibly to become piratical .
Thus , on several occasions , junks were seized upon , and their crews forced by their <NAME> captors to pay large ransoms .
The ships next passed by the <NAME> of the <NAME> , the haunt of <NAME> pirates , who have even now only lately submitted to the <NAME> arms ; then by <NAME> , which had been already visited , for it was known that the eagerly sought-for Moluccas must be in its neighbourhood , whether more or less remote .
At last , after having seen a number of islands , of which the names would not convey much idea to us , on Wednesday , the 6th of November the <NAME> discovered the <NAME> , about which the <NAME> had related such terrifying fables , and two days later they landed at <NAME> .
Thus the object of the voyage was attained .
The king came to meet the <NAME> , and invited them to go on board his canoe .
" He was seated under a silk parasol which covered him entirely .
In front of him were placed one of his sons who carried the royal sceptre , two men who had each a golden vase full of water for washing the king 's hands , and two others holding small gilt boxes filled with betel . "
Then the <NAME> made the king come on board the vessels , where they showed him much respect , at the same time loading him and those who accompanied him with presents , which seemed to them very precious .
" This king is a <NAME> , that is to say , an <NAME> , " <NAME> affirms ; " he is nearly forty-five years of age , tolerably well made , and with a fine physiognomy .
His clothing consisted of a very fine shirt , the cuffs of which were embroidered in gold ; drapery descended from his waist to his feet ; a silk veil ( no doubt a turban ) covered his head , and upon this veil there was a garland of flowers .
His name is Rajah-sultan Manzor . "
The next day , in a long interview which he had with the <NAME> , <NAME> declared his intention of placing himself with the <NAME> of <NAME> and <NAME> under the protection of the king of <NAME> .
This is the place to give some details about the <NAME> of the <NAME> , drawn from <NAME> 's narrative , which we are following step by step in the version that M. Ed .
<NAME> has given , and to which he has added such valuable notes .
This Archipelago properly speaking , comprises the <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> ; but the <NAME> and <NAME> groups are also often comprehended under the general name of <NAME> .
Formerly convulsed by repeated volcanic commotions , this Archipelago contains a great number of craters almost all extinct , or in repose during a long succession of years .
The air there is burning , and would be almost unfit to breathe , if frequent rains did not fall and refresh the atmosphere .
The natural productions are extremely valuable .
In the first rank must be placed the sago-tree , of which the pith called sago takes , with yams , the place of cereals throughout <NAME> .
As soon as the tree is cut down , the pith is extracted , which is then grated , passed through a sieve , and afterwards cut up in the form of small rolls , which are dried in the shade .
There are also the mulberry , the clove , the nutmeg , the camphor , and pepper-trees ; in fact all the spice-trees and all the tropical fruits .
The forests contain some valuable kinds of wood , ebony , iron-wood , teak , famous for its strength and employed from the most ancient times in costly buildings , and the <NAME> laurel , which yields an aromatic essential oil that is highly prized .
At this period domestic animals were not numerous in the <NAME> , but among the wild animals the most curious were the _babiroussa_ , an enormous wild boar with long tusks bent backwards ; the opossum , a kind of didelphis a little larger than our squirrel ; the phalanger , a marsupial which lives in thick , dark forests , where it feeds upon leaves and fruit ; and the tarsier , a kind of jerboa , a very harmless , inoffensive little animal with reddish-coloured hair , about the size of a rat , but whose body bears some resemblance to that of an ape .
Among the birds , the most remarkable were the parroquets and cockatoos , the birds of <NAME> of which so many fabulous accounts were given , and which until then had been believed to be without legs , the king-fishers , and the cassowaries , great wading-birds almost as large as ostriches .
A <NAME> named <NAME> had been long settled in the <NAME> , and to him the <NAME> forwarded a letter , in the hope that he would betray his country and attach himself to <NAME> .
They obtained the most curious information from him with regard to the expeditions which the king of <NAME> had despatched to the Cape of <NAME> , to the <NAME> de la <NAME> and to the <NAME> ; but from various circumstances these latter expeditions had not been able to take place .
He himself had been sixteen years in this <NAME> ; the <NAME> had been installed there for ten years , but upon this fact they preserved the most complete silence .
When <NAME> saw the Spaniards making their preparations for departure , he came on board with his wife and his goods to return to <NAME> .
On the 12th of November all the merchandise destined for barter was landed , it being chiefly derived from the four junks which had been seized in <NAME> .
Certainly the Spaniards traded to great advantage , but nevertheless not to so great an extent as they might have done , for they were in haste to return to <NAME> .
Some vessels from <NAME> and <NAME> came also to trade with them , and a few days later they received a considerable stock of cloves from the king of <NAME> .
This king invited them to a great banquet which he said it was his custom to give when a vessel or junk was loaded with the first cloves .
But the <NAME> , remembering what had happened to them in the <NAME> , refused the invitation while presenting compliments and excuses to the king .
When their cargo was completed , they set sail .
Scarcely had the <NAME> put to sea before it was perceived that she had a serious leak , and the return to <NAME> as fast as possible was unavoidable .
The skilful divers whom the king placed at the disposal of the <NAME> , were unable to discover the hole , and it became necessary to partly unload the ship to make the necessary repairs .
The sailors who were on board the <NAME> would not wait for their companions , and the ship 's officers seeing clearly that the <NAME> would not be fit for the voyage to <NAME> , decided that she should go to <NAME> , where her valuable cargo would be discharged and transported across the <NAME> to the <NAME> , where a vessel would be sent to fetch it .
But neither the unfortunate vessel nor her crew was destined ever to return to <NAME> .
The <NAME> , commanded by the alguazil <NAME> de <NAME> , who had <NAME> de <NAME> as pilot , was in so bad a state that after leaving <NAME> , she was obliged to anchor at <NAME> , in the port of <NAME> , where her crew consisting of seventeen men was immediately imprisoned by the <NAME> .
The only reply given to <NAME> 's remonstrances was a threat to hang him to the yard of a vessel ; and the unfortunate alguazil , after having been transferred to <NAME> , was sent to <NAME> , where for seven months he remained shut up in the prison of the <NAME> with two Spaniards , the sole survivors of the crew of the <NAME> .
As to the <NAME> , she left <NAME> richly laden under the command of <NAME> del <NAME> , who , after having been simply a pilot on board one of <NAME> 's ships , had taken the command of the _Concepcion_ on the 27th of April , 1521 , and who succeeded to <NAME> de <NAME> , when the latter was superseded in his command for incapacity .
The crew of the <NAME> was composed of only fifty-three Europeans and thirteen Indians .
Fifty-four Europeans remained at <NAME> on board the <NAME> .
After passing amidst the islands of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , the <NAME> left this latter island to the west , and steering west-south-west , stopped during the night at the island of <NAME> or <NAME> .
At thirty miles from thence the <NAME> anchored at <NAME> , ( the <NAME> of <NAME> ) , where the ship was revictualled .
They stopped 105 miles further on , at <NAME> , where mace and nutmegs are found , then at <NAME> , where a great trade in white sandal-wood is carried on .
They spent a fortnight there to repair their ship , which had suffered much , and there they laid in an ample provision of wax and pepper ; then they anchored at <NAME> , where they could only obtain provisions by retaining by stratagem the chief of the village and his son , who had come on board the ship .
This island was frequented by junks from <NAME> , and by the " praos , " from <NAME> and <NAME> , which traded largely there in sandal-wood and pepper .
A little further on the <NAME> touched at <NAME> , where , as it appears , _suttee_ was practised at this time , as it has been in <NAME> until quite recently .
Among the stories which <NAME> relates , without entirely believing them , is one which is most curious .
It concerns a gigantic bird the <NAME> , of which the bones and the enormous eggs were discovered in <NAME> about the year 1850 .
It is an instance proving the caution needed before rejecting as fictitious many apparently fabulous legends , but which on examination may prove to possess a substratum of truth .
" To the north of <NAME> , " says <NAME> , " in the gulf of <NAME> , there is a very large tree called _campanganghi_ inhabited by certain birds called _garula_ , which are so large and strong that they can bear away a buffalo and even an elephant , and carry it as they fly to the place where the tree _puzathaer_ is . "
This legend has been current ever since the ninth century , among the Persians and <NAME> , and this bird plays a wonderful part in <NAME> tales under the name of the _roc_ .
It is not surprising , therefore , that <NAME> found an analogous tradition among the <NAME> .
After leaving greater <NAME> , the <NAME> rounded the peninsula of <NAME> , which had been subjugated to <NAME> by the great Albuquerque ten years before .
In the immediate neighbourhood are <NAME> and <NAME> , and <NAME> , where rhubarb grows .
This substance is discovered in the following manner .
" A company of from twenty to five-and-twenty men go into the wood , where they pass the night in the trees , to protect themselves from lions ( note here , that there are no lions in this country ) , and other ferocious beasts , and also that they may better perceive the odour of the rhubarb , which the wind wafts towards them .
In the morning they go towards the place whence came the odour , and search there for the rhubarb until they find it .
<NAME> is the putrefied wood of a great tree , and acquires its odour even from its putrefaction , the best part of the tree is the root , nevertheless the trunk , which they call _calama_ , has the same medicinal virtue . "
Decidedly it is not from <NAME> that we should seek to acquire botanical knowledge ; we should run a great risk of deceiving ourselves if we took in earnest the nonsense that the <NAME> told him from whom he drew his information .
The <NAME> traveller gives us also fantastic details about <NAME> with the greatest seriousness , and falls into the grave errors , which his contemporary <NAME> had avoided .
It is to the latter we owe the information that the trade in _anfiam_ or opium has existed from this period .
When once the <NAME> had left the shores of <NAME> , <NAME> del <NAME> took great care to avoid the coast of <NAME> , where the <NAME> had been established since the beginning of the century .
He kept to the open sea as far as 42 degrees south latitude , and for nine weeks he was obliged to keep the sails furled , on account of the constant west and north-west winds , which ended in a fearful storm .
To keep to this course required great perseverance on the part of the captain , with a settled desire on his part to carry his enterprise to a successful issue .
The vessel had several leaks , and a number of the sailors demanded an anchorage at <NAME> , for the provisions which were not salted having become bad , the crew had only rice and water for food and drink .
At last on the 6th of May , the Cape of <NAME> was doubled and a favourable issue to the voyage might be hoped for .
Nevertheless , many vexatious accidents still awaited the navigator .
In two months , twenty-one men , <NAME> and <NAME> , died from privations , and if on the 9th July they had not landed at <NAME> , one of the <NAME> de <NAME> , the whole crew would have died of hunger .
As this archipelago belonged to <NAME> , the sailors took care to say that they came from <NAME> , and carefully concealed the route which they had discovered .
But one of the sailors having had the imprudence to say that the <NAME> was the only vessel of <NAME> 's squadron which had returned to <NAME> , the <NAME> immediately seized the crew of a long-boat , and prepared to attack the <NAME> vessel .
However , <NAME> on board his vessel was watching all the movements of the <NAME> , and suspecting , by the preparations which he saw , that there was an intention of seizing the <NAME> , he set sail , leaving thirteen men of his crew in the hands of the <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> assigns a different motive from the one given by <NAME> , for the anchorage at the <NAME> de <NAME> .
He asserts that the fatigued state of the crew , who were reduced by privations , and who in spite of everything had not ceased to work the pumps , had decided the captain to stop and buy some slaves to aid them in this work .
Having no money the <NAME> would have paid with some of their spices , which would have opened the eyes of the <NAME> .
" To see if our journals were correctly kept , " says <NAME> , " we inquired on shore what day of the week it was .
They replied that it was Thursday , which surprised us , because according to our journals it was as yet only Wednesday .
We could not be persuaded that we had made the mistake of a day ; I was more astonished myself than the others were , because having always been sufficiently well to keep my journal , I had uninterruptedly marked the days of the week , and the course of the months .
We learnt afterwards , that there was no error in our calculation , for having always travelled towards the west , following the course of the sun , and having returned to the same point , we must have gained twenty-four hours upon those who had remained stationary ; one has only need of reflection to be convinced of this fact . "
<NAME> del <NAME> rapidly made the coast of <NAME> , and on the 6th of September entered the <NAME> of <NAME> de <NAME> , with a crew of seventeen men , almost all of whom were ill. Two days later he anchored before the mole at <NAME> , after having accomplished a complete circuit of the world .
As soon as he arrived , <NAME> del <NAME> went to <NAME> , where the court was , and received from <NAME> V. the welcome which was merited after so many difficulties had been courageously overcome .
The bold mariner received permission to take as his armorial bearings , a globe with this motto , <NAME> circumdedisti me_ , and he also received a pension of 500 ducats .
The rich freight of the <NAME> , decided the Emperor to send a second fleet to the <NAME> .
The supreme command of it was not , however , given to <NAME> del <NAME> ; it was reserved for the commander <NAME> de <NAME> , whose only claim to it was his grand name .
However , after the death of the chief of the expedition , which happened as soon as the fleet had passed the <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> found himself invested with the command , but he did not hold it long , for he died six days afterwards .
As for the ship <NAME> , she was long preserved in the port of <NAME> , but in spite of all the care that was taken of her , she at length fell to pieces from old age .
The <NAME> -- Eric the Red -- The Zenos -- <NAME> -- Cortereal -- <NAME> -- Willoughby -- Chancellor .
<NAME> had opened up the road to the north to the Scandinavians by discovering <NAME> ( the famous Thule ) and the <NAME> , of which the mud , the shallow-water , and the ice render the navigation dangerous , and where the nights are as light as twilight .
The traditions of the voyages undertaken by the ancients to the <NAME> , the <NAME> , and even to <NAME> , were treasured up among the <NAME> monks , who were learned men , and themselves bold mariners , as their successive establishments in these archipelagos clearly prove .
They were also the pilots of the <NAME> , a name given generally to the <NAME> pirates , both <NAME> and <NAME> , who rendered themselves so formidable to the whole of <NAME> during the <NAME> .
But if all the information that we owe to the ancients , both <NAME> and <NAME> , with regard to these hyperborean countries be extremely vague and so to speak fabulous , it is not so with that which concerns the adventurous enterprises of the " Men of the <NAME> . "
The <NAME> , as the <NAME> and <NAME> songs are called , are extremely precise , and the numerous data which we owe to them are daily confirmed by the archæological discoveries made in <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
This is a source of valuable information which was long unknown and unexplored , and of which we owe the revelation to the learned <NAME> , C. C. Rafn , who has furnished us with authentic facts of the greatest interest bearing on the pre-Columbian discovery of <NAME> .
<NAME> was poor and encumbered with population .
Hence arose the necessity for a permanent emigration , which should allow a considerable portion of the inhabitants to seek in more favoured regions the nourishment which a frozen soil denied them .
When they had found some country rich enough to yield them an abundant spoil , they then returned to their own land , and set out the following spring accompanied by all those who could be enticed either by the love of lucre , the desire for an easy life , or by the thirst for strife .
Intrepid hunters and fishermen , accustomed to a dangerous navigation between the continent and the mass of islands which border it and appear to defend it against the assaults of the ocean , and across the narrow , deep _fiords_ , which seem as though they were cut into the soil itself by some gigantic sword , they set out in those oak vessels , the sight of which made the people tremble who lived on the shores of the <NAME> and <NAME> Channel .
Sometimes decked , these vessels , long or short , large or small , were usually terminated in front by a spur of enormous size , above which the prow sometimes rose to a great height , taking the form of an _S_ .
The _hällristningar_ , for so they call the graphic representations so often met with on the rocks of <NAME> and <NAME> , enable us to picture to ourselves these swift vessels , which could carry a considerable crew .
<NAME> was the _Long-serpent_ of <NAME> , which had thirty-two benches of rowers and held ninety men , <NAME> 's vessel , which carried sixty , and the two vessels of Olaf the Saint , which carried sometimes 200 men .
The Sea-kings , as they often called these adventurers , lived on the ocean , never settling on shore , passing from the pillage of a castle to the burning of an abbey , devastating the coasts of <NAME> , ascending rivers , especially the <NAME> , as far as <NAME> , sailing over the <NAME> as far as <NAME> , establishing themselves later in <NAME> , and leaving traces of their incursions or their sojourn in all the regions of the known world .
<NAME> , far from being , as at the present day , an act falling under the ban of the law , was not only encouraged in that barbarous or half-civilized society , but was celebrated in the songs of the <NAME> , who reserved their most enthusiastic eulogies for celebrating chivalrous struggles , adventurous privateering , and all exhibitions of strength .
From the eighth century , these formidable sea-rovers frequented the groups of the <NAME> , the <NAME> , the <NAME> , and <NAME> , where they met with the <NAME> monks , who had settled themselves there nearly a century earlier , to instruct the idolatrous population .
In 861 a <NAME> pirate , named <NAME> , was carried by a storm towards an island covered with snow , which he named <NAME> ( land of snow ) , a name changed later to that of <NAME> ( land of ice ) .
There again the <NAME> found the <NAME> monks under the name of <NAME> , in the cantons of <NAME> and <NAME> .
<NAME> installed himself some years afterwards in the country , and founded <NAME> .
In 885 the triumph of <NAME> , who had just subjugated the whole of <NAME> by force of arms , brought a considerable number of malcontents to <NAME> .
They established there the republican form of government , which had just been overthrown in their own country , and which subsisted till 1261 , the epoch when <NAME> passed under the dominion of the kings of <NAME> .
When established in <NAME> , these bold fellows , lovers of adventure and of long hunts in pursuit of seals and walrus , retained their wandering habits and pursued their bold plans in the west , where only three years after the arrival of <NAME> , <NAME> discovered the snowy peaks of the mountains of <NAME> .
Five years later , <NAME> the <NAME> , banished from <NAME> for murder , rediscovered the land in latitude 64 degrees north , of which <NAME> had caught a glimpse .
The sterility of this ice-bound coast made him decide to seek a milder climate with a more open country , and one producing more game , in the south .
So he rounded <NAME> at the extremity of <NAME> , established himself on the west coast , and built some vast dwellings for himself and his companions , of which M. Jorgensen has discovered the ruins .
This country was worthy at that period of the name of <NAME> ( <NAME> ) which the <NAME> gave to it , but the annual and great increase of the glaciers , has rendered it since that epoch a land of desolation .
<NAME> returned to <NAME> to seek his friends , and in the same year that he returned to <NAME> ( for so he called his settlement ) , fourteen vessels laden with emigrants came to join him .
It was a veritable exodus .
These events took place in the year 1000 .
As quickly as the resources of the country allowed of it , the population of <NAME> increased , and in 1121 , <NAME> , the capital of the country , became the seat of a bishopric , which existed until after the discovery of the Antilles by <NAME> .
In 986 Bjarn <NAME> , who had come from <NAME> to <NAME> to spend the winter with his father , learnt that the latter had joined Eric the Red in <NAME> .
Without hesitation , the young man again put to sea , seeking at haphazard for a country of which he did not even know the exact situation , and was cast by currents on coasts which we think must have been those of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
He ended , however , by reaching <NAME> , where <NAME> , the powerful <NAME> _jarl_ , reproached him for not having examined with more care countries of which he owed his knowledge to a happy accident of the sea .
<NAME> had sent his son <NAME> to the <NAME> court , so close at this time was the connexion between the metropolis and the colonies .
The king , who had been converted to <NAME> , had just despatched a mission to <NAME> charged to overthrow the worship of <NAME> .
He committed to <NAME> 's care some priests who were to instruct the <NAME> ; but scarcely had the young adventurer returned to his own country , when he left the holy men to work out the accomplishment of their difficult task and hearing of the discovery made by <NAME> , he fitted out his vessels and went to seek for the lands which had been only imperfectly seen .
He landed first on a desolate and stony plain , to which he gave the name of <NAME> , and which we have no hesitation in recognizing as <NAME> , and afterwards on a flat sandy shore behind which rose an immense screen of dark forests , cheered by the songs of innumerable birds .
A third time he put to sea and steering towards the south he arrived at the <NAME> of <NAME> , where the mild climate and the river teeming with salmon induced him to settle , and where he constructed vast buildings of planks , which he called <NAME> ( <NAME> 's house ) .
Then he sent some of his companions to explore the country , and they returned with the good news that the wild vine grows in the country , to which it owes the name of <NAME> .
In the spring of the year 1001 , <NAME> , having laded his ship with skins , grapes , wood , and other productions of the country , set out for <NAME> ; he had made the valuable observation that the shortest day in <NAME> lasted nine hours , which places the site of <NAME> at 41 degrees 24 minutes 10 seconds .
This fortunate voyage and the salvage of a <NAME> vessel carrying fifteen men , gained for Leif the surname of the <NAME> .
This expedition made a great stir , and the account of the wonders of the country in which <NAME> had settled , induced his brother <NAME> , to set out with thirty men .
After passing the winter at <NAME> , <NAME> explored the coasts to the south , returning in the autumn to <NAME> , and in the following year 1004 , he sailed along the coast to the north of <NAME> .
During this return voyage , the <NAME> met with the <NAME> for the first time , and without any provocation , slaughtered them without mercy .
The following night they found themselves all at once surrounded by a numerous flotilla of <NAME> , from which came a cloud of arrows .
<NAME> alone , the chief of the expedition , was mortally wounded ; he was buried by his companions on a promontory , to which they gave the name of the promontory of the <NAME> .
Now , in the Gulf of <NAME> in the eighteenth century , a tomb of masonry was discovered , in which , with the bones , was found a sword-hilt of iron .
The Indians not being acquainted with this metal , it could not be one of their skeletons ; it was not either , the remains of one of the Europeans who had landed after the fifteenth century , for their swords had not this very characteristic form .
This tomb has been thought to be that of a <NAME> , and we venture to say , that of <NAME> , son of Eric the Red .
In the spring of 1007 , three vessels carrying 160 men and some cattle , left <NAME> ; the object in view was the foundation of a permanent colony .
The emigrants after sighting <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , landed in an island , upon which they constructed some barracks and began the work of cultivation .
But they must either have laid their plans badly , or have been wanting in foresight , for the winter found them without provisions , and they suffered cruelly from hunger .
They had , however , the good sense to regain the continent , where in comparative ease , they could await the end of the winter .
At the beginning of 1008 , they set out to seek for <NAME> , and settled themselves at <NAME> , on the opposite shore to the old settlement of <NAME> .
There , for the first time , some intercourse was held with the natives , called _Skrellings_ in the sagas , and whom , from the manner in which they are portrayed , it is easy to recognize as <NAME> .
The first meeting was peaceable , and barter was carried on with them until the day when the desire of the <NAME> to acquire iron hatchets , always prudently refused them by the <NAME> , drove them to acts of aggression , which decided the new-comers , after three years of residence , to return to their own country , which they did without leaving behind them any lasting trace of their stay in the country .
It will be easily understood that we can not give any detailed account of all the expeditions , which set out from <NAME> , and succeeded each other on the coasts of <NAME> and the <NAME> .
Those of our readers who wish for circumstantial details , should refer to M. <NAME> 's interesting publication , the most complete work on the subject , and from which we have borrowed all that relates to the <NAME> expeditions .
The same year as Erik the <NAME> landed in <NAME> ( 983 ) , a certain <NAME> , being driven out of the ordinary course by storms , was cast upon the shores of a country known by the name of " <NAME> man 's land , " which extended according to <NAME> from <NAME> to <NAME> .
What is the meaning of this name " <NAME> man 's land " ?
Had some compatriots of <NAME> 's already settled there ?
There is some reason to suppose so even from the words used in the chronicle .
We can understand how interesting it would be , to be able to determine the nationality of these first colonists .
However , the Sagas have not as yet revealed all their secrets .
There are probably , some of them still unknown , and as those which have been successively discovered , have confirmed facts already admitted , there is every reason to hope that our knowledge of <NAME> navigation may become more precise .
Another legend , of which great part is mere romance , but which nevertheless , contains a foundation of truth , relates that a certain Bjorn , who was obliged to quit <NAME> in consequence of an unfortunate passion , took refuge in the countries beyond <NAME> , where in 1027 , he was found by some of his countrymen .
In 1051 , during another expedition , an Icelandic woman was killed by some _Skrellings_ , and in 1867 , a tomb was exhumed , bearing a _runic_ inscription , and containing bones , and some articles of the toilet , which are now preserved in the museum at <NAME> .
This discovery was made at the exact spot indicated in the <NAME> which related these events , and which was not itself discovered until 1863 .
But the <NAME> , established in <NAME> and <NAME> , were not the only people who frequented the coast of <NAME> about the year 1000 , which is proved by the name of " <NAME> , " which was given to <NAME> man 's land .
As the history of Madoc-op-Owen proves , the <NAME> and <NAME> founded colonies there , regarding which we have but little information , but vague and uncertain as it is , <NAME> .
d'Avezac and <NAME> agree in recognizing its probability .
Having now said a few words upon the travels and settlements of the <NAME> in <NAME> , <NAME> , and the more southern countries , we must return to the north .
The colonies first founded in the neighbourhood of <NAME> , had not been slow in stretching along the western coast , which at this period was infinitely less desolate than it is at the present day , as far as northern latitudes , which were not again reached until our own day .
Thus at this time they caught seals , walrus , and whales in the bay of <NAME> ; there were 190 towns counted then in <NAME> and eighty-six in <NAME> , while at the present day , there are far fewer <NAME> settlements on these icy shores .
These towns were probably only inconsiderable groups of those houses in stone and wood , of which so many ruins have been found from <NAME> , as far as <NAME> in about 72 degrees 50 minutes .
At the same time numerous runic inscriptions , which have now been deciphered , have given a degree of absolute certainty to facts so long unknown .
But how many of these vestiges of the past still remain to be discovered !
how many of these valuable evidences of the bravery and spirit of enterprise of the <NAME> race are for ever buried under the glaciers !
[ Illustration : The <NAME> of <NAME> . ]
We have also obtained evidence that <NAME> had been brought into <NAME> , and especially into <NAME> .
To this country , according to the instructions of <NAME> IV. , there were pastoral visits made to strengthen the newly-converted <NAME> in the faith , and to evangelize the <NAME> and the <NAME> tribes .
Besides this , M. Riant in 1865 , has proved incontrovertibly that the Crusades were preached in <NAME> in the bishopric of <NAME> , as well as in the _islands and neighbouring lands_ , and that up to 1418 , <NAME> paid to the <NAME> tithes and <NAME> 's pence , which for that year consisted of 2600 lbs .
The <NAME> colonies owe their downfall and ruin to various causes : to the very rapid extension of the glaciers , -- <NAME> has proved that the glacier of <NAME> moves at the rate of about thirty-three yards annually ; -- to the bad policy of the mother country , which prevented the recruiting of the colonies ; to the black plague , which decimated the population of <NAME> from 1347 to 1351 ; lastly , to the depredations of the pirates , who ravaged these already enfeebled countries in 1418 , and in whom some have thought they recognized certain inhabitants of the <NAME> and <NAME> , of which we are now about to speak .
One of the companions of <NAME> the <NAME> , named Saint-Clair or <NAME> , not thinking that the portion of the conquered country allotted to him was proportioned to his merits , went to try his luck in <NAME> , where he was not long in rising to fortune and honours .
In the latter half of the fourteenth century , the <NAME> passed into the hands of his descendants .
About 1390 , a certain <NAME> , a member of one of the most ancient and noble <NAME> families , who had fitted out a vessel at his own expense , to visit <NAME> and <NAME> as a matter of curiosity , was wrecked in the archipelago of the <NAME> whither he had been driven by a storm .
He was about to be massacred by the inhabitants , when the <NAME> , <NAME> took him under his protection .
The history of this wreck , and the adventures and discoveries which followed it , published in the collection of <NAME> had been written by <NAME> , says <NAME> , the learned geographer , in his " Threshold of the <NAME> . "
Unfortunately one of his descendants named <NAME> , born in 1515 , when a boy , not knowing the value of these papers , tore them up , " but some of the letters surviving , he was able from them subsequently to compile the narrative as we now have it , and which was printed in <NAME> in 1558 .
There was also found in the palace an old map , rotten with age , illustrative of his voyages .
Of this he made a copy , unluckily supplying from his own reading of the narrative what he thought was requisite for its illustration .
By doing this in a blundering way , unaided by the geographical knowledge which enables us to see where he goes astray , he threw the whole of the geography which he derived from the narrative into the most lamentable confusion , while those parts of the map which are not thus sophisticated , and which are consequently original , present an accuracy far in advance by many generations of the geography even of <NAME> 's time , and confirm in a notable manner the site of the old <NAME> colony .
In these facts we have not only the solution of all the discussions which have arisen on the subject , but the most indisputable proof of the authenticity of the narrative ; for it is clear that <NAME> , junior , could not himself have been the ingenious concocter of a story the straightforward truth of which he could thus ignorantly distort upon the face of the map . "
The name of <NAME> , in which writers of the present day , and chief among them <NAME> , who has rescued these facts from the domain of fable , recognize the name of <NAME> -- appears to be in fact only applicable to this earl of the <NAME> .
At this time the seas of the north of <NAME> were infected by <NAME> pirates .
<NAME> , who had recognized in <NAME> a clever mariner , attached him to himself , and with him conquered the country of <NAME> , the haunt of pirates , who ravaged all the north of <NAME> .
In the maps at the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth century this name is applied to the archipelago of the <NAME> , a reasonable indication , for <NAME> has recognized in the present names of the harbours and islands of this archipelago a considerable number of those given by <NAME> ; finally the facts which we owe to the <NAME> navigator about the waters , -- abounding in fish and dangerous from shallows , -- which divide this archipelago , are still true at the present day .
Satisfied with his position , <NAME> wrote to his brother <NAME> to come and join him .
While <NAME> was conquering the <NAME> , the <NAME> pirates desolated the <NAME> , then called <NAME> .
<NAME> set sail to give them battle , but was himself obliged to fly before their fleet , much more numerous than his own , and to take refuge on a small island on the coast of <NAME> .
After wintering in this place <NAME> must have landed the following year on the eastern coast of <NAME> at 69 degrees north latitude , in a place " where was a monastery of the order of preaching friars , and a church dedicated to <NAME> .
The cells were warmed by a natural spring of hot water , which the monks used to prepare their food and to bake their bread .
The monks had also gardens covered over in the winter season , and warmed by the same means , so that they were able to produce flowers , fruits , and herbs as well as if they had lived in a mild climate . "
There would seem to be some confirmation of these narratives in the fact that between the years 1828-1830 a captain of the <NAME> navy met with a population of 600 individuals at 69 degrees north latitude , of a purely <NAME> type .
But these adventurous travels in countries of which the climate was so different from that of <NAME> , proved fatal to <NAME> , who died a short time after his return to <NAME> .
An old sailor , who had returned with the <NAME> , and who said he had been for many long years a prisoner in the countries of the extreme west , gave to <NAME> such precise and tempting details of the fertility and extent of these regions , that the latter resolved to attempt their conquest with <NAME> who had rejoined his brother .
But the inhabitants showed themselves everywhere so hostile , and opposed such resistance to the strangers landing , that <NAME> after a long and dangerous voyage was obliged to return to <NAME> .
These are all the details that have been left to us , and they make us deeply regret the loss of those that <NAME> should have furnished in his letters to his father <NAME> , on the subject of the countries which Forster and Malto-Brun have thought may be identified with <NAME> .
Who knows , if in his voyage to <NAME> and during his wanderings as far as <NAME> , <NAME> may not have heard mentioned the ancient expeditions of the <NAME> and the <NAME> , and if this information may not have appeared to him a strange confirmation of the theories which he held , and of the ideas for whose realization he came to claim the protection of the King of <NAME> ?
From the collection of facts which have been here briefly given , it follows that <NAME> was known to <NAME> and had been colonized before the time of <NAME> .
But in consequence of various circumstances , and foremost among these must be placed the rarity of communication between the people in the north of <NAME> and those in the south , the discoveries made by the <NAME> were only vaguely known in <NAME> and <NAME> .
Judging by appearances , we of the present day know much more on this subject than did the fellow-countrymen and contemporaries of <NAME> .
If the <NAME> mariner had been informed of the existence of some rumours , he classed them with the information he had collected in the <NAME> de <NAME> and with his classical recollections of the famous <NAME> of <NAME> and the <NAME> of <NAME> .
From this information , which came from so many different sides , the certainty awoke within him that the east could be reached by the western route .
However it may be , his glory remains whole and entire ; he is really the discoverer of <NAME> , and not those who were carried thither in spite of themselves by chances of wind and storm , without their having any intention of reaching the shores of <NAME> , which <NAME> would have done , had not the way been barred by <NAME> .
The information that we are about to give on the family of <NAME> , although it may be much more complete than that which can be met with in biographical Dictionaries , is still extremely vague .
Nevertheless we must content ourselves with it , for up to this time history has not collected further details concerning this race of intrepid navigators .
<NAME> <NAME> was the natural son of a gentleman named <NAME> da <NAME> , who had received the soubriquet of <NAME> from the King of <NAME> , on account of the magnificence of his house and followers .
Devoted like so many other gentlemen of this period to sea-faring adventure , <NAME> had carried off in <NAME> a young girl named <NAME> de <NAME> , who became his wife .
After having been gentleman-usher to the <NAME> don <NAME> , he was sent by the king to the <NAME> , with <NAME> .
The two navigators saw an island known from this time by the name of <NAME> dos Bacalhaos_ -- the land of cod-fish -- which must really have been <NAME> .
The date of this discovery is approximately fixed by the fact that on their return , they landed at <NAME> and finding the captainship vacant by the death of <NAME> de <NAME> , they went to ask for it from the <NAME> , the widow of the <NAME> ; she bestowed it upon them on condition that they would divide it between them , a fact which is confirmed by a deed of gift dated from <NAME> the 2nd of April , 1464 .
Though one can not guarantee the authenticity of this discovery of <NAME> , it is nevertheless an ascertained fact that <NAME> 's voyage must have been signalized by some extraordinary event ; donations of such importance as this were only made to those who had rendered some great service to the crown .
When <NAME> was settled at <NAME> from 1490 to 1497 , he caused a fine palace to be built in the town of <NAME> , where he lived with his three children .
His third son , <NAME> , after having been in the service of King Emmanuel , when the latter was only <NAME> de <NAME> had felt himself attracted while still young to the enterprises of discovery which had rendered his father illustrious .
By an act dated from <NAME> the 12th of March , 1500 , King <NAME> made a gift to <NAME> of any islands or _terra firma_ which he might discover , and the king added this valuable information , that " already and at other times he had sought for them on his own account and at his own expense . "
For <NAME> this was not his first essay .
Probably , his researches may have been directed to the parts where his father had discovered the <NAME> of <NAME> .
At his own expense , although with the assistance of the king , <NAME> fitted out two vessels at the commencement of the summer of 1500 , and after having touched at <NAME> , he sailed towards the north-west .
His first discovery was of a land of which the fertile and verdant aspect seems to have charmed him .
He saw there a great river bearing ice along with it on its course -- the <NAME> Lawrence -- which some of his companions mistook for an arm of the sea , and to which he gave the name of <NAME> .
" Its volume is so considerable that it is not probable that this country is an island , besides , it must be completely covered with a very thick coating of snow to produce such a stream of water . "
The houses in this country were of wood and covered with skins and furs .
The inhabitants were unacquainted with iron , but used swords made of sharpened stones , and their arrows were tipped with fish-bones or stones .
Tall and well-made , their faces and bodies were painted in different colours according to taste , they wore golden and copper bracelets , and dressed themselves in garments of fur .
<NAME> pursued his voyage and arrived at the Cape of <NAME> , " fishes which are found in such great quantities upon this coast that they hinder the advance of the caravels . "
Then he followed the shore for a stretch of 600 miles , from 56 degrees to 60 degrees , or even more , naming the islands , the rivers , and the gulfs that he met with , as is proved by <NAME> do <NAME> , <NAME> de <NAME> , & c. , and landing and holding intercourse with the natives .
<NAME> cold , and a veritable river of gigantic blocks of ice prevented the expedition from going farther north , and it returned to <NAME> bringing back with it fifty-seven natives .
The very year of his return , on the 15th of May , 1501 , <NAME> , in pursuance of an order of the 15th of April , received provisions , and left <NAME> in the hope of extending the field of his discoveries .
But from this time he is never again mentioned .
<NAME> , his brother , who was the first gentleman-usher to the king , then requested and obtained permission to go and seek his brother , and to pursue his enterprise .
By an act of the 15th of January , 1502 , a deed of gift conveyed to him the half of the terra firma and islands which his brother might have discovered .
Setting out on the 10th of May of this year with three vessels , <NAME> reached <NAME> , where he divided his little squadron , so that each of the vessels might explore the coasts separately , while he fixed the place of rendezvous .
But at the time fixed , he did not reappear , and the two other vessels , after waiting for him till the 20th of <NAME> , set out on their return to <NAME> .
In 1503 , the king sent two caravels to try to obtain news of the two brothers , but the search was in vain , and they returned without having acquired any information .
When <NAME> , the last of the brothers <NAME> , who was captain and governor of the <NAME> of <NAME> and <NAME> , and alcaide mõr of the town of <NAME> , became acquainted with these sad events , he resolved to fit out a vessel at his own cost , and to go and search for his brothers .
The king , however , would not allow him to go , fearing to lose the last of this race of good servants .
Upon the maps of this period , <NAME> is often indicated by the name of <NAME> dos <NAME> , a name which is sometimes extended much further south , embracing a great part of <NAME> .
* * * * * All that concerns <NAME> and <NAME> has been until recently shrouded by a mist which is not even now completely dissipated , notwithstanding the conscientious labours of <NAME> the <NAME> in 1831 , and of our compatriot M. d'Avezac ; as also those of <NAME> the <NAME> , who taking advantage of the discoveries made among the <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> archives , has built up an imposing monument , of which some parts , however , are open to discussion .
It is from the two last-named works that we shall draw the materials for this rapid sketch , but principally from <NAME> ' book , which has this advantage over the smaller volume of M. d'Avezac , that it relates the whole life of <NAME> .
It has been found impossible to determine with certainty either the name or the nationality of <NAME> , and still less to settle the period of his birth .
<NAME> , <NAME> or <NAME> must have been born , if not in Genoa itself , as M. d'Avezac asserts , at least in the neighbourhood of that town , possibly at <NAME> , about the first quarter of the fifteenth century .
Some historians have considered that he was an Englishman , and perhaps <NAME> from national considerations is inclined to adopt this opinion ; at least this seems to be the meaning of the expressions used by him .
What we do know without room for doubt , is that <NAME> came to <NAME> to occupy himself with commerce , and that he soon settled at <NAME> , then the second town in the kingdom , in one of the suburbs which had received the name of <NAME> , probably from the number of Venetians who resided there , and the trade carried on by them with the countries of the extreme <NAME> .
It was at <NAME> that <NAME> 's two youngest children were born , <NAME> and <NAME> , if we may rely upon the following account given by the old chronicler <NAME> .
" <NAME> told me that he was born at <NAME> , and that at four years of age he went with his father to <NAME> , returning with him to <NAME> some years later ; this made people imagine that he was born at <NAME> . "
In 1476 , <NAME> was at <NAME> , and there on the 29th of March , he received letters of naturalization , which prove that he was not a native of this city , and that he must have merited the honour by some service rendered to the <NAME> .
M. d'Avezac is inclined to think that he devoted himself to the study of cosmography and navigation , perhaps even in company with the celebrated Florentine , <NAME> , with whose theories upon the distribution of land and sea on the surface of the globe , he would certainly be acquainted at this time .
He may also have heard mention made of the islands situated in the <NAME> , and known by the names of <NAME> , the <NAME> of the <NAME> , or <NAME> .
What seems more certain is , that his business affairs took him to the <NAME> , and , it is said , to <NAME> , and that while there he would learn from what country came the spices , which then constituted the most important branch of <NAME> commerce .
Whatever value we may attach to these speculative theories , it is at least certain that <NAME> founded an important mercantile house at <NAME> .
His son <NAME> , who in these first voyages had acquired an inclination for the sea , studied navigation , as far as it was then known , and made some excursions on the sea , to render himself as familiar with the practice of this art , as he already was with its theory .
" For seven years past , " says the <NAME> Ambassador in a despatch of the 25th of July , 1498 , speaking of an expedition commanded by <NAME> , " the people of <NAME> have fitted out two , three , or four caravels every year , to go in search of the <NAME> of <NAME> , and of the <NAME> , according to the ideas of the <NAME> . "
At this time the whole of <NAME> resounded with the fame of the discoveries of <NAME> .
" It awoke in me , " says <NAME> , in a narrative preserved by <NAME> , " a great desire and a kind of ardour in my heart to do myself also something famous , and knowing by examining the globe , that if I sailed by the west wind I should reach <NAME> more rapidly , I at once made my project known to His Majesty , who was much satisfied with it . "
The king to whom <NAME> addressed himself was the same <NAME> .
who some years before had refused all support to <NAME> .
It is evident that he received with favour the project which <NAME> and <NAME> had just submitted to him ; and though <NAME> , in the fragment which we have just quoted , attributes to himself alone all the honour of the project , it is not less true that his father was the promoter of the enterprise , as the following charter shows , which we translate in an abridged form .
" We Henry ... permit our well-beloved <NAME> , citizen of <NAME> , and <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , his sons , under our flag and with five vessels of the tonnage and crew which they shall judge suitable , to discover at their own expense and charge ... we grant to them as well as to their heirs and assigns , licence to occupy , possess ... at the charge of , by them , upon the profits , benefits , and advantages , accruing from this navigation , to pay us in merchandise or in money the fifth part of the profit thus obtained , for each of their voyages , every time that they shall return to the port of <NAME> ( at which port they shall be compelled to land ) ... . We promise and guarantee to them , their heirs and assigns , that they shall be exempt from all custom-house duties on the merchandise which they shall bring from the countries thus discovered ... . We command and direct all our subjects , as well on land as on the sea , to render assistance to the said <NAME> , and to his sons ... .
Given at ... the 5th day of March , 1495 . "
<NAME> was the charter that was granted to <NAME> and his sons upon their return from the <NAME> continent , and not as certain authors have pretended , anterior to this voyage .
From the time that the news of the discovery made by <NAME> had reached <NAME> , that is to say , probably in 1493 , <NAME> and <NAME> prepared the expedition at their own expense , and set out at the beginning of the year 1494 , with the idea of reaching <NAME> , and finally the <NAME> .
There can be no doubt upon this point , for in the <NAME> in <NAME> is preserved an unique copy of the map engraved in 1544 , that is to say , in the lifetime of <NAME> , which mentions this voyage , and the precise and exact date of the discovery of <NAME> .
It is probable that we must attribute to the intrigues of the <NAME> Ambassador , the delay which occurred in <NAME> 's expedition , for the whole of the year 1496 passed without the voyage being accomplished .
The following year he set out at the beginning of summer .
After having again sighted the <NAME> Bona-vista_ , he followed the coast , and was not long in perceiving to his great disappointment that it trended towards the north .
" Then , sailing along it to make sure if I could not find some passage , I could not perceive any , and having advanced as far as 56 degrees , and seeing that at this point the land turned towards the east , I despaired of finding any passage , and I put about to examine the coast in this direction towards the equinoctial line , always with the same object of finding a passage to the <NAME> , and in the end , I reached the country now called <NAME> , where as provisions were beginning to run short , I resolved to return to <NAME> . "
This narrative , of which we have given the commencement above , was related by <NAME> to <NAME> , forty or fifty years after the event .
Also , is it not astonishing that <NAME> mixes up in it two perfectly distinct voyages , that of 1494 , and that of 1497 ?
Let us add some reflections on this narrative .
The first land seen was , without doubt , the <NAME> , the northern extremity of the island of <NAME> , and the island which is opposite to it is that of <NAME> , long known by the name of <NAME> <NAME> 's <NAME> .
<NAME> , probably penetrated into the estuary of the <NAME> , which he took for an arm of the sea , near to the place where <NAME> now stands , and coasted along the northern shore of the gulf , so that he did not see the coast of <NAME> stretching away in the east .
He took <NAME> for an archipelago , and continued his course to the south , not doubtless , as far as <NAME> as he states himself , the time occupied by the voyage making it impossible that he can have descended so low , but as far as <NAME> .
These were the countries which the <NAME> afterwards called " <NAME> de <NAME> . "
On the 3rd of February , 1498 , King <NAME> .
signed at <NAME> some new letters patent .
He empowered <NAME> or his representative , -- being duly authorized -- to take in <NAME> ports six vessels of 200 tons ' burden , and to procure all that should be required for their equipment , at the same price as if it were for the crown .
He was allowed to take on board such master-mariners , pages , and other subjects as might of their own accord wish to go , and pass with him to the recently discovered land and islands .
<NAME> <NAME> bore the expense of the equipment of two vessels , and three others were fitted out at the cost of the merchants of <NAME> .
In all probability it was death -- a sudden and unexpected death -- which prevented <NAME> from taking the command of this expedition .
His son <NAME> then assumed the direction of the fleet , which carried 300 men and provisions for a year .
After having sighted land at 45 degrees , <NAME> followed the coast as far as 58 degrees , perhaps even higher , but then it became so cold , and although it was the month of July , there was so much floating ice about , that , it would have been impossible to go further northwards .
The days were very long , and the nights excessively light , an interesting detail by which to fix the latitude reached , for we know that below the 60th parallel of latitude the longest days are eighteen hours .
These various reasons made <NAME> decide to put about , and he touched at the <NAME> , of which the inhabitants , who were clothed in the skins of animals , were armed with bow and arrows , lance , javelin , and wooden sword .
The navigators here caught a great number of <NAME> ; they were even so numerous , says an old narrative , that they hindered ships from advancing .
After having sailed along the coast of <NAME> as far as 38 degrees , <NAME> set out for <NAME> , where he arrived at the beginning of autumn .
This voyage had indeed a threefold object , that of discovery , commerce , and colonization , as is shown by the number of vessels which took part in it and the strength of the crews .
Nevertheless it does not appear that <NAME> landed any one , or that he made any attempts at forming a settlement , either in <NAME> , or in <NAME> 's Bay -- which he was destined to explore more completely in 1517 , in the reign of <NAME> VIII. -- or even to the south of the <NAME> , known by the general name of <NAME> .
At the close of this expedition , which was almost entirely unproductive , we lose sight of <NAME> , if not completely , at least so as to be insufficiently informed about his deeds and voyages until 1517 .
The traveller <NAME> , whose various enterprises we have related above , had left <NAME> in the month of May , 1499 .
We know that in this voyage he met with an Englishman at <NAME> , on the coast of <NAME> .
Can this have been <NAME> ?
<NAME> has come to light to enable us to settle this point ; but we may believe that <NAME> did not remain idle , and that he would be likely to undertake some fresh expedition : what we do know is , that in spite of the solemn engagements that he had made with <NAME> , the King of <NAME> granted certain privileges of trading in the countries which he had discovered , to the <NAME> and to the merchants of <NAME> .
This ungenerous manner of recognizing his services wounded the navigator , and decided him to accept the offers which had been made to him on different occasions , to enter the <NAME> service .
From the death of <NAME> , which happened in 1512 , <NAME> was the navigator held in most renown .
To attach him to himself , <NAME> wrote on the 13th of September , 1512 , to <NAME> , commander in chief of the troops which had been transported to <NAME> , to treat with the <NAME> navigator .
[ Illustration : Discoveries of <NAME> and <NAME> . ]
As soon as he arrived in <NAME> , <NAME> received the rank of captain , by an edict dated the 20th of October , 1512 , with a salary of 5000 maravédis .
<NAME> was fixed upon for his residence , until an opportunity might arise of turning his talents and experience to account .
There was a plan on foot for his taking the command of a very important expedition , when <NAME> the <NAME> died , on the 23rd of January , 1516 .
<NAME> returned at once to <NAME> , having probably obtained leave of absence .
<NAME> tells us that the following year <NAME> was appointed with <NAME> to the command of a fleet which was to reach <NAME> by the north-west .
On the 11th of June , he was in <NAME> 's Bay at 67-1/2 degrees of latitude ; the sea free from ice spread itself out before him so far that he reckoned upon success in his enterprise , when the faintheartedness of his companion , together with the cowardice and mutinous spirit of the crews , who refused to go any further , obliged him to return to <NAME> .
In his _Theatrum orbis terrarum_ , <NAME> traces the shape of <NAME> 's Bay as it really is ; he even indicates at its northern extremity a strait leading northwards .
How can the geographer have attained to such exactness ?
" Who , " says <NAME> , " can have given him the information set forth in his map , if not <NAME> ? "
On his return to <NAME> , <NAME> found the country ravaged by a horrible plague , which put a stop even to commercial transactions .
Soon , either because the time of his leave had expired , or that he wished to escape from the pestilence , or that he was recalled to <NAME> , the <NAME> navigator returned to that country .
In 1518 , on the 5th of February , <NAME> was made pilot-major , with a salary which , added to that which he already had , made a total of 125,000 maravédis , say , 300 ducats .
He did not actually exercise the functions of his office till <NAME> returned from <NAME> .
His principal duty consisted in examining pilots , who were not allowed to go to the <NAME> until after having passed this examination .
This epoch was by no means favourable to great maritime expeditions .
The struggle between <NAME> and <NAME> absorbed all the resources both in men and money , of these two countries -- <NAME> too , who seems to have adopted science for his fatherland , much more than any particular country , made some overtures to <NAME> , the <NAME> of <NAME> , to take service on board the fleets of the <NAME> ; but when the favourable answer of the <NAME> of <NAME> arrived , he had other projects in his head , and did not carry his attempt any further .
[ Illustration : <NAME> presides over a Conference of <NAME> . ]
In the month of April , 1524 , <NAME> presided at a conference of mariners and cosmographers , which met at <NAME> , to discuss the question whether the <NAME> belonged , according to the celebrated treaty of <NAME> , to <NAME> or <NAME> .
On the 31st of May , it was decided that the <NAME> were within the <NAME> waters , by 20 degrees .
Perhaps this resolution of the junta of which <NAME> was president , and which again placed in the hands of <NAME> a great part of the spice trade , was not without its influence upon the resolutions of the council of the <NAME> .
However this may be , in the month of September of the same year <NAME> was authorized to take the command of three vessels of 100 tons , and a small caravel , carrying together 150 men , with the title of captain-general .
The declared aim of this voyage was to pass through the <NAME> of <NAME> , carefully to explore the western coast of <NAME> , and to reach the <NAME> , where they would take in on their return a cargo of spices .
The month of <NAME> , 1525 , had been fixed upon as the date of departure , but the intrigues of <NAME> succeeded in delaying it until April , 1526 .
Different circumstances seem from this moment to have augured ill for the voyage .
<NAME> had only a nominal authority , and the association of merchants who had defrayed the expenses of the equipment not accepting him willingly as chief , had found means to oppose all the plans of the <NAME> sailor .
Thus it was that in place of the man whom he had appointed as second in command , another was imposed upon him , and that instructions destined to be unsealed when at sea were delivered to each captain .
They contained this absurd arrangement , that in case of the death of the captain-general , eleven individuals were to succeed him each in his turn .
Was not this an encouragement given to assassination ?
Scarcely was the fleet out of sight of land , when discontent appeared .
The rumour spread that the captain-general was not equal to his task ; then as they saw that these calumnies did not affect him , they pretended that the flotilla was already short of provisions .
The mutiny broke out as soon as land was reached , but <NAME> was not the man to allow himself to be annihilated by it ; he had suffered too much from <NAME> 's cowardice to bear such an insult .
In order to nip the evil in the bud , he had the mutinous captains seized , and notwithstanding their reputation and the brilliancy of their past services , he made them get into a boat , and abandoned them on the shore .
Four months afterwards they had the good luck to be picked up by a <NAME> expedition , which seems to have had orders to thwart the plans of <NAME> .
The <NAME> navigator then penetrated into the <NAME> de la <NAME> , the exploration of which had been commenced by his predecessor the Pilot-major de Solis .
The expedition was not then composed of more than two vessels , one having been lost during the voyage .
<NAME> sailed up the <NAME> , and discovered an island which he called <NAME> , and upon which he built the fort of <NAME> , entrusting the command of it to <NAME> .
<NAME> had the keel removed from one of his caravels , and with it , being towed by his small boats , entered the <NAME> , built a new fort at the confluence of the <NAME> and <NAME> , and after having thus secured his line of retreat he pursued the course of these rivers farther into the interior .
Arriving at the confluence of the <NAME> and <NAME> , he followed the second , the direction of which agreed best with his project of reaching the region of the west where silver was to be obtained .
But it was not long before the aspect of the country changed , and the attitude of the inhabitants altered also .
Until now , they had collected in crowds , astonished at the sight of the vessels ; but upon the cultivated shores of the Paraguay they courageously opposed the strangers ' landing , and three Spaniards having tried to knock down the fruit from a palm-tree , a struggle took place , in which 300 natives lost their lives .
This victory had disabled twenty-five Spaniards .
It was too much for <NAME> , who rapidly removed his wounded to the fort <NAME> and retired , still presenting a bold front to the enemy .
<NAME> had already sent two of his companions to the <NAME> , to acquaint him with the attempt at revolt of the captains , to explain to him the motives which obliged him to modify the course marked out for his voyage , and to request aid from him , both in men and provisions .
The answer arrived at last .
The <NAME> approved of what <NAME> had done , and ordered him to colonize the country in which he had just made a settlement , but did not send him either one man or a single maravédi .
<NAME> tried to procure the resources which he needed in the country , and caused some attempts at cultivation to be commenced .
At the same time , to keep his troops in exercise , he reduced the neighbouring nations to obedience , had some forts built , and again sailing up the Paraguay he reached <NAME> , and the water-courses of the Andes which feed the basin of the <NAME> .
At last he prepared to enter <NAME> , from whence came the gold and silver which he had seen in the possession of the natives ; but it needed more troops than he could muster , to attempt the conquest of this vast region .
The <NAME> , however , was quite unable to send him any .
His <NAME> wars absorbed all his resources , the <NAME> refused to vote new subsidies and the <NAME> had just been pledged to <NAME> .
In this state of affairs , after having occupied the country for five years , and waited all this time for the assistance which never came , <NAME> decided to evacuate a part of his settlements , and he returned with some of his people to <NAME> .
The rest , amounting to 120 , men who were left to guard the fort of <NAME> , after many vicissitudes which can not be related here , perished by the hands of the <NAME> , or were obliged to take refuge in the <NAME> settlements on the coast of <NAME> .
It is to the horses imported by <NAME> that is due the wonderful race of wild horses which may be seen in large troops on the pampas of <NAME> at the present day ; this was the only result of the expedition .
Some time after his return to <NAME> , <NAME> resigned his office , and went to <NAME> , where he settled about 1548 , that is to say at the beginning of the reign of <NAME> .
What were the motives of this fresh change ?
<NAME> <NAME> discontented at having been left to his own resources during his expedition ?
Was he hurt at the manner in which his services were recompensed ?
It is impossible to say .
But <NAME> took advantage of <NAME> 's departure to deprive him of his pension , which <NAME> .
hastened to replace , causing him to receive 250 marks annually , about 116_l._ and a fraction , which was a considerable sum for that period .
The post which <NAME> occupied in <NAME> seems to be best expressed by the name of <NAME> of the <NAME> ; under the authority of the king and council , he appears to have superintended all maritime affairs .
He issues licences , he examines pilots , he frames instructions , he draws maps , a varied and complicated function for which he possessed the rare gift of both practical and theoretical knowledge .
At the same time he instructed the young king in cosmography , explained to him the variation of the compass , and was successful in interesting him in nautical matters , and in the glory resulting from maritime discoveries .
It was a high and almost unique situation .
<NAME> used it to put into execution a project which he had long cherished .
At this period , we may almost say there was no trade in <NAME> .
All commerce was in the hands of the <NAME> towns , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , & c. These companies of merchants had , on various occasions , obtained considerable reductions in import duties , and had ended by monopolizing the <NAME> trade .
<NAME> held that <NAME> possessed as good qualifications as these merchants for becoming manufacturers , and that the already powerful navy which <NAME> possessed might assist marvellously in the export of the products of the soil and of the manufactures .
What was the use of having recourse to strangers when people could do their own business ?
If they had been unable up to this time to reach <NAME> and <NAME> by the north-west , might they not endeavour to reach it by the north-east .
And if they did not succeed , would they not find in this direction more commercial , and more civilized people than the miserable Esquimaux on the coast of <NAME> and <NAME> ?
<NAME> assembled some leading <NAME> merchants , laid his projects before them , and formed them into an association , of which on the 14th of December , 1551 , he was named president for life .
At the same time he exerted himself most vigorously with the king , and having made him understand the wrong which the monopoly enjoyed by strangers did to his own subjects , he obtained its abolition on the 23rd of February , 1551 , and inaugurated the practice of free trade .
The <NAME> of <NAME> , under the name of " <NAME> , " hastened to have some vessels built , adapted to the difficulties to be encountered in the navigation of the <NAME> regions .
The first improvement which the <NAME> marine owed to <NAME> was the sheathing of the keels , which he had seen done in <NAME> , but which had not hitherto been practised in <NAME> .
A flotilla of three vessels was assembled at <NAME> .
They were the _Buona-Speranza_ , of which the command was given to <NAME> , a brave gentleman who had earned a high reputation in war ; the _Buona-Confidencia_ , <NAME> ; and the <NAME> , <NAME> , a clever sailor , and a particular friend of <NAME> 's ; he received the title of pilot-major .
The sailing-master of the <NAME> was <NAME> , an accomplished mariner , who was destined to make numerous voyages in the <NAME> seas , and later to become pilot in chief for <NAME> .
Although age and his important duties prevented <NAME> from placing himself at the head of the expedition , he wished at least , to preside over all the details of the equipment .
He himself wrote out the instructions , which have been preserved , and which prove the prudence and skill of this distinguished navigator .
He there recommends the use of the log-line , an instrument intended to measure the speed of the vessel , and he desires that the journal of the events happening at sea may be kept with regularity , and that all information as to the character , manners , habits , and resources of the people visited , and the productions of the country , may be recorded in writing .
The sailors were to offer no violence to the natives , but to act towards them with courtesy .
All blasphemy and swearing was to be punished with severity , and also drunkenness .
The religious exercises are prescribed , prayers are to be said morning and evening , and the <NAME> are to be read once in the day .
<NAME> ends by recommending union and concord above all , and reminds the captains of the greatness of their enterprise , and the honour which they might hope to gain ; finally he promises them to add his prayers to theirs for the success of their common work .
The squadron set sail on the 20th of May , 1558 , in presence of the court assembled at <NAME> , amid an immense concourse of people , after fêtes and rejoicings , at which the king , who was ill , could not be present .
Near the <NAME> , on the coast of <NAME> at the bearing of <NAME> , the squadron was separated from the _Bonaventure_ .
Carried away by the storm , <NAME> 's two vessels touched , without doubt , at <NAME> , and were forced by the ice to return southwards .
On the 18th of September , they entered the port formed by the mouth of the <NAME> in <NAME> .
Some time afterwards , the _Buona-Confidencia_ , separated from <NAME> by a fresh tempest , returned to <NAME> .
As to the latter , some <NAME> fishermen found his vessel the following year , in the midst of the ice .
The whole crew had died of cold .
This , at least , is what we are led to suppose from the journal kept by the unfortunate <NAME> up to the month of January , 1554 .
Chancellor , after having waited in vain for his two consorts at the rendezvous which had been agreed upon in case of separation , thought they must have outsailed him , and rounding the <NAME> , he entered a vast gulf which was none other than the <NAME> ; he then landed at the mouth of the <NAME> , near the monastery of <NAME> , on the spot upon which the town of <NAME> was soon to stand .
The inhabitants of these desolate places told him that the country was under the dominion of the <NAME> of <NAME> .
<NAME> resolved at once to go to <NAME> , in spite of the enormous distance which separated him from it .
The Czar then on the throne was <NAME> .
For some time before this , the <NAME> had shaken off the <NAME> yoke , and <NAME> had united all the petty rival principalities in one body politic , of which the power was already becoming considerable .
The situation of <NAME> , exclusively continental , far from any frequented sea , isolated from the rest of <NAME> , of which it did not yet form part , so much were its habits and manners still <NAME> , promised success to Chancellor .
[ Illustration : Chancellor received by the Czar . ]
The <NAME> , who up to this time , had not been able to procure <NAME> merchandise , except by way of <NAME> , and who wished to gain access to the <NAME> seas , saw with pleasure the attempts of the <NAME> to establish a trade which would be beneficial to both parties .
He not only received <NAME> courteously , but he made him most advantageous offers , granted him great privileges and encouraged him , by the kindness of his reception , to repeat his voyage .
<NAME> sold his merchandise to great advantage , and after taking on board another cargo of furs , of seal and whale oils , copper , and other products , returned to <NAME> , carrying a letter from the Czar .
The advantages which the <NAME> had derived from this first voyage , encouraged them to attempt a second .
So Chancellor the following year , made a fresh voyage to <NAME> , and took two of the <NAME> 's agents to <NAME> , who concluded an advantageous treaty with the Czar .
Then he set out again for <NAME> with an ambassador and his suite , sent by <NAME> to <NAME> .
Of the four vessels which composed the flotilla , one was lost on the coast of <NAME> , another as it left <NAME> , and the <NAME> , on board of which were <NAME> and the ambassador , foundered in the <NAME> of <NAME> , on the east coast of <NAME> on the 10th of November , 1556 .
<NAME> was drowned in the wreck , being less fortunate than the <NAME> ambassador , who had the good luck to escape ; but the presents and merchandise which he was carrying to <NAME> were lost .
[ Illustration : Wreck of the _Bonaventure_ . ]
<NAME> was the commencement of the Anglo-Russian Company .
A goodly number of expeditions succeeded each other in those parts , but it would be beside our purpose to give an account of them .
Let us now return to <NAME> .
It was in 1554 that <NAME> of <NAME> was married to <NAME> , King of <NAME> .
When the latter came to <NAME> he showed himself very ill-disposed towards <NAME> , who had abandoned the service of <NAME> , and who , at this very moment was procuring for <NAME> a commerce which would soon immensely increase the maritime power of an already formidable country .
Thus we are not surprised to learn that eight days after the landing of the King of <NAME> , <NAME> was forced to resign his office and his pension , both of which had been bestowed upon him for life by <NAME> .
<NAME> was nominated in his place .
<NAME> <NAME> thinks that this dishonourable man , who had had some quarrels with the law , had a secret mission to seize among <NAME> 's plans , maps , instructions , and projects , those which could be of use to <NAME> .
The fact is that all these documents are now lost , at least unless they may yet be discovered among the archives of <NAME> .
At the end of this period , history completely loses sight of the old mariner .
The same mystery which hangs over his birth , also envelopes the place and date of his death .
His immense discoveries , his cosmographical works , his study of the variations of the magnetic needle , his wisdom , his humane disposition , and his honourable conduct , place <NAME> in the foremost rank among discoverers .
A figure lost in the shadow and vagueness of legends until our own day , <NAME> owes it to his biographers , to <NAME> , D'Avezac , and <NAME> , that he is now better known , more highly appreciated , and for the first time really placed in the light .
<NAME> -- <NAME> and his three voyages to <NAME> -- The town of <NAME> -- Tobacco -- The scurvy -- Voyage of <NAME> -- <NAME> and his voyages -- <NAME> -- <NAME> and <NAME> -- Spitzbergen -- Winter season at <NAME> Zembla -- <NAME> to <NAME> -- Relics of the <NAME> .
From 1492 to 1524 , <NAME> had stood aloof , officially at least , from enterprises of discovery and colonization .
But <NAME> could not look on quietly while the power of his rival <NAME> received a large addition by the conquest of <NAME> .
He therefore ordered <NAME> , a Venetian who was in his service , to make a voyage of exploration .
We will pause here for a short time , although the various places may have already been visited on several occasions , because for the first time the banner of <NAME> floats over the shores of the <NAME> .
This exploration besides , was to prepare the way for those of <NAME> and of <NAME> in <NAME> , as well as for the unlucky experiments in colonization of <NAME> , and of <NAME> , the sanguinary voyage of reprisals of <NAME> , and <NAME> 's attempt at a settlement in <NAME> .
We possess no biographical details with regard to <NAME> .
Under what circumstances did he enter the service of <NAME> ?
What was his title to the command of such an expedition ?
<NAME> is known of the <NAME> traveller , for all we possess of his writings is the <NAME> translation of his report to <NAME> I. published in the collection of <NAME> .
The <NAME> translation of this <NAME> translation exists in an abridged form in <NAME> 's work on <NAME> and in the <NAME> des <NAME> .
For our very rapid epitome we shall make use of the <NAME> text of <NAME> , except in some passages where <NAME> 's translation has appeared to give an idea of the rich , original , and marvellously modulated language of the sixteenth century .
[ Illustration : Map of <NAME> and of the <NAME> of the St .
Having set out with four vessels to make discoveries in the ocean , says <NAME> in a letter written from <NAME> to <NAME> on the 8th July , 1524 , he was forced by a storm to take refuge in <NAME> with two of his vessels , the <NAME> and the <NAME> , there to repair damages .
Thence he set sail for the coast of <NAME> , where he seems to have given chase to some <NAME> vessels .
We see him leave with the <NAME> alone on the 17th of January , 1524 , a small inhabited island in the neighbourhood of <NAME> , and launch himself upon the ocean with a crew of fifty men , well furnished with provisions and ammunition for an eight months ' voyage .
Twenty-five days later he has made 1500 miles to the west , when he is assailed by a fearful storm ; and twenty-five days afterwards , that is to say on the 8th or 9th of March , having made about 1200 miles , he discovers land at 30 degrees north latitude , which he thought had never been previously explored .
" When we arrived , it seemed to us to be very low , but on approaching within a quarter of a league we saw by the great fires which were lighted along the harbours and borders of the sea , that it was inhabited , and in taking trouble to find a harbour in which to land and make acquaintance with the country , we sailed more than 150 miles in vain , so that seeing the coast trended ever southwards , we decided to turn back again . "
The Frenchmen finding a favourable landing-place , perceived a number of natives who came towards them , but who fled away when they saw them land .
Soon recalled by the friendly signs and demonstrations of the <NAME> , they showed great surprise at their clothes , their faces , and the whiteness of their skin .
The natives were entirely naked , except that the middle of the body was covered with sable-skins , hung from a narrow girdle of prettily woven grasses , and ornamented with tails of other animals , which fell to their knees .
Some wore crowns of birds ' feathers .
" They have brown skins , " says the narrative , " and are exactly like the <NAME> ; their hair is black , not very long , and tied at the back of the head in the form of a small tail .
Their limbs are well proportioned , they are of middle height , although a little taller than ourselves , and have no other defect beyond their faces being rather broad ; they are not strong , but they are agile , and some of the greatest and quickest runners in the world . "
It was impossible for <NAME> to collect any details about the manners and mode of life of these people , on account of the short time that he remained among them .
The shore at this place was composed of fine sand interspersed here and there with little sandy hillocks , behind which were scattered " groves and very thick forests which were wonderfully pleasant to look upon . "
There were in this country , as far as we could judge , abundance of stags , fallow deer and hares , numerous lakes , and streams of sparkling water , as well as a quantity of birds .
This land lies at 34 degrees .
It is therefore the part of the <NAME> which now goes by the name of <NAME> .
The air there is pure and salubrious , the climate temperate , the sea is entirely without rocks , and in spite of the want of harbours it is not unfavourable for navigators .
During the whole month of March the <NAME> sailed along the coast , which seemed to them to be inhabited by a numerous population .
The want of water forced them to land several times , and they perceived that the savages were most pleased with mirrors , bells , knives , and sheets of paper .
One day they sent a long-boat ashore with twenty-five men in it .
A young sailor jumped into the water " because he could not land on account of the waves and currents , in order to give some small articles to these people , and having thrown them to them from a distance because he was distrustful of the natives , he was cast violently on shore by the waves .
The Indians seeing him in this condition , take him and carry him far away from the sea , to the great dismay of the poor sailor , who expected they were about to sacrifice him .
Having placed him at the foot of a little hill , in the full blaze of the sun , they stripped him quite naked and wondered at the whiteness of his skin ; then lighting a large fire they made him come to it and recover his strength , and it was then that the poor young man as well as those who were in the boat , thought that the Indians were about to massacre and immolate him , roasting his flesh in this large brazier and then eating their victim , as do the cannibals .
But it happened quite differently ; for having shown a desire to return to the boat they reconducted him to the edge of the sea , and having kissed him very lovingly , they retired to a hill to see him re-enter the boat . "
Continuing to follow the shore northwards for more than 150 miles , the <NAME> reached a land which seemed to them more beautiful , being covered with thick woods .
Into these forests , twenty men penetrated for more than six miles and only returned to the shore from the fear of losing themselves .
In this walk , having met two women , one young and the other old , with some children , they seized one of the latter who might be about eight years old , with the idea of taking him away to <NAME> ; but they could not do the same with the young woman , who began to cry with all her might , calling for aid from her compatriots , who were hidden in the wood .
In this place the savages were whiter than any of those hitherto met with ; they snared birds and used a bow of very hard wood , and arrows tipped with fish-bones .
Their canoes , twenty feet long and four feet wide , were hollowed by fire out of a trunk of a tree .
<NAME> vines abounded and climbed over the trees in long festoons as they do in <NAME> .
With a little cultivation they would no doubt produce excellent wine -- " for the fruit is sweet and pleasant like ours , and we thought that the natives were not insensible to it , for in all directions where these vines grew , they had taken care to cut away the branches of the surrounding trees so that the fruit might ripen . "
<NAME> roses , lilies , violets , and all kinds of odoriferous plants and flowers , new to the <NAME> , carpeted the ground everywhere , and filled the air with sweet perfumes .
After remaining for three days in this enchanting place , the <NAME> continued to follow the coast northwards , sailing by day and casting anchor at night .
As the land trended towards the east , they went 150 miles further in that direction , and discovered an island of triangular shape about thirty miles distant from the continent , similar in size to the <NAME> of <NAME> , and upon which they bestowed the name of the mother of <NAME> , <NAME> of <NAME> .
Then they reached another island forty-five miles off , which possessed a magnificent harbour and of which the inhabitants came in crowds to visit the strange vessels .
Two kings , especially , were of fine stature and great beauty .
They were dressed in deer-skins , with the head bare , the hair carried back and tied in a tuft , and they wore on the neck a large chain ornamented with coloured stones .
This was the most remarkable nation which they had until now met with .
" The women are graceful , " says the narrative published by <NAME> .
" Some wore the skins of the lynx on their arms ; their head was ornamented with their plaited hair and long plaits hung down on both sides of the chest ; others had headdresses which recalled those of the <NAME> and <NAME> women ; only the elderly women , and those who were married , wore pendants in their ears of worked copper . "
This land is situated on the same parallel as <NAME> , in 41 degrees 40 minutes , but its climate is much colder .
On the 5th of May , <NAME> left this port and sailed along the sea-shore for 450 miles .
At last he reached a country of which the inhabitants resembled but little any of those whom he had hitherto met with .
They were so wild that it was impossible to carry on any trade with them , or any sustained intercourse .
What they appeared to esteem above everything else were fish-hooks , knives , and all articles in metal , attaching no value to all the trifling baubles which up to this time had served for barter .
Twenty-five armed men landed and advanced from four to six miles into the interior of the country .
They were received by the natives with flights of arrows , after which the latter retired into the immense forests which appeared to cover the whole country .
One hundred and fifty miles further on spreads out a vast archipelago composed of thirty-two islands , all near the land , separated by narrow canals , which reminded the <NAME> navigator of the archipelagos which in the <NAME> border the coasts of <NAME> and <NAME> .
At length , 450 miles further on , in latitude 50 degrees , the <NAME> came to lands which had been previously discovered by the <NAME> .
Finding themselves then short of provisions , and having reconnoitred the coast of <NAME> for a distance of 2100 miles , they returned to <NAME> , and disembarked safely at <NAME> in the month of July , 1524 .
Some historians relate that <NAME> was made prisoner by the savages who inhabit the coast of <NAME> , and was eaten by them .
A fact which is simply impossible , since he addressed from <NAME> to <NAME> I. the account of his voyage which we have just abridged .
Besides , the Indians of these regions were not anthropophagi .
<NAME> authors , but we have not been able to discover on the authority of what documents , nor under what circumstances this happened , relate that <NAME> having fallen into the power of the <NAME> , had been taken to <NAME> and there hanged .
It is wiser to admit that we know nothing certain about <NAME> , and that we are totally ignorant what rewards his long voyage procured for him .
Perhaps when some learned man shall have looked through our archives ( of which the abstract and inventory are far from being finished ) , he may recover some new documents ; but for the present we must confine ourselves to the narrative of <NAME> .
Ten years later a captain of <NAME> , named <NAME> , born on the 21st of December , 1484 , conceived the project of establishing a colony in the northern part of <NAME> .
Being favourably received by <NAME> de <NAME> , and by <NAME> , who asked to see the clause in <NAME> 's will which disinherited him of the <NAME> in favour of the kings of <NAME> and <NAME> , <NAME> left <NAME> with two vessels on the 20th of April , 1534 .
The vessel which carried him weighed only sixty tons and carried a crew of sixty-one men .
At the end of only twenty days , so favourable was the voyage , <NAME> discovered <NAME> at <NAME> .
He then went northwards as far as <NAME> , which he found surrounded by ice , all broken up and melting , but on which he was able , nevertheless , to lay in a stock of five or six tons of guillemots , puffins , and penguins , without reckoning those which were eaten fresh .
He then explored all the coast of the island , which at this time bore a number of <NAME> names , thus proving the assiduous manner in which the <NAME> frequented these shores .
Then penetrating into the <NAME> of Belle-Isle , which separates the continent from the <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> arrived at the Gulf of <NAME> .
Along the whole of this coast the harbours are excellent : " If the land only corresponded to the goodness of the harbours , " says the <NAME> sailor , " it would be a great blessing ; but one ought not to call it _land_ ; it is rather pebbles and savage rocks and places fit for wild beasts : as for all the land towards the north , I never saw as much earth there as would fill a tumbrel . "
After having coasted along the continent , <NAME> was cast by a tempest upon the west coast of <NAME> , where he explored <NAME> and <NAME> , the <NAME> , <NAME> , the <NAME> , and the <NAME> of <NAME> on the continent .
In this place he had some intercourse with the savages , who showed " a great and marvellous eagerness in the acquisition of iron tools and other things , always dancing and performing various ceremonies , among others throwing sea-water on their heads with their hands ; so well did they receive us that they gave us all that they had , keeping back nothing . "
The next day the number of the savages was even greater , and our <NAME> sailors made an ample harvest of furs and skins of animals .
After having explored the <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> arrived at the entrance of the estuary of the <NAME> , where he saw some natives , who possessed neither the appearance nor the language of the first .
" The latter may truly be called savages , for no poorer people can be found in the world , and I think that all put together , excepting their boats and their nets , they could not have had the value of two pence half-penny .
They have the head entirely shaved , with the exception of a lock of hair on the very top , which they allow to grow as long as a horse 's tail , and which they fasten upon the head with some small copper needles .
Their only dwelling is underneath their boats , which they overturn and then stretch themselves on the ground beneath them without any covering . "
After having planted a large cross in this place , <NAME> obtained the chief 's permission to take away with him two of his children , whom he was to bring back again on his next voyage .
Then he set out again for <NAME> , and landed at <NAME> on the 5th of The following year , on the 19th of May , <NAME> left <NAME> at the head of a fleet composed of three vessels called the <NAME> and the <NAME> and the _Emerillon_ on board of which some gentlemen of high rank had taken passages , among whom may be named <NAME> de la <NAME> , and <NAME> de Pont-Briant , son of the <NAME> de <NAME> and cup-bearer to the <NAME> .
Very soon the squadron was dispersed by the storm , and could not be brought together again until it reached <NAME> .
After having landed at <NAME> , in <NAME> harbour , which is in <NAME> , <NAME> penetrated into the <NAME> of <NAME> .
He discovered there the <NAME> of <NAME> which we call <NAME> , and entered a great river called <NAME> , which leads to <NAME> .
On the banks of this river lies the country called <NAME> , whence comes the red copper , to which the two savages whom he had taken on his first voyage gave the name of _caquetdazé_ .
But before entering the <NAME> , <NAME> wished to explore the whole gulf , to see if no passage existed to the north .
He afterwards returned to the <NAME> of the <NAME> , went up the river , and soon reached the river <NAME> , which falls into the <NAME> on its northern bank .
A little further on , after passing by fourteen islands , he entered the <NAME> territories , which no traveller before him had ever visited .
" The next day the lord of <NAME> , called <NAME> , with twelve boats and accompanied by sixteen men , approached the ships .
When abreast of the smallest of our vessels he began to make a palaver or preachment in their fashion , while moving his body and limbs in a marvellous manner , which is a sign of joy and confidence , and when he arrived at the flag-ship where were the two Indians who had been brought back from <NAME> , the said chief spoke to them and they to him .
And they began to relate to him what they had seen in <NAME> and the good treatment which they had received , at which the said chief was very joyful , and begged the captain to give him his arms that he might kiss and embrace them , which is their mode of welcome in this country .
The country of <NAME> , or <NAME> , is fertile and full of very fine trees of the same nature and kind as in <NAME> , such as oaks , elms , plum-trees , yews , cedars , vines , hawthorns -- which bear fruit as large as damsons -- and other trees ; beneath them grows hemp as good as that of <NAME> . "
<NAME> succeeded afterwards in reaching with his boats and his galleon a place which is the <NAME> of the present day , next , a great lake formed by the river -- St. <NAME> 's Lake -- and at last he arrived at <NAME> or <NAME> , which is 630 miles from the mouth of the <NAME> .
In this place are " ploughed lands and large and beautiful plains full of the corn of the country , which is like the millet of <NAME> , as large or larger than peas , on which they live as we do on wheat .
And among these plains is placed and seated the said town of <NAME> near to and joining on to some high ground which is around the town ; and which is well cultivated and quite small ; from the top of it one can see very far .
We named this mountain the <NAME> . "
The welcome given to <NAME> could not have been more cordial .
The chief or <NAME> , who was crippled in all his limbs , begged the captain to touch them , as if he had asked him for a cure .
Then the blind , and those who were blind in one eye , the lame , and the impotent came and sat down near <NAME> , that he might touch them , so thoroughly were they persuaded that he was a god descended to heal them .
" The said captain , seeing the faith and piety of this people , recited the <NAME> of <NAME> , namely : _In principio_ , making the sign of the cross over the poor sick people , praying GOD that he would give them the knowledge of our holy faith and grace to accept <NAME> and baptism .
Then the said captain took a book of <NAME> and read aloud the Passion of our Saviour , so well that all those present could hear it , all the poor people being quite silent , looking up to heaven and using the same ceremonies as they saw us use . "
After making themselves acquainted with the country , which could be seen for ninety miles around from the top of <NAME> , and having collected some information about the water-falls and rapids of the <NAME> , <NAME> returned towards <NAME> , where he did not delay to rejoin his ships .
We owe to him the first information on tobacco for smoking , which does not seem to have been in use throughout the whole extent of the <NAME> .
" They have a herb , " he says , " of which they collect great quantities during the summer for the winter ; they esteem it highly , and the men alone use it in the following manner : they dry it in the sun and carry it on their necks in a small skin of an animal in the shape of a bag , with a horn of stone or of wood , then constantly they make the said herb into powder , and put it into one of the ends of the said horn ; they then place a live coal upon it and blow through the other end , and so fill their body with smoke that it issues from the mouth and nostrils , as if from the shaft of a chimney .
We have tried the said smoke , but after having put it into our mouths , it seemed as if there were ground pepper in them , so hot is it . "
In the month of December the inhabitants of <NAME> were attacked by an infectious disease which proved to be the scurvy .
" This malady spread so rapidly in our vessels that by the middle of February out of our 110 men there were but ten in good health . "
Neither prayers , nor orisons , nor vows to our Lady of <NAME> brought any relief .
Twenty-five Frenchmen perished up to the 18th of April , and there were not four amongst them who were not attacked by the malady .
But at this time a savage chief informed <NAME> that a decoction of the leaves and sap of a certain tree , probably either the <NAME> fir-tree or the barberry , was very salutary .
As soon as two or three had experienced its beneficial effects " there was a crowding as if they would have killed each other to be the first to get the medicine ; and one of the tallest and largest trees I ever saw was used in less than eight days , which had such an effect that if all the doctors of <NAME> and <NAME> had been there with all the drugs of <NAME> , they had not done as much in a year as the said tree accomplished in eight days . "
Some time after , <NAME> , having noticed that <NAME> was trying to excite sedition against the <NAME> , caused him to be seized , as well as nine other savages , that he might take them to <NAME> , where they died .
He set sail from the harbour of <NAME> on the 6th of May , descended the <NAME> , and after a voyage which was not marked by any incident , he landed at <NAME> on the 16th of July , <NAME> , in consequence of the report of this voyage which the <NAME> captain made to him , resolved to take effective possession of the country .
After having appointed <NAME> de la <NAME> , <NAME> de <NAME> , viceroy of <NAME> , he caused five vessels to be fitted out , which being laden with provisions and ammunition for two years , were to transport <NAME> and a certain number of soldiers , artizans , and gentlemen to the new colony , which they were about to establish .
The five vessels set sail on the 23rd of May , 1541 .
They met with such contrary winds that it took them three months to reach <NAME> .
<NAME> did not arrive at the harbour of <NAME> Croix till the 23rd of August .
As soon as he had landed his provisions , he sent back two of his vessels to <NAME> with letters for the king , telling him what had been done , also that the <NAME> de <NAME> had not yet appeared , and that they did not know what had happened to him .
Then he had works commenced to clear the land , to build a fort , and to lay the first foundations of the town of <NAME> .
He next set out for <NAME> , taking with him <NAME> de <NAME> and other gentlemen , and went to examine the three waterfalls of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> ; on his return to <NAME> , he found <NAME> had just arrived .
<NAME> returned to <NAME> in the month of October , 1542 , where , probably ten years later , he died .
As to the new colony , <NAME> having perished in a second voyage , it vegetated , and was nothing more than a factory until 1608 , the date of the foundation of <NAME> by M. de Champlain , of whom we shall relate the services and discoveries a little further on .
We have just seen how <NAME> , who had set out first to seek for the north-west passage , had been led to take possession of the country and to lay the foundations of the colony of <NAME> .
In <NAME> a similar movement had begun , set on foot by the writings of <NAME> and of <NAME> .
They ended by carrying public opinion with them , and demonstrating that it was not more difficult to find this passage than it had been to discover the <NAME> of <NAME> .
One of the most ardent partizans of this search was a bold sailor , called <NAME> , who after having many times applied to rich ship-owners , at last found in <NAME> , <NAME> of <NAME> , the favourite of <NAME> , a patron , whose pecuniary help enabled him to equip a pinnace and two poor barks of from twenty to twenty-five tons ' burden .
It was with means thus feeble , that the intrepid navigator went to encounter the ice in localities which had never been visited since the time of the <NAME> .
Setting out from <NAME> on the 8th of June , 1576 , he sighted the south of <NAME> , which he took for the <NAME> of <NAME> .
Soon stopped by the ice , he was obliged to return to <NAME> without being able to land there , and he entered <NAME> 's Straits .
After having coasted along <NAME> and <NAME> , he entered a strait which has received his name , but which is also called by some geographers , <NAME> 's inlet .
He landed at <NAME> , took possession of the country in the name of <NAME> , and entered into some relations with the natives .
The cold increased rapidly , and he was obliged to return to <NAME> .
Frobisher only brought back some rather vague scientific and geographical details about the countries which he had visited ; he received , however , a most flattering welcome when he showed a heavy black stone in which a little gold was found .
At once all imaginations were on fire .
Several lords and the Queen herself contributed to the expense of a new armament , consisting of a vessel of 200 tons , with a crew of 100 men , and two smaller barks , which carried six months ' provision both for war and for nourishment .
<NAME> had some experienced sailors -- <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and C. Hall , under his command .
On the 31st of May , 1577 , the expedition set sail , and soon sighted <NAME> , of which the mountains were covered with snow , and the shores defended by a rampart of ice .
Exceedingly dense fogs , -- as thick as pease-soup , said the <NAME> sailors , -- islands of ice a mile and a half in circumferance , floating mountains which were sunk seventy or eighty fathoms in the sea , such were the obstacles which prevented Frobisher from reaching before the 9th of <NAME> , the strait which he had discovered during his previous campaign .
The <NAME> took possession of the country , and pursued both upon land and sea some poor Esquimaux , who , wounded " in this encounter , jumped in despair from the top of the rocks into the sea , " says Forster in his _Voyages in the <NAME> , " which would not have happened if they had shown themselves more submissive , or if we could have made them understand that we were not their enemies . "
A great quantity of stones similar to that which had been brought to <NAME> were soon discovered .
They were of gold marcasite , and 200 tons of this substance was soon collected .
In their delight , the <NAME> sailors set up a memorial column on a peak to which they gave the name of <NAME> , and performed solemn acts of thanksgiving .
Frobisher afterwards went ninety miles further on in the same strait , as far as a small island , which received the name of <NAME> 's <NAME> .
There the <NAME> found two women , of whom they took one with her child , but left the other on account of her extreme ugliness .
Suspecting , so much did superstition and ignorance flourish at this time , that this woman had cloven feet , they made her take the coverings off her feet , to satisfy themselves that they really were made like their own .
<NAME> , now perceiving that the cold was increasing , and wishing to place the treasures which he thought he had collected , in a place of safety , resolved to give up for the present any farther search for the north-west passage .
He then set sail for <NAME> , where he arrived at the end of September , after weathering a storm which dispersed his fleet .
The man , woman , and child who had been carried off were presented to the Queen .
It is said with regard to them , that the man , seeing at <NAME> 's trumpeter on horseback wished to imitate him , and mounted with his face turned towards the tail of the animal .
These savages were the objects of much curiosity , and obtained permission from the Queen to shoot all kinds of birds , even swans , on the <NAME> , a thing which was forbidden to every one else under the most severe penalties .
They did not long survive , and died before the child was fifteen months old .
People were not slow in discovering that the stones brought back by <NAME> really contained gold .
The nation , but above all the higher classes , were immediately seized with a fever bordering on delirium .
They had found a Peru , an Eldorado .
<NAME> , in spite of her practical good sense , yielded to the current .
She resolved to build a fort in the newly discovered country , to which she gave the name of <NAME> incognita_ , ( unknown boundary ) and to leave there , with 100 men as garrison , under the command of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , three vessels which should take in a cargo of the auriferous stones .
These 100 men were carefully chosen ; there were bakers , carpenters , masons , gold-refiners , and others belonging to all the various handicrafts .
The fleet was composed of fifteen vessels , which set sail from <NAME> on the 31st of May , 1578 .
Twenty days later the western coasts of <NAME> were discovered .
Whales played round the vessels in innumerable troops .
It is related even that one of the vessels propelled by a favourable wind , struck against a whale with such force that the violence of the shock stopped the ship at once , and that the whale after uttering a loud cry , made a spring out of the water and then was suddenly swallowed up .
Two days later , the fleet met with a dead whale which they thought must be the one struck by the _Salamander_ .
When <NAME> came to the entrance of the strait which has received his name , he found it blocked up with floating ice .
" The barque <NAME> , 100 tons , " says the old account of <NAME> , " received such a shock from an iceberg that she sank in sight of the whole fleet .
Following upon this catastrophe , a sudden and horrible tempest arose from the south-east , the vessels were surrounded on all sides by the ice ; they left much of it , between which they could pass , behind them , and found still more before them through which it was impossible for them to penetrate .
<NAME> ships , either having found a place less blocked with ice , or one where it was possible to proceed , furled sails and drifted ; of the others , several stopped and cast their anchors upon a great island of ice .
The latter were so rapidly enclosed by an infinite number of islets of ice and fragments of icebergs , that the English were obliged to resign themselves and their ships to the mercy of the ice , and to protect the ships with cables , cushions , mats , boards , and all kinds of articles which were suspended to the sides , in order to defend them from the fearful shocks and blows of the ice . "
Frobisher himself was thrown out of his course .
Finding the impossibility of rallying his squadron , he sailed along the west coast of <NAME> , as far as the strait which was soon to be called <NAME> ' <NAME> , and penetrated as far as the <NAME> of <NAME> .
When he had repaired his vessels with the wood which was to have been used in the building of a dwelling , he loaded the ships with 500 tons of stones similar to those which he had already brought home .
Judging the season to be then too far advanced , and considering also that the provisions had been either consumed , or lost in the <NAME> , that the wood for building had been used for repairing the vessels , and having lost 40 men , he set out on his return to <NAME> on the 31st of August .
Tempests and storms accompanied him to the shores of his own country .
As to the results of his expedition they were almost none as to discoveries , and the stones , which he had put on board in the midst of so many dangers , were valueless .
This was the last Arctic voyage in which <NAME> took part .
In 1585 we meet with him again as vice-admiral , under <NAME> ; in 1588 he distinguished himself against the <NAME> ; in 1590 he was with <NAME> 's fleet on the coast of <NAME> ; finally in a descent on the coast of <NAME> , he was so seriously wounded that he had only time to bring his squadron back to <NAME> before he died .
If <NAME> 's voyages had only gain for their motive , we must put this down not to the navigator himself , but to the passions of the period , and it is not the less true that in difficult circumstances , and with means the insufficiency of which makes us smile , he gave proof of courage , talent , and perseverance .
To <NAME> is due , in one word , the glory of having shown the route to his countrymen , and of having made the first discoveries in the localities where the <NAME> name was destined to render itself illustrious .
If it became necessary to abandon the hope of finding in these circumpolar regions countries in which gold abounded as it did in <NAME> , this was no ground for not continuing to seek there for a passage to <NAME> ; an opinion supported by very skilful sailors , and one which found many adherents among the merchants of <NAME> .
By the aid of several high personages , two ships were equipped ; the <NAME> , of fifty tons ' burden and carrying a crew of twenty-three in number , and the <NAME> , of thirty-five tons .
They quitted <NAME> on the 7th of June , 1585 , under the command of <NAME> .
<NAME> discovered the entrance of the strait which received his name , and was obliged to cross immense fields of drifting ice , after having reassured his crew , who were frightened while in the midst of a dense fog , by the dash of the icebergs , and the splitting of the blocks of ice .
On the 20th July , <NAME> discovered the <NAME> of Desolation , but without being able to disembark upon it .
<NAME> days later he entered <NAME> , where he found a peaceable population , who gave him sealskins and furs in exchange for some trifling articles .
These natives , some days afterwards , arrived in such numbers , that there were not less than thirty-seven canoes around <NAME> ' vessels .
In this place , the navigator perceived an enormous quantity of drift wood , amongst which he mentions an entire tree , which could not have been less than sixty feet in length .
On the 6th of <NAME> , he cast anchor in a fine bay called <NAME> ; near a mountain of the colour of gold , which received the name of <NAME> , at the same time , he gave the names of <NAME> and <NAME> to two capes of that land of <NAME> .
During eleven days , <NAME> still sailed northwards on a very open sea , free from ice , and of which the water had the colour of the <NAME> .
Already he believed himself at the entrance of the sea , which communicated with the <NAME> , when all at once the weather changed , and became so foggy , that he was forced to return to <NAME> , where he landed on the 30th of September .
<NAME> had the skill to make the owners of his ships partake in the hope which he had conceived .
Thus on the 7th of May ( 1586 ) , he set out again with the two ships which had made the previous voyage .
To them were added the <NAME> of 120 tons , and the pinnace <NAME> .
When , on the 25th of June , he arrived at the southern point of <NAME> , <NAME> despatched the <NAME> and the <NAME> towards the north , in order to search for a passage upon the eastern coast , whilst he pursued the same route as in the preceding year , and penetrated into the strait which bears his name as far as 69 degrees .
But there was a much greater quantity of ice this year , and on the 17th of July , the expedition fell in with an " icefield " of such extent that it took thirteen days to coast along it .
The wind after passing over this icy plain was so cold , that the rigging and sails were frozen , and the sailors refused to go any further .
It was needful , therefore , to descend again to the east-south-east .
There <NAME> explored the land of <NAME> , without finding the strait he was seeking , and after a skirmish with the <NAME> , in which three of his men were killed , and two wounded , he set out on the 19th of September , on his return to <NAME> .
Although once more his researches had not been crowned with success , <NAME> still had good hope , as is witnessed by a letter , which he wrote to the <NAME> , in which he said that he had reduced the existence of the passage to a species of certainty .
Foreseeing , however , that he would have more trouble in obtaining the despatch of a new expedition , he added that the expenses of the enterprise would be fully covered by the profit arising from the fishery of walrus , seals , and whales , which were so numerous in those parts , that they appeared to have there established their head-quarters .
On the 15th of May , 1587 , he set sail with the <NAME> , the <NAME> , and the <NAME> .
This time he went farther north than he had ever done before , and reached 72 degrees 12 minutes , that is to say , nearly the latitude of <NAME> , and he descried <NAME> 's Hope .
Stopped by the ice , and forced to retrace his way , he sailed in <NAME> 's <NAME> , and after having crossed a large gulf , he arrived , in 61 degrees 10 minutes latitude , in sight of a cape to which he gave the name of <NAME> .
This cape is a part of the <NAME> coast , and forms the southern entrance to <NAME> 's Bay .
After coasting along the <NAME> shores as far as 52 degrees , <NAME> set out for <NAME> , which he reached on the 15th of September .
Although the solution of the problem had not been found , yet nevertheless , precious results had been obtained , but results to which people at that period did not attach any great value .
Nearly the half of <NAME> 's <NAME> had been explored , and clear ideas had been obtained of its shores , and of the people inhabiting them .
These were considerable acquisitions , from a geographical point of view , but they were scarcely those which would greatly affect the merchants of the city .
In consequence , the attempts at finding a north-west passage were abandoned by the <NAME> for a somewhat long period .
A new nation was just come into existence .
The <NAME> -- while scarcely delivered from the <NAME> yoke , -- inaugurated that commercial policy , which was destined to make the greatness and prosperity of their country , by the successive despatch of several expeditions to seek for a way to <NAME> by the north-east ; the same project formerly conceived by <NAME> , and which had given to <NAME> the <NAME> trade .
With their practical instinct , the <NAME> had acquainted themselves with <NAME> navigation .
They had even established factories at <NAME> , and at <NAME> , but they wished to proceed further in their search for new markets .
The <NAME> of <NAME> appearing to them too difficult , they resolved , acting on the advice of the cosmographer <NAME> , to try a new way by the north of <NAME> .
The merchants of <NAME> applied therefore , to an experienced sailor , <NAME> , born in the island of <NAME> , near the <NAME> .
This navigator set out from the <NAME> in 1594 , on board the <NAME> , doubled the <NAME> , saw the island of <NAME> , and found himself , on the 4th of July , in sight of the coast of <NAME> , in latitude 73 degrees 25 minutes .
He sailed along the coast , doubled <NAME> on the 10th of July , and three days later he came in contact with the ice .
Until the 3rd of <NAME> , he attempted to open a passage through the pack , testing the mass of ice on various sides , going up as far as the <NAME> at the north-western extremity of <NAME> , sailing over 1700 miles of ground , and putting his ship about no less than eighty-one times .
We do not imagine that any navigator had hitherto displayed such perseverance .
Let us add that he turned this long cruise to account , to fix astronomically , and with remarkable accuracy , the latitude of various points .
At last , wearied with the fruitless boxing about along the edge of the pack , the crew cried for mercy , and it became necessary to return to the <NAME> .
The results obtained were judged so important , that the following year , the <NAME> States-General entrusted to <NAME> van <NAME> , the command of a fleet of seven vessels , of which <NAME> was named chief pilot .
After touching at various points upon the coasts of <NAME> and of <NAME> , this squadron was forced by the pack to go back without having made any important discovery , and it returned to <NAME> on the 18th of September .
As a general rule governments do not possess as much perseverance as do private individuals .
The large fleet of the year 1595 , had cost a great sum of money , and had produced no results ; this was sufficient to discourage the States-General .
The merchants of <NAME> therefore , substituting private enterprise for the action of the government , which merely promised a reward to the man who should first discover the north-east passage -- fitted out two vessels , of which the command was given to <NAME> and to <NAME> , while <NAME> , who had only the title of pilot , was virtually the leader of the expedition .
The historian of the voyage , <NAME> , was also on board as second mate .
The <NAME> sailed from <NAME> on the 10th of May , 1596 , passed by the <NAME> and <NAME> , and on the 5th of June , saw the first masses of ice , " whereat we were much amazed , believing at first that they were white swans . "
They soon arrived to the south of <NAME> , at <NAME> , upon which they landed on the 11th of June .
They collected there a great number of sea-gulls ' eggs , and after much trouble killed at some distance inland a white bear , destined to give its name to the land which <NAME> had just discovered .
On the 19th of June , they disembarked upon some far-spreading land , which they took to be a part of <NAME> , and to which on account of the sharp-pointed mountains , they gave the name of <NAME> ; of this they explored a considerable portion of the western coast .
Forced by the Polar pack to go southwards again to <NAME> , they separated there from <NAME> , who was once more to endeavour to find a way by the north .
On the 11th of July , <NAME> and <NAME> were in the parts of <NAME> , and five days later they had reached the western coast of <NAME> , which was called <NAME> 's <NAME> .
They then altered their course , and again going northwards , they arrived on the 19th at the <NAME> of <NAME> , where the ice which was still attached to the shore , barred their passage .
They remained in this place until the 4th of <NAME> , and two days later they doubled <NAME> .
After several changes of course , which it would take too long to relate , they reached the <NAME> at the northern extremity of <NAME> .
They began to descend the eastern coast , but were soon obliged to enter a harbour , where they found themselves completely blocked in by the pack-ice , and in which " they were forced in great cold , poverty , misery , and grief , to stay all the winter . "
This was on the 26th of August .
" On the 30th the masses of ice began to pile themselves one upon another against the ship , with snow falling .
The ship was lifted up and surrounded in such a manner , that all that was about her and around her began to crack and split .
It seemed as if the ship must break into a thousand pieces , a thing most terrible to see and to hear , and fit to make one 's hair stand on end .
The ship was afterwards in equal danger , when the ice formed beneath , raising her and bearing her up as though she had been lifted by some instrument . "
Soon the ship cracked to such a degree , that prudence dictated the debarkation of some of the provisions , sails , gunpowder , lead , the arquebuses as well as other arms , and the erection of a tent or hut , in which the men might be sheltered from the snow and from any attacks by bears .
Some days later , some sailors who had advanced from four to six miles inland , found near a river of fresh water , a quantity of drift-wood ; they discovered there also the traces of wild goats and of reindeer .
On the 11th of September , seeing that the bay was filled with enormous blocks of ice piled one upon the other , and welded together , the <NAME> perceived that they would be obliged to winter in this place , and resolved , " in order to be better defended against the cold , and armed against the wild beasts , " to build a house there , which might be able to contain them all , while they would leave to itself the ship , which became each day less safe and comfortable .
Fortunately , they found upon the shore whole trees , coming doubtless from <NAME> , and driven here by the current , and in such quantity that they sufficed not only for the construction of their habitation , but also for firewood throughout the winter .
Never yet had any <NAME> wintered in these regions , in the midst of that slothful and immovable sea , which according to the very false expressions used by <NAME> , forms the girdle of the world , and in which is heard the uproar caused by the rising of the sun .
The <NAME> , therefore , were unable to picture to themselves the sufferings which threatened them .
They bore them , however , with admirable patience , without a single murmur , and without the least want of discipline or attempt at mutiny .
The conduct of these brave seamen , quite ignorant of what so apparently dark a future might have in reserve for them , but who with wonderful faith had " placed their affairs in the hands of <NAME> , " may be always proposed as an example even to the sailors of the present day .
It may well be said that they had really in their heart the _æs triplex_ of which <NAME> speaks .
It was owing to the skill , knowledge , and foresight of their leader <NAME> , as much as to their own spirit of obedience , that the <NAME> sailors ever came forth from <NAME> , which threatened to be their tomb , and again saw the shores of their own country .
[ Illustration : <NAME> view of the house .
The bears , which were extremely numerous at that period of the year , made frequent visits to the crew .
More than one was killed , but the <NAME> contented themselves with skinning them for the sake of their fur , and did not eat them , probably because they believed the flesh to be unwholesome .
It would have been , however , a considerable addition to their food , and would have saved them from using their salted meat , and thus they might longer have escaped the attacks of scurvy .
But that we may not anticipate , let us continue to follow the journal of <NAME> de Veer .
On the 23rd September , the carpenter died , and was interred the next day in the cleft of a mountain , it being impossible to put a spade into the ground , on account of the severity of the frost .
The following days were devoted to the transport of driftwood and the building of the house .
To cover it in , it was necessary to demolish the fore and aft cabins of the ship ; the roof was put on , on the 2nd October , and a piece of frozen snow was set up like a May pole .
On the 31st September , there was a strong wind from the north-west , and as far as the eye could reach , the sea was entirely open and without ice .
" But we remained as though taken and arrested in the ice , and the ship was raised full two or three feet upon the ice , and we could imagine nothing else but that the water must be frozen quite to the bottom , although it was three fathoms and a half in depth . "
On the 12th October , they began to sleep in the house , although it was not completed .
On the 21st , the greater part of the provisions , furniture , and everything which might be wanted was withdrawn from the ship , for they felt certain that the sun was about to disappear .
A chimney was fixed in the centre of the roof , inside a <NAME> clock was hung up , bed-places were formed along the walls , and a wine-cask was converted into a bath , for the surgeon had wisely prescribed to the men frequent bathing as a preservative of health .
The quantity of snow which fell during this winter , was really marvellous .
The house disappeared entirely beneath this thick covering , which , however , sensibly raised the temperature within .
Every time that they wished to go forth , the <NAME> were obliged to hollow out a long corridor beneath the snow .
Each night they first heard the bears , and then the foxes , which walked upon the top of the dwelling , and tried to tear off some planks from the roof , that they might get into the house .
So the sailors were accustomed to climb into the chimney , whence , as from a watch-tower they could shoot the animals and drive them off .
They had manufactured a great number of snares , into which fell numbers of blue foxes , the valuable fur of which served as a protection against cold , while their flesh enabled the sailors to economize their provisions .
Always cheerful and good tempered , they bore equally well the ennui of the long polar night , and the severity of the cold , which was so extreme , that during two of three days , when they had not been able to keep so large a fire as usual , on account of the smoke being driven back again by the wind , it froze so hard in the house , that the walls and the floor were covered with ice to the depth of two fingers , even in the cots where these poor people were sleeping .
It was necessary to thaw the sherry , when it was served out , as was done every two days , at the rate of half a pint .
" On the 7th of December , the rough weather continued , with a violent storm coming from the north-east , which produced horrible cold .
We knew no means of guarding ourselves against it , and while we were consulting together , what we could do for the best , one of our men in this extreme necessity proposed to make use of the coal which we had brought from the ship into our house , and to make a fire of it , because it burns with great heat and lasts a long time .
In the evening we lighted a large fire of this coal , which threw out a great heat , but we did not provide against what might happen , for as the heat revived us completely , we tried to retain it for a long time .
To this end we thought it well to stop up all the doors and the chimney , to keep in the delightful warmth .
And thus , each went to repose in his cot , and animated by the acquired warmth , we discoursed long together .
But in the end , we were seized with a giddiness in the head , some however , more than others ; this was first perceived to be the case with one of our men who was ill , and who for this reason , had less power of resistance .
And we also ourselves were sensible of a great pain which attacked us , so that several of the bravest came out of their cots and began by unstopping the chimney , and afterwards opening the door .
But the man who opened the door fainted , and fell senseless upon the snow , on perceiving which , I ran to him and found him lying on the ground in a fainting fit .
I went in haste to seek for some vinegar , and with it I rubbed his face until he recovered from his swoon .
Afterwards , when we were somewhat restored , the captain gave to each a little wine , in order to comfort our hearts ... . " " On the 11th , the weather continued fine , but so extremely cold , that no one who had not felt it could imagine it ; even our shoes , frozen to our feet , were as hard as horn , and inside they were covered with ice in such a manner that we could no longer use them .
The garments which we wore were quite white with frost and ice . "
On <NAME> Day , the 25th December , the weather was as rough as on the preceding days .
The foxes made havoc upon the house , which one of the sailors declared to be a bad omen , and upon being asked why he said so , answered , " Because we can not put them in a pot , or on the spit , which would have been a good omen . "
If the year 1596 , had closed with excessive cold , the commencement of 1597 was not more agreeable .
Most violent storms of snow , and hard frost prevented the <NAME> from leaving the house .
They celebrated <NAME> with gaiety , as is related in the simple and touching narrative of <NAME> de Veer .
" For this purpose , we besought the captain to allow us a little diversion in the midst of our sufferings , and to let us use a part of the wine which was destined to be served out to us every other day .
Having two pounds of flour we made some pancakes with oil , and each one brought a white biscuit , which we soaked in the wine and eat .
And it seemed to us that we were in our own country , and amongst our relations and friends ; and we were as much diverted as if a banquet had been given in our honour , so much did we relish our entertainment .
We also made a Twelfth-Night king , by means of paper , and our master gunner was king of <NAME> , which is a country enclosed between two seas , and of the great length of six hundred miles . "
After the 21st January , the foxes became less numerous , the bears reappeared , and daylight began to increase , which enabled the <NAME> , who had been so long confined to the house , to go out a little .
On the 24th , one of the sailors , who had been long ill , died , and was buried in the snow at some distance from the house .
On the 28th , the weather being very fine , the men all went out , walking about , running for exercise , and playing at bowls , to take off the stiffness of their limbs , for they were extremely weak , and nearly all suffering from scurvy .
They were so much enfeebled that they were obliged to go to work several times before they could carry to their house the wood which was needful .
At length in the first days of March , after several tempests and driving snowstorms , they were able to verify the fact that there was no ice in the sea .
Nevertheless , the weather was still rough and the cold glacial .
It was not feasible as yet to put to sea again , the rather because the ship was still embedded in the ice .
On the 15th of April , the sailors paid a visit to her and found her in fairly good condition .
[ Illustration : Exterior view of the house .
At the beginning of May the men became somewhat impatient , and asked <NAME> if he were not soon intending to make the necessary preparations for departure .
But <NAME> answered that he must wait until the end of the month , and then , if it should be impossible to set the ship free , he would take measures to prepare the long-boats and the launch , and to render them fit for a sea voyage .
On the 20th of the month the preparations for departure commenced ; with what joy and ardour it is easy to imagine .
The launch was repaired , the sails were mended , and both boats were dragged to the sea , and provisions put on board .
Then , seeing that the water was free , and that a strong wind was blowing , <NAME> went to seek <NAME> , who had been long ill , and declared to him " that it seemed good to him to set out from thence , and in <NAME> 's name to commence the voyage and abandon <NAME> . "
" <NAME> had before this written a paper setting forth how we had started from <NAME> to go towards the kingdom of <NAME> , and all that had happened , in order that , if by chance , some one should come after us , it might be known what had befallen us .
This note he enclosed in the case of a musket which he hung up in the chimney . "
On the 13th June , 1597 , the <NAME> abandoned the ship , which had not stirred from her icy prison , and commending themselves to the protection of <NAME> , the two open boats put to sea .
They reached the <NAME> , and again descended the western coast of <NAME> in the midst of ceaselessly recurring dangers .
" On the 20th of June <NAME> became very weak , and we saw clearly that he would soon expire .
The lieutenant of the governor came on board our launch , and told us that <NAME> was very much indisposed , and that it was very evident that his days would soon end .
Upon which , <NAME> said , 'It appears to me that my life also will be very short . '
We did not imagine that <NAME> was so ill , for we were chatting together , and <NAME> was looking at the little chart which I had made of our voyage , and we had various discourses together .
Finally , he laid down the chart , and said to me , 'Gerard , give me something to drink . '
After he had drunk , such weakness supervened that his eyes turned in his head , and he died so suddenly that we had not time to call the captain , who was in the other boat .
This death of <NAME> saddened us greatly , seeing that he was our principal leader , and our sole pilot , in whom we had placed our whole trust .
But we could not oppose the will of <NAME> , and this thought quieted us a little . "
Thus died the illustrious <NAME> , like his successors <NAME> and <NAME> , in the midst of his discoveries .
In the measured and sober words of the short funeral oration of <NAME> de <NAME> may be perceived the affection , sympathy , and confidence which this brave sailor had been able to inspire in his unfortunate companions .
<NAME> is one of the glories of <NAME> , so prolific in brave and skilful navigators .
We shall mention presently what has been done to honour his memory .
[ Illustration : Map of <NAME> . ]
After having been forced several times to haul the boats out of the water when they were on the point of being crushed between the blocks of ice ; after having seen on various occasions the sea open , and again close before them ; after having suffered both from thirst and hunger , the <NAME> reached <NAME> .
One day , being obliged to draw up the long-boat , which was in danger of being stove in upon an iceberg , the sailors lost a part of their provisions and were all deluged with water , for the ice broke away under their feet .
In the midst of so much misery they sometimes met with good windfalls .
Thus , when they were upon the ice on the <NAME> of Crosses they found there seventy eggs of the mountain-duck .
" But they did not know what they should put them in to carry them .
At length one man took off his breeches , tying them together by the ends , and having put the eggs into them , they carried them on a pike between two , while the third man carried the musket .
The eggs were very welcome , and we eat them like lords . "
From the 19th July , the <NAME> sailed over a sea , which , if not altogether free from ice , was at least clear of those great fields of ice which had given them so much trouble to avoid .
On the 28th July , when entering the Gulf of <NAME> , they met with two <NAME> vessels , which at first they dared not approach .
But when they saw the sailors come to them unarmed and with friendly demonstrations , they put aside all fear , the rather as they recognized in the Russians some people whom they had met with the year before in the neighbourhood of <NAME> .
The <NAME> received some assistance from them , and then continued their voyage , still keeping along the coast of <NAME> , and as close in shore as the ice would allow .
Upon one occasion when they landed , they discovered the cochlearia ( scurvy-grass ) , a plant of which the leaves and seeds form one of the most powerful of known anti-scorbutics .
They eat them , therefore , by handfuls , and immediately experienced great relief .
Their provisions were , however , nearly exhausted ; they had only a little bread remaining and scarcely any meat .
They decided therefore to take to the open sea , in order to shorten the distance which separated them from the coast of <NAME> , where they hoped to fall in with some fishermen 's boats , from which they might obtain assistance .
In this hope they were not deceived , although they had still many trials to undergo .
The Russians were much touched by their misfortunes , and consented on several occasions to bestow provisions upon them , which prevented the <NAME> sailors from dying of hunger .
In consequence of a thick fog the two boats were separated from each other , and did not come together again until some distance beyond <NAME> on the further side of the <NAME> , at <NAME> , where some fishermen informed the <NAME> that at <NAME> there were three ships belonging to their nation , which were ready to put to sea on their return to their own country .
They therefore despatched thither one of their men accompanied by a Laplander , who returned three days afterwards with a letter signed <NAME> .
<NAME> was the astonishment of the <NAME> at the sight of this signature .
It was only on comparing the letter just received with several others which <NAME> had in his possession , that they were convinced that it really came from the captain who had accompanied them the preceding year .
Some days later , on the 30th September , <NAME> himself arrived with a boat laden with provisions , to seek them out and take them to the <NAME> , in which his ship was at anchor .
<NAME> was greatly astonished at all that they related to him , and at the terrible voyage of nearly 1200 miles which they had made , and which had not taken less than 104 days -- namely , from the 13th June to the 25th September .
Some days of repose accompanied by wholesome and abundant food sufficed to clear off the last remains of scurvy , and to refresh the sailors after their fatigues .
On the 17th September , <NAME> left the <NAME> , and on the 1st November the <NAME> crew arrived at <NAME> .
" We had on , " says <NAME> , " the same garments which we wore in <NAME> , having on our heads caps of white fox-skin , and we repaired to the house of <NAME> , who had been one of the guardians of the town of <NAME> charged with presiding over the fitting out of the two ships of <NAME> and of our own captain .
Arrived at this house , in the midst of general astonishment , because that we had been long thought to be dead , and this report had been spread throughout the town , the news of our arrival reached the palace of the prince , where there were then at table the <NAME> , and the <NAME> of the high and mighty King of <NAME> and <NAME> , of the <NAME> and the <NAME> .
We were then brought before them by M. l'Écoutets and two lords of the town , and we gave to the said lord Ambassador , and to their lordships the burgomasters , a narrative of our voyage .
Afterwards each of us retired to his own house .
Those who had not dwellings in the town , were lodged in an inn until such time as we had received our money , when each went his own way .
These are the names of the men who returned from this voyage : <NAME> , clerk and captain , <NAME> , <NAME> , mate , <NAME> , surgeon , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> de <NAME> , and <NAME> . "
Of all these brave sailors we have nothing further to record except that <NAME> published the following year the narrative of his voyage , and that <NAME> after having made several cruises to <NAME> , received in 1607 the command of a fleet of twenty-six vessels , at the head of which , on the 25th of April , he had a severe battle with the <NAME> under the guns of <NAME> , in which battle , although the <NAME> were the conquerers , <NAME> lost his life .
The spot where the unfortunate <NAME> and his companions had wintered was not revisited until 1871 , nearly three hundred years after their time .
The first to double the northern point of <NAME> , <NAME> had remained alone in the achievement until this period .
On the 7th September , 1871 , the <NAME> , <NAME> , well known by his numerous voyages in the <NAME> and the <NAME> , arrived at the ice haven of <NAME> , and on the 9th he discovered the house which had sheltered the <NAME> .
It was in such a wonderful state of preservation that it seemed to have been built but a day , and everything was found in the same position as at the departure of the shipwrecked crew .
<NAME> , foxes , and other creatures inhabiting these inhospitable regions had alone visited the spot .
Around the house were standing some large puncheons and there were heaps of seal , bear , and walrus bones .
<NAME> , everything was in its place .
It was the faithful reproduction of the curious engraving of <NAME> de Veer .
The bed-places were arranged along the partition as they are shown in the drawing , as well as the clock , the muskets , and the halberd .
Amongst the household utensils , the arms , and the various objects brought away by <NAME> , we may mention two copper cooking-pans , some goblets , gun-barrels , augers and chisels , a pair of boots , nineteen cartridge-cases , of which some were still filled with powder , the clock , a flute , some locks and padlocks , twenty-six pewter candlesticks , some fragments of engravings , and three books in <NAME> , one of which , the last edition of <NAME> 's " History of <NAME> " shows the goal which <NAME> sought in this expedition , and a " Manual of <NAME> " proves the care taken by the pilot to keep himself well up in all professional matters .
Upon his return to the port of <NAME> , <NAME> met with a <NAME> , <NAME> , who purchased the <NAME> relics , and forwarded them to the authorities of the <NAME> .
These objects have been placed in the <NAME> at the <NAME> , where a house , open in front , has been constructed precisely similar to the one represented in the drawing of <NAME> de Veer , and each object or instrument brought back has been placed in the very position which it occupied in the house in <NAME> .
Surrounded by all the respect and affection which they merit , these precious witnesses of a maritime event so important as the first wintering in the <NAME> regions , these touching reminiscences of <NAME> , <NAME> , and their rough companions , constitute one of the most interesting monuments in the <NAME> .
Beside the clock is placed a copper dial , through the middle of which a meridian is drawn .
This curious dial , invented by <NAME> , which served without doubt to determine the variations of the compass , is now the only example extant of a nautical instrument which has never been in very general use .
For this reason it is as precious as , from another point of view , are the flute used by <NAME> , and the shoes of the poor sailor who died during the winter sojourn .
It is impossible to behold this curious collection without experiencing poignant emotion .
A very poor cottage at <NAME> in <NAME> was the birthplace in 1540 , of <NAME> , who was destined to gain millions by his indomitable courage , which however , he lost with as much facility as he had obtained them .
<NAME> Drake his father , was one of those clergy who devote themselves to the education of the people .
His poverty was only equalled by the respect which was felt for his character .
Burdened with a family as he was , the father of <NAME> found himself obliged from necessity to allow his son to embrace the maritime profession , for which he had an ardent longing , and to serve as cabin-boy on board a coasting vessel which traded with <NAME> .
<NAME> , active , self-reliant , and saving , the young <NAME> had soon acquired all the theoretical knowledge needed for the direction of a vessel .
When he had realized a small sum , which was increased by the sale of a vessel bequeathed to him by his first master , he made more extended voyages ; he visited the <NAME> of <NAME> and the Gulf of <NAME> , and laid out all his capital in purchasing a cargo which he hoped to sell in the <NAME> .
But no sooner had he arrived at <NAME> de la <NAME> , than both ship and cargo were confiscated , we know not under what frivolous pretext .
All the remonstrances of <NAME> , who thus saw himself ruined , were useless .
He vowed to avenge himself for such a piece of injustice , and he kept his word .
In 1567 , two years after this adventure , a small fleet of six vessels , of which the largest was of 700 tons ' burden , left <NAME> with the sanction of the Queen , to make an expedition to the Coasts of <NAME> .
<NAME> was in command of a ship of fifty tons .
At first starting they captured some negroes on the <NAME> de <NAME> , a sort of rehearsal of what was destined to take place in <NAME> .
Then they besieged <NAME> , where some more negroes were taken , which they sold at the <NAME> .
<NAME> , doubtless by the advice of <NAME> , captured the town of <NAME> la Hacha ; after which he reached <NAME> d'Ulloa , having encountered a fearful storm .
But the harbour contained a numerous fleet , and was defended by formidable artillery .
The <NAME> fleet was defeated , and <NAME> had much difficulty in regaining the <NAME> coast in January , 1568 .
<NAME> afterwards made two expeditions to the <NAME> for the purpose of studying the country .
When he considered himself to have acquired the necessary information , he fitted out two vessels at his own expense : the <NAME> , of twenty-five tons , commanded by his brother <NAME> , and the <NAME> , of seventy tons .
The two vessels had as crew seventy-three jack-tars , who could be thoroughly depended on .
From <NAME> , 1572 , to <NAME> , 1573 , sometimes alone , sometimes in concert with a certain Captain Rawse , <NAME> made a lucrative cruise upon the coasts of the Gulf of <NAME> , attacked the towns of <NAME> and of <NAME> de <NAME> , and obtained considerable spoil .
Unfortunately these enterprises were not carried out without much cruelty and many acts of violence which would make men of the present day blush .
But we will not dwell upon the scenes of piracy and barbarity which are only too frequently met with in the sixteenth century .
After assisting in the suppression of the rebellion in <NAME> , <NAME> , whose name was beginning to be well known , was presented to <NAME> .
He laid before her his project of going to ravage the western coasts of <NAME> , by passing through the <NAME> of <NAME> , and he obtained , with the title of admiral , a fleet of six vessels , on board of which were 160 picked sailors .
<NAME> <NAME> started from <NAME> on the 15th November , 1577 .
He had some intercourse with the Moors of <NAME> , of which he had no reason to boast , made some captures of small importance before arriving at the <NAME> de <NAME> , where he took in fresh provisions , and then was fifty-six days in crossing the <NAME> and reaching the coast of <NAME> , which he followed as far as the estuary of <NAME> , where he laid in a supply of water .
He afterwards arrived at <NAME> in <NAME> , where he traded with the natives , and killed a great number of penguins and sea-wolves for the nourishment of his crew .
" Some of the Patagonians who were seen on the 13th May a little below <NAME> , " says the original narrative , " wore on the head a kind of horn , and nearly all had many beautiful birds ' feathers by way of hats .
They also had the face painted and diversified by several kinds of colours , and they each held a bow in the hand , from which every-time they drew it , they discharged two arrows .
They were very agile , and as far as we could see , well instructed in the art of making war , for they kept good order in marching and advancing , and for so few men as they were , they made themselves appear a large number . "
M. <NAME> , in his <NAME> et <NAME> , notices that <NAME> does not mention the extraordinary stature which <NAME> had attributed to the Patagonians .
For this there is more than one good reason .
There exists in <NAME> more than one tribe , and the description here given by <NAME> of the savages whom he met , does not at all resemble that given by <NAME> of the Patagonians of <NAME> St. Julian .
If there exist , as seems now to be proved , a race of men of great stature , their habitat appears fixed upon the shores of the Strait at the southern extremity of <NAME> , and not at fifteen days ' sail from <NAME> , at which <NAME> arrived on the 2nd June .
On the following day he reached the harbour of <NAME> , where he found a gibbet erected of yore by <NAME> for the punishment of some rebellious members of his crew .
<NAME> in his turn , chose this spot to rid himself of one of his captains , named <NAME> , who had been long accused of treason and underhand dealing , and who on several occasions had separated himself from the fleet .
Some sailors having confessed that he had solicited them to join with him in frustrating the voyage , <NAME> was convicted of the crimes of rebellion , and of tampering with the sailors , and according to the laws of <NAME> , he was condemned by a court martial to be beheaded .
This sentence was immediately executed , although <NAME> until the last moment vehemently declared his innocence .
Was his guilt thoroughly proved ?
If <NAME> were accused upon his return to <NAME> -- in spite of the moderation which he always evinced towards his men , -- of having taken advantage of the opportunity to get rid of a rival whom he dreaded , it is difficult to conceive that the forty judges who pronounced the sentence should have concerted together to further the secret designs of their admiral and condemn an innocent man .
On the 20th of <NAME> , the fleet , now reduced to three vessels -- two of the ships having been so much damaged that they were at once destroyed by the admiral -- entered the strait , which had not been traversed since the time of <NAME> .
Although he met with fine harbours , <NAME> found that it was difficult to anchor in them , on account both of the depth of the water close to the shore , and of the violence of the wind , which , blowing as it did in sudden squalls , rendered navigation dangerous .
During a storm which was encountered at the point where the strait opens into the <NAME> , <NAME> beheld one of his ships founder , while his last companion was separated from him a few days afterwards , nor did he see her again until the end of the campaign .
Driven by the currents to the south of the strait as far as 55 degrees 40 minutes , <NAME> had now only his own vessel ; but by the injury which he did to the <NAME> , he showed what ravages he would have committed if he had had still under his command the fleet with which he left <NAME> .
During a descent upon the island of <NAME> , the <NAME> had two men killed and several wounded , while <NAME> himself , hit by two arrows on the head , found himself utterly unable to punish the <NAME> for their perfidy .
In the harbour of Valparaiso he captured a vessel richly laden with the wines of <NAME> , and with ingots of gold valued at 37,000 ducats ; afterwards he pillaged the town , which had been precipitately abandoned by its inhabitants .
At <NAME> , the people were forewarned of his approach , so that he found there a strong force , which obliged him to re-embark .
At <NAME> he plundered three small vessels , in one of which he found fifty-seven bars of silver valued at 2006_l._ In the harbour of <NAME> , where were moored twelve ships or barks , the booty was considerable .
But what most rejoiced the heart of <NAME> was to learn that a galleon named the <NAME> , very richly laden , was sailing towards <NAME> .
He immediately went in pursuit , capturing on the way a bark carrying 80 lbs .
of gold , which would be worth 14,080 <NAME> crowns , and in the latitude of <NAME> Francisco he seized without any difficulty the <NAME> , in which he found 80 lbs .
This caused the <NAME> pilot to say , laughing , " Captain , our ship ought no longer to be called <NAME> ( spit-fire ) , but rather _Caga-Plata_ ( spit money ) , it is yours which should be named _Caga-Fuego_ . "
After making some other captures more or less valuable , upon the <NAME> coast , <NAME> , learning that a considerable fleet was being prepared to oppose him , thought it time to return to <NAME> .
For this , there were three different routes open to him : he might again pass the <NAME> of <NAME> , or he might cross the <NAME> , and doubling the Cape of <NAME> might so return to the <NAME> , or he could sail up the coast of <NAME> and return by the <NAME> and the <NAME> .
It was this last alternative , as being the safest of the three , which was adopted by <NAME> .
He therefore put out to sea , reached the 38 degrees of north latitude , and landed on the shore of the <NAME> of <NAME> , which had been discovered three years previously by <NAME> .
It was now the month of June , the temperature was very low , and the ground covered with snow .
The details given by <NAME> of his reception by the natives , are curious enough : " When we arrived , the savages manifested great admiration at the sight of us , and thinking that we were gods , they received us with great humanity and reverence . "
" As long as we remained , they continued to come and visit us , sometimes bringing us beautiful plumes made of feathers of divers colours , and sometimes petun ( tobacco ) which is a herb in general use among the <NAME> .
But before presenting these things to us , they stopped at a little distance , in a spot where we had pitched our tents .
Then they made a long discourse after the manner of a harangue , and when they had finished , they laid aside their bows and arrows in that place , and approached us to offer their presents . "
" The first time they came their women remained in the same place , and scratched and tore the skin and flesh of their cheeks , lamenting themselves in a wonderful manner , whereat we were much astonished .
But we have since learnt that it was a kind of sacrifice which they offered to us . "
The facts given by <NAME> with regard to the Indians of <NAME> are almost the only ones which he furnishes upon the manners and customs of the nations which he visited .
We would draw the reader 's attention here , to that custom of long harangues which the traveller especially remarks , just as <NAME> had observed upon it forty years earlier , and which is so noticeable amongst the <NAME> Indians at the present day .
<NAME> did not advance farther north and gave up his project of returning by the <NAME> .
When he again set sail , it was to descend towards the <NAME> , to reach the <NAME> , and to return to <NAME> by the Cape of <NAME> .
As this part of the voyage deals with countries already known , and as the observations made by <NAME> are neither numerous nor novel , our narrative here shall be brief .
On the 13th of October , 1579 , <NAME> arrived in latitude 8 degrees north , at a group of islands of which the inhabitants had their ears much lengthened by the weight of the ornaments suspended to them ; their nails were allowed to grow , and appeared to serve as defensive weapons , while their teeth , " black as ship 's pitch , " contracted this colour from the use of the betel-nut .
After resting for a time , <NAME> passed by the <NAME> , and on the 14th of November arrived at <NAME> .
The king of this island came alongside , with four canoes bearing his principal officers dressed in their state costumes .
After an interchange of civilities and presents , the <NAME> received some rice , sugar-canes , fowls , _figo_ , cloves , and sago .
On the morrow , some of the sailors who had landed , were present at a council .
" When the king arrived , a rich umbrella or parasol all embroidered in gold was borne before him .
He was dressed after the fashion of his country , but with extreme magnificence , for he was enveloped from the shoulders with a long cloak of cloth of gold reaching to the ground .
He wore as an ornament upon the head , a kind of turban made of the same stuff , all worked in fine gold and enriched with jewels and tufts .
On his neck there hung a fine gold chain many times doubled , and formed of broad links .
On his fingers , he had six rings of very valuable stones , and his feet were encased in shoes of morocco leather . "
After remaining some time in the country to refresh his crew , <NAME> again put to sea , but his ship on the 9th of January , 1580 , struck on a rock , and to float her off it was necessary to throw overboard eight pieces of ordnance and a large quantity of provisions .
A month later , <NAME> arrived at <NAME> where he repaired his ship .
This island afforded much silver , gold , copper , sulphur , spices , lemons , cucumbers , cocoa-nuts , and other delicious fruits .
" We loaded our vessels abundantly with these , being able to certify that since our departure from <NAME> we have not visited any place where we have found more comforts in the way of food and fresh provisions than in this island and that of <NAME> . "
After quitting this richly endowed island , <NAME> landed at <NAME> , where he was very warmly welcomed by the five kings amongst whom the island was partitioned , and by the inhabitants .
" These people are of a fine degree of corpulence , they are great connoisseurs in arms , with which they are well provided , such as swords , daggers , and bucklers , and all these arms are made with much art . "
<NAME> had been some little time at <NAME> when he learnt that not far distant there was a powerful fleet at anchor , which he suspected must belong to <NAME> ; to avoid it he put to sea in all haste .
He doubled the Cape of <NAME> during the first days of June , and after stopping at <NAME> to take in water , he entered <NAME> harbour on the 3rd November , 1580 , after an absence of three years all but a few days .
The reception which awaited him in <NAME> was at first extremely cold .
His having fallen by surprise both upon <NAME> towns and ships , at a time when the two nations were at peace , rightly caused him to be regarded by a portion of society as a pirate , who tramples under foot the rights of nations .
For five months the Queen herself , under the pressure of diplomatic proprieties , pretended to be ignorant of his return .
But at the end of that time , either because circumstances had altered , or because she did not wish to show herself any longer severe towards the skilful sailor , she repaired to <NAME> where <NAME> 's ship was moored , went on board , and conferred the honour of knighthood upon the navigator .
From this period <NAME> 's part as a discoverer is ended , and his after-life as a warrior and as the implacable enemy of the <NAME> does not concern us .
Loaded with honours , and invested with important commands , <NAME> died at sea on the 28th January , 1596 , during an expedition against the <NAME> .
To him pertains the honour of having been the second to pass through the <NAME> of <NAME> , and to have visited <NAME> del <NAME> as far as the parts about <NAME> .
He also ascended the coast of <NAME> to a point higher than any his predecessors had attained , and he discovered several islands and archipelagos .
Being a very clever navigator , he made the transit through the <NAME> of <NAME> with great rapidity .
If there are but very few discoveries due to him , this is probably either because he neglected to record them in his journal , or because he often mentions them in so inaccurate a manner that it is scarcely possible to recognize the places .
It was he who inaugurated that privateering warfare by which the <NAME> , and later on the <NAME> , were destined to inflict much injury upon the <NAME> .
And the large profits accruing to him from it , encouraged his contemporaries , and gave birth in their minds to the love for long and hazardous voyages .
Among all those who took example by <NAME> , the most illustrious was undoubtedly <NAME> or <NAME> .
<NAME> joined the <NAME> marine service at a very early age ; and passed a most stormy youth , during which he rapidly dissipated his modest fortune .
That which play had robbed him of , he resolved to recover from the <NAME> .
Having in 1585 obtained letters of mark , he made a cruise to the <NAME> and returned with considerable booty .
Encouraged by his easy success as a highwayman on the great maritime roads , he thought that if he could acquire some honour and glory while engaged in making his fortune , so much the better would it be for him .
With this idea he bought three ships , the <NAME> , of twenty tons , the <NAME> , of sixty tons , and the <NAME> , of forty tons , upon which he embarked one hundred and twenty-three soldiers and sailors .
Setting sail on the 22nd July , 1586 , he passed by the Canaries , and landed at <NAME> , which town he attacked and plundered ; then , sailing again , he crossed the <NAME> , sighted <NAME> in <NAME> , sailed along the coast of <NAME> , and arrived on the 27th November at <NAME> .
He found there an immense quantity of dog-fish , very large , and so strong that four men could with difficulty kill them , and numbers of birds , which , having no wings , could not fly , and which fed upon fish .
They are classed under the general names of auks and penguins .
In this very secure harbour , the ships were drawn up on shore to be repaired .
During his stay at this place <NAME> had some skirmishes with the Patagonians , -- " men of gigantic size , and having feet eighteen inches long " -- who wounded two of the sailors with arrows tipped with sharpened flints .
On the 7th January , 1587 , <NAME> entered the <NAME> of <NAME> , and in the narrowest part of it received on board his ships one-and-twenty Spaniards and two women , the sole survivors of the colony founded three years previously , under the name of <NAME> , by <NAME> .
This town , which had been built to bar the passage through the strait , had possessed no fewer than four forts as well as several churches .
<NAME> could discern the fortress , then deserted and already falling into ruins .
Its inhabitants , who had been completely prevented by the continual attacks of the savages from gathering in their harvests , had died of hunger , or had perished in endeavouring to reach the <NAME> settlements in <NAME> .
The <NAME> , upon hearing this lamentable tale , changed the name of <NAME> into that of <NAME> , under which appellation the place is known at the present day .
On the 21st the ships entered a beautiful bay , which received the name of <NAME> , and in which was buried the carpenter of the <NAME> .
Not far from thence a fine river fell into the sea , on the banks of which dwelt the anthropophagi who had fought so fiercely with the <NAME> , and who endeavoured , but in vain , to entice the <NAME> into the interior of the country .
On the 24th February , as the little squadron came forth from the strait , it encountered a violent storm , which dispersed it .
The <NAME> , left alone , and letting in water in all directions , was only kept afloat with the greatest trouble .
Rejoined on the 15th by his consorts , <NAME> tried in vain to land on <NAME> , where <NAME> had been so maltreated by the Araucanians .
This country , rich in gold and silver , had hitherto successfully resisted all <NAME> attempts to subjugate it , and its inhabitants , fully determined to maintain their liberty , repulsed by force of arms every attempt to land .
It was necessary therefore to go to the island of <NAME> , where the <NAME> , who took the <NAME> for <NAME> , furnished them with abundance of maize , fowls , sweet potatoes , pigs , and other provisions .
On the 30th March , <NAME> dropped anchor in 32 degrees 50 minutes in the <NAME> of <NAME> .
A party of thirty musketeers advanced into the country and met with oxen , cows , wild horses , hares , and partridges in abundance .
The little troop was attacked by the <NAME> , and <NAME> was obliged to return to his ships after losing twelve of his men .
He afterwards ravaged , plundered , or burnt the towns of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , and devastated the island of <NAME> , where he obtained a booty in coined money of the value of 25,760_l._ After having scuttled the <NAME> , which was totally unfit any longer to keep the water , <NAME> continued his profitable cruising , burnt , in the latitude of <NAME> , a ship of 120 tons , plundered and burnt Aguatulio , and captured , after six hours of fighting , a vessel of 708 tons , laden with rich stuffs , and with 122,000 gold pesos .
Then , " victorious and contented , " <NAME> wished to secure the great spoils which he was conveying against any chance of danger .
He touched at the <NAME> , the <NAME> , and <NAME> , doubled the Cape of <NAME> , recruited himself at <NAME> , and on the 9th September , 1588 , anchored at <NAME> , after two years of sailing , privateering , and fighting .
At the end of two years after his return , of all the great fortune which he had brought back with him , there remained only a sum sufficient for the fitting out of a third , and as it proved , a last expedition .
<NAME> started on the 6th August , 1591 , with five vessels , but a storm on the coast of <NAME> scattered the flotilla , which could not be collected again until the arrival at <NAME> .
Assailed by fearful hurricanes in the <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> was obliged to go back , after having seen himself deserted by three of his ships .
The want of fresh provisions , the cold , and the privations of all kinds which he underwent , and which had decimated his crew , forced him to return northwards along the coast of <NAME> , where the <NAME> opposed every attempt at landing .
He was therefore obliged to put to sea again without having been able to revictual .
<NAME> died , from grief perhaps as much as from hardships , before he reached the <NAME> coast .
One year after the return of the companions of <NAME> , two ships , the <NAME> and the <NAME> , with two yachts , the <NAME> and <NAME> , having on board a crew of 248 men , quitted <NAME> on the 2nd July , 1598 .
The commander-in-chief of this squadron was <NAME> de <NAME> , a man at that time about thirty or thereabouts , and well known as having made several long cruising voyages .
His second in command and vice-admiral was <NAME> d'Ulpenda , and as pilot there was a certain Melis , a skilful sailor of <NAME> origin .
This expedition , fitted out by the merchants of <NAME> with the concurrence and aid of the States-General of <NAME> , had a double purpose ; at once commercial and military .
Formerly the <NAME> had contented themselves with fetching from <NAME> the merchandise which they distributed by means of their coasting vessels throughout <NAME> ; but now they were reduced to the necessity of going to seek the commodities in the scene of their production .
For this object , <NAME> was to show his countrymen the route inaugurated by <NAME> , and on the way to inflict as much injury as he could upon the <NAME> and <NAME> .
At this period <NAME> , whose yoke the <NAME> had shaken off , and who had just added <NAME> to his possessions , had forbidden his subjects to have any commercial intercourse with the rebels of the <NAME> .
It was thus a necessity for <NAME> if she did not wish to be ruined , and as a consequence , to fall anew under <NAME> rule , to open up for herself a road to the <NAME> .
The route which was the least frequented by the enemy 's ships was that by the <NAME> of <NAME> , and this was the one which <NAME> was ordered to follow .
After touching at <NAME> , the <NAME> anchored in the Gulf of <NAME> , at the <NAME> _do Principe_ .
Here the <NAME> pretended to give a friendly welcome to the men who went on shore , but they took advantage of a favourable opportunity , to fall upon and massacre them without mercy .
Among the dead were <NAME> de <NAME> , brother of the admiral , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> de Bremen -- the captain , <NAME> , being the only man who escaped .
It was a sorrowful commencement for a campaign , a sad presage which was destined not to remain unfulfilled .
<NAME> Noort , who was furious over this foul play , landed from his ships 120 men ; but he found the <NAME> so well entrenched , that after a brisk skirmish in which seventeen more of his men were either killed or wounded , he was obliged to weigh anchor without having been able to avenge the wicked and cowardly perfidy to which his brother and twelve of his companions had fallen victims .
On the 25th December , one of the pilots named <NAME> , was abandoned on the <NAME> coast as a punishment for his disloyal intrigues , for endeavouring to foment a spirit of despondency amongst the crews , and for his well-proved rebellion .
On the 5th January , the island of <NAME> , situated in the Gulf of <NAME> , a little below the <NAME> , was sighted , and the course of the ships was changed for crossing the <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> had scarcely cast anchor in the <NAME> of <NAME> before he sent some sailors on shore to obtain water and buy provisions from the natives ; but the <NAME> opposed the landing , and killed eleven men .
Afterwards , repulsed from the coast of <NAME> by the <NAME> and the natives , driven back by contrary winds , having made vain efforts to reach the island of <NAME> , where they had hoped to obtain the provisions of which they were in the most pressing want , the <NAME> , deprived of their pilot , toss at random upon the ocean .
They land upon the desert islands of <NAME> , again reach the coast of <NAME> at <NAME> , which they mistake for <NAME> , and are finally obliged to winter in the desert island of <NAME> .
The putting into port at this place was marked by several disagreeable events .
The flag-ship struck upon a rock with so much violence that had the sea been a little rougher , she must have been lost .
There were also some bloody and barbarous executions of mutinous sailors , notably that of a poor man , who having wounded a pilot with a knife thrust , was condemned to have his hand nailed to the mainmast .
The invalids , of whom there were many on board the fleet , were brought on shore , and nearly all were cured by the end of a fortnight .
From the 2nd to the 21st of June , <NAME> remained in this island , which was not more than three miles from the mainland .
But before putting to sea he was obliged to burn the <NAME> , as he had not sufficient men to work her .
It was not until the 20th December , after having been tried by many storms , that he was able to cast anchor in <NAME> , where the crew killed in a few days a quantity of dog-fish and sea-lions , as well as more than five thousand penguins .
" The general landed , " says the <NAME> translation of <NAME> 's narrative , published by <NAME> , " with a party of armed men , but they saw nobody , only some graves placed on high situations among the rocks , in which the people bury their dead , putting upon the grave a great quantity of stones , all painted red , having besides adorned the graves with darts , plumes of feathers , and other singular articles which they use as arms . "
The <NAME> saw also , but at too great a distance to shoot them , buffalos , stags , and ostriches , and from a single nest they obtained ten ostrich eggs .
<NAME> <NAME> de <NAME> , died during the stay at this place , and was interred at <NAME> .
On the 23rd November , the fleet entered the <NAME> of <NAME> .
During a visit to the shore three Dutchmen were killed by some Patagonians , and their death was avenged by the massacre of a whole tribe of <NAME> .
The long navigation through the narrows and the lakes of the <NAME> of <NAME> was signalized by the meeting with two <NAME> ships , under the command of <NAME> , who had wintered not far from the <NAME> of <NAME> , and by the abandoning of Vice-admiral Claaz , who , as it would appear , had been several times guilty of insubordination .
Are not these acts , which we see so frequently committed by <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> navigators , a true sign of the times ?
A deed which we should regard now-a-days as one of terrible barbarity seemed , doubtless , a relatively mild punishment in the eyes of men so accustomed to set but little value upon human life .
Nevertheless , could anything be more cruel than to abandon a man in a desert country , without arms and without provisions , to put him on shore in a country peopled by ferocious cannibals , prepared to make a repast on his flesh ; what was it but condemning him to a horrible death ?
On the 29th of February , 1600 , <NAME> , after having been ninety-nine days in passing through the strait , came out on to the <NAME> .
A fortnight later , a storm separated him from the <NAME> , which was never again heard of .
As for <NAME> , who had now with him only one yacht besides his own vessel , he cast anchor at the island of <NAME> , and , unlike the experience of his predecessors , he was very well received by the natives .
Afterwards he sailed along the coast of <NAME> , where he was able to obtain provisions in abundance in exchange for <NAME> knives , hatchets , shirts , hats , and other articles of no great value .
After ravaging , plundering , and burning several towns on the <NAME> coast , after sinking all the vessels that he met with , and amassing a considerable booty , <NAME> , hearing that a squadron commanded by the brother of the viceroy , <NAME> de <NAME> , had been sent in pursuit of him , judged it time to make for the <NAME> , where he anchored on the 16th of September .
" The inhabitants came around our ship with more than 200 canoes , there being three , four , or five men in each canoe , crying out all together : 'Hierro , hierro ' ( iron , iron ) , which is greatly in request amongst them .
They are as much at home in the water as upon land , and are very clever divers , as we perceived when we threw five pieces of iron into the sea , which a single man went to search for . "
<NAME> Noort could testify unfortunately , that these islands well deserved their name .
The islanders tried even to drag the nails out of the ship , and carried off everything upon which they could lay their hands .
One of them , having succeeded in climbing along a part of the rigging , had the audacity to enter a cabin and seize upon a sword , with which he threw himself into the sea .
On the 14th October following , <NAME> traversed the <NAME> , where he made several descents , and burnt , plundered , or sunk a number of <NAME> or <NAME> vessels , and some <NAME> junks .
While cruising in the <NAME> of Manilla he was attacked by two large <NAME> vessels , and in the battle which followed the <NAME> had five men killed , and twenty-five wounded and lost their brigantine , which was captured with her crew of twenty-five men .
The <NAME> lost more than 200 men , for their flag-ship caught fire and sank .
Far from picking up the wounded and the able-bodied men , who were trying to save themselves by swimming , the <NAME> , " making way with sails set on the foremast , across the heads which were to be seen in the water , pierced some with lances , and also discharged their cannon over them . "
After this bloody and fruitless victory , <NAME> went to recruit at <NAME> , captured a rich cargo of spices at <NAME> , and having doubled the Cape of <NAME> , landed at <NAME> on the 26th of <NAME> , having only one ship and forty-eight men remaining .
If the merchants who had defrayed the expenses of the expedition approved of the conduct of <NAME> , who brought back a cargo which more than reimbursed them for their expenditure , and who had taught his countrymen the way to the <NAME> , it behoves us , while extolling his qualities as a sailor , to take great exception to the manner in which he exercised the command , and to mete out severe blame for the barbarity which has left a stain of blood upon the first <NAME> voyage of circumnavigation .
We have now to speak of a man who , endowed with eminent qualities and with at least equal defects , carried on his life 's work in divers , sometimes even in opposing directions , and who after having reached the highest summit of honour to which a gentleman could aspire , at last laid his head upon a scaffold , accused of treason and felony .
This man is <NAME> .
If he have any claim to a place in this portrait gallery of great sailors , it is neither as founder of any <NAME> colony nor as a sailor ; it is as a discoverer , and what we have to say of him is not to his credit .
<NAME> <NAME> passed five years in <NAME> fighting against the <NAME> , in the midst of all those Gascons who formed the basis of the armies of <NAME> of <NAME> , and in such society he perfected the habits of boasting and falsehood which belonged to his character .
In 1577 , after a campaign in the <NAME> against the <NAME> , he returns to <NAME> and takes a deep interest in the questions so passionately debated among his three brothers by the mother 's side , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
At this period <NAME> was passing through a very grave economic crisis .
The practice of agriculture was undergoing a transformation ; in all directions grazing was being substituted for tillage , and the number of agricultural labourers was greatly reduced by the change .
From thence arose general distress , and also such a surplussage of population as was fast becoming a matter of anxious concern .
At the same time , to long wars succeeds a peace , destined to endure throughout the reign of <NAME> , so that a great number of adventurers know not how to find indulgence for their love of violent emotions .
At this moment , therefore , arises the necessity for such an emigration as may relieve the country of its population , may permit all the miserable people dying of hunger to provide for their own wants in a new country , and by that means may increase the influence and prosperity of the mother country .
All the more thoughtful minds in <NAME> , who follow the course of public opinion -- <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and the brothers <NAME> -- are struck with this need .
But it is to the last named that belongs the credit of indicating the locality suitable for the establishing of colonies .
<NAME> only joined with his brothers in the scheme , following their lead , but he neither conceived nor began the carrying into execution -- as he has been too often credited with doing -- of this fruitful project , the colonization of the <NAME> shores of the <NAME> .
If <NAME> , all-powerful with <NAME> , fickle and nevertheless jealous in her affections as she was , encourage his brothers ; if he expend himself 40,000_l._ sterling in his attempts at colonization , he still takes good care not to quit <NAME> , for the life of patience and self-devotion of the founder of a colony would have no attractions for him .
He gives up and sells his patent as soon as he perceives the inutility of his efforts , while he does not forget to reserve for himself the fifth part of any profit arising eventually from the colony .
At the same time <NAME> fits out some vessels against the <NAME> possessions ; and himself soon takes part in the strife and the battles which saved <NAME> from the <NAME> , afterwards proceeding to support the claims of the <NAME> de <NAME> , to the throne of <NAME> .
It is a short time after his return to <NAME> that he falls into disgrace with his royal mistress , and after his release from prison , while he is confined to his princely mansion of <NAME> , he conceives the project of his voyage to <NAME> .
To his mind , this is a gigantic enterprise of which the marvellous results are destined to draw upon him the attention of the whole world , and to restore to him the favour of his sovereign .
Would not the discovery and conquest of <NAME> , of the country in which according to <NAME> , the temples are roofed with plates of gold , where all the tools , even those for the meanest purposes , are made of gold , where one walks upon precious stones , " procure for him greater glory , " these are the very words which <NAME> employs in his account , " than <NAME> had gained in <NAME> , or <NAME> in <NAME> .
He will have under him more golden towns and nations than the King of <NAME> , the <NAME> of the <NAME> , and no matter what <NAME> ! "
We have already spoken of the fables which <NAME> had invented in 1539 , and which had been the fruitful source of more than one legend .
<NAME> discloses what had given them birth when he describes to us the nature of the soil and the rocks which surround <NAME> , between the <NAME> and the <NAME> .
" They are , " says this great traveller , " rocks of micaceous slate , and of sparkling talc , which are resplendent in the midst of a sheet of water , which acts as a reflector beneath the burning tropical sun . "
So are explained those massive domes of gold , those obelisks of silver , and all those marvels of which the boastful and enthusiastic minds of the <NAME> afforded them a glimpse .
<NAME> Raleigh believe really in the existence of this city of gold , for the conquest of which he was about to sacrifice so many lives ?
Was he thoroughly convinced himself , or did he not yield to the illusions of a mind eager for glory ?
It is impossible to say , but this at least is indisputable , that , to borrow the just expressions of M. Philarète Chasles , " at the moment even of his embarkation men did not believe in his promises , they were suspicious of his exaggerations , and dreaded the results of an expedition directed by a man so fool-hardy , and of a morality so equivocal . "
Nevertheless , it seemed that <NAME> had foreseen everything needful for this undertaking , and that he had made the necessary studies .
Not only did he speak of the nature of the soil of <NAME> , of its productions , and its inhabitants with imperturbable assurance , but he had taken care to send , at his own expense , a ship commanded by <NAME> , to prepare the way for the fleet which he intended to conduct in person to the banks of the <NAME> .
What he took good care , however , not to confide to the public , was that all the information he received from his emissary was unfavourable to the enterprise .
Raleigh himself started from <NAME> on the 9th February , 1595 , with a small fleet of five vessels , and 100 soldiers , without reckoning marines , officers , and volunteers .
After stopping four days at <NAME> , one of the <NAME> , to take in wood and water there , he reached <NAME> , where <NAME> ought to have rejoined him .
Having waited for him in vain for eighty days , <NAME> sailed for <NAME> , where he met <NAME> .
The island of <NAME> was at that time governed by <NAME> de <NAME> , who , it is said , had obtained accurate information concerning <NAME> .
The arrival of the <NAME> did not please him , and he immediately despatched emissaries to <NAME> and to <NAME> , with orders to gather together the troops to attack the <NAME> , while at the same time he forbade any Indians or Spaniards to hold intercourse with them under pain of death .
<NAME> , forewarned , determined to be beforehand with him .
At nightfall he landed in secret with 100 men , captured the town of <NAME> , to which the <NAME> set fire , without a blow , and carried off <NAME> and the principal personages to the ships .
At the same time arrived <NAME> and <NAME> , from whom he had been separated upon the <NAME> Coasts .
<NAME> at once sailed for the <NAME> , entered <NAME> with a large galley and three boats carrying 100 sailors and soldiers , became entangled in the inextricable labyrinth of islands and canals which form the mouth of the river , and ascended the <NAME> for a distance of 330 miles .
The account which <NAME> gives of his campaign is so fabulous , with the coolness of a Gascon transported to the banks of the <NAME> , he so heaps one falsehood upon the top of another , that one is almost tempted to class his narrative amongst the number of imaginary voyages .
He says that some Spaniards who had seen the town of <NAME> , called <NAME> , told him that this town exceeds in size and wealth all the towns in the world , and everything which the " conquistadores " had seen in <NAME> .
" There is no winter there , " he says ; " a soil dry and fertile , with game , and birds of every species in great abundance , who filled the air with hitherto unknown notes ; it was a real concert for us .
My captain , sent to search for mines , perceived veins both of gold and silver ; but as he had no tool but his sword , he was unable to detach these metals to examine them in detail ; however , he carried away several bits of them which he reserved for future examination .
A <NAME> of <NAME> called this mine _Madre del Oro_ ( mother of gold ) . "
Then , as <NAME> well knows that the public is on its guard against his exaggerations , he adds , " It will be thought perchance , that I am the sport of a false and cheating delusion , but why should I have undertaken a voyage thus laborious , if I had not entertained the conviction that there is not a country upon earth which is richer in gold than <NAME> ?
<NAME> and <NAME> , our surgeon , brought back several stones which resembled sapphires .
I showed these stones to several inhabitants of <NAME> , who have assured me that there exists an entire mountain of them . "
An old cacique of the age of 110 , who nevertheless could still walk ten miles without fatigue , came to see <NAME> , boasted to him of the formidable power of the <NAME> of <NAME> , and proved to him that his forces were insufficient .
He depicted these people as much civilized , as wearing clothes , and possessing great riches , especially in plates of gold ; finally , he spoke to him of a mountain of pure gold .
<NAME> relates that he wished to approach this mountain , but , sad mischance , it was at that moment half submerged .
" It had the form of a tower , and appeared to me rather white than yellow .
A torrent which precipitated itself from the mountain , swollen by the rains , made a tremendous noise , which could be heard at the distance of many miles , and which deafened our people .
I recollected the description which <NAME> had given of the brilliancy of the diamonds and of the other precious stones scattered over the various parts of the country .
I had , however , some doubt as to the value of these stones ; their extraordinary whiteness , nevertheless surprised me .
After a short time of repose on the banks of the <NAME> , and a visit to the village of the cacique , the latter promised to conduct me to the foot of the mountain by a circuitous route ; but at the sight of the numerous difficulties which presented themselves , I preferred to return to the mouth of the <NAME> , where the caciques of the neighbourhood came to bring various presents , consisting of the rare productions of the country . "
We will spare the reader the description of people three times taller than ordinary men , of cyclops , of natives who had their eyes upon the shoulders , their mouth in the chest , and the hair growing from the middle of the back -- all affirmations seriously related , but which give to <NAME> 's narrative a singular resemblance to a fairy tale .
One fancies while reading it that it must be a page taken out of the <NAME> and one <NAME> .
If we put on one side all these figments of an imagination run mad , what gain has been derived for geography ?
There was certainly no pains spared in announcing with much noise , and very great puffing , this fantastic expedition , and we may well say with the fable-writer , -- " In fancy free I an author see , <NAME> says , 'The awful war I 'll sing Of <NAME> with the Thunder-King : ' Of this grand promise the result , we find , Is often wind . "
Distinguishing characteristics of the <NAME> -- The more thorough exploration of regions previously discovered -- To the thirst for gold succeeds <NAME> zeal -- <NAME> missionaries in <NAME> -- <NAME> missionaries in <NAME> -- Brue in <NAME> and <NAME> in <NAME> -- The <NAME> of <NAME> , of <NAME> , and of <NAME> .
The seventeenth century has a distinctive character of its own , differing from that of the preceding century in the fact that nearly all the great discoveries have been already made , and that the work of this whole period consists almost exclusively in perfecting the information already acquired .
It contrasts equally with the century which is to succeed it , because scientific methods are not yet applied by astronomers and sailors , as they are to be 100 years later .
It appears in fact , that the narratives of the first explorers -- who were only able , so to speak , to obtain a glimpse of the regions which they traversed while waging their wars , -- may have in some degree exercised a baneful influence upon the public mind .
<NAME> , in the narrowest sense of the word , is carried to an extreme .
<NAME> travel over the world to gain an idea of the manners and customs of each nation , of the productions and manufactures of each country , but there is no real study .
They do not seek to trace what they see to its source , and to reason scientifically upon the why and wherefore of facts .
They behold , curiosity is satisfied , and they pass on .
The observations made do not penetrate beneath the surface , and the great object appears to be to visit , as rapidly as may be , all the regions which the sixteenth century has brought to light .
Besides , the abundance of the wealth diffused on a sudden over the whole of <NAME> has caused an economic crisis .
<NAME> , like industry , is transformed and altered .
<NAME> ways are opened , new mediums arise , new wants are created , luxury increases , and the eagerness to make a fortune rapidly by speculation , turns the heads of many .
If Venice from a commercial point of view be dead , the <NAME> are about to constitute themselves , to use a happy expression of M. Leroy-Beaulieu , " the carriers and agents of <NAME> , " and the <NAME> are preparing to lay the foundations of their vast colonial empire .
To the merchants succeed the missionaries .
They alight in large numbers upon the newly-discovered countries , preaching the <NAME> , civilizing the barbarous nations , studying and describing the country .
The development of <NAME> zeal is one of the dominant features of the seventeenth century , and it behoves us to recognize all that geography and historic science owe to these devoted , learned , and unassuming men .
The traveller only passes through a country , the missionary dwells in it .
The latter has evidently much greater facilities for acquiring an intimate knowledge of the history and civilization of the nations which he studies .
It is therefore very natural that we should owe to them narratives of journeys , descriptions , and histories , which are still consulted with advantage , and which have served as a basis for later works .
If there be any country to which these reflections more particularly apply , it is to <NAME> , and especially to <NAME> .
How much of this vast triangular continent of <NAME> was known in the seventeenth century ?
Nothing but the coasts , it will be said .
From the earliest times the two branches of the Nile , the <NAME> and the Bahr-el-Abiad , had been known to the ancients .
They had even advanced -- if the lists of countries and nations discovered at <NAME> by M. <NAME> may be believed -- as far as the great Lakes of the interior .
In the twelfth century , the <NAME> geographer <NAME> writes an excellent description of <NAME> for <NAME> .
of <NAME> , and confirms these data .
Later on , <NAME> and <NAME> travel over <NAME> , and the latter goes as far as <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> affirms that <NAME> is only united to <NAME> by the <NAME> of <NAME> , and he visits <NAME> .
Lastly , when the <NAME> , led by <NAME> da Gama , have completed the circumnavigation of <NAME> , some of them remain in <NAME> , and in a short time diplomatic relations are established between that country and <NAME> .
We have already said something of <NAME> ; in his train several <NAME> missionaries settle in the country , amongst whom must be named <NAME> and <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> left Goa in 1588 to preach Christianity upon the eastern coast of <NAME> .
After long and sad mishaps , he landed at <NAME> in <NAME> , traversed the country , and in 1618 pushed on as far as the sources of the <NAME> , -- a discovery the authenticity of which <NAME> was hereafter to dispute , but of which the narrative differs only in some unimportant particulars from that of the <NAME> traveller .
In 1604 , <NAME> , arrived at the court of the king <NAME> , had preached with such success that he had converted the king and all his court .
He had even soon acquired so great an influence over the <NAME> monarch , that the latter , in writing to the <NAME> and to the King of <NAME> to offer them his friendship , asked them to send him men fitted to teach his people .
<NAME> <NAME> landed in <NAME> with <NAME> , patriarch of <NAME> , in 1625 .
But times were greatly changed .
The king converted by <NAME> had been murdered , and his successor , who had summoned the <NAME> missionaries , died after a short time .
A violent revulsion of feeling ensued against the Christians , and the missionaries were driven away , imprisoned , or given up to the <NAME> .
<NAME> was charged with the mission of obtaining the sum necessary for the ransom of his companions .
After many wanderings , which led him to <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , to <NAME> and to <NAME> , where he gave the <NAME> and the King of <NAME> numerous and accurate details upon the <NAME> of <NAME> and the manners of the inhabitants , he made a last journey in <NAME> , and returned to <NAME> to die , in 1678 .
<NAME> had been introduced into <NAME> , upon the <NAME> coast , in 1489 , the year of its discovery by the <NAME> .
At first Dominicans were sent ; but as they made scarce any progress , the <NAME> , with the consent of the King of <NAME> , despatched thither some <NAME> Capuchins .
These were <NAME> de Placenza in 1667 , <NAME> , from 1654 to 1668 , afterwards <NAME> and <NAME> , from 1696 to 1704 .
We shall mention these missionaries only , because they have published accounts of their journeys .
<NAME> explored in succession <NAME> , the country of <NAME> , and the islands of <NAME> and <NAME> .
In the ardour of his apostolic zeal , he could devise no better means of converting the blacks than by burning their idols , rebuking the kings for the time-honoured custom of polygamy , and subjecting to torture , or to being torn with whips , those who relapsed into idolatry .
Notwithstanding all this , he gained considerable ascendancy over the natives , which , if it had been well directed , might have produced very useful results in the development of civilization and the progress of religion .
The same reproach is due also to <NAME> and to the other Missionaries in <NAME> .
The narrative of <NAME> , published at <NAME> in 1687 , asserted that <NAME> influence extended from 200 to 300 miles from the coast , and that in the interior there existed a very important town , known by the name of <NAME> , which possessed twelve churches , a <NAME> college , and a population of 50,000 souls .
At the close of the fourteenth century <NAME> published the account of the journey of <NAME> , ambassador from the King of <NAME> to the Courts of <NAME> and <NAME> .
A map which accompanies this narrative presents to us a <NAME> , in the very place occupied by <NAME> , and more to the west , <NAME> , from whence issued the <NAME> ; south of the equator two lakes are indicated , one the <NAME> of the Nile , the other , more to the east , bears the name of <NAME> ; they appear to be the <NAME> and the <NAME> .
This most curious information was rejected by the geographers of the nineteenth century , who left blank the whole interior of <NAME> .
Upon the <NAME> of <NAME> at the mouth of the <NAME> , the <NAME> had established settlements which , under the skilful administration of <NAME> , speedily received considerable extension .
<NAME> , <NAME> for the King and Director-general of the <NAME> upon the <NAME> and in other parts of <NAME> -- so ran his official title -- although he may be little known , and the article which treats of him may be one of the most curtailed in the great collections of biography , deserves to occupy one of the most prominent positions among colonizers and explorers .
Not content with extending the colony as far as its present limits , he explored countries which have been only lately revisited by <NAME> , or which have not been visited at all since <NAME> 's time .
He carried the <NAME> outposts eastwards above the junction of the <NAME> and the <NAME> , northwards as far as <NAME> , which we have since abandoned , although reserving our rights , and southwards as far as the island of <NAME> .
He explored in the interior <NAME> and <NAME> , so rich in gold , and collected the earliest documents concerning the <NAME> , <NAME> or <NAME> , the <NAME> and the <NAME> , who coming from the north , attempted the religious conquest of all the black nations of the country .
The information thus collected by <NAME> about the history and migrations of these various people , is of the greatest value , affording clear light , even in the present day , to the geographer and the historian .
Not only has Brue left us the narrative of deeds of which he was witness and the description of the places which he visited , but we also owe to him much information about the productions of the countries , the plants , the animals , and all the objects which would give occasion for commercial or industrial enterprise .
These most curious documents , put together very maladroitly it must be confessed , by <NAME> , formed the subject , a few years ago , of a very interesting work by M. Berlioux .
To the south-east of <NAME> , during the first half of the seventeenth century , the <NAME> founded some commercial settlements in <NAME> , an island long known under the name of <NAME> .
They build <NAME> under the administration of M. de Flacourt ; several unknown districts of the island are explored as well as the neighbouring islands upon the coast ; the <NAME> are occupied in 1649 .
Although firm and moderate towards his countrymen , <NAME> did not use the same self-control towards the natives ; he even brought about a general revolt , as a consequence of which he was recalled .
Expeditions into the interior of <NAME> were henceforth very rare , and it is not until the present day that we find a thorough exploration carried out .
Of <NAME> and Thibet the only information which reached <NAME> during the whole of the seventeenth century was due to the missionaries .
Such names as <NAME> de <NAME> , <NAME> .
d'Andrada , <NAME> , <NAME> , may not be passed over in silence .
In their _Annual Letters_ is to be found a quantity of information , which even in the present day retains a real interest , as concerning regions so long closed against <NAME> .
In <NAME> and <NAME> , <NAME> devoted himself to astronomical observations , of which the result was to prove by the most conclusive evidence the great errors in the longitudes given by <NAME> .
This called the attention of the learned world to the necessity of a reform in the graphic representation of the countries of the extreme east , and for attaining this end , to the absolute need of close observations made by specially qualified scientific men , or by navigators familiar with astronomical calculations .
The country which especially attracted the missionaries was <NAME> , that enormous and populous empire , which ever since the arrival of <NAME> in <NAME> , had persevered with the greatest strictness in the absurd policy of abstention from any intercourse whatsoever with foreigners .
It was not until the close of the sixteenth century that the missionaries obtained the permission , so often demanded before in vain , to penetrate into the <NAME> .
Their knowledge of mathematics and astronomy facilitated their settlement and enabled them to gather , as well from the ancient annals of the country , as during their journies , a prodigious quantity of most valuable information concerning the history , ethnography , and geography of the <NAME> .
Fathers <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , deserve especial mention for having carried to <NAME> the arts and sciences of <NAME> , while they diffused in the west the first accurate and precise information upon the unprogressive civilization of the <NAME> .
The <NAME> in the <NAME> -- <NAME> and <NAME> -- <NAME> -- Mendana -- <NAME> and <NAME> -- <NAME> de <NAME> -- Pietro della <NAME> -- Tavernier -- Thévenot -- <NAME> -- <NAME> -- Chardin -- <NAME> -- Kæmpfer .
The <NAME> were not slow in perceiving the weakness and decadence of the <NAME> power in <NAME> .
They felt with how much ease a clever and prudent nation might in a short time become possessed of the whole commerce of the extreme <NAME> .
After a considerable number of private expeditions and voyages of reconnaissance they had founded in 1602 that celebrated <NAME> of the <NAME> which was destined to raise to so high a pitch the wealth and prosperity of the metropolis .
Equally in its strife with the <NAME> as in its dealing with the natives , the <NAME> pursued a very skilful policy of moderation .
Far from founding colonies , or repairing and occupying the fortresses which they took from the <NAME> , the <NAME> bore themselves as simple traders , exclusively occupied with their commerce .
They avoided building any fortified factory , except at the intersection of the great commercial roads .
Thus they were able in a short time to seize all the carrying trade between <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
The one fault committed by the all-powerful Company was the concentrating in its own hands a monopoly of the trade in spices .
It drove away the foreigners who had settled in the <NAME> or in the <NAME> of <NAME> , or who came thither to obtain a cargo of spices ; it even went the length , in order to raise the price of this valuable commodity , of proscribing the cultivation of certain species in a large number of islands , and of forbidding , under pain of death , the exportation and sale of seeds and cuttings of the spice-producing trees .
In a few years the <NAME> were established in <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , the <NAME> , and at the Cape of <NAME> , harbours the best placed for ships returning to <NAME> .
It was at this time that a rich merchant of <NAME> , <NAME> , in concert with a skilful mariner , named <NAME> , conceived a project for reaching the Indies by a new route .
The <NAME> States-General had in fact forbidden any subject of the <NAME> , not in the pay of the <NAME> of the Indies , from going to the Spice Islands by way of the Cape of <NAME> or of the <NAME> of <NAME> .
<NAME> , according to some , <NAME> , according to others , had formed the idea of eluding this interdict by seeking a passage to the south of <NAME> 's <NAME> .
This much is certain , that <NAME> bore one half of the expense of the expedition , while <NAME> , by the aid of several merchants whose names have been handed down to us , and who filled the chief offices in the town of <NAME> , provided the other half .
They fitted out the <NAME> , a vessel of 360 tons , and a yacht , carrying together a crew of sixty-five men , and twenty-nine cannon .
This was certainly an equipment but little in accordance with the magnitude of the enterprise .
But <NAME> was a skilful mariner , the crew had been carefully chosen , and the vessels were abundantly furnished with provisions and spare rigging .
<NAME> was commissioner , and Schouten the captain of the ship .
The destination was kept secret , and officers and crew entered into an unlimited engagement to go wherever they might be led .
On the 25th June , 1615 , eleven days after quitting the <NAME> , and when there was no longer anything to be feared from indiscretion , the crews were assembled to listen to the reading of an order which ran as follows : " The two vessels would seek another passage than that of <NAME> , by which to enter the <NAME> , and to discover there certain southern countries , in the hope of obtaining enormous profits from them , and if heaven should not favour this design , they would repair by means of the same sea to the <NAME> . "
This declaration was received with enthusiasm by the whole crew , who were animated , like all Dutchmen of that period , with a love for great discoveries .
The route then usually pursued for reaching <NAME> -- as may perhaps have been already observed -- followed the <NAME> coasts as far as below the equator .
The <NAME> did not try to deviate from it ; she reached the shores of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , at 300 miles to the north of the <NAME> of <NAME> , but was for several days hindered by storms from entering the harbour .
The yacht even remained for the space of one whole tide , aground and lying on her side , but high water set her afloat again ; only for a short time however , for whilst some repairs were being done to her keel , her rigging took fire , and she was consumed in spite of the energetic efforts of the two crews .
On the 13th January , 1616 , <NAME> and <NAME> arrived at the <NAME> , discovered by <NAME> , and followed the coast of <NAME> del Fuego at a short distance from land .
The coast ran east-quarter-south-east , and was skirted by high mountains covered with snow .
On the 24th of January at mid-day , they sighted its extreme point , but eastward stretched some more land , which also appeared to be of great elevation .
The distance between these two islands , according to the general opinion , appeared to be about twenty-four miles , and <NAME> entered the strait which divided them .
It was so encumbered with whales that the ship was obliged to tack more than once to avoid them .
The island to the east received the name of <NAME> , and that to the west the name of <NAME> of <NAME> .
[ Illustration : The sea was so encumbered with whales . ]
Twenty-four hours after entering this strait , which received the name of <NAME> , the ship emerged from it , and to an archipelago of small islands situated to starboard was given the name of <NAME> , in honour of the <NAME> of <NAME> .
In 58 degrees <NAME> doubled <NAME> -- so named in remembrance of the town where the expedition had been fitted out -- and entered the <NAME> .
<NAME> afterwards went northwards as far as the parallel of the <NAME> , where he judged it wise to stop , in order to recruit his men who were suffering from scurvy .
As <NAME> had done , <NAME> and <NAME> passed without perceiving them amongst the principal <NAME> archipelagos , and cast anchor on the 10th April , at the <NAME> of <NAME> , where it was only possible to procure a little fresh water and some herbs .
They hoped to reach the <NAME> , but in the north the <NAME> was entered , in which were discovered <NAME> -- so named on account of its containing a great lake -- and <NAME> , because a cloud of these insects settled upon the vessel , and it was impossible to get rid of them until at the end of four days there was a change of wind .
Afterwards <NAME> crossed the <NAME> , and entered that of the <NAME> , or of <NAME> , of which four small islands still retain the names which were then given to them : <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> ' Islands .
The inhabitants of these parts showed themselves extremely addicted to stealing ; they tried to draw out the bolts from the ship and to break the chains .
<NAME> continued to prevail among the crew , and it was therefore a great boon to receive from the king a present of a black boar and some fruits .
The sovereign , who was named <NAME> , speedily arrived in a large canoe with sails , in shape like the <NAME> sledges ( _trainaux_ ) , escorted by a flotilla of five and twenty boats .
The king did not venture himself to go on board the <NAME> , but his son was of a bolder spirit , and inquired the reason of everything he saw with the most lively curiosity .
The next day the number of canoes was greatly augmented , and the <NAME> perceived by certain indications that an attack was impending .
Accordingly , a shower of stones falls on a sudden upon the ship , the canoes approach nearer , become annoying , and the <NAME> to free themselves from them are forced to resort to a discharge of musketry .
This island was rightly named <NAME> ' <NAME> .
It was now the 18th of May , and <NAME> ordered the course to be changed , that the <NAME> might be reached by the north of <NAME> .
He probably passed within sight of the <NAME> , the <NAME> , and the <NAME> ( <NAME> ) , coasting afterwards along <NAME> Guinea from 143 degrees to <NAME> .
He frequently landed , and gave names to a number of points : the twenty-five islands which form a part of the <NAME> , the <NAME> , the <NAME> ( <NAME> ) -- which seems to correspond to a portion of the neighbouring coast of Kornelis-Kinerz Bay -- Moa and <NAME> , two islands again seen later on by <NAME> , the island to which was given the name of <NAME> , but which is now called <NAME> and which must not be confounded with some other <NAME> situated upon the Coast of Guinea but much farther to the west , and finally the <NAME> Goede-Hoep , which appears to be <NAME> at the western extremity of <NAME> .
After sighting the country of <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> reached <NAME> , one of the <NAME> , where they received an eager welcome from their compatriots .
When they were thoroughly rested from their fatigues and cured of scurvy , the <NAME> went to <NAME> , arriving there on the 23rd October , 1616 , only thirteen months after quitting the <NAME> , and having lost only thirteen men during the long voyage .
But the <NAME> of the <NAME> did not at all understand their privileges being infringed upon , and a possibility discovered of reaching the colonies by a way not foreseen in the letters patent which had been granted to the <NAME> at the time of its establishment .
The Governor caused the <NAME> to be seized , and arrested her officers and sailors , whom he sent off to <NAME> , there to be tried .
<NAME> <NAME> , who had expected a totally different recompense for his toils and fatigues , and for the discoveries which he had made , could not bear up under the blow which had fallen so unexpectedly upon him ; he fell ill of grief and died in the latitude of the island of <NAME> .
As for <NAME> , he appears not to have been molested upon his return to his own country , and to have made several voyages to the <NAME> , which were not distinguished by any fresh discovery .
He was returning to <NAME> in 1625 , when he was forced by bad weather to enter <NAME> , upon the east coast of <NAME> , where he died .
<NAME> was the history of this important expedition , which by means of <NAME> opened up a shorter and less dangerous route than that by <NAME> 's <NAME> , an expedition signalized by several discoveries in <NAME> , and by a more attentive exploration of points already seen by <NAME> or <NAME> navigators .
But it is often a matter of difficulty to settle with accuracy to which of these nations the discovery of certain islands , countries , or archipelagos in the neighbourhood of <NAME> , may be due .
Since we are speaking of the <NAME> , we shall put the chronological order of discoveries a little on one side , that we may relate as well as those of <NAME> and <NAME> , the expeditions of <NAME> .
What was the early history of <NAME> , by what concurrence of circumstances did he embrace the profession of a sailor , by what means did he acquire the nautical skill and science of which he gave so many proofs , and which conducted him to his important discoveries ?
From ignorance we can not answer these questions , all we know of his biography commences with his departure from <NAME> on 2nd June , 1639 .
After passing the <NAME> , he would seem during this first voyage to have visited in company with <NAME> the <NAME> , then known by the fantastic title of " the <NAME> and <NAME> . "
In a second expedition , composed of two vessels of which he had the chief command , and which sailed from <NAME> on the 14th of <NAME> , 1642 , he reached the <NAME> on the 5th September , and afterwards sailed to the south-east , seeking for the <NAME> Continent .
On the 24th November in latitude 42 degrees 25 minutes south , he discovered land , to which he gave the name of Van-Diemen , after the Governor of the <NAME> , but which is now with much greater justice called <NAME> .
He anchored there in <NAME> <NAME> , and ascertained that the country was inhabited , although he could not see a single native .
After following this coast for a certain time , he sailed eastwards , with the intention of afterwards making once more for the north , to reach the <NAME> .
On the 13th December , in latitude 42 degrees 10 minutes , he came in sight of a mountainous country which he followed towards the north , until the 18th December , when he cast anchor in a bay ; but even the boldest of the savages whom he met with there , did not approach the ship within a stone 's throw .
Their voices were rough , their stature tall , their colour brown inclining to yellow , and their black hair , which was nearly as long as that of the <NAME> , was worn drawn up to the crown of the head .
On the morrow they summoned courage to go on board one of the vessels and carry on traffic by means of barter .
<NAME> , upon seeing these pacific dispositions , despatched a boat for the purpose of obtaining a more accurate knowledge of the shore .
Of the sailors who manned it , three were killed without provocation by the natives , while the others escaped by swimming , and were picked up by the ships ' boats , but by the time they were in readiness to fire upon the assailants , these had disappeared .
The spot where this sad event happened , received the name of <NAME> ' ( <NAME> ) Bay .
<NAME> , who felt convinced that he could not carry on any intercourse with such fierce people , weighed anchor and sailed up the coast as far as its extreme point , which he named <NAME> Van-Diemen , in honour of his " lady , " for a legend states that having had the audacity to pretend to the hand of the daughter of the governor of the <NAME> , the latter had sent him to sea with two dilapidated ships , the <NAME> and the <NAME> .
[ Illustration : Three were killed by the natives without provocation . ]
The land thus discovered received the name of <NAME> , soon changed into that of <NAME> .
On the 21st January , 1643 , <NAME> discovered the islands of <NAME> and <NAME> , upon which he found a great quantity of pigs , fowls , and fruit .
On the 6th February , the ships entered an archipelago , consisting of a score of islands , which were called <NAME> <NAME> , and after sighting Anthong-Java , <NAME> followed the coast of <NAME> Guinea from <NAME> , passed by the various points previously discovered by <NAME> and <NAME> , and anchored off <NAME> on the 15th June following , after a ten months ' voyage .
In a second expedition , <NAME> , in obedience to his orders dated 1664 , was to visit <NAME> 's <NAME> , and to make a careful examination of the western coast of <NAME> , as far as 17 degrees south latitude , in order to ascertain whether that island belonged to the <NAME> Continent .
It does not appear that <NAME> carried out this programme , but the loss of his journals causes complete uncertainty as to the route which he followed , and the discoveries which he may have made .
From this time there is no record of the events which marked the close of his career , nor of the place and date of his death .
From the period of the taking of <NAME> by <NAME> , the <NAME> conceived that a new world extended to the south of <NAME> .
Their ideas were soon shared by the <NAME> , and henceforward a series of voyages were made on the <NAME> , to search for a southern continent , of which the existence appeared geographically necessary to counterbalance the immense extent of the lands already known .
Java the <NAME> , designated later by the names of <NAME> and <NAME> , had been seen by the <NAME> perhaps , or as is more probable by <NAME> , from 1530 to 1540 , and it was sought for by a crowd of navigators , amongst whom we may mention the <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> , and the <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> de <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> de <NAME> , who explored the greater part of the islands to the north of <NAME> , as well as that great island itself .
Afterwards come <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , upon whose deeds we shall pause a little , on account of the importance and authenticity of the discoveries which we owe to them .
<NAME> <NAME> de <NAME> was nephew to the Governor of <NAME> , <NAME> de <NAME> , who warmly advocated with the home government his nephew 's project of searching for new countries in the <NAME> .
<NAME> was one-and-twenty when he took the command of two ships and one hundred and twenty-five soldiers and sailors .
He sailed from <NAME> , the port of <NAME> , on the 19th November , 1567 .
After sighting the small <NAME> of <NAME> , he discovered on the 7th February between 7 degrees and 8 degrees south latitude , the <NAME> of <NAME> , where the <NAME> built a brigantine , with which they explored the archipelago of which this island was a part .
" The inhabitants , " says the narrative of a companion of <NAME> , " are anthropophagi , they devour those whom they can make their prisoners in war , and even without being in open hostility , those whom they can succeed in taking by treachery . "
One of the chiefs in the island sent to <NAME> as a delicacy , a quarter of a child , but the <NAME> commander caused it to be buried in the presence of the natives , who appeared much hurt by an act which they could not understand .
The <NAME> explored the <NAME> las <NAME> ( <NAME> ) , los Ramos -- so named because it was discovered on <NAME> Sunday -- <NAME> , and Buena-Vista , of which the inhabitants , under the appearance of friendship concealed hostile intentions , which were not long in displaying themselves .
The same reception awaited the Spaniards at the <NAME> , at <NAME> , and at <NAME> , upon which ginger was found for the first time .
In the return voyage to <NAME> , the <NAME> pursued a course which enabled them to discover <NAME> , where they found bats as large as kites .
Scarcely had the crew of the brigantine cast anchor in the harbour of <NAME> , than they were obliged again to weigh it , for the place was so unhealthy that five soldiers died and a great number of others were taken ill. <NAME> stopped at the <NAME> of <NAME> , where out of ten men who had landed to fetch water , one negro alone escaped from the attacks of the natives , who were extremely angry at one of their fellows having been carried off by the <NAME> .
The punishment was terrible ; twenty men were killed and a number of houses burnt .
<NAME> afterwards visited several islands of the <NAME> archipelago , amongst others the <NAME> and <NAME> .
Upon the latter island , whilst the ships were being repaired and calked , several affrays with the natives occurred , in which some prisoners were made .
After this checkered rest , <NAME> again put to sea , and visited the islands of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
But as by this time the number of invalids was considerable , the provisions and ammunition nearly exhausted , and the rigging become rotten , the flotilla now set out to return to <NAME> .
The separation of the flagship , the discovery of certain islands which it is difficult to identify , and probably of the <NAME> ; violent storms , during which the sails were carried away ; the sickness caused by the insufficiency and putrefaction of the water and biscuit on board , were all incidents signalizing this long and trying return voyage , which was ended by the arrival of the ships at the port of <NAME> in <NAME> after five months of navigation .
The narrative of <NAME> excited no enthusiasm , in spite of the name of <NAME> which he gave to the archipelago discovered by him , to make it believed that from thence came the treasures of the Jewish King .
Marvellous recitals had no longer any fascination for men glutted with the riches of <NAME> .
Proofs were what they demanded ; the smallest nugget of gold , or the least grain of silver would have been more satisfactory to them .
<NAME> had twenty-seven years to wait before he was able to organize another expedition , but then his fleet was a large one , it being proposed to found a colony in the island of <NAME> Christoval which <NAME> de <NAME> had seen during his first voyage .
Thus four ships carrying nearly four hundred people sailed from the port of <NAME> on the 11th April , 1595 .
<NAME> those on board may be named <NAME> , wife of <NAME> , the three brothers-in-law of the general , and the pilot <NAME> , who later on distinguished himself as commander-in-chief of another expedition .
The fleet did not finally leave the <NAME> coast , where its equipment had been completed , until the 16th April .
At the end of a month 's navigation , not distinguished by any remarkable incident , an island was discovered , which according to custom received the name of the saint whose day it was , and was called <NAME> .
Immediately the fleet was surrounded by a crowd of canoes bearing more than four hundred Indians , of fine stature and nearly white , and who while presenting cocoa-nuts and other fruits to the sailors , appeared to entreat them to disembark .
The natives no sooner came on board than they began to pilfer , and it was necessary to fire a cannon to get rid of them ; a wound which one of the natives received in the fray soon changed their disposition , and a discharge of musketry was the reply to the shower of arrows which they let fly from their boats .
Not far from this island three others were discovered , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , and the name of _las Marquezas de <NAME> was given to the group , in honour of the governor of <NAME> .
So friendly had been the intercourse at the beginning , that an <NAME> woman upon seeing the beautiful fair hair of <NAME> de <NAME> had begged her by signs to give her a curl of it ; but by the fault of the Spaniards the mutual relations speedily became hostile , and so continued until the day when the natives , becoming conscious of the great inferiority of their arms , begged for peace .
On the 5th August the <NAME> flotilla again put to sea and made 1200 miles west-north-west .
On the 20th August were discovered the <NAME> , since called <NAME> , and afterwards <NAME> 's <NAME> , upon which notwithstanding the scarcity of provisions , no landing was made .
After <NAME> -- a name which explains its situation -- the <NAME> archipelago was reached .
But at this time , during a storm , the flagship became separated from the fleet , and although search was made several times , no tidings of her were obtained .
<NAME> canoes , carrying a crowd of natives of a tawny complexion , or of a lustrous black , immediately approached the ships .
" All had frizzled hair , black , red , or some other colour ( for it was dyed ) ; their teeth also were dyed red ; the head was half shaven , the body was naked , except a small veil of fine linen , the face and the arms painted black , glittering and striped with various colours ; the neck and limbs loaded with several strings of small beads , of gold , or of black wood , of fishes ' teeth , or of a species of medals made of mother of pearl , or of pearls . "
For arms they carried bows , poisoned arrows with sharp points hardened in the fire , or tipped with bone and steeped in the juice of a herb , great stones , heavy wooden swords made of stiff wood , with three harpoon points , each more than a handbreadth long .
<NAME> over their shoulders they had haversacks exceedingly well made out of palm leaves , and filled with biscuits made from certain roots which serve them for food .
[ Illustration : <NAME> consults the officers . ]
At first Mendana thought he recognized in these natives the inhabitants of the islands he was seeking , but he was quickly undeceived .
The vessels were received with a shower of arrows , which was the more vexatious because <NAME> , seeing that he could not find the <NAME> , had determined to establish his colony in this archipelago .
At this juncture , discord reigned among the <NAME> ; a revolt fomented against the general was almost immediately suppressed , and the guilty were executed .
But these sorrowful events and the fatigues of the voyage had so completely undermined the health of the head of the expedition , that he died on the 17th October , after having had time to indicate his wife as his successor in the conduct of the enterprise .
After the death of Mendana the hostilities with the natives redoubled , and many of the <NAME> were so exhausted by sickness and hardships , that a score of thoroughly determined natives might easily have gained the mastery over them .
To persist in the intention of founding a settlement under such conditions would have been folly ; all agreed in this , and the anchor was raised on the 18th November .
<NAME> <NAME> de <NAME> 's project was to go to <NAME> , and there to obtain recruits from amongst the colonists , with whom she would return to found a settlement .
She consulted the officers , who all gave their approval in writing ; and she found in <NAME> a devotion and skill which were speedily to be put to a severe proof .
They at once steered away from <NAME> , in order to avoid being entangled amongst the numerous archipelagos surrounding it , and also to enable them sooner to reach the <NAME> , which the dilapidated state of the ships rendered necessary .
After passing within sight of several islands surrounded by reefs of madrepore , upon which the crews wished to land , a permission which <NAME> with great prudence always refused , after having been separated from one of the ships of the squadron , which could not or would not follow , the flotilla arrived at the <NAME> -- soon to be called the <NAME> -- Islands .
The <NAME> went on shore several times to buy some provisions ; the natives did not desire either their silver or gold , but set the highest value upon iron and all tools made of that metal .
The narrative contains here some details upon the veneration shown by the natives towards their ancestors , which are curious enough to warrant our reproducing them verbatim : " They take out the bones from the bodies of their relations , burn the flesh , and mixing the ashes with _tuba_ , a wine made from the cocoa palm , swallow them .
They weep for the dead every year for a whole week ; there are a great number of female mourners , who are to be hired for the purpose .
Besides that , all the neighbours come to weep in the house of the deceased ; the compliment being returned to them when the turn comes for the feast to take place at their house .
These anniversaries are much frequented , all those assisting at them being liberally regaled .
They weep all day and drink to intoxication all night .
They recite in the midst of tears , the life and deeds of the dead , beginning with the moment of his birth , and dealing with the whole course of his life , recounting his strength , his height , his beauty , in a word , all that can in any way do him honour .
If some amusing action occur in the recital , the company begin to laugh as if they would split their sides ; then on a sudden they drink and are again drowned in tears .
There are sometimes two hundred persons present at these absurd anniversaries . "
When the <NAME> crew arrived at the <NAME> , it was scarcely more than a company of skeletons , emaciated and half dead with hunger .
<NAME> <NAME> landed at <NAME> on the 11th February , 1596 , under a salute from the guns , and was solemnly received in the midst of the troops drawn up under arms .
The rest of the crew , fifty having died since the departure from <NAME> , were housed and fed at the public expense , and the women all found husbands in <NAME> , except four or five who embraced the religious life .
As for <NAME> , she was escorted back to Peru some time afterwards by <NAME> , who lost no time in submitting to the viceroy a project for a fresh voyage .
But <NAME> , who had succeeded <NAME> , referred the navigator to the King of <NAME> and the <NAME> of the <NAME> , under the pretext that such a decision would overstep the limits of his authority .
Quiros therefore went to <NAME> and thence to <NAME> , where he received a kindly welcome from the <NAME> , who recommended him warmly to <NAME> .
At length in 1605 , after numberless applications and solicitations , he was empowered to fit out at Lima the two vessels which he should judge the most suitable for the investigation of the <NAME> continent and for continuing the discoveries of <NAME> .
With two ships and one light vessel , <NAME> set out from <NAME> on the 21st December , 1605 .
At 3000 miles from Peru he had as yet discovered no land .
In latitude 25 degrees south he observed a group of small islands belonging to the <NAME> archipelago .
These were the <NAME> , the <NAME> , and <NAME> , so named because it was the tenth island seen .
Although this island was defended by rocks , intercourse was carried on with the natives , whose dwellings were scattered about amongst palm-trees on the sea shore .
The natives were strong and well proportioned , and their chief wore on his head a kind of crown made of small black feathers so fine and supple that they might have been taken for silk .
His fair hair , which descended to the waist , excited the wonder of the <NAME> , who , not being able to understand how a man with so tawny coloured a face could have such light yellow hair , " chose to think that he was married , and that he wore his wife 's hair . "
This singular colour was only due to the habitual use of powdered lime , which burns the hair and causes it to turn yellow .
This island to which <NAME> gave the name of <NAME> , is , according to <NAME> , <NAME> , one of the principal of the group of <NAME> .
On the succeeding days <NAME> sighted several other islands , upon which he did not land , and to which he gave names taken from the <NAME> , according to a practice which has changed all the native nomenclature of <NAME> into a veritable litany .
One island visited may be especially noticed ; it was named the island of _la Gente Hermosa_ on account of the beauty of its inhabitants , and of the fair colour and coquetry of its women , who , as the <NAME> declared , even bore away the palm for grace and attractiveness from their own fellow-countrywomen of <NAME> , whose beauty is proverbial .
This island , according to <NAME> , was situated upon the same parallel as <NAME> , to which he intended to go .
He therefore sailed westward and reached an island called by the natives <NAME> , in 10 degrees south latitude and 240 miles east of <NAME> .
This must have been one of the <NAME> , and here <NAME> was told that if he directed his course southwards , he would discover a great land , of which the inhabitants were whiter than those whom he had hitherto seen .
This information determined him to abandon his scheme of going to <NAME> .
He steered in a south-westerly direction , and after having sighted several small islands , he arrived on the 1st May , 1606 , in a bay more than twenty-four miles broad .
He gave to this island the name which it still bears , of <NAME> .
It was one of the <NAME> group .
What events happened during the stay of the ships here ?
The narrative is silent upon this subject , but we know from other sources that the crew mutinied , made <NAME> prisoner , and abandoning the second ship and the brigantine , set out on the 11th June to return to <NAME> , where they arrived on the 3rd October , 1606 , after a nine months ' voyage .
<NAME> throws no light upon this incident .
He is silent upon the mutiny of the crew , and even throws all the blame of the separation upon the commander of the second vessel , <NAME> de <NAME> , who abandoned his chief in quitting <NAME> .
Now it is known by a letter from <NAME> himself to the King of <NAME> -- published by <NAME> at the end of his <NAME> edition of <NAME> 's _History of the <NAME> -- that he remained " fifteen " days waiting for <NAME> in the <NAME> of <NAME> and <NAME> .
The officers met in council , resolved to weigh anchor on the 26th June , and to continue the search for the <NAME> continent .
Hindered by bad weather , which prevents him from sailing round <NAME> , assailed by the demands of a crew over whom prevails a slight breath of mutiny , <NAME> decides to steer to the north-east to reach the <NAME> .
In 11 degrees 30 minutes he discovers land , which he imagines must be the commencement of <NAME> .
" All this land is part of <NAME> , " says <NAME> , " it is peopled by Indians who are not very white , and who go naked , although their middles are covered with the bark of trees ... .
They fight with javelins , bucklers , and certain clubs of stone , the whole adorned with beautiful feathers .
All along this land there are other inhabited islands .
Upon the whole of this coast there are numerous and vast harbours , with very broad rivers and great plains .
Outside these islands stretch reefs and shallows ; the islands are between these dangers and the mainland , and a channel runs between .
We took possession of these harbours in your Majesty 's name .
Having pursued this coast for 900 miles , and seen our latitude decrease from 2-1/2 degrees until we found ourselves in 9 degrees , at this point commenced a shoal of from three to nine fathoms deep , which stretched along the coast to 7-1/2 degrees .
Not being able to proceed farther on account of the numerous shallows and powerful currents which we encountered , we decided to alter our course to the south-west , by the deep channel which has been mentioned , as far as about 11 degrees .
There is there , from one end to the other , an archipelago of innumerable islands , by which I passed .
At the end of the eleventh degree the bottom became deeper .
There were some very large islands there , and there appeared to be more of them towards the south ; they were inhabited by a black population , very robust and quite naked , bearing for arms , strong and long spears , arrows , and stone clubs roughly fashioned . "
<NAME> geographers are agreed in recognizing in the localities thus described , that portion of the <NAME> Coast which ends in <NAME> , and the extremity of <NAME> Guinea recently visited by <NAME> .
It was known that <NAME> had entered the strait which has been named after him , and which divides <NAME> Guinea from <NAME> ; but the very recent exploration of the south-eastern portion of <NAME> , of which the population has been discovered to be of a comparatively light colour and differing much from the <NAME> , has just furnished an unexpected confirmation of the discoveries of <NAME> .
It is for this reason that we have dwelt at some length upon them , referring for the purpose to a very learned work of M. E. T. Hamy , which appeared in the <NAME> de la <NAME> de Géographie_ .
It behoves us now to say a few words about some travellers who explored some unfrequented countries , and furnished their contemporaries with more exact knowledge of a world until then almost unknown .
The first of these travellers is <NAME> , of <NAME> .
Having embarked in 1601 on board a St. Malo ship to go to the <NAME> to trade , he was wrecked in the <NAME> .
These islets or atolls ( detached coral reefs , ) to the number of at least 12,000 , descend into the <NAME> <NAME> from <NAME> as far as the equator .
The worthy <NAME> relates his shipwreck , the flight of a portion of his companions in captivity in the archipelago , and his long sojourn of seven years upon the <NAME> , a stay rendered almost agreeable by the pains which he took to acquire the native language .
He had plenty of time to learn the manners , customs , religion , and industries of the inhabitants , as well as to study the productions and climate of the country .
Thus his narrative is filled with details of all kinds , and had retained its attractions until recent years , because travellers do not voluntarily frequent this unhealthy archipelago , the isolated situation of which had kept away foreigners and conquerors .
<NAME> 's narrative therefore , is still instructive and agreeable reading .
In 1607 , a fleet was sent to the Maldives by the King of <NAME> , in order to carry off the 100 or 120 cannon which the <NAME> sovereign owed to the wreck of numerous <NAME> vessels .
<NAME> , notwithstanding all the liberty allowed him , and that he had become a landholder , was desirous to behold his beloved <NAME> once more .
He therefore eagerly embraced this opportunity of quitting the <NAME> with the three companions who out of the whole crew alone remained with him .
But the eventful travels of <NAME> were not yet concluded .
Taken first to <NAME> , he was carried afterwards to <NAME> , and endeavoured to reach <NAME> .
Before reaching this town he was captured by the <NAME> and carried prisoner to <NAME> ; he afterwards fell ill and was nursed in the <NAME> of Goa which he only quitted to serve for two years as a soldier , at the end of which time he was again thrown into prison , and it was not until 1611 , that he was able to revisit the good town of <NAME> .
After so many trials , <NAME> must doubtless have felt the need of repose , and we are justified in imagining , from the silence of history as to the close of his life , that he was privileged at length to find happiness .
While the honest burgess <NAME> , was , so to speak , in spite of himself , and from having indulged the desire of making a fortune too rapidly , launched into adventures in which he had to pass much of his life , circumstances of a different and romantic kind caused <NAME> della <NAME> to determine upon travelling .
Descendant of an ancient and noble family , he is by turns a soldier of the <NAME> , and a sailor chasing Barbary corsairs .
Upon his return to Rome he finds that a rival , profiting by his absence , has taken his place with a young girl whom he was to have married .
So great a misfortune demands an heroic remedy , and <NAME> makes a vow of pilgrimage to the <NAME> .
But if , as saith the proverb , there is no road which does not lead to <NAME> , so there is no circuit so long as not to lead to <NAME> , and of this Della <NAME> was to make proof .
He embarks at <NAME> in 1614 , passes thirteen months at <NAME> , reaches <NAME> by sea , afterwards <NAME> , and joins a caravan which at length brings him to <NAME> .
But while en route , <NAME> had no doubt imbibed a taste for a traveller 's life , for he visits in succession <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and even pushes on as far as the ruins of <NAME> .
We must believe that <NAME> was marked out as an easy prey to love , for upon his return he becomes enamoured of a young <NAME> woman of <NAME> , of wondrous beauty , whom he marries .
One would imagine that here at length is fixed the destiny of this indefatigable traveller .
<NAME> <NAME> contrives to accompany the Shah in his war against the <NAME> , and to traverse during four consecutive years the provinces of <NAME> .
He quits <NAME> in 1621 , loses his wife in the month of December of the same year , causes her to be embalmed , and has her coffin carried about in his train for four years longer , which he devotes to exploring <NAME> , the western coasts of <NAME> , the <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , landing at length at <NAME> in The countries which this singular character visited , urged on as he was by an extraordinary enthusiasm , are described by him in a shrewd , gay , and natural style , and even with some degree of fidelity .
But he inaugurates the pleiad of amateur , curious , and commercial travellers .
He is the first of that prolific race of tourists who each year encumber geographical literature with numerous volumes , from which the savant finds nothing to glean beyond meagre details .
<NAME> is a specimen of insatiable curiosity .
At two-and-twenty he has traversed <NAME> , <NAME> , the <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
Then when <NAME> no longer offers any food for his curiosity , he starts for <NAME> , where he remains for a year , and then arrives in <NAME> , where the opportunity and <NAME> diable , aussi , le poussant , he sets to work to purchase carpets , stuffs , precious stones , and those thousand trifles of which lovers of curiosities soon became passionately fond , and for which they were ready to pay fabulous sums .
The profit which <NAME> realized from his cargo induced him to resume his travels .
But like a wise and prudent man , before starting he learnt from a jeweller the art of knowing precious stones .
During four successive journeys from 1638 to 1663 , he travelled over <NAME> , the <NAME> , the Indies as far as the frontier of <NAME> , and the <NAME> of <NAME> .
Dazzled by the immense fortune which his traffic had obtained for him , <NAME> would play the lord , and soon saw himself on the verge of ruin , which he hoped to avert by sending one of his nephews to the east with a considerable venture , but instead , his ruin was consummated by this young man , who , judging it best to appropriate the goods which had been confided to him , settled down at <NAME> .
<NAME> , who was a well-educated man , made a number of interesting observations upon the history , manners and customs , of the countries which he visited .
His narrative certainly contributed to give his contemporaries a much more correct idea of the countries of the east than they previously possessed .
All travellers during the reign of <NAME> .
take the route to the <NAME> , whatever may be the end they have in view .
<NAME> is entirely deserted , and if <NAME> be the theatre of any real exploration , it is carried out without aid from government .
<NAME> <NAME> was accomplishing his last and distant excursions , a distinguished archæologist , <NAME> de <NAME> , nephew of <NAME> Thévenot -- a learned man to whom we owe an interesting series of travels -- journeyed through <NAME> , and visited <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
He brought back in 1661 an important collection of medals and monumental inscriptions , recognized nowadays as so important a help to the historian and the philologist .
In 1664 , he set out anew for the <NAME> , and visited <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , where he saw <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
But the fatigues which he had experienced prevented his return to <NAME> , and he died in <NAME> in 1667 .
The success of his narratives was considerable , and was well deserved by the care and exactitude of a traveller whose scientific attainments in history , geography , and mathematics , far surpassed the average level of his contemporaries .
We must now speak of the amiable <NAME> , the " pretty philosopher , " as he was entitled in his polite circle , in which were found <NAME> and <NAME> , <NAME> la <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , without reckoning many other good and gay spirits , refractories from the stiff solemnity which then weighed upon the entourage of <NAME> .
<NAME> could not escape from the fashion of travelling .
After having taken a rapid survey of <NAME> and <NAME> , he resided for twelve years in <NAME> , where his good knowledge of medicine conciliated the favour of Aurung-Zebe , and gave him the opportunity of beholding in detail , and with profit , an empire then in the full bloom of its prosperity .
To the south of <NAME> , <NAME> had more than one surprise in reserve for its explorers .
<NAME> <NAME> , taken prisoner by the natives , owed to this sad circumstance his long residence in the country and the collection of the first authentic documents relating to the forests and the savage natives of <NAME> , the <NAME> , with a commercial jealousy which they were not singular in evincing , having until now kept secret all the information which had come to light concerning an island of which they were endeavouring to make a colony .
Another merchant , <NAME> , the son of a rich <NAME> jeweller , jealous of the successes of <NAME> , desired , like him , to make his fortune by trading in diamonds .
The countries which attract these merchants are those of which the fame for wealth and prosperity is become proverbial ; these are <NAME> and <NAME> , where rich costumes sparkle with jewels and gold , and where there are mines of diamonds of a fabulous size .
The moment is well chosen for visiting these countries .
<NAME> to the <NAME> , civilization and art have been developed ; mosques , palaces , temples have been built , and towns have risen suddenly .
Their taste -- that curious taste , so distinctly characterized , so different from our own , -- is displayed in the construction of gigantic edifices , quite as much as in jewellery and goldsmith 's work , and in the manufacture of those costly trifles of which the east was beginning to be passionately fond .
Like a wise man , <NAME> takes a partner , as good a connoisseur as himself .
At first Chardin only traversed <NAME> in order to reach <NAME> and to embark for the <NAME> .
The following year he returns to <NAME> , and applies himself to learn the language of the country , in order to be able to transact business directly and without any intermediary agent .
He has the good fortune to please the <NAME> , <NAME> .
From that time his fortune is made , for it is at once genteel and also the part of a prudent courtier to employ the same purveyor as his sovereign .
But <NAME> had another merit besides that of making a fortune .
He was able to collect so considerable a mass of information concerning the government , manners , creeds , customs , towns , and populations of <NAME> , that his narrative has remained to our own days the _vade-mecum_ of the traveller .
This guide is so much the more precious because <NAME> took care to engage at <NAME> a clever draughtsman named <NAME> , by whom were reproduced the monuments , cities , scenes , costumes , and ceremonies which so well portray what <NAME> called , " the every day of a people . "
When <NAME> returned to <NAME> in 1670 , the <NAME> of the <NAME> of <NAME> , with the barbarous persecutions which resulted from it , had chased from their country great numbers of artisans , who , taking refuge in foreign countries enriched them with our arts and manufactures .
<NAME> , being a protestant , clearly perceived that his religion would hinder him from attaining " to what are termed honours and advancement . "
As , to use his own words , " one is not free to believe what one will , " he resolved to return to the Indies " where , without being urged to a change of religion , " he could not fail of attaining an honourable position .
Thus liberty of conscience was at that period greater in <NAME> than in <NAME> .
Such an assertion on the part of a man who had made the comparison , is but little flattering to the grandson of <NAME> .
This time , however , <NAME> did not follow the same route as before .
He passed by <NAME> and <NAME> , and from thence , crossing the <NAME> , he landed in the <NAME> , in the garb of a religious .
<NAME> passing through the region of the Caucasus he had the opportunity of studying the Abkasians and Circassians .
He afterwards penetrated into <NAME> , where he was robbed of his goods and papers , and of a portion of the jewels which he was taking back to <NAME> .
He could not have escaped himself had it not been for the devotion to him of the theatines , from whom he had received hospitality , but he escaped only to fall into the hands of the <NAME> , who , in their turn , accepted a ransom for him .
After further misadventures he arrived at <NAME> on the 17th of December , 1672 , and as <NAME> was then governed by a prince who was a tributary of the <NAME> of <NAME> , it was easy for <NAME> to reach <NAME> , <NAME> , and finally <NAME> .
After a stay of four years in <NAME> , and a concluding journey to <NAME> , during which he realized a considerable fortune , <NAME> returned to <NAME> and settled in <NAME> , his own country on account of his religion , being forbidden ground to him .
The journal of his travels forms a large work , in which everything that concerns <NAME> is especially developed .
The long stay he made in the country and his intimate acquaintance with the highest personages of the state enabled him to collect numerous and authentic documents .
It may fairly be said that in this way <NAME> was better known in the seventeenth century than it was 100 years later .
The countries which <NAME> had just explored were visited again some years later by a <NAME> painter , <NAME> de <NAME> , or <NAME> .
The great value of his work consists in the beauty and accuracy of the drawings which illustrate it , for as far as the text is concerned , it contains nothing which was not known before , except in what relates to the <NAME> , whom he was the first to visit .
We must now speak of the <NAME> , <NAME> , almost a naturalized Swede in consequence of his long sojourn in <NAME> countries .
He refused the brilliant position which was there offered him in order to accompany as secretary , an ambassador who was going to <NAME> .
He was thus enabled to see the principal cities of <NAME> , a country which at that period had scarcely entered upon the path of western civilization ; afterwards he went to <NAME> , where he quitted the <NAME> , in order to enter the service of the <NAME> <NAME> of the <NAME> , and to continue his travels .
He thus visited in the first place <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> upon the <NAME> , where he was extremely ill , and whence he embarked in 1688 for the <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , the <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> were afterwards all visited by him .
The object of these journeys was exclusively scientific .
<NAME> was a physician , but was more especially devoted to the various branches of <NAME> , and collected , described , drew , or dried , a considerable number of plants then unknown in <NAME> , gave new information upon their use in medicine or manufactures , and collected an immense herbarium , which is now preserved with the greater part of his manuscripts in the <NAME> Museum in <NAME> .
But the most interesting portion of his narrative , now-a-days indeed quite obsolete and very incomplete since the country has been opened up to our scientific men , -- was for a long time that relating to <NAME> .
He had contrived to procure books treating of the history , literature , and learning of the country , when he had failed in obtaining from certain personages to whom he had rendered himself very acceptable , information which was not usually imparted to foreigners .
To conclude , if all the travellers of whom we have just spoken are not strictly speaking discoverers , if they do not explore countries unknown before , they all have , in various degrees and according to their ability or their studies , the merit of having rendered the countries which they visited better known .
Besides they were able to banish to the domain of fable , many of the tales which others less learned had naïvely accepted , and which had for long become so completely public property that nobody dreamed of disputing them .
<NAME> to these travellers , something is known of the history of the east , the migrations of nations began to be dimly suspected , and accounts to be given of the changes in those great empires of which the very existence had been long problematical .
<NAME> ; or a Sea-King of the <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> was born in 1612 at <NAME> , and by the death of his parents was from his childhood left to his own control .
Not possessing any great taste for study , he preferred running wild in the woods , and fighting with his companions , to remaining in his place on the school benches .
While still young he was sent to sea as cabin-boy on board merchant ships .
After a voyage to <NAME> and a campaign in the <NAME> , he took service in the <NAME> , and being wounded in a battle , returned to <NAME> to be nursed .
Free from any prejudices , <NAME> forgot his engagement when he left the Military <NAME> , and started for <NAME> in the position of manager of a plantation .
It did not require a long trial to discover that this occupation was not to his taste .
So he abandoned his negroes at the end of six months , and went on board a ship bound for the <NAME> of <NAME> , where he worked for three years at gathering in woods for dyeing .
At the end of that period he is again found in <NAME> , but the laws and the officers charged with compelling their observance are too strict for his comfort .
He goes back to <NAME> , where he speedily puts himself into communication with those famous buccaneers and corsairs , who at that time did so much harm to the <NAME> .
These English or <NAME> adventurers , established in the <NAME> of <NAME> , off the coast of <NAME> , had sworn implacable hatred to <NAME> .
Their ravages were not confined to the Gulf of <NAME> : they crossed the <NAME> of <NAME> and devastated the coast of the <NAME> from the <NAME> of <NAME> to <NAME> .
<NAME> exaggerated the exploits of these pirates , which however presented something of the marvellous .
It was amongst these adventurers , then commanded by <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , that <NAME> enrolled himself .
In 1680 we find him in <NAME> , where he pillages <NAME> , endeavours in vain to surprise <NAME> , and with his companions , on board of some wretched canoes stolen from the <NAME> , captures eight vessels well armed , which were at anchor not far from the town .
In this affair the losses of the corsairs are so great in the fight , and the spoil is so poor , that they separate from each other .
Some go back to the Gulf of <NAME> , while others establish themselves upon the island of <NAME> , whence shortly after they attack <NAME> .
But here again they were so roughly handled that a new secession takes place , and <NAME> is sent to <NAME> , where his captain hoped to make some recruits .
There Captain <NAME> was fitting out a vessel , with the intention of reaching the Pacific by the <NAME> of <NAME> , and <NAME> joins the expedition .
It begins by privateering upon the <NAME> coast , in the <NAME> de <NAME> , at <NAME> , and in the <NAME> , for this is the route habitually taken by the ships going to <NAME> .
In 36 degrees south latitude , <NAME> , who notes in his journal every interesting fact , remarks that the sea is become white or rather pale , but of this he can not explain the reason , which he might easily have done had he made use of the microscope .
The <NAME> are passed without incident , the <NAME> of <NAME> is traversed , <NAME> is doubled on the 6th February , 1684 , and as soon as he can escape from the storms which usually assail ships entering the <NAME> , <NAME> arrives at the island of <NAME> , where he hopes to revictual .
<NAME> wondered if he would find a <NAME> <NAME> there , who had been left behind in 1680 by <NAME> .
" This <NAME> had remained alone upon the island for more than three years .
He had been in the woods hunting goats when the <NAME> captain had ordered his men to re-embark , and they had set sail without perceiving his absence .
He had only his gun and his knife , with a small horn of powder and a little lead ; when his powder and lead were exhausted he had contrived to saw the barrel of his gun into small pieces with his knife , and out of them to make harpoons , spears , fish hooks and a long knife .
With these instruments he obtained all the supplies which the island afforded : goats and fish .
At the distance of half a mile from the sea , he had a small hut covered with goat skins .
He had no clothes left , but an animal 's skin covered his loins . "
We have dwelt at some length upon this involuntary hermit because he served <NAME> de Foe as the original of his " <NAME> , " a romance which has formed the delight of every child .
We shall not relate minutely all the expeditions in which <NAME> participated .
Suffice it to mention that in this campaign he visited the <NAME> .
In 1686 , <NAME> was serving on board of <NAME> 's ship , who , seeing that the greater part of his enterprises failed , went to the <NAME> , where the <NAME> were less upon their guard , and where the corsairs reckoned upon seizing the <NAME> galleon .
But when our adventurers arrived at <NAME> , they had only three days ' provisions , and the sailors had plotted if the voyage should be prolonged , to eat in turn all those who had declared themselves in favour of the voyage , and to begin with the captain who had proposed it .
<NAME> 's turn would have come next .
" Thus it came to pass , " says he very humourously , " that after having cast anchor at <NAME> , <NAME> embraced him and said : 'Ah Dampier , you would have made them but a sorry meal . '
He was right , " he adds , " for I was as thin and lean , as he was fat and plump . "
<NAME> , <NAME> , certain parts of the <NAME> coasts , the <NAME> , <NAME> , and the <NAME> , were the places visited and plundered by <NAME> in this campaign .
In the last-named archipelago he became separated from his companions , and was discovered half dead upon the coast of <NAME> .
<NAME> , you would have afforded them but a sorry meal . " ]
During this voyage , <NAME> had discovered several hitherto unknown islands , and especially the <NAME> group .
Like the thorough adventurer he was , immediately he recovered his health he travelled over the south of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , where he enrolled himself as an artilleryman in the <NAME> service .
Five months afterwards he deserted and returned to <NAME> .
The narrative of his adventures and his privateering obtained for him a certain amount of sympathy amongst the higher classes , and he was presented to the <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> .
He speedily received the command of the ship _Roebuck_ to attempt a voyage of discovery in the seas which he had already explored .
He left <NAME> on the 14th January , 1699 , with the intention of passing through the <NAME> of <NAME> , or of making the tour of <NAME> del <NAME> , so as to commence his discoveries on the coasts of the <NAME> , which had hitherto received the visits of a comparatively small number of travellers .
After crossing the line on the 10th March , he sailed for <NAME> , where the ship was revictualled .
Far from being able again to descend the coast of <NAME> , he beheld himself driven by the wind to forty-eight miles south of the Cape of <NAME> , whence he steered east-south-east towards <NAME> , a long passage which was not signalized by any adventure .
On the 1st August , <NAME> saw land , and at once sought for a harbour in which to land .
Five days later he entered the <NAME> of Sea-Dogs upon the western coast of <NAME> ; but he only found there a sterile soil , and met with neither water nor vegetation .
Until the 31st August , he sailed along this coast without discovering what he sought .
Once when he landed , he had a slight skirmish with some of the inhabitants , who seemed to be very thinly scattered over the country .
Their chief was a young man of middle height , but quick and vigilant ; his eyes were surrounded by a single ring of white paint , while a stripe of the same colour descended from the top of his forehead to the end of his nose ; his chest and arms were likewise striped with white .
His companions were black , fierce in aspect , their hair woolly , and in shape they were tall and slender .
For five weeks <NAME> hovered near land , and found neither water nor provisions ; however , he would not give in , and intended to continue to ascend the coast northwards , but the shallows which he incessantly encountered , and the monsoon from the north-west which was soon due , obliged him to give up the enterprise , after having discovered more than 900 miles of the <NAME> continent .
He afterwards steered towards <NAME> , where he intended to repose and recruit his crew , exhausted by the long voyage .
But he knew little of these parts , and his charts were quite insufficient .
He was therefore obliged to make a reconnaissance of it , as if the <NAME> had not already been long settled there .
Thus he discovered a passage between <NAME> and <NAME> , in a locality in which his map only indicated a bay .
The arrival of <NAME> in a port known only to themselves , astonished and greatly displeased the <NAME> .
They imagined that the <NAME> could only have reached it by means of charts taken on board a ship of their own .
However , in the end they recovered from their fright and received the strangers with kindness .
Although the precursors of the monsoon were making themselves felt , <NAME> again put to sea , and steered towards the western coast of <NAME> , where he arrived on the 4th February , 1700 , near to <NAME> of the <NAME> .
Amongst the things which struck him , <NAME> notices the prodigious quantities of a species of pigeon , bats of extraordinary size , and scallops , a kind of shell fish , of which the empty shell weighed as much as 258 lbs .
On the 7th of February he approaches King <NAME> 's <NAME> and runs to the east , where he soon sights the Cape of <NAME> of <NAME> , and the island named after that navigator .
On the 24th the crew witnessed a curious spectacle : " Two fish , which had accompanied the vessel for five or six days , perceived a great sea serpent , and began to pursue it .
They were about the shape and size of mackerel , but yellow and green in colour .
The serpent , who fled from them with great swiftness , carried his head out of the water , and one of them attempted to seize his tail .
As soon as he turned round , the first fish remained in the rear , and the other took his place .
They retained their wind for a long time , always heedful to defend themselves by flight , until they were lost to view . "
On the 25th , <NAME> gave the name of <NAME> to a mountainous island , thirty miles long , situated above and to the east of the <NAME> .
Further on at the distance of twenty-one or twenty-four miles , he discovered another island , which received the name of <NAME> , on account of violent whirlwinds which prevented him from landing upon it .
<NAME> believed himself to be on the coast of <NAME> , while he was in reality sailing along that of <NAME> .
He endeavoured to land there , but he was surrounded by canoes carrying more than 200 natives , and the shore was covered by a large crowd .
Seeing that it would be imprudent to send a boat on shore , <NAME> ordered the ship to be put about .
Scarcely was the order given , when the ship was assailed by showers of stones , which the natives hurled from a machine of which <NAME> could not discover the shape , but which caused the name of <NAME> ' Bay to be given to this locality .
A single discharge of cannon stupefied the natives , and put an end to hostilities .
A little further on , at some distance from the coast of <NAME> , the <NAME> discover the <NAME> of <NAME> and <NAME> .
<NAME> is the first to pass through the strait which separates <NAME> from <NAME> , and discovers <NAME> , <NAME> , G. Rook , <NAME> Reach and <NAME> .
[ Illustration : Battle in <NAME> ' Bay . ]
After this long cruise , distinguished by important discoveries , <NAME> again steered towards the west , reached <NAME> , and at length arrived at the <NAME> of <NAME> , one of the <NAME> , where he made a somewhat long stay .
He went afterwards to <NAME> , passed through the <NAME> of <NAME> , and on the 23rd of June anchored at <NAME> , in the <NAME> of <NAME> .
He remained there until the 17th of October , when he set out for <NAME> .
On arriving at the <NAME> of <NAME> on the 23rd of February , 1701 , his vessel had so considerable a leak that it was impossible to stop it .
It was necessary to run the ship aground and to put the crew and cargo on shore .
Happily there was no want of water , turtles , goats , and land-crabs , which prevented any fear of dying of hunger before some ship should call at the island , and transport the shipwrecked sailors to their country .
For this they had not long to wait , for on the 2nd of April an <NAME> vessel took them on board and carried them to <NAME> .
We shall have occasion again to speak of <NAME> with relation to the voyages of <NAME> .
<NAME> and <NAME> -- Champlain and <NAME> -- The <NAME> upon the coast of the <NAME> -- The Spaniards in <NAME> -- Summary of the information acquired at the close of the 17th century -- The measure of the terrestrial degree -- Progress of cartography -- Inauguration of <NAME> .
Although the attempts to find a passage by the north-west had been abandoned by the <NAME> for twenty years , they had not , however , given up the idea of seeking by that way , for a passage which was only to be discovered in our own days , and of which the absolute impracticability was then to be ascertained .
A clever sailor , <NAME> , of whom <NAME> says , " that never did any one better understand the seafaring profession , that his courage was equal to any emergency , and that his application was indefatigable , " concluded an agreement with a company of merchants to search for the passage by the north-west .
On the 1st of May , 1607 , he sailed from <NAME> in the <NAME> , a craft about the size of one of the smallest of modern collier brigs , and having on board a crew of twelve men ; and on the 13th of June , reached the eastern coast of <NAME> at 73 degrees , and gave it a name answering to the hopes he entertained , in calling it Cape Hold with <NAME> .
The weather here was finer and less cold than it had been ten degrees southwards .
By the 27th of June , <NAME> had advanced 5 degrees more to the north , but on the 2nd of July , by one of the sudden changes which so frequently occur in those countries , the cold became severe .
The sea , however , remained free , the air was still , and drift wood floated about in large quantity .
On the 14th of the same month , in 33 degrees 23 minutes , the master 's mate and the boatswain of the vessel landed upon a shore which formed the northern part of <NAME> .
Traces of musk oxen , and foxes , great abundance of aquatic birds , two streams of fresh water , one of them being warm , proved to our navigators that it was possible to live in these extreme latitudes at this period of the year .
<NAME> , who had re-embarked without delay , found himself arrested at the height of 82 degrees , by thick pack ice , which he endeavoured in vain to penetrate or sail round .
He was compelled to return to <NAME> , where he arrived on September 15th , after having discovered an island , which is probably that of <NAME> .
The route followed in this first voyage having had no result towards the north , <NAME> would try another , and accordingly set sail on April 21st in the following year , and advanced between <NAME> and <NAME> ; but he could only follow for a certain distance the coast of that vast land , without being able to attain as high an elevation as he had wished .
The failure of this second attempt was more complete than that of the voyage of 1607 .
In consequence , the <NAME> , which had defrayed the expenses of both attempts , declined to proceed further .
This was doubtless the reason which decided <NAME> to take service in <NAME> .
The <NAME> of <NAME> gave him , in 1609 , the command of a vessel , with which he set sail from the <NAME> at the beginning of the year .
Having doubled the <NAME> , he advanced along the coasts of <NAME> ; but his crew , composed of <NAME> and <NAME> , who had made voyages to the <NAME> Indies , were soon disheartened by the cold and ice .
<NAME> found himself forced to change his route , and to propose to his sailors , who were in open mutiny , to seek for a passage , either by <NAME> ' <NAME> , or the coasts of <NAME> , where , according to the information of <NAME> , who had frequently visited them , an outlet must surely be found .
The choice of this crew , little accustomed to discipline , could not be doubtful .
In order not to render the outlay of the <NAME> completely abortive , <NAME> was obliged to make for the <NAME> , to descend southward as low as 44 degrees , and to search on the coast of <NAME> for the strait , of the existence of which he had been assured .
On July 18th , he disembarked on the continent , in order to replace his foremast , which had been broken in a storm ; and he took the opportunity of bartering furs with the natives .
But his undisciplined sailors , having by their exactions roused the indignation of the poor and peaceable natives , compelled him again to set sail .
He continued to follow the coast until August 3rd , and then landed a second time .
At 40 degrees 30 minutes , he discovered a great bay which he explored in a canoe for more than 150 miles .
In the meantime , his provisions began to run short , and it was impossible to procure supplies on land .
The crew , which appears to have imposed its wishes on its captain during this whole voyage , assembled ; some proposed to winter in <NAME> , in order to resume the search for the passage in the following year ; others wished to make for <NAME> .
This latter proposition was adopted ; but when they approached the shores of <NAME> , the land proved so attractive to his men , that <NAME> was obliged , on November 7th , to cast anchor at <NAME> .
The following year , 1610 , notwithstanding all the mortifications which he had experienced , <NAME> tried to renew his engagement with the <NAME> company .
But the terms which they named as the price of their concurrence compelled him to renounce the project , and induced him to submit to the requirements of the <NAME> .
This company imposed on <NAME> as a condition , that he should carry on board , rather as an assistant than as a subordinate , a clever seaman , named <NAME> , in whom they had full confidence .
It is easy to understand how mortifying this condition was to <NAME> .
Accordingly , he took the earliest opportunity of ridding himself of the superintendent who had been imposed upon him .
He had not yet left the Thames when he sent <NAME> back to shore with a letter for the <NAME> , in which he endeavoured to palliate and justify this certainly very strange proceeding .
Towards the end of May , when the ship had cast anchor in one of the ports of the island , the crew formed on the subject of <NAME> , its first conspiracy , which was repressed without difficulty , and when <NAME> quitted the island on June 1st , he had re-established his authority .
After having passed <NAME> 's <NAME> , he sighted the land of Desolation of <NAME> , entered the strait which has received his name , and speedily penetrated into a wide bay , the entire western coast of which he examined until the beginning of September .
At this epoch , one of the inferior officers , continuing to excite revolt against his chief , was superseded ; but this act of justice only exasperated the sailors .
In the early part of November , <NAME> , having arrived at the extremity of the bay , sought for an appropriate spot to winter in , and having soon found one , drew up the ship on dry land .
It is difficult to understand such a resolution .
On the one hand , <NAME> had left <NAME> with provisions for six months only , which had already been largely reduced , and he could scarcely reckon , considering the barrenness of the country , upon procuring a further supply of nourishment ; on the other , the crew had exhibited such numerous signs of mutiny , that he could hardly rely upon its discipline and good will .
Nevertheless , although the English were often obliged to content themselves with scanty rations , they did not , owing to the arrival of great numbers of birds , pass a very distressing winter .
But , on the return of spring , as soon as the ship was prepared to resume her route to <NAME> , <NAME> found that his fate was decided .
He made his arrangements accordingly , distributed to each his share of biscuit , paid the wages due , and awaited the course of events .
He had not long to wait .
The conspirators seized their captain , his son , a volunteer , the carpenter , and five sailors , put them on board a boat , without arms , provisions , or instruments , and abandoned them to the mercy of the ocean .
The culprits reached <NAME> again , but not all ; two were killed in an encounter with the <NAME> , another died of sickness , while the others were sorely tried by famine .
Eventually , no prosecution was commenced against them .
Only , the <NAME> , in 1674 , procured employment , on board a vessel , for the son of <NAME> , " lost in the discovery of the North-west , " the son being entirely destitute of resources .
[ Illustration : <NAME> abandoned by his crew . ]
The expeditions of <NAME> were followed by those of <NAME> and of <NAME> , to whom we owe , if not new discoveries , important observations on the tides , the variation of the weather and the temperature , and on a number of natural phenomena .
In 1615 , the <NAME> entrusted to <NAME> , who had taken part in the last voyages , the command of a vessel of fifty tons .
Her name , the <NAME> , was of good augury .
She carried , as pilot , the famous <NAME> , whose renown has eclipsed that of his captain .
Setting sail from <NAME> on April 13th , the <NAME> explorers sighted <NAME> by the 6th of May , passed from the <NAME> of Desolation to the <NAME> , where they met with a great number of natives , and ascended north-westward as high as 64 degrees .
On July 10th , land appeared on the starboard , and the tide flowed from the north ; from which they conceived so much hope of the passage sought for , that they gave to the cape , discovered on this spot , the name of <NAME> .
It was probably <NAME> , for they ascertained , after doubling it , that the land inclined towards the north-east , and the east .
It was at the entry of <NAME> ' <NAME> , that their discoveries came to an end for this year .
They returned to <NAME> on September 9th , without having lost a single man .
So strong were the hopes entertained by <NAME> and <NAME> , that they obtained permission to put to sea again in the same vessel the following year .
On May 14th , 1616 , after a voyage in which nothing worthy of remark occurred , the two captains penetrated into <NAME> ' <NAME> , sighted <NAME> 's <NAME> , the extreme point formerly reached by <NAME> , and ascended as high as 72 degrees 40 minutes to the <NAME> 's <NAME> , thus named after some Esquimaux females whom they met with .
On June 12th , <NAME> and <NAME> were forced by the ice to enter a bay on the coast .
Some <NAME> brought them a great quantity of horns , without doubt tusks of walruses , or horns of musk oxen ; from which they named the bay <NAME> .
After remaining some days in this place , they were able to put to sea again .
On setting out from 75 degrees 40 minutes , they encountered a vast expanse of water free from ice , and penetrated , without much danger , beyond the 78 degree of latitude , to the entrance of the strait , which prolonged northwards the immense bay which they had just traversed , and which received the name of <NAME> .
Then turning to the west , and afterwards to the south-west , <NAME> and <NAME> discovered the <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , and afterwards they descended along the entire western shore of <NAME> 's Bay as far as <NAME> .
Despairing then of being able to carry his discoveries further , <NAME> , who had several men among his crew afflicted with scurvy , found himself obliged to return to the shores of <NAME> , where he disembarked at <NAME> , on August 30th .
If this expedition terminated again in failure , in the sense that the north-west passage was not discovered , the results obtained were nevertheless considerable .
<NAME> and <NAME> had prodigiously increased the knowledge of the seas and coasts in the quarters of <NAME> .
The captain and the pilot , in writing to the Director of the <NAME> , assured him that the bay which they had visited was an excellent spot for fishing , in which thousands of whales , seals , and walruses , disported themselves .
The event could not be long in amply proving the correctness of this information .
Let us now descend again upon the coast of <NAME> , as far as <NAME> , and see what had happened since the time of <NAME> .
This latter , we may remember , had made an attempt at colonization , which had not produced any important results .
Nevertheless , some Frenchmen had remained in the country , had married there , and founded families of colonists .
From time to time , they received reinforcements brought by fishing vessels from <NAME> or <NAME> .
But it was difficult to establish a current of emigration .
It was under these circumstances that a gentleman , named <NAME> de Champlain , a veteran of the wars of <NAME> , and who , for two years and a half , had frequented the <NAME> , was engaged by the <NAME> of <NAME> with the <NAME> de <NAME> , to continue the discoveries of <NAME> , and to choose the situations most favourable for the establishment of towns and centres of population .
This is not the place for us to consider the manner in which <NAME> understood the business of a colonizer , nor his great services , which might well entitle him to be called the father of <NAME> .
We will , therefore , advisedly leave this aspect of his undertaking , not the least brilliant , in order simply to occupy ourselves with the discoveries which he effected in the interior of the continent .
Setting sail from <NAME> , on March 15th , 1603 , the two chiefs of the enterprise first ascended the <NAME> , as far as the harbour of <NAME> , 240 miles from its mouth .
They were welcomed by the populations , which had , however , " neither faith , nor law , and lived without God , and without religion , like brute beasts . "
At this place they quitted their ships , which could not have advanced further without danger , and reached in a boat the <NAME> , where <NAME> had been stopped ; they even penetrated a little into the interior , and then returned to <NAME> , where <NAME> printed a narrative of the voyage for the king .
resolved to continue the enterprise .
In the meantime M. de Chastes having died , his privilege was transferred to M. de <NAME> , with the title of Vice-admiral and Governor of <NAME> .
<NAME> accompanied M. de <NAME> to <NAME> , and passed three whole years , whether in aiding by his counsels and his exertions the efforts of colonization , or in exploring the coasts of <NAME> , the bearings of which he took beyond <NAME> , or in making excursions into the interior and visiting the savage tribes which it was important to conciliate .
In 1607 , after a new voyage to <NAME> to recruit colonists , <NAME> returned again to <NAME> , and founded , in 1608 , a town which was to become <NAME> .
The following year was devoted to again ascending the <NAME> , and ascertaining its course .
On board of a pirogue , with two companions only , <NAME> penetrated , with some Algonquins , to the <NAME> , and remained conqueror in a great battle fought on the borders of a lake which has received his name ; he then descended the river <NAME> , as far as the <NAME> .
In 1610 , he made a fresh incursion into the territory of the <NAME> , at the head of his allies , the <NAME> , whom he had the greatest possible difficulty in making observe the <NAME> discipline .
In this campaign he employed instruments of warfare which greatly astonished the savages , and easily secured him the victory .
For the attack of a village , he constructed a cavalier of wood , which 200 of the most powerful men " carried before this village to within a pike 's length , and displayed three arquebusiers well protected from the arrows and stones which might be shot or launched at them . "
A little later , we see him exploring the river <NAME> , and advancing , in the north of the continent , to within 225 miles of <NAME> 's Bay .
After having fortified <NAME> , in 1615 , he twice ascended the <NAME> , explored <NAME> , and arrived by land at <NAME> , which he crossed .
[ Illustration : Siege of a village by <NAME> . ]
It is very difficult to divide into two parts a life so occupied as <NAME> 's .
All his excursions , all his reconnaissances , had but one object , the development of the work to which he had consecrated his existence .
Thus detached from what gives them their interest , they appear to us unimportant ; and yet if the colonial policy of <NAME> .
and his successor had been different , we should possess in <NAME> a colony which assuredly would not yield in prosperity to the <NAME> .
Notwithstanding our abandonment , <NAME> has preserved a fervent love for the mother country .
We must now leap over a period of forty years , to arrive at <NAME> de la Sale .
During this time , the <NAME> establishments have acquired some importance in <NAME> , and have extended themselves over a great part of <NAME> .
Our hunters and trappers scour the woods , and bring , every year , with their load of furs , new information respecting the interior of the continent .
In this latter task they are powerfully seconded by the missionaries , in the first rank of whom we must place <NAME> , whom the extent of his voyages on the great lakes and as far as the <NAME> marks out for special acknowledgment .
Two men , besides , deserve to be mentioned for the encouragements and facilities which they afforded to the explorers , viz. , M. de Frontenac , Governor of <NAME> , and <NAME> , intendant of justice and police .
In 1678 , there arrived in <NAME> , without any settled purpose , a young man named <NAME> de la Sale .
" He was born at <NAME> , " says <NAME> , " of a family in easy circumstances ; but having passed some years with the Jesuits , he had had no share in the inheritance of his parents .
He had a cultivated mind , he wished to distinguish himself , and he felt within himself sufficient genius and courage to ensure success .
In reality , he was not deficient in resolution to enter upon , nor in perseverance to follow up , an undertaking , nor in firmness in contending against obstacles , nor in resource to repair his losses ; but he knew not how to make himself loved , nor how to manage those of whom he stood in need , and when he had attained authority , he exercised it with harshness and arrogance .
With such defects he could not be happy , and in fact he was not . "
<NAME> <NAME> 's portrait appears to us somewhat too black , and he does not seem to estimate at its true value the great discovery which we owe to <NAME> la Sale ; a discovery , which has nothing like it , we do not say equal to it , except that of the river <NAME> , by <NAME> , in the 16th century , and that of the <NAME> , by <NAME> , in the 19th .
However this may be , no sooner had he arrived in the country , than he set himself , with extraordinary application , to study the native idioms , and to associate with the savages in order to render himself familiar with their manners and habits .
At the same time he gathered from the trappers a mass of information on the situation of the rivers and lakes .
He communicated his projects of exploration to M. de Frontenac , who encouraged him , and gave him the command of a fort constructed at the outlet of the lake into the <NAME> .
In the meantime , one <NAME> arrived at <NAME> .
He brought the news that in company with <NAME> and four other persons , he had reached a great river called the <NAME> , flowing towards the south .
<NAME> de la <NAME> very soon understood what advantage might be derived from an artery of this importance , especially if the <NAME> had , as he believed , its mouth in the Gulf of <NAME> .
By the lakes and the <NAME> , an affluent of the <NAME> , it was easy to effect a communication between the <NAME> , and the <NAME> of the <NAME> .
What marvellous profit would <NAME> derive from this discovery !
<NAME> <NAME> explained the project which he had conceived to the Count of <NAME> , and obtained from him very pressing letters of recommendation to the Minister of <NAME> .
On arriving in <NAME> , <NAME> learned the death of <NAME> ; but he remitted to his son , the <NAME> of <NAME> , who had succeeded him , the despatches of which he was the bearer .
This project , which appeared to rest upon solid foundations , could not fail to please a young minister .
Accordingly , <NAME> presented <NAME> to the king , who caused letters of nobility to be prepared for him , granted him the <NAME> of <NAME> , and the government of the fort which he had built , with the monopoly of commerce in the countries which he might discover .
<NAME> <NAME> had also found means to procure the patronage of the <NAME> de Conti , who asked him to take with him the <NAME> , son of the inventor of the <NAME> , in whom he felt an interest .
He was for <NAME> a precious acquisition .
<NAME> , who had made a campaign in <NAME> , where his hand had been carried off by the explosion of a grenade , was a brave and skilful officer , who always showed himself extremely devoted .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> embarked at <NAME> , on July 14th , 1678 , carrying with them about thirty men , workmen and soldiers , and a <NAME> ( monk ) , <NAME> , who accompanied them in all their voyages .
Then <NAME> , being conscious that the execution of his project required more considerable resources than those which were at his disposal , constructed a boat upon the <NAME> , and devoted a whole year to scouring the country , visiting the <NAME> , and carrying on an active trade in furs , which he stored in his fort of <NAME> , while <NAME> pursued the same course in other directions .
At length , towards the middle of <NAME> , of the year 1679 , his boat , the <NAME> , being prepared for sailing , he embarked on the <NAME> , with thirty men , and three Fathers , <NAME> , for <NAME> .
In crossing the lakes St. Clair and <NAME> , he experienced a violent storm , which caused the desertion of some of his people , whom , however , <NAME> brought back to him .
<NAME> <NAME> arrived at <NAME> , and very soon entered the <NAME> .
But during this time his creditors at <NAME> had sold all that he possessed , and the <NAME> , which he had despatched , laden with furs , to the fort of <NAME> , was either lost or pillaged by the <NAME> ; which of these took place has never been precisely ascertained .
For himself , although the departure of the <NAME> had displeased his companions , he continued his route , and reached the river St. Joseph , where he found an encampment of <NAME> , and where <NAME> speedily rejoined him .
Their first care was to construct a fort on this spot .
Then they crossed the dividing line of the water between the basin of the great lakes , and that of the <NAME> ; they subsequently reached the river of the <NAME> , an affluent on the left of that great river .
With his small band of followers , upon whose fidelity he could not entirely depend , the situation of <NAME> was critical , in the midst of an unknown country , and among a powerful nation , the <NAME> , who , at first allies of <NAME> , had been prejudiced and excited against us by the <NAME> and the <NAME> , jealous of the progress of the <NAME> colony .
Nevertheless , it was necessary , at all cost , to attach to himself these Indians , who from their situation , were able to hinder all communication between <NAME> and <NAME> .
In order to strike their imagination , <NAME> la Sale proceeds to their encampment , where more than 3000 men are assembled .
He has but twenty men , but he traverses their village haughtily , and stops at some distance .
The <NAME> , who have not yet declared war , are surprised .
They advance towards him , and overwhelm him with pacific demonstrations .
So versatile is the spirit of the savages !
Such an impression does every mark of courage make upon them !
Without delay , <NAME> takes advantage of their friendly dispositions , and erects upon the very site of their camp , a small fort , which he calls <NAME> , in allusion to the troubles which he has already experienced .
There he leaves <NAME> with all his people , and he himself , anxious about the fate of the <NAME> , returns with three Frenchmen and one <NAME> , to the fort of <NAME> , separated by 500 leagues from <NAME> .
Before setting out , he had detached with <NAME> , one of his companions named <NAME> , on a mission to reascend the <NAME> beyond the river of the <NAME> , and if possible , to its source .
" These two travellers , " says <NAME> , " set out from the fort of <NAME> , on February 28th , and having entered the <NAME> , ascended it as far as 46 degrees of north latitude .
There they were stopped by a considerable waterfall , extending quite across the river , to which <NAME> gave the name of <NAME> Anthony of <NAME> .
Then they fell , I know not by what mischance , into the hands of the <NAME> , who kept them for a long time prisoners . "
On his journey back to <NAME> , <NAME> , having discovered a new site appropriate to the construction of a fort , summoned <NAME> thither , who immediately set to work , while <NAME> continued his route .
This is <NAME> .
On his arrival at <NAME> , <NAME> learned news which would have broken down a man of a less hardy temperament .
Not only had the <NAME> , on board of which he had furs of the value of 10,000 crowns , been lost , but a vessel which was bringing him from <NAME> a cargo worth 880_l._ had been shipwrecked , and his enemies had spread a report of his death .
Having no further business at <NAME> , and having proved by his presence that the reports of his disappearance were all false , he arrived again at the fort of <NAME> , where he was much astonished to find no one .
This is what had happened .
While the <NAME> was employed in the construction of <NAME> , the garrison of <NAME> had mutinied , had pillaged the magazines , had done the same at <NAME> , and then fled to <NAME> .
<NAME> , almost alone in face of the <NAME> , who were roused against him by the depredations of his men , and judging that he could not resist in his fort of <NAME> , had left it on September 11th , 1680 , with the five Frenchmen who composed his garrison , and had retired as far as the bay of the <NAME> .
After having placed a garrison at <NAME> and at <NAME> , <NAME> came to <NAME> , where he rejoined <NAME> , and together they set out again from thence towards the end of August for <NAME> , whence they embarked on the <NAME> with fifty-five persons , on August 28th , 1681 .
After a journey of 240 miles along the frozen river of the <NAME> , they reached <NAME> , where the water , free from ice , permitted the use of their canoes .
On February 6th , 1682 , <NAME> arrived at the confluence of the <NAME> and the <NAME> .
He descended the river , sighted the mouth of the <NAME> , and that of the <NAME> , where he raised a fort , penetrated into the country of the <NAME> , of which he took possession in the name of <NAME> , crossed the country of the <NAME> , with whom he made a treaty of friendship , and finally passed out into the Gulf of <NAME> on April 9th , after a navigation of 1050 miles in a mere bark .
The anticipations so skilfully conceived by <NAME> la <NAME> , were realized .
He immediately took formal possession of the country , to which he gave the name of <NAME> , and called the immense river which he had just discovered the <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> 's return to <NAME> occupied not less than one year and a half .
There is no ground for astonishment , when all the obstacles scattered in his path are considered .
What energy , what strength of mind were requisite in one of the greatest travellers of whom <NAME> has reason to be proud , to succeed in such an enterprise !
Unhappily , a man , otherwise well intentioned , but who allowed himself to be prejudiced against <NAME> by his numerous enemies , M. Lefèvre de la <NAME> , who had succeeded M. de Frontenac as governor of <NAME> , wrote to the Minister of <NAME> , that the discoveries of <NAME> were not to be regarded as of much importance .
" This traveller , " he said " was actually , with about twenty <NAME> vagabonds and savages , at the extremity of the bay , where he played the part of sovereign , plundered and ransomed those of his own nation , exposed the people to the incursions of the <NAME> , and covered all these acts of violence with the pretext of the permission , which he had from His Majesty , to carry on commerce alone in the countries which he might be able to discover . "
<NAME> de la <NAME> could not allow himself to remain exposed to these calumnious imputations .
On the one side , honour prompted him to return to <NAME> to exculpate himself ; on the other , he would not leave others to reap the profit of his discoveries .
He set out , therefore , and received from <NAME> a kindly welcome .
The minister had not been much influenced by the letters of M. de la <NAME> ; he was aware that men could not accomplish great achievements without wounding much self-love , nor without making numerous enemies .
<NAME> <NAME> took the opportunity to explain to him his project of discovering the mouth of the Mississippi by sea , in order to open a way for <NAME> vessels , and to found an establishment there .
The minister entered into these views , and gave him a commission which placed <NAME> and savages under his orders , from <NAME> to the sea .
At the same time the commandant of the squadron which was to transport him to <NAME> , was to be under his authority , and to furnish him on his disembarkation with all the succours which he might require , provided that nothing was done to the prejudice of the king .
Four vessels , one of them a frigate of forty guns , commanded by M. de <NAME> were to carry 280 persons , including the crews , to the mouth of the <NAME> , to form the nucleus of the new colony .
Soldiers and artisans had been very badly chosen , as was perceived when too late , and no one knew his business .
Setting sail from <NAME> , on July 24th , 1684 , the little squadron was almost immediately obliged to return to port , the bowsprit of the frigate having broken suddenly in the very finest weather .
This inexplicable accident was the commencement of misunderstanding between M. de Beaujeu and M. de la Sale .
The former could scarcely be pleased to see himself subordinated to a private individual , and did not forgive Cavelier this .
Nothing however would have been more easy than to decline the command .
<NAME> <NAME> had not the gentleness of manner and the politeness necessary to conciliate his companions .
The disagreement did but gather force during the voyage by reason of the obstacles raised by M. de <NAME> to the rapidity and secrecy of the expedition .
The annoyances of <NAME> had indeed become so great when he arrived at <NAME> , that he fell seriously ill .
He recovered , however , and the expedition set sail again on November 25th .
A month later , it was off <NAME> ; but , as " La <NAME> had been assured that in the Gulf of <NAME> , all the currents bore eastwards , he did not doubt that the mouth of the <NAME> must be far to the west ; an error which was the source of all his misfortunes . "
<NAME> <NAME> then steered to the west , and passed by , without perceiving it , without deigning even to attend to certain signs which he was asked to observe , the mouth of the <NAME> .
When he perceived his mistake , and entreated M. de <NAME> to turn back , the latter would no longer consent .
<NAME> <NAME> , seeing that he could make no impression upon the contradictory mind of his companion , decided to disembark his men and his provisions in the <NAME> of <NAME> .
Yet , in this very last act , <NAME> manifested an amount of culpable ill-will , which did as little honour to his judgment as to his patriotism .
Not only was he unwilling to land all the provisions , under the pretext that certain of them being at the bottom of the hold , he had no time to change his stowage , but further he gave shelter on board his own ship to the master and crew of the transport , laden with the stores , utensils , and implements necessary for a new establishment , people whom everything seems to convict of having purposely cast their vessel upon shore .
At the same time , a number of savages took advantage of the disorder caused by the shipwreck of the transport , to plunder everything on which they could lay their hands .
Nevertheless , <NAME> , who had the talent of never appearing depressed by misfortune , and who found in his own genius resources adapted to the circumstances of the case , ordered the works of the establishment to be begun .
In order to give courage to his companions , he more than once took part with his own hands in the work ; but very slow progress was made , in consequence of the ignorance of the workmen .
<NAME> with the resemblance of the language and habits of the Indians of these parts to those of the <NAME> , <NAME> was very soon persuaded that he was not far distant from that river , and made several excursions in order to approach it .
But , if he found a country beautiful and fertile , he did not make progress towards what he was in search of .
He returned each time to the fort more gloomy and more harsh ; and this was not the way to restore calm to spirits embittered by sufferings and the inutility of their efforts .
<NAME> had been sown ; but scarcely any came up for want of rain , and what had sprung up was soon laid waste by the savages and the deer .
The hunters who wandered far from the camp were massacred by the <NAME> , and sickness found an easy prey in men overwhelmed with ennui , disappointment , and misery .
In a short time , the number of the colonists fell to thirty-seven .
At length , <NAME> resolved to try a last effort to reach the <NAME> , and in descending the river to seek help from the nations with which he had made alliance .
He set out on January 12th , 1687 , with his brother , his two nephews , two missionaries , and twelve colonists .
He was approaching the country of the <NAME> , when , in consequence of an altercation between one of his nephews and three of his companions , these latter assassinated the young man and his servant during their sleep , and resolved immediately to do the same with the chief of the enterprise .
<NAME> la <NAME> , uneasy at not seeing his nephew return , set out to seek him on the morning of the 19th , with <NAME> .
The assassins , seeing him approach , lay in ambush in a thicket , and one of them shot him in the head , and stretched him on the ground stark dead .
Thus perished <NAME> de la <NAME> , " a man of a capacity , " says <NAME> , " of a largeness of mind , of a courage and firmness of soul , which might have led him to the achievement of something great , if with so many great qualities , he had known how to master his gloomy and atrabilious disposition , and to soften the severity or rather the harshness of his nature ... . " Many calumnies had been spread abroad against him ; but it is necessary so much the more to be on our guard against all these malevolent reports " as it is only too common to exaggerate the defects of the unfortunate , to impute to them even some which they had not , especially when they have given occasion for their misfortune , and have not known how to make themselves beloved .
What is sadder for the memory of this celebrated man , is that he has been regretted by few persons , and that the ill-success of his undertakings -- only of his last -- has given him the air of an adventurer , among those who judge only by appearances .
Unhappily , these are usually the most numerous , and in some degree the voice of the public . "
[ Illustration : Assassination of <NAME> . ]
We have but little to add to these last wise words .
<NAME> <NAME> knew not how to obtain pardon for his first success .
We have related subsequently by what concurrence of circumstances his second enterprise miscarried .
He died , the victim it may be said , of the jealousy and malevolence of the <NAME> de <NAME> .
It is to this slight cause that we owe the failure to found in <NAME> a powerful colony , which would very soon have been found in a condition to compete with the <NAME> establishments .
We have narrated the beginning of the <NAME> colonies .
The events which took place in <NAME> were highly favourable to them .
The religious persecutions , the revolutions of 1648 and 1688 , furnished numerous recruits , who , animated by an excellent spirit , set themselves to work , and transported to the other side of the Atlantic the arts , the industry , and in a short time the prosperity , of the mother country .
Very soon , the immense forests which covered <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , fell beneath the hatchet of the " Squatter , " and the soil became cleared , while the hunters of the woods , driving back the <NAME> , made the interior of the country better known , and prepared the work of civilization .
In <NAME> , in the whole of <NAME> , in <NAME> , in <NAME> , and on the shores of the <NAME> , a different state of things prevailed .
The <NAME> had extended their conquests ; but , far from acting like the <NAME> , they had reduced the <NAME> to slavery .
Instead of applying themselves to the cultivation appropriate to the variety of the climates and of the countries of which they had made themselves masters , they sought only in the produce of the mines the resources and prosperity which they should have endeavoured to obtain from the land .
If a country can thus rapidly attain prodigious wealth , yet this factitious system can not last long .
With the mines a prosperity which does not renew itself , must ere long become exhausted .
The <NAME> could not fail to experience the sad result .
Thus then , at the end of the seventeenth century , a great part of the new world was known .
In <NAME> , <NAME> , the shores of the <NAME> and of the Gulf of <NAME> , the valley of the <NAME> , the coasts of <NAME> and of <NAME> , were discovered or colonized .
All the central part of the continent , from <NAME> del <NAME> , as far as <NAME> , was subject , at least nominally , to the <NAME> .
In the south , the savannahs and the forests of <NAME> , the pampas of the <NAME> , and the interior of <NAME> , escaped the observation of the explorers , as they were destined to do for a long time yet .
In <NAME> , the long line of coasts , which are washed by the <NAME> and the <NAME> , had been patiently followed and observed by navigators .
At some points only , colonists and missionaries had tried to penetrate the mystery of this vast continent .
<NAME> , <NAME> , the valley of the Nile , and <NAME> , were all that were known with some degree of detail and of certainty .
If many of the countries of <NAME> , surveyed by the travellers of the middle ages , had not been revisited since that epoch , we had carefully explored the whole anterior part of that continent , <NAME> had been revealed to us , we had even founded some establishments there , <NAME> had been touched by our missionaries , and <NAME> , that famous Cipango which had exercised so great an attraction for our travellers of the preceding age , was at length known to us .
Only <NAME> and the whole north-east angle of <NAME> had escaped our investigations , and it was not yet known whether <NAME> was not connected with <NAME> , a mystery which was before long to be cleared up .
In <NAME> , a number of archipelagos , of islands and separate islets , remained still to be discovered , but the islands of <NAME> were colonized , the coasts of <NAME> and of <NAME> had been partially revealed , and the existence of that great continent which , according to <NAME> , extended from <NAME> del <NAME> to <NAME> , began to be doubted ; but it still required the long and careful researches of <NAME> to banish definitely into the domain of fable a chimera so long cherished .
<NAME> was on the point of transforming itself .
The great discoveries made in astronomy were about to be applied to geography .
The labours of <NAME> and above all of <NAME> , upon the measure of a terrestrial degree between <NAME> and <NAME> , had made it clear that the globe is not a sphere , but a spheroid , that is to say , a ball flattened at the poles and swollen at the equator , and thus were found at one stroke the form and the dimensions of the world which we inhabit .
At length the labours of <NAME> , continued by <NAME> and <NAME> , were completed at the commencement of the following century .
The astronomical observations , rendered possible by the calculation of the satellites of <NAME> , enabled us to rectify our maps .
If this rectification had been already effected with regard to certain places , it became indispensable when the number of points of which the astronomical position had been observed , had been considerably increased ; and this was to be the work of the next century .
At the same time , historical geography was more studied ; it began to take for its foundation the study of inscriptions , and archæology was about to become one of the most useful instruments of comparative geography .
In a word , the seventeenth century is an epoch of transition and of progress ; it seeks and it finds the powerful means which its successor , the eighteenth century , was destined to put into operation .
The era of the sciences has already opened , and with it the modern world commences .
End of <NAME> 's <NAME> and <NAME> , by <NAME>
