CHAPTER I.
THE FORWARD.


"To-morrow, at the turn of the tide, the brig _Forward_, K. Z.,
captain, Richard Shandon, mate, will clear from New Prince's Docks;
destination unknown."

This announcement appeared in the _Liverpool Herald_ of April 5, 1860.

The sailing of a brig is not a matter of great importance for the
chief commercial city of England. Who would take notice of it in so
great a throng of ships of all sizes and of every country, that
dry-docks covering two leagues scarcely contain them?

Nevertheless, from early morning on the 6th of April, a large crowd
collected on the quays of the New Prince's Docks; all the sailors of
the place seemed to have assembled there. The workingmen of the
neighboring wharves had abandoned their tasks, tradesmen had left
their gloomy shops, and the merchants their empty warehouses. The
many-colored omnibuses which pass outside of the docks were
discharging, every minute, their load of sight-seers; the whole city
seemed to care for nothing except watching the departure of the
_Forward_.

The _Forward_ was a vessel of one hundred and seventy tons, rigged as
a brig, and carrying a screw and a steam-engine of one hundred and
twenty horse-power. One would have very easily confounded it with the
other brigs in the harbor. But if it presented no especial difference
to the eye of the public, yet those who were familiar with ships
noticed certain peculiarities which could not escape a sailor's keen
glance.

Thus, on the _Nautilus_, which was lying at anchor near her, a group
of sailors were trying to make out the probable destination of the
_Forward_.

[Illustration]

"What do you say to her masts?" said one; "steamers don't usually
carry so much sail."

"It must be," answered a red-faced quartermaster, "that she relies
more on her sails than on her engine; and if her topsails are of that
size, it's probably because the lower sails are to be laid back. So
I'm sure the _Forward_ is going either to the Arctic or Antarctic
Ocean, where the icebergs stop the wind more than suits a solid ship."

"You must be right, Mr. Cornhill," said a third sailor. "Do you notice
how straight her stem is?"

"Besides," said Mr. Cornhill, "she carries a steel ram forward, as
sharp as a razor; if the _Forward_, going at full speed, should run
into a three-decker, she would cut her in two."

"That's true," answered a Mersey pilot, "for that brig can easily run
fourteen knots under steam. She was a sight to see on her trial trip.
On my word, she's a swift boat."

"And she goes well, too, under sail," continued the quartermaster;
"close to the wind, and she's easily steered. Now that ship is going
to the polar seas, or my name is not Cornhill. And then, see there! Do
you notice that large helm-port over the head of her rudder?"

"That's so," said some of the sailors; "but what does that prove?"

"That proves, my men," replied the quartermaster with a scornful
smile, "that you can neither see nor think; it proves that they wanted
to leave the head of the rudder free, so that it might be unshipped
and shipped again easily. Don't you know that's what they have to do
very often in the ice?"

"You are right," answered the sailors of the _Nautilus_.

"And besides," said one, "the lading of the brig goes to prove what
Mr. Cornhill has said. I heard it from Clifton, who has shipped on
her. The _Forward_ carries provisions for five or six years, and coal
in proportion. Coal and provisions are all she carries, and a quantity
of woollen and sealskin clothing."

"Well," said Mr. Cornhill, "there's no doubt about it. But, my friend,
since you know Clifton, hasn't he told you where she's bound?"

"He couldn't tell me, for he didn't know; the whole crew was shipped
in that way. Where is he going? He won't know till he gets there."

"Nor yet if they are going to Davy Jones's locker," said one scoffer,
"as it seems to me they are."

"But then, their pay," continued the friend of Clifton
enthusiastically,--"their pay! it's five times what a sailor usually
gets. If it had not been for that, Richard Shandon would not have got
a man. A strangely shaped boat, going no one knows where, and as if it
never intended coming back! As for me, I should not have cared to ship
in her."

"Whether you would or not," answered Mr. Cornhill, "you could never
have shipped in the _Forward_."

"Why not?"

"Because you would not have answered the conditions. I heard that
married men were not taken. Now you belong to that class. So you need
not say what you would or would not do, since it's all breath thrown
away."

The sailor who was thus snubbed burst out laughing, as did his
companions, showing in this way that Mr. Cornhill's remarks were true.

"There's nothing but boldness about the ship," continued Cornhill,
well pleased with himself. "The _Forward_,--forward to what? Without
saying that nobody knows who her captain is."

"O, yes, they do!" said a young sailor, evidently a green-hand.

[Illustration]

"What! They do know?"

"Of course."

"My young friend," said Cornhill, "do you think Shandon is the captain
of the _Forward_?"

"Why--" answered the boy.

"Shandon is only the mate, nothing else; he's a good and brave sailor,
an old whaler, a good fellow, able to take command, but he's not the
captain; he's no more captain than you or I. And who, under God, is
going to have charge of the ship, he does not know in the least. At
the proper time the captain will come aboard, I don't know how, and I
don't know where; for Richard Shandon didn't tell me, nor has he leave
to tell me in what direction he was first to sail."

"Still, Mr. Cornhill," said the young sailor, "I can tell you that
there's some one on board, some one who was spoken of in the letter in
which Mr. Shandon was offered the place of mate."

"What!" answered Cornhill, "do you mean to tell me that the _Forward_
has a captain on board?"

"Yes, Mr. Cornhill."

"You tell me that?"

"Certainly, for I heard it from Johnson, the boatswain."

"Boatswain Johnson?"

"Yes, he told me himself."

"Johnson told you?"

"Not only did he tell me, but he showed him to me."

"He showed him to you!" answered Cornhill in amazement.

[Illustration]

"He showed him to me."

"And you saw him?"

"I saw him with my own eyes."

"And who is it?"

"It's a dog."

"A dog?"

"A four-footed dog?"

"Yes."

The surprise of the sailors of the _Nautilus_ was great. Under any
other circumstances they would have burst out laughing. A dog captain
of a one hundred and seventy ton brig! It was certainly amusing
enough. But the _Forward_ was such an extraordinary ship, that one
thought twice before laughing, and before contradicting it. Besides,
Quartermaster Cornhill showed no signs of laughing.

"And Johnson showed you that new sort of captain, a dog?" he said to
the young sailor. "And you saw him?"

"As plainly as I see you, with all respect."

"Well, what do you think of that?" asked the sailors, turning to
Cornhill.

"I don't think anything," he answered curtly, "except that the
_Forward_ is a ship of the Devil, or of fools fit for Bedlam."

Without saying more, the sailors continued to gaze at the _Forward_,
which was now almost ready to depart; and there was no one of them who
presumed to say that Johnson, the boatswain, had been making fun of
the young sailor.

This story of the dog had already spread through the city, and in the
crowd of sight-seers there were many looking for the captain-dog, who
were inclined to believe that he was some supernatural animal.

Besides, for many months the _Forward_ had been attracting the public
attention; the singularity of its build, the mystery which enshrouded
it, the incognito maintained by the captain, the manner in which
Richard Shandon received the proposition of superintending its outfit,
the careful selection of the crew, its unknown destination, scarcely
conjectured by any,--all combined to give this brig a reputation of
something more than strangeness.

For a thoughtful, dreamy mind, for a philosopher, there is hardly
anything more touching than the departure of a ship; the imagination
is ready to follow her in her struggles with the waves, her contests
with the winds, in her perilous course, which does not always end in
port; and if only there is something unusual about her, the ship
appears like something fantastic, even to the least imaginative minds.

So it was with the _Forward_. And if most of the spectators were
unable to make the ingenious remarks of Quartermaster Cornhill, the
rumors which had been prevailing for three months were enough to keep
all the tongues of Liverpool busy.

The brig had been built at Birkenhead, a suburb of the city on the
left bank of the Mersey, and connected with it by numerous
ferry-boats.

The builders, Scott & Co., as skilful as any in England, had received
from Richard Shandon careful plans and drawings, in which the tonnage,
dimensions, and model of the brig were given with the utmost
exactness. They bore proof of the work of an experienced sailor. Since
Shandon had ample means at his command, the work began, and, in
accordance with the orders of the unknown owner, proceeded rapidly.

Every care was taken to have the brig made exceedingly strong; it was
evidently intended to withstand enormous pressure, for its ribs of
teak, an East Indian wood remarkable for its solidity, were further
strengthened by thick iron braces. The sailors used to ask why the
hull of a ship, which was intended to be so strong, was not made of
iron like other steamers. But they were told that the mysterious
designer had his own reasons for having it built in that way.

Gradually the shape of the brig on the stocks could be clearly made
out, and the strength and beauty of her model were clear to the eye of
all competent judges. As the sailors of the _Nautilus_ had said, her
stem formed a right angle with the keel, and she carried, not a ram,
but a steel cutter from the foundry of R. Hawthorn, of Newcastle. This
metallic prow, glistening in the sun, gave a singular appearance to
the brig, although there was nothing warlike about it. However, a
sixteen-pound gun was placed on her forecastle; its carriage was so
arranged that it could be pointed in any direction. The same thing can
be said of the cannon as of her bows, neither were positively warlike.

On the 5th of February, 1860, this strange vessel was successfully
launched in the sight of an immense number of spectators.

[Illustration]

But if the brig was not a man-of-war, nor a merchant-vessel, nor a
pleasure-yacht, for no one takes a pleasure trip with provisions for
six years in the hold, what could she be?

A ship intended for the search of the _Erebus_ and the _Terror_, and
of Sir John Franklin? No; for in 1859, the previous year, Captain
MacClintock had returned from the Arctic Ocean, with convincing proof
of the loss of that ill-fated expedition.

Did the _Forward_ want to try again the famous Northwest Passage? What
for? Captain MacClure had discovered it in 1853, and his lieutenant,
Cresswell, had the honor of first skirting the American continent from
Behring Strait to Davis Strait.

It was nevertheless absolutely certain to all competent observers that
the _Forward_ was preparing for a voyage to icy regions. Was it going
to push towards the South Pole, farther than the whaler Wedell,
farther than Captain James Ross? But what was the use, and with what
intention?

It is easy to see that, although the field for conjecture was very
limited, the imagination could easily lose itself.

The day after the launching of the brig her machinery arrived from the
foundry of R. Hawthorn at Newcastle.

The engine, of one hundred and twenty horse-power, with oscillating
cylinders, took up but little space; its force was large for a vessel
of one hundred and seventy tons, which carried a great deal of sail,
and was, besides, remarkably swift. Of her speed the trial trips left
no doubt, and even the boatswain, Johnson, had seen fit to express his
opinion to the friend of Clifton in these terms,--

"When the _Forward_ is under both steam and sail, she gets the most
speed from her sails."

Clifton's friend had not understood this proposition, but he
considered anything possible in a ship commanded by a dog.

After the engines had been placed on board, the stowage of provisions
began; and that was no light task, for she carried enough for six
years. They consisted of salted and dried meats, smoked fish, biscuit,
and flour; mountains of coffee and tea were deposited in the
store-room. Richard Shandon superintended the arrangement of this
precious cargo with the air of a man who perfectly understood his
business; everything was put in its place, labelled, and numbered with
perfect precision; at the same time there was stowed away a large
quantity of pemmican, an Indian preparation, which contains a great
deal of nutriment in a small compass.

This sort of supply left no doubt as to the length of the cruise; but
an experienced observer would have known at once that the _Forward_
was to sail in polar waters, from the barrels of lime-juice, of lime
lozenges, of bundles of mustard, sorrel, and of cochlearia,--in a
word, from the abundance of powerful antiscorbutics, which are so
necessary in journeys in the regions of the far north and south.
Shandon had doubtless received word to take particular care about this
part of the cargo, for he gave to it especial attention, as well as to
the ship's medicine-chest.

[Illustration]

If the armament of the vessel was small enough to calm the timid
souls, on the other hand, the magazine was filled with enough powder
to inspire some uneasiness. The single gun on the forecastle could not
pretend to require so large a supply. This excited curiosity. There
were, besides, enormous saws and strong machinery, such as levers,
masses of lead, hand-saws, huge axes, etc., without counting a
respectable number of blasting-cylinders, which might have blown up
the Liverpool custom-house. All this was strange, if not alarming, not
to mention the rockets, signals, lights, and lanterns of every sort.

Then, too, the numerous spectators on the quays of the New Prince's
Docks gazed with admiration at a long mahogany whale-boat, a tin canoe
covered with gutta-percha, and a number of halkett-boats, which are a
sort of india-rubber cloaks, which can be inflated and thereby turned
into canoes. Every one felt more and more puzzled, and even excited,
for with the turn of the tide the _Forward_ was to set sail for its
unknown destination.




CHAPTER II.
AN UNEXPECTED LETTER.


This is a copy of the letter received by Richard Shandon eight months
previously:--


ABERDEEN, August 2, 1859.

MR. RICHARD SHANDON, _Liverpool_.

SIR,--This letter is to advise you of a remittance of £16,000,
deposited with Messrs. Marcuart & Co., bankers, at Liverpool. Enclosed
you will find a series of drafts, signed by me, which will enable you
to draw upon Messrs. Marcuart & Co. to the amount mentioned above.

[Illustration]

You do not know me. No matter; I know you, and that is enough. I offer
you the position of mate on board of the brig _Forward_, for a voyage
which may be long and perilous.

If you decline, well and good. If you accept, five hundred pounds will
be assigned you as salary, and at the end of each year of the voyage
your pay will be increased one tenth.

The brig _Forward_ does not exist. You will be obliged to have it
built so that it will be possible to set to sea in the beginning of
April, 1860, at the latest. Enclosed is a drawing with estimates. You
will follow them exactly. The ship will be built in the stocks of
Scott & Co., who will arrange everything with you.

I beg of you to be specially cautious in selecting the crew of the
_Forward_; it will consist of a captain (myself), a mate (you), a
second mate, a boatswain, two engineers, an ice-master, eight sailors,
two stokers, in all eighteen men, including Dr. Clawbonny of this
city, who will join you at the proper time.

Those who are shipped on board of the _Forward_ must be Englishmen,
independent, with no family ties, single and temperate; for the use of
spirits, and even of beer, will be strictly forbidden on shipboard:
the men must be ready to undertake and endure everything.

In your selection you will prefer those of a sanguine temperament, and
so inclined to maintain a higher degree of animal heat.

You will offer the crew five times their usual pay, to be increased
one tenth at the end of each year. At the end of the voyage each one
shall receive five hundred pounds, and you yourself two thousand. The
requisite sum shall be deposited with the above-named Messrs. Marcuart
& Co.

The voyage will be long and difficult, but one sure to bring renown.
You need not hesitate, then, Mr. Shandon.

Send your answer to the initials K. Z., at Gottenburg, Sweden, _poste
restante_.

[Illustration]

P. S. On the 15th of February next you will receive a large Danish
dog, with hanging lips, of a dark tawny color, with black stripes
running crosswise. You will find place for him on board, and you will
feed him on barley bread mixed with a broth of lard. You will
acknowledge the receipt of this dog by a letter to the same initials
at Leghorn, Italy.

The captain of the _Forward_ will appear and make himself known at the
proper time. As you are about setting sail you will receive new
instructions.

K. Z.,
_Captain of the Forward_.




CHAPTER III.
DR. CLAWBONNY.


Richard Shandon was a good sailor; for a long time he had commanded
whalers in the Arctic seas, with a well-deserved reputation throughout
all Lancaster. Such a letter was well calculated to astonish him; he
was astonished, it is true, but with the calmness of a man who is
accustomed to surprises.

He suited all the required conditions; no wife, child, nor relatives.
He was as independent as man could be. There being no one whose
opinion he needed to consult, he betook himself to Messrs. Marcuart &
Co.

"If the money is there," he said to himself, "the rest is all right."

At the banking-house he was received with the respect due to a man who
has sixteen thousand pounds deposited to his credit; having made that
point sure, Shandon asked for a sheet of white paper, and in his large
sailor's handwriting he sent his acceptance of the plan to the address
given above.

That very day he made the necessary arrangements with the builders at
Birkenhead, and within twenty-four hours the keel of the _Forward_ was
laid on the stocks.

Richard Shandon was a man about forty years old, strong, energetic,
and fearless, three qualities most necessary for a sailor, for they
give him confidence, vigor, and coolness. He was known to be severe
and very hard to please; hence he was more feared than loved by his
men. But this reputation was not calculated to interfere with his
selection of a crew, for he was known to be skilful in avoiding
trouble.

Shandon feared that the mysterious nature of the expedition might
stand in his way.

"In that case," he said, "it's best not to say anything about it;
there will always be plenty of men who will want to know the why and
the wherefore of the whole matter, and, since I don't know anything
about it myself, I should find it hard to answer them. This K. Z. is
certainly an odd stick; but, after all, he knows me, he depends on me,
and that is enough. As for his ship, it will be a good one, and if
it's not going to the Arctic Ocean, my name is not Richard Shandon.
But I shall keep that fact for myself and my officers."

Thereupon Shandon began to choose his crew, bearing in mind the
captain's wishes about the independence and health of the men.

He knew a very capital fellow, and a good sailor, James Wall by name.
Wall might have been about thirty years old, and had already made some
voyages in the northern seas. Shandon offered him the place of second
mate, and Wall accepted it at once; all he cared for was to be at sea.
Shandon confided all the details of the affair to him and to a certain
Johnson, whom he took as boatswain.

[Illustration]

"All right," answered James Wall, "that's as good as anything. Even if
it's to seek the Northwest Passage, some have come back from that."

"Not all," said Johnson, "but that's no reason that we should not try
it."

"Besides, if our guesses are right," said Shandon, "it must be said
that we start with a fair chance of success. The _Forward_ will be a
stanch ship and she will carry good engines. She can go a great
distance. We want a crew of only eighteen men."

"Eighteen men," answered Johnson; "that's the number the American,
Kane, took with him on his famous voyage towards the North Pole."

"It's strange," said Wall, "that a private person should try to make
his way from Davis Strait to Behring Strait. The expeditions in search
of Sir John Franklin have already cost England more than seven hundred
and sixty thousand pounds, without producing any practical good. Who
in the world wants to throw away his money for such a purpose?"

"In the first place, James," answered Shandon, "we are in the dark
about it all. I don't know whether we are going to the northern or the
southern seas. Perhaps there's some new discovery to be tried. At any
rate, some day or other a Dr. Clawbonny is to come aboard who will
probably know more about it and will be able to tell us. We shall
see."

"Let us wait, then," said Johnson; "as for me, I'm going to look after
some good men, and I'll answer now for their animal heat, as the
captain calls it. You can depend on me."

Johnson was an invaluable man; he was familiar with high latitudes. He
had been quartermaster aboard of the _Phoenix_, which belonged to one
of the expeditions sent out in 1853 in search of Franklin; he had been
an eye-witness of the death of the French lieutenant Bellot, whom he
had accompanied in his expedition across the ice. Johnson knew all the
sailors in Liverpool, and immediately set about engaging a crew.

[Illustration: "Johnson knew all the sailors in Liverpool, and
immediately set about engaging a crew."]

Shandon, Wall, and he succeeded in filling the number by the middle of
December, but they met with considerable difficulty; many who were
attracted by the high pay were alarmed by the danger, and more than
one who had boldly enlisted came later to say that he had changed his
mind on account of the dissuasion of his friends. They all tried to
pierce the mystery, and pursued Shandon with their questions. He used
to refer them to Johnson.

"What can I say, my man?" the boatswain used to answer; "I don't know
any more about it than you do. At any rate you will be in good
company, with men who won't shirk their work; that's something! So
don't be thinking about it all day: take it or leave it!" And the
greater number took it.

"You understand," added Johnson, sometimes, "my only trouble is in
making my choice. High pay, such as no sailor ever had before, with
the certainty of finding a round sum when we get back. That's very
tempting."

"The fact is," answered the sailors, "that it is hard to refuse. It
will support a man all the rest of his life."

"I won't hide from you," continued Johnson, "that the voyage will be
long, difficult, and dangerous; that's all stated in our instructions;
it's well to know beforehand what one undertakes to do; probably it's
to try all that men can possibly do, and perhaps even more. So, if you
haven't got a bold heart and a strong body, if you can't say you have
more than twenty chances to one of staying there, if, in short, you
are particular about leaving your body in one place more than another,
here rather than there, get away from here and let some bolder man
have your place!"

"But, at least," said the confused sailor,--"at least, you know the
captain?"

"The captain is Richard Shandon, my friend, until we receive another."

Now it must be said that was what the commander thought; he allowed
himself to think that at the last moment he would receive definite
instructions as to the object of the voyage, and that he would remain
in command of the _Forward_. He was fond of spreading this opinion
about, either in conversation with his officers or in superintending
the building of the brig, of which the timbers were now rising in the
Birkenhead ship-yard like the sides of a huge whale.

Shandon and Johnson conformed strictly with the recommendation about
the health of the crew; they all looked hardy and possessed enough
animal heat to run the engines of the _Forward_; their elastic limbs,
their clear and ruddy skin, showed that they were fit to encounter
intense cold. They were bold, determined men, energetic and stoutly
built; they were not all equally vigorous. Shandon had even hesitated
about accepting some of them; for instance, the sailors Gripper and
Garry, and the harpooner Simpson, who seemed to him too thin; but, on
the other hand, they were well built, they were earnest about it, and
they were shipped.

All the crew were members of the same church; in their long voyage
their prayers and the reading of the Bible would call them together
and console them in the hours of depression; so that it was advisable
that there should be no diversity on this score. Shandon knew from
experience the usefulness of this practice and its good influence on
the men, so valuable that it is never neglected on board of ships
which winter in the polar seas.

When all the crew had been engaged, Shandon and his two officers
busied themselves with the provisions; they followed closely the
captain's instructions, which were definite, precise, and detailed, in
which the quality and quantity of the smallest articles were clearly
set down. Thanks to the drafts placed at the commander's order, every
article was paid for, cash down, with a discount of eight per cent,
which Richard carefully placed to the credit of K. Z.

Crew, provisions, and outfit were all ready in January, 1860; the
_Forward_ was approaching completion. Shandon never let a day pass
without visiting Birkenhead.

On the morning of the 23d of January he was, as usual, on one of the
double-ended ferry-boats which ply between the two shores of the
Mersey; everything was enveloped in one of the ordinary fogs of that
region, which compel the pilot to steer by compass, although the trip
is one of but ten minutes.

[Illustration: "Everything was enveloped in one of the ordinary fogs
of that region."]

However, the thickness of the fog could not prevent Shandon from
noticing a short, rather stout man, with a refined, agreeable face and
pleasant expression, who came towards him, seized both his hands, and
pressed them with a warmth and familiarity which a Frenchman would
have said was "very southern."

But if this stranger was not from the South, he had escaped it
narrowly; he spoke and gesticulated freely; his thoughts seemed
determined to find expression, even if they had to burst out. His
eyes, small like the eyes of witty men, his large and mobile mouth,
were safety-valves which enabled him to rid himself of too strong a
pressure on his feelings; he talked; and he talked so much and
joyously, that, it must be said, Shandon could not make out what he
was saying.

[Illustration]

Still the mate of the _Forward_ was not slow in recognizing this short
man whom he had never seen; it flashed into his mind, and the moment
that the other stopped to take breath, Shandon uttered these words,--

"Dr. Clawbonny?"

"The same, in person, Commander! For nearly a quarter of an hour I
have been looking after you, asking for you of every one and
everywhere. Imagine my impatience. Five minutes more and I should have
lost my head! So this is you, officer Shandon? You really exist? You
are not a myth? Your hand, your hand! Let me press it again in mine!
Yes, that is indeed the hand of Richard Shandon. Now, if there is a
commander Richard, there is a brig _Forward_ which he commands; and if
he commands it, it will sail; and if it sails, it will take Dr.
Clawbonny on board."

"Well, yes, Doctor, I am Richard Shandon, there is a brig _Forward_,
and it will sail."

"There's logic," answered the doctor, taking a long breath,--"there's
logic. So I am delighted, enchanted! For a long time I've been waiting
for something of this sort to turn up, and I've been wanting to try a
voyage of this sort. Now, with you--"

"Excuse me--" said Shandon.

"With you," continued Clawbonny, paying him no attention, "we are sure
of going far without turning round."

"But--" began Shandon.

"For you have shown what stuff you are made of, and I know all you've
done. Ah, you are a good sailor!"

"If you please--"

"No, I sha'n't let your courage and skill be doubted for a moment,
even by yourself. The captain who chose you for mate is a man who knew
what he was about; I can tell you that."

"But that is not the question," said Shandon, impatiently.

"What is it, then? Don't keep me anxious any longer."

"But you won't let me say a word. Tell me, Doctor, if you please, how
you came to join this expedition of the _Forward_?"

"By a letter, a capital letter; here it is,--the letter of a brave
captain, very short, but very full."

With these words he handed Shandon a letter running as follows:--


INVERNESS, January 22, 1860.

_To_ DR. CLAWBONNY, _Liverpool_.

If Dr. Clawbonny wishes to sail on the _Forward_ for a long voyage, he
can present himself to the mate, Richard Shandon, who has been advised
concerning him.

K. Z.,
_Captain of the Forward_.


"The letter reached me this morning, and I'm now ready to go on board
of the _Forward_."

"But," continued Shandon, "I suppose you know whither we are bound."

"Not the least idea in the world; but what difference does it make,
provided I go somewhere? They say I'm a learned man; they are wrong; I
don't know anything, and if I have published some books which have had
a good sale, I was wrong; it was very kind of the public to buy them!
I don't know anything, I tell you, except that I am very ignorant. Now
I have a chance offered me to complete, or, rather, to make over my
knowledge of medicine, surgery, history, geography, botany,
mineralogy, conchology, geodesy, chemistry, physics, mechanics,
hydrography; well, I accept it, and I assure you, I didn't have to be
asked twice."

"Then," said Shandon in a tone of disappointment, "you don't know
where the _Forward_ is going."

"O, but I do, commander; it's going where there is something to be
learned, discovered; where one can instruct himself, make comparisons,
see other customs, other countries, study the ways of other people; in
a word, it's going where I have never been."

"But more precisely?" cried Shandon.

"More precisely," answered the doctor, "I have understood that it was
bound for the Northern Ocean. Well, good for the North!"

"At any rate," said Shandon, "you know the captain?"

"Not at all! But he's a good fellow, you may depend on it."

The mate and the doctor stepped ashore at Birkenhead; Shandon gave his
companion all the information he had, and the mystery which lay about
it all excited highly the doctor's imagination. The sight of the
_Forward_ enchanted him. From that time he was always with Shandon,
and he came every morning to inspect the hull of the _Forward_.

In addition he was specially intrusted with the providing of the
ship's medicine-chest.

For Clawbonny was a physician, and a good one, although he had never
practised much. At twenty-five he was an ordinary young doctor, at
forty he was a learned man; being known throughout the whole city, he
became a leading member of the Literary and Philosophical Society of
Liverpool. His moderate fortune allowed him to give some advice which
was no less valuable for being without charge; loved as a thoroughly
kind-hearted man must be, he did no harm to any one else nor to
himself; quick and garrulous, if you please, but with his heart in his
hand, and his hand in that of all the world.

When the news of his intended journey on board the _Forward_ became
known in the city, all his friends endeavored to dissuade him, but
they only made him cling more obstinately to his intention; and when
the doctor had absolutely determined on anything, he was a skilful man
who could make him change.

From that day the rumors, conjectures, and apprehensions steadily
increased; but that did not interfere with the launching of the
_Forward_ on the 5th of February, 1860. Two months later she was ready
for sea.

On the 15th of March, as the captain's letter had said, a Danish dog
was sent by rail from Edinburgh to Liverpool, to the address of
Richard Shandon. He seemed morose, timid, and almost wicked; his
expression was very strange. The name of the _Forward_ was engraved on
his collar.

[Illustration]

The commander gave him quarters on board, and sent a letter, with the
news of his arrival, to Leghorn.

Hence, with the exception of the captain, the crew of the _Forward_
was complete. It was composed as follows:--

1. K. Z., captain; 2. Richard Shandon, first mate, in command; 3.
James Wall, second mate; 4. Dr. Clawbonny; 5. Johnson, boatswain; 6.
Simpson, harpooner; 7. Bell, carpenter; 8. Brunton, first engineer; 9.
Plover, second engineer; 10. Strong (negro), cook; 11. Foker,
ice-master; 12. Wolston, gunner; 13. Bolton, sailor; 14. Garry,
sailor; 15. Clifton, sailor; 16. Gripper, sailor; 17. Pen, sailor; 18.
Warren, stoker.




CHAPTER IV.
THE DOG-CAPTAIN.


The 5th of April, the day of departure, came. The fact that the doctor
had joined the expedition gave some comfort to those on board.
Wherever he could go they could follow. Still, most of the sailors
were very uneasy, and Shandon, fearing that their number might be
diminished by desertion, was very anxious to get to sea. The land once
out of sight, the men would soon be resigned.

Dr. Clawbonny's cabin was situated on the poop, occupying the extreme
after-part of the ship. The cabins of the captain and mate opened on
the deck. That of the captain was kept tightly closed, after it had
been provided with various instruments, furniture, clothing, books,
and utensils, all of which had been set down in detail in a letter. As
he had asked, the key was sent to the captain at Lübeck; so he alone
had admission into the cabin.

This fact annoyed Shandon, and diminished his chances of having chief
command. As for his own cabin, he had arranged it suitably for the
presumed voyage, for he knew very well what was necessary for a polar
expedition.

The second mate's cabin was on the lower deck, where the sailors were
domiciled; the crew had very comfortable quarters; they would hardly
have had such accommodations in any other ship. They were treated as
if they were a valuable cargo; a huge stove stood in the middle of
their sleeping-room.

Dr. Clawbonny was very enthusiastic about it; he took possession of
his cabin on the 6th of February, the day after the ship was launched.

"The happiest animal in the world," he used to say, "would be a snail
who could make himself just such a shell as he wanted; I shall try to
be an intelligent snail."

And, in fact, for a shell which he was not going to leave for some
time, his cabin presented a very comfortable appearance; the doctor
took a scientific or childlike pleasure in arranging his scientific
paraphernalia. His books, his specimens, his cases, his instruments,
his physical apparatus, his thermometers, barometers, field-glasses,
compasses, sextants, charts, drawings, phials, powder, and
medicine-bottles, all were classified in a way which would have done
honor to the British Museum. This space of six feet square contained
incalculable wealth; the doctor needed only to stretch out his hand
without rising, to become at once a physician, a mathematician, an
astronomer, a geographer, a botanist, or a conchologist.

[Illustration: "This space of six feet square contained incalculable
wealth."]

To tell the truth, he was proud of his arrangements, and very
contented in his floating sanctum, which three of his thinnest friends
would have completely filled. They used to crowd there in great
numbers, so that even so good-natured a man as the doctor was
occasionally put out; and, like Socrates, he came at last to say,--

"My house is small, but may Heaven grant that it never be filled with
friends!"

To complete our account of the _Forward_, it is only necessary to add
that a kennel for the huge Danish dog was built just beneath the
window of the closed cabin; but he preferred to keep himself between
decks and in the hold; it seemed impossible to tame him; no one ever
conquered his shyness; he could be heard, at night especially, howling
dismally in the ship's hold.

Was it because he missed his master? Had he an instinctive dread of
the dangers of the voyage? Had he a presentiment of the coming perils?
The sailors were sure that he had, and more than one said the same in
jest, who in his heart regarded the dog as a sort of diabolic animal.

Pen, a very brutal man, one day, while trying to kick him, slipped,
and fell on the corner of the capstan in such a way that he cut his
head badly. It is easy to see how the sailors put all the blame upon
the dog.

[Illustration: PEN.]

Clifton, who was the most superstitious man in the crew, made, one
day, the strange observation that the dog, when on the poop, would
always walk on the windward side; and afterwards, when the brig was at
sea and under sail, this singular animal would shift his position to
the other side after every tack, so as to be windward, as the captain
of the _Forward_ would have done.

[Illustration: CLIFTON.]

Dr. Clawbonny, who by his gentleness and caresses would have almost
tamed the heart of a tiger, tried in vain to make friends with the
dog; he met with no success.

The dog, too, did not answer to any of the usual names of his kind. So
the men used to call him "Captain," for he seemed perfectly familiar
with all the ways on shipboard. He had evidently been to sea before.

It is hence easy to understand the boatswain's answer to Clifton's
friend, and how this idea found but few sceptics; more than one would
repeat it jestingly, who was fully prepared to see the dog, some fine
day, take human shape, and with a loud voice assume command.

If Richard Shandon did not share such apprehensions, he was far from
being undisturbed, and on the eve of departing, on the night of April
5th, he was talking on this subject with the doctor, Wall, and
Johnson, in the mess-room.

These four persons were sipping their tenth grog, which was probably
their last, too; for, in accordance with the letter from Aberdeen, all
the crew, from the captain to the stoker, were teetotalers, never
touching beer, wine, nor spirits, except in case of sickness, and by
the advice of the doctor.

For an hour past they had been talking about their departure. If the
captain's instructions were to be completely carried out, Shandon
would the next day receive a letter containing his last orders.

"If that letter," said the mate, "doesn't tell me the captain's name,
it must at least tell us whither we are bound. If not, in what
direction shall we sail?"

"Upon my word," answered the impatient doctor, "if I were in your
place, Shandon, I should set sail even without getting a letter; one
will come after us, you may be sure."

"You have a great deal of faith, Doctor. But, if you please, to what
part of the world would you sail?"

"Towards the North Pole, of course; there can be no doubt about that."

"No doubt indeed!" said Wall. "Why not towards the South Pole?"

"The South Pole! Never!" cried the doctor. "Would the captain ever
have thought of sending a brig across the whole Atlantic Ocean? Just
think for a moment, my dear Wall."

"The doctor has an answer for everything," was his only reply.

"Granted it's northward," resumed Shandon. "But tell me, Doctor, is it
to Spitzbergen, Greenland, or Labrador that we have to sail, or to
Hudson's Bay? If all these routes come to the same end at last,--the
impassable ice,--there is still a great number of them, and I should
find it very hard to choose between them. Have any definite answer to
that, Doctor?"

"No," answered the doctor, annoyed that he had nothing to say; "but if
you get no letter, what shall you do?"

"I shall do nothing; I shall wait."

"You won't set sail!" cried Clawbonny, twirling his glass in his
despair.

"No, certainly not."

"That's the best course," said Johnson, mildly; while the doctor
walked around the table, being unable to sit quiet any longer. "Yes,
that's the best course; and still, too long a delay might have very
disastrous consequences. In the first place, the season is a good one,
and if it's north we are going, we ought to take advantage of the mild
weather to get through Davis Straits; besides, the crew will get more
and more impatient; the friends and companions of the men are urging
them to leave the _Forward_, and they might succeed in playing us a
very bad turn."

[Illustration]

"And then, too," said James Wall, "if any panic should arise among the
men, every one would desert us; and I don't know, Commander, how you
could get together another crew."

"But what is to be done?" cried Shandon.

"What you said," answered the doctor: "wait; but wait till to-morrow
before you despair. The captain's promises have all been fulfilled so
far with such regularity that we may have the best hopes for the
future; there's no reason to think that we shall not be told of our
destination at the proper time. As for me, I don't doubt in the least
that to-morrow we shall be sailing in the Irish Sea. So, my friends, I
propose one last drink to a happy voyage; it begins in a mysterious
way, but, with such sailors as you, there are a thousand chances of
its ending well."

And they all touched their glasses for the last time.

"Now, Commander," resumed Johnson, "I have one piece of advice to give
you, and that is, to make everything ready for sailing. Let the crew
think you are certain of what you are about. To-morrow, whether a
letter comes or not, set sail; don't start your fires; the wind
promises to hold; nothing will be easier than to get off; take a pilot
on board; at the ebb of the tide leave the docks; then anchor beyond
Birkenhead Point; the crew will have no more communication with the
land; and if this devilish letter does come at last, it can find us
there as well as anywhere."

"Well said, Johnson!" exclaimed the doctor, reaching out his hand to
the old sailor.

"That's what we shall do," answered Shandon.

Each one then withdrew to his cabin, and took what sleep he could get
till morning.

The next day the first distribution of letters took place in the city,
but there was none for Commander Richard Shandon.

Nevertheless he made his preparations for departure; the news spread
immediately throughout the city, and, as we have seen, a great
concourse of spectators thronged the piers of the New Prince's Docks.

[Illustration: "The news spread immediately throughout the city, and a
great concourse of spectators thronged the piers."]

A great many people came on board the brig,--some to bid a friend good
by, or to urge him to leave the ship, or to gaze at this strange
vessel; others to ascertain the object of the voyage; and there were
many murmurs at the unusual silence of the commander.

For that he had his reasons.

Ten o'clock struck. Eleven. The tide was to turn at half past twelve.
Shandon, from the upper deck, gazed with anxious eyes at the crowd,
trying in vain to read on some one's face the secret of his fate. But
in vain. The sailors of the _Forward_ obeyed his orders in silence,
keeping their eyes fixed upon him, ever awaiting some information
which he did not give.

Johnson was finishing the preparations for setting sail. The day was
overcast, and the sea, outside of the docks, rather high; a stiff
southwest breeze was blowing, but they could easily leave the Mersey.

At twelve o'clock still nothing. Dr. Clawbonny walked up and down
uneasily, looking about, gesticulating, and "impatient for the sea,"
as he said. In spite of all he could do, he felt excited. Shandon bit
his lips till the blood came.

At this moment Johnson came up to him and said,--

"Commander, if we are going to take this tide, we must lose no time;
it will be a good hour before we can get off from the docks."

Shandon cast one last glance about him, and looked at his watch. It
was after the time of the midday distribution of letters.

"Cast off!" he said to his boatswain.

"All ashore who are going!" cried the latter, ordering the spectators
to leave the deck of the _Forward_.

Thereupon the crowd, began to move toward the gangway and make its way
on to the quay, while the crew began to cast off the last moorings.

At once the inevitable confusion of the crowd, which was pushed about
without much ceremony by the sailors, was increased by the barking of
the dog. He suddenly sprang from the forecastle right through the mass
of visitors, barking sullenly.

All made way for him. He sprang on the poop-deck, and, incredible as
it may seem, yet, as a thousand witnesses can testify, this
dog-captain carried a letter in his mouth.

[Illustration]

"A letter!" cried Shandon; "but is _he_ on board?"

"_He_ was, without doubt, but he's not now," answered Johnson, showing
the deck cleared of the crowd.

"Here, Captain! Captain!" shouted the doctor, trying to take the
letter from the dog, who kept springing away from him. He seemed to
want to give the letter to Shandon himself.

"Here, Captain!" he said.

The dog went up to him; Shandon took the letter without difficulty,
and then Captain barked sharply three times, amid the profound silence
which prevailed on board the ship and along the quay.

Shandon held the letter in his hand, without opening it.

"Read it, read it!" cried the doctor. Shandon looked at it. The
address, without date or place, ran simply,--"Commander Richard
Shandon, on board the brig _Forward_."

Shandon opened the letter and read:--


You will sail towards Cape Farewell. You will reach it April 20. If
the captain does not appear on board, you will pass through Davis
Strait and go up Baffin's Bay as far as Melville Sound.

K. Z.,
_Captain of the Forward_.


Shandon folded carefully this brief letter, put it in his pocket, and
gave the order to cast off. His voice, which arose alone above the
roaring of the wind, sounded very solemn.

Soon the _Forward_ had left the docks, and under the care of a pilot,
whose boat followed at a distance, put out into the stream. The crowd
hastened to the outer quay by the Victoria Docks to get a last look at
the strange vessel. The two topsails, the foresail, and staysail were
soon set, and under this canvas the _Forward_, which well deserved its
name, after rounding Birkenhead Point, sailed away into the Irish Sea.




CHAPTER V.
AT SEA.


The wind, which was uncertain, although in general favorable, was
blowing in genuine April squalls. The _Forward_ sailed rapidly, and
its screw, as yet unused, did not delay its progress. Towards three
o'clock they met the steamer which plies between Liverpool and the
Isle of Man, and which carries the three legs of Sicily on its
paddle-boxes. Her captain hailed them, and this was the last good-by
to the crew of the _Forward_.

At five o'clock the pilot resigned the charge of the ship to Richard
Shandon, and sailed away in his boat, which soon disappeared from
sight in the southwest.

Towards evening the brig doubled the Calf of Man, at the southern
extremity of the island of that name. During the night the sea was
very high; the _Forward_ rode the waves very well, however, and
leaving the Point of Ayr on the northwest, she ran towards the North
Channel.

[Illustration: "Towards evening the brig doubled the Calf of Man."]

Johnson was right; once at sea the sailors readily adapted themselves
instinctively to the situation. They saw the excellence of their
vessel and forgot the strangeness of their situation. The ship's
routine was soon regularly established.

The doctor inhaled with pleasure the sea-air; he paced up and down the
deck in spite of the fresh wind, and showed that for a student he had
very good sea-legs.

[Illustration]

"The sea is a fine thing," he said to Johnson, as he went upon the
bridge after breakfast; "I am a little late in making its
acquaintance, but I shall make up for my delay."

"You are right, Dr. Clawbonny; I would give all the land in the world
for a bit of ocean. People say that sailors soon get tired of their
business; but I've been sailing for forty years, and I like it as well
as I did the first day."

"What a pleasure it is to feel a stanch ship under one's feet! and, if
I'm not mistaken, the _Forward_ is a capital sea-boat."

"You are right, Doctor," answered Shandon, who had joined the two
speakers; "she's a good ship, and I must say that there was never a
ship so well equipped for a voyage in the polar regions. That reminds
me that, thirty years ago, Captain James Ross, going to seek the
Northwest Passage--"

"Commanded the _Victory_," said the doctor, quickly, "a brig of about
the tonnage of this one, and also carrying machinery."

"What! did you know that?"

"Say for yourself," retorted the doctor. "Steamers were then new
inventions, and the machinery of the _Victory_ was continually
delaying him. Captain Ross, after in vain trying to patch up every
piece, at last took it all out and left it at the first place he
wintered at."

"The deuce!" said Shandon. "You know all about it, I see."

"More or less," answered the doctor. "In my reading I have come across
the works of Parry, Ross, Franklin; the reports of MacClure, Kennedy,
Kane, MacClintock; and some of it has stuck in my memory. I might add
that MacClintock, on board of the _Fox_, a propeller like ours,
succeeded in making his way more easily and more directly than all his
successors."

"That's perfectly true," answered Shandon; "that MacClintock is a good
sailor; I have seen him at sea. You might also say that we shall be,
like him, in Davis Strait in the month of April; and if we can get
through the ice our voyage will be very much advanced."

"Unless," said the doctor, "we should be as unlucky as the _Fox_ in
1857, and should be caught the first year by the ice in the north of
Baffin's Bay, and we should have to winter among the icebergs."

"We must hope to be luckier, Mr. Shandon," said Johnson; "and if, with
a ship like the _Forward_, we can't go where we please, the attempt
must be given up forever."

"Besides," continued the doctor, "if the captain is on board he will
know better than we what is to be done, and so much the better because
we are perfectly ignorant; for his singularly brief letter gives us no
clew to the probable aim of the voyage."

"It's a great deal," answered Shandon, with some warmth, "to know what
route we have to take; and now for a good month, I fancy, we shall be
able to get along without his supernatural intervention and orders.
Besides, you know what I think about him."

"Ha, ha!" laughed the doctor; "I used to think as you did, that he was
going to leave the command of the ship in your hands, and that he
would never come on board; but--"

"But what?" asked Shandon, with some ill-humor.

"But since the arrival of the second letter, I have altered my views
somewhat."

"And why so, doctor?"

"Because, although this letter does tell you in which direction to go,
it still does not inform you of the final aim of the voyage; and we
have yet to know whither we are to go. I ask you how can a third
letter reach us now that we are on the open sea. The postal service on
the shore of Greenland is very defective. You see, Shandon, I fancy
that he is waiting for us at some Danish settlement up there,--at
Holsteinborg or Upernavik. We shall find that he has been completing
the supply of seal-skins, buying sledges and dogs,--in a word,
providing all the equipment for a journey in the arctic seas. So I
shall not be in the least surprised to see him coming out of his cabin
some fine morning and taking command in the least supernatural way in
the world."

"Possibly," answered Shandon, dryly; "but meanwhile the wind's
freshening, and there's no use risking our topsails in such weather."

Shandon left the doctor, and ordered the topsails furled.

"He still clings to that idea," said the doctor to the boatswain.

"Yes," was the answer, "and it's a pity; for you may very well be
right, Dr. Clawbonny."

Towards the evening of Saturday the _Forward_ rounded the Mull of
Galloway, on which the light could be seen in the northeast. During
the night they left the Mull of Cantire to the north, and on the east
Fair Head, on the Irish coast. Towards three o'clock in the morning,
the brig, passing Rathlin Island on its starboard quarter, came out
from the North Channel into the ocean.

That was Sunday, April 8. The English, and especially sailors, are
very observant of that day; hence the reading of the Bible, of which
the doctor gladly took charge, occupied a good part of the morning.

[Illustration]

The wind rose to a gale, and threatened to drive the ship back upon
the Irish coast. The waves ran very high; the vessel rolled a great
deal. If the doctor was not sea-sick, it was because he was determined
not to be, for nothing would have been easier. At midday Malin Head
disappeared from their view in the south; it was the last sight these
bold sailors were to have of Europe, and more than one gazed at it for
a long time who was doubtless fated never to set eyes on it again.

[Illustration]

By observation the latitude then was 55° 57', and the longitude,
according to the chronometer, 7° 40'.[1]

[Footnote 1: Meridian of Greenwich.]

The gale abated towards nine o'clock of the evening; the _Forward_, a
good sailer, kept on its route to the northwest. That day gave them
all a good opportunity to judge of her sea-going qualities; as good
judges had already said at Liverpool, she was well adapted for
carrying sail.

During the following days, the _Forward_ made very good progress; the
wind veered to the south, and the sea ran high. The brig set every
sail. A few petrels and puffins flew about the poop-deck; the doctor
succeeded in shooting one of the latter, which fortunately fell on
board.

[Illustration]

Simpson, the harpooner, seized it and carried it to the doctor.

"It's an ugly bird, Dr. Clawbonny," he said.

"But then it will make a good meal, my friend."

"What, are you going to eat it?"

"And you shall have a taste of it," said the doctor, laughing.

"Never!" answered Simpson; "it's strong and oily, like all sea-birds."

[Illustration]

"True," said the doctor; "but I have a way of dressing such game, and
if you recognize it to be a sea-bird, I'll promise never to kill
another in all my life."

"So you are a cook, too, Dr. Clawbonny?" asked Johnson.

"A learned man ought to know a little of everything."

"Then take care, Simpson," said the boatswain; "the doctor is a clever
man, and he'll make us take this puffin for a delicious grouse."

In fact, the doctor was in the right about this bird; he removed
skilfully the fat which lies beneath the whole surface of the skin,
principally on its thighs, and with it disappeared all the rancid,
fishy odor with which this bird can be justly charged. Thus prepared,
the bird was called delicious, even by Simpson.

During the recent storm, Richard Shandon had made up his mind about
the qualities of his crew; he had tested his men one by one, as every
officer should do who wishes to be prepared for future dangers; he
knew on whom he could rely.

James Wall, who was warmly attached to Richard, was intelligent and
efficient, but he had very little originality; as second officer he
was exactly in his place.

Johnson, who was accustomed to the dangers of the sea, and an old
sailor in arctic regions, lacked neither coolness nor courage.

Simpson, the harpooner, and Bell, the carpenter, were steady men,
obedient and well disciplined. The ice-master, Foker, an experienced
sailor, who had sailed in northern waters, promised to be of the
greatest service.

Of the other men, Garry and Bolton seemed to be the best; Bolton was a
jolly fellow, always laughing and joking; Garry, a man about
thirty-five years old, had an energetic, but rather pale and sad face.

[Illustration]

The three sailors, Clifton, Gripper, and Pen, seemed to be the least
enthusiastic and determined; they were inclined to grumbling. Gripper
had even wished to break his engagement when the time came for
sailing, and only a feeling of shame prevented him. If things went
well, if they encountered no excessive dangers, and their toil was not
too severe, these three men could be counted on; but they were hard to
please with their food, for they were inclined to gluttony. In spite
of their having been forewarned, they were by no means pleased with
being teetotalers, and at their meals they used to miss their brandy
or gin; but they made up for it with the tea and coffee which were
distributed with a lavish hand.

As for the two engineers, Brunton and Plover, and the stoker, Warren,
they had been so far well satisfied with having nothing to do.

Shandon knew therefore what to expect from each man.

On the 14th of April, the _Forward_ crossed the Gulf Stream, which,
after following the eastern coast of America as far as Newfoundland,
turns to the northeast and moves towards the shore of Norway. They
were then in latitude 51° 37', and longitude 22° 37', two hundred
miles from the end of Greenland. The weather grew colder; the
thermometer fell to 32°, the freezing-point.

The doctor, without yet putting on his arctic winter dress, was
wearing a suit of sea-clothes, like all the officers and sailors; he
was an amusing sight in his high boots, in which he could not bend his
legs, his huge tarpaulin hat, his trousers and coat of the same
material; in heavy rain, or when the brig was shipping seas, the
doctor used to look like a sort of sea-monster, a comparison which
always flattered him.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

For two days the sea was very rough; the wind veered to the northwest,
and delayed the _Forward_. From the 14th to the 16th of April there
was still a high sea running; but on Monday there fell a heavy shower
which almost immediately had the effect of calming the sea. Shandon
called the doctor's attention to it.

"Well," said the doctor, "that confirms the curious observations of
the whaler Scoresby, who was a member of the Royal Society of
Edinburgh, of which I have the honor to be a corresponding member. You
see that while the rain is falling the waves are hardly to be noticed,
even when the wind is strong. On the other hand, in dry weather the
sea would be rougher even with a gentler wind."

"But what is the explanation of it, Doctor?"

"It's very simple; there is no explanation."

At that moment the ice-master, who was on watch in the topmast
cross-trees, cried out that there was a floating mass on the starboard
quarter, about fifteen miles to windward.

[Illustration]

"An iceberg in these latitudes!" cried the doctor.

Shandon turned his glass in that direction, and corroborated the
lookout's words.

"That's strange," said the doctor.

"Are you surprised?" asked the commander, laughing. "What! are we
lucky enough to find anything that will surprise you?"

"I am surprised without being surprised," answered the doctor,
smiling, "since the brig _Ann Poole_, of Greenspond, was caught in the
ice in the year 1813, in the forty-fourth degree of north latitude,
and Dayement, her captain, saw hundreds of icebergs."

"Good," said Shandon; "you can still teach us a great deal about
them."

"O, not so very much!" answered Clawbonny, modestly, "except that ice
has been seen in very much lower latitudes."

"That I know, my dear Doctor, for when I was a cabin-boy on the
sloop-of-war, _Fly_--"

"In 1818," continued the doctor, "at the end of March, or it might
have been the beginning of April, you passed between two large fields
of floating ice, in latitude forty-two."

"That is too much!" exclaimed Shandon.

"But it's true; so I have no need to be surprised, now that we are two
degrees farther north, at our sighting an iceberg."

"You are bottled full of information, Doctor," answered the commander;
"one needs only draw the cork."

"Very well, I shall be exhausted sooner than you think; and now,
Shandon, if we can get a nearer view of this phenomenon, I should be
the gladdest of doctors."

"Exactly, Johnson," said Shandon, summoning the boatswain; "I think
the wind is freshening."

"Yes, Commander," answered Johnson, "we are making very little
headway, and soon we shall feel the currents from Davis Strait."

"You are right, Johnson, and if we mean to make Cape Farewell by the
20th of April, we must go under steam, or we shall be cast on the
coast of Labrador.--Mr. Wall, give the order to light the fires."

The mate's orders were obeyed; an hour later the engines were in
motion; the sails were furled; and the screw, turning through the
waves, was driving the _Forward_ rapidly in the teeth of the northwest
wind.




CHAPTER VI.
THE GREAT POLAR CURRENT.


Soon more numerous flocks of birds, petrels, puffins, and others which
inhabit those barren shores, gave token of their approach to
Greenland. The _Forward_ was moving rapidly northward, leaving behind
her a long line of dark smoke.

Tuesday, the 17th of April, the ice-master caught the first sight of
the _blink_[1] of the ice. It was visible at least twenty miles off to
the north-northwest. In spite of some tolerably thick clouds it
lighted up brilliantly all the air near the horizon. No one of those
on board who had ever seen this phenomenon before could fail to
recognize it, and they felt assured from its whiteness that this blink
was due to a vast field of ice lying about thirty miles farther than
they could see, and that it came from the reflection of its luminous
rays.

[Footnote 1: A peculiar and brilliant color of the air above a large
expanse of ice.]

Towards evening the wind shifted to the south, and became favorable;
Shandon was able to carry sail, and as a measure of economy they
extinguished the furnace fires. The _Forward_ under her topsails, jib,
and foresail, sailed on towards Cape Farewell.

At three o'clock on the 18th they made out an ice-stream, which, like
a narrow but brilliant band, divided the lines of the water and sky.
It was evidently descending rather from the coast of Greenland than
from Davis Strait, for the ice tended to keep on the western side of
Baffin's Bay. An hour later, and the _Forward_ was passing through the
detached fragments of the ice-stream, and in the thickest part the
pieces of ice, although closely welded together, were rising and
falling with the waves.

At daybreak the next morning the watch saw a sail; it was the
_Valkyria_, a Danish corvette, sailing towards the _Forward_, bound to
Newfoundland. The current from the strait became perceptible, and
Shandon had to set more sail to overcome it.

At that moment the commander, the doctor, James Wall, and Johnson were
all together on the poop-deck, observing the force and direction of
the current. The doctor asked if it were proved that this current was
felt throughout Baffin's Bay.

"There's no doubt of it," answered Shandon; "and sailing-vessels have
hard work in making headway against it."

"And it's so much the harder," added James Wall, "because it's met on
the eastern coast of America, as well as on the western coast of
Greenland."

"Well," said the doctor, "that serves to confirm those who seek a
Northwest Passage. The current moves at the rate of about five miles
an hour, and it is hard to imagine that it rises at the bottom of a
gulf."

"That is very likely, Doctor," answered Shandon, "because, while this
current flows from north to south, there is a contrary current in
Behring Strait, which flows from south to north, and which must be the
cause of this one."

"Hence," said the doctor, "you must admit that America is completely
separated from the polar regions, and that the water from the Pacific
skirts its whole northern coast, until it reaches the Atlantic.
Besides, the greater elevation of the water of the Pacific is another
reason for its flowing towards the European seas."

"But," said Shandon, "there must be some facts which support this
theory; and if there are," he added with gentle irony, "our learned
friend must be familiar with them."

"Well," answered the latter, complacently, "if it interests you at all
I can tell you that whales, wounded in Davis Strait, have been found
afterwards on the coast of Tartary, still carrying a European harpoon
in their side."

"And unless they doubled Cape Horn, or the Cape of Good Hope,"
answered Shandon, "they must have gone around the northern coast of
America. There can be no doubt of that, Doctor."

"And if you were not convinced, my dear Shandon," said the doctor,
smiling, "I could produce still other evidence, such as the floating
wood with which Davis Strait is filled, larch, aspen, and other
southern kinds. Now we know that the Gulf Stream could not carry them
into the strait; and if they come out from it they must have got in
through Behring Strait."

"I am perfectly convinced, Doctor, and I must say it would be hard to
maintain the other side against you."

"See there," said Johnson, "there's something that will throw light on
this discussion. It's a large piece of wood floating on the water; if
the commander will give us leave, we can put a rope about it, hoist it
on board, and ask it the name of its country."

"That's the way!" said the doctor; "after the rule we have the
example."

Shandon gave the necessary orders; the brig was turned towards the
piece of wood, and soon the crew were hoisting it aboard, although not
without considerable trouble.

[Illustration]

It was the trunk of a mahogany-tree, eaten to its centre by worms,
which fact alone made it light enough to float.

"This is a real triumph," exclaimed the doctor, enthusiastically,
"for, since the Atlantic currents could not have brought it into Davis
Strait, since it could not have reached the polar waters from the
rivers of North America, as the tree grows under the equator, it is
evident that it must have come direct from Behring Strait. And
besides, see those sea-worms which have eaten it; they belong to warm
latitudes."

"It certainly gives the lie to those who deny the existence of a
Northwest Passage."

"It fairly kills them," answered the doctor. "See here, I'll give you
the route of this mahogany-tree: it was carried to the Pacific Ocean
by some river of the Isthmus of Panama or of Guatemala; thence the
current carried it along the coast of America as far as Behring
Strait, and so it was forced into the polar waters; it is neither so
old nor so completely water-logged that we cannot set its departure at
some recent date; it escaped all the obstacles of the many straits
coming into Baffin's Bay, and being quickly seized by the arctic
current it came through Davis Strait to be hoisted on board the
_Forward_ for the great joy of Dr. Clawbonny, who asks the commander's
permission to keep a piece as a memorial."

"Of course," answered Shandon; "but let me tell you in my turn that
you will not be the only possessor of such a waif. The Danish governor
of the island of Disco--"

"On the coast of Greenland," continued the doctor, "has a mahogany
table, made from a tree found in the same way; I know it, my dear
Shandon. Very well; I don't grudge him his table, for if there were
room enough on board, I could easily make a sleeping-room out of
this."

On the night of Wednesday the wind blew with extreme violence;
drift-wood was frequently seen; the approach to the coast became more
dangerous at a time when icebergs are numerous; hence the commander
ordered sail to be shortened, and the _Forward_ went on under merely
her foresail and forestay-sail.

The thermometer fell below the freezing-point. Shandon distributed
among the crew suitable clothing, woollen trousers and jackets,
flannel shirts, and thick woollen stockings, such as are worn by
Norwegian peasants. Every man received in addition a pair of
water-proof boots.

As for Captain, he seemed contented with his fur; he appeared
indifferent to the changes of temperature, as if he were thoroughly
accustomed to such a life; and besides, a Danish dog was unlikely to
be very tender. The men seldom laid eyes on him, for he generally kept
himself concealed in the darkest parts of the vessel.

Towards evening, through a rift in the fog, the coast of Greenland
could be seen in longitude 37° 2' 7". Through his glass the doctor was
able to distinguish mountains separated by huge glaciers; but the fog
soon cut out this view, like the curtain of a theatre falling at the
most interesting part of a play.

[Illustration]

On the morning of the 20th of April, the _Forward_ found itself in
sight of an iceberg one hundred and fifty feet high, aground in this
place from time immemorial; the thaws have had no effect upon it, and
leave its strange shape unaltered. Snow saw it; in 1829 James Ross
took an exact drawing of it; and in 1851 the French lieutenant,
Bellot, on board of the _Prince Albert_, observed it. Naturally the
doctor wanted to preserve a memorial of the famous mountain, and he
made a very successful sketch of it.

It is not strange that such masses should run aground, and in
consequence become immovably fixed to the spot; as for every foot
above the surface of the water they have nearly two beneath, which
would give to this one a total height of about four hundred feet.

At last with a temperature at noon as low as 12°, under a snowy, misty
sky, they sighted Cape Farewell. The _Forward_ arrived at the
appointed day; the unknown captain, if he cared to assume his place in
such gloomy weather, would have no need to complain.

"Then," said the doctor to himself, "there is this famous cape, with
its appropriate name! Many have passed it, as we do, who were destined
never to see it again! Is it an eternal farewell to one's friends in
Europe? You have all passed it, Frobisher, Knight, Barlow, Vaughan,
Scroggs, Barentz, Hudson, Blosseville, Franklin, Crozier, Bellot,
destined never to return home; and for you this cape was well named
Cape Farewell!"

It was towards the year 970 that voyagers, setting out from Iceland,
discovered Greenland. Sebastian Cabot, in 1498, went as high as
latitude 56°; Gaspard and Michel Cotréal, from 1500 to 1502, reached
latitude 60°; and in 1576 Martin Frobisher reached the inlet which
bears his name.

To John Davis belongs the honor of having discovered the strait, in
1585; and two years later in a third voyage this hardy sailor, this
great whaler, reached the sixty-third parallel, twenty-seven degrees
from the Pole.

Barentz in 1596, Weymouth in 1602, James Hall in 1605 and 1607,
Hudson, whose name was given to the large bay which runs so far back
into the continent of America, James Poole in 1611, went more or less
far into the straits, seeking the Northwest Passage, the discovery of
which would have greatly shortened the route between the two worlds.

Baffin, in 1616, found in the bay of that name Lancaster Sound; he was
followed in 1619 by James Monk, and in 1719 by Knight, Barlow,
Vaughan, and Scroggs, who were never heard of again.

In 1776, Lieutenant Pickersgill, sent to meet Captain Cook, who tried
to make his way through Behring Strait, reached latitude 68°; the next
year, Young, on the same errand, went as far as Woman's Island.

Then came James Ross, who in 1818 sailed all around the shores of
Baffin's Bay, and corrected the errors on the charts of his
predecessors.

Finally, in 1819 and 1820, the famous Parry made his way into
Lancaster Sound. In spite of numberless difficulties he reached
Melville Island, and won the prize of five thousand pounds offered by
act of Parliament to the English sailors who should cross the meridian
at a latitude higher than the seventy-seventh parallel.

In 1826, Beechey touched at Chamisso Island; James Ross wintered, from
1829 to 1833, in Prince Regent's Inlet, and, among other important
services, discovered the magnetic pole.

During this time Franklin, by a land-journey, defined the northern
coast of America, from Mackenzie River to Turnagain Point; Captain
Back followed the same route from 1823 to 1835; and these explorations
were completed in 1839 by Dease, Simpson, and Dr. Rae.

At last, Sir John Franklin, anxious to discover the Northwest Passage,
left England in 1845, with the _Erebus_ and the _Terror_; he entered
Baffin's Bay, and since his leaving Disco Island there has been no
news of his expedition.

His disappearance started numerous search-expeditions, which have
effected the discovery of the passage, and given the world definite
information about the rugged coasts of the polar lands. The boldest
sailors of England, France, and the United States hastened to these
terrible latitudes; and, thanks to their exertions, the tortuous,
complicated map of these regions has at last been placed in the
archives of the Royal Geographical Society of London.

The strange history of these lands crowded on the imagination of the
doctor, as he stood leaning on the rail, and gazing on the long track
of the brig. The names of those bold sailors thronged into his memory,
and it seemed to him that beneath the frozen arches of the ice he
could see the pale ghosts of those who never returned.

CHAPTER VII.
THE ENTRANCE OF DAVIS STRAIT.


During that day the _Forward_ made easy progress through the loose
ice; the breeze was in a good quarter, but the temperature was very
low; the wind coming across the ice-fields was thoroughly chilled.

At night the strictest care was necessary; the icebergs crowded
together in this narrow passage; often they could be counted by the
hundred on the horizon; they had been loosened from the lofty coasts
by the incessant beating of the waves and the warmth of the spring
month, and they were floating down to melt away in the depths of the
ocean. Often, too, they came across large masses of floating wood,
which they were obliged to avoid, so that the crow's-nest was placed
in position on the top of the foremast; it consisted of a sort of tub,
in which the ice-master, partly sheltered from the wind, scanned the
sea, giving notice of the ice in sight, and even, if necessary,
directing the ship's course.

[Illustration]

The nights were short; since the 31st of January the sun had
reappeared in refraction, and was every day rising higher and higher
above the horizon. But it was hid by the snow, which, if it did not
produce utter darkness, rendered navigation difficult.

April 21st, Cape Desolation appeared through the mist; hard work was
wearying the crew; since the brig had entered the ice, the sailors had
had no rest; it was now necessary to have recourse to steam to force a
way through the accumulated masses.

The doctor and Johnson were talking together on the after-deck, while
Shandon was snatching a few hours of sleep in his cabin. Clawbonny was
very fond of talking with the old sailor, whose numerous voyages had
given him a valuable education. The two had made great friends of one
another.

"You see, Dr. Clawbonny," said Johnson, "this country is not like any
other; its name is Greenland, but there are very few weeks of the year
in which it deserves this name."

"But, Johnson," answered the doctor, "who can say whether in the tenth
century this name did not suit it? More than one change of this sort
has taken place on the globe, and I should astonish you much more by
saying that, according to Icelandic chroniclers, two hundred villages
flourished on this continent eight or nine hundred years ago."

"You astonish me so much, Dr. Clawbonny, that I can't believe you; for
it's a sterile country."

"Well, sterile as it is, it supports a good many inhabitants, and
among them are some civilized Europeans."

"Without doubt; at Disco and at Upernavik we shall find men who are
willing to live in such a climate; but I always supposed they stayed
there from necessity, and not because they liked it."

"I think you are right; still, men get accustomed to everything, and
these Greenlanders appear to me better off than the workingmen of our
large cities; they may be unfortunate, but they are not miserable. I
say unfortunate, but that is not exactly what I mean; in fact, if they
are not quite as comfortable as those who live in temperate regions,
they, nevertheless, are accustomed to the severity of the climate, and
find in it an enjoyment which we should never imagine."

"We have to think so, Dr. Clawbonny, because Heaven is just; but I
have often visited these coasts, and I am always saddened at the sight
of its gloomy loneliness; the capes, promontories, and bays ought to
have more attractive names, for Cape Farewell and Cape Desolation are
not of a sort to cheer sailors."

"I have often made the same remark," answered the doctor; "but these
names have a geographical value which is not to be forgotten; they
describe the adventures of those who gave them; along with the names
of Davis, Baffin, Hudson, Ross, Parry, Franklin, Bellot, if I find
Cape Desolation, I also find soon Mercy Bay; Cape Providence makes up
for Port Anxiety, Repulse Bay brings me to Cape Eden, and after
leaving Point Turnagain I rest in Refuge Bay; in that way I have under
my eyes the whole succession of dangers, checks, obstacles, successes,
despairs, and victories connected with the great names of my country;
and, like a series of antique medals, this nomenclature gives me the
whole history of these seas."

"Well reasoned, Doctor; and may we find more bays of Success in our
journey than capes of Despair!"

"I hope so, Johnson; but, tell me, have the crew got over their
fears?"

"Somewhat, sir; and yet, to tell the truth, since we entered these
straits, they have begun to be very uneasy about the unknown captain;
more than one expected to see him appear at the end of Greenland; and
so far no news of him. Between ourselves, Doctor, don't you think that
is a little strange!"

"Yes, Johnson, I do."

"Do you believe the captain exists?"

"Without any doubt."

"But what reason can he have had for acting in this way?"

"To speak frankly, Johnson, I imagine that he wants to get the crew so
far away that it will be impossible for them to turn back. Now, if he
had appeared on board when we set sail, and every one had known where
we were going, he might have been embarrassed."

"How so?"

"Why, if he wants to try any superhuman enterprise, if he wants to go
where so many have failed, do you think he would have succeeded in
shipping a crew? But, once on the way, it is easy to go so far that to
go farther becomes an absolute necessity."

"Possibly, Doctor; I have known more than one bold explorer, whose
name alone would have frightened every one, and who would have found
no one to accompany him on his perilous expeditions--"

"Except me," said the doctor.

"And me," continued Johnson. "I tell you our captain is probably one
of those men. At any rate, we shall know sooner or later; I suppose
that at Upernavik or Melville Bay he will come quietly on board, and
let us know whither he intends to take the ship."

"Very likely, Johnson; but the difficulty will be to get to Melville
Bay; see how thick the ice is about us! The _Forward_ can hardly make
her way through it. See there, that huge expanse!"

[Illustration]

"We whalers call that an ice-field, that is to say, an unbroken
surface of ice, the limits of which cannot be seen."

"And what do you call this broken field of long pieces more or less
closely connected?"

"That is a pack; if it's round we call it a patch, and a stream if it
is long."

"And that floating ice?"

"That is drift-ice; if a little higher it would be icebergs; they are
very dangerous to ships, and they have to be carefully avoided. See,
down there on the ice-field, that protuberance caused by the pressure
of the ice; we call that a hummock; if the base were under water, we
should call it a cake; we have to give names to them all to
distinguish them."

[Illustration]

"Ah, it is a strange sight," exclaimed the doctor, as he gazed at the
wonders of the northern seas; "one's imagination is touched by all
these different shapes!"

"True," answered Johnson, "the ice takes sometimes such curious
shapes; and we men never fail to explain them in our own way."

"See there, Johnson; see that singular collection of blocks of ice!
Would one not say it was a foreign city, an Eastern city, with
minarets and mosques in the moonlight? Farther off is a long row of
Gothic arches, which remind us of the chapel of Henry VII., or the
Houses of Parliament."

[Illustration: "Would one not say it was a foreign city, an Eastern
city, with minarets and mosques in the moonlight?"]

"Everything can be found there; but those cities or churches are very
dangerous, and we must not go too near them. Some of those minarets
are tottering, and the smallest of them would crush a ship like the
_Forward_."

"And yet men have dared to come into these seas under sail alone! How
could a ship be trusted in such perils without the aid of steam?"

"Still it has been done; when the wind is unfavorable, and I have
known that happen more than once, it is usual to anchor to one of
these blocks of ice; we should float more or less around with them,
but we would wait for a fair wind; it is true that, travelling in that
way, months would be sometimes wasted where we shall need only a few
days."

[Illustration]

"It seems to me," said the doctor, "that the temperature is falling."

"That would be a pity," answered Johnson, "for there will have to be a
thaw before these masses separate, and float away into the Atlantic;
besides, they are more numerous in Davis Strait, because the two
stretches of land approach one another between Cape Walsingham and
Holsteinborg; but above latitude 67° we shall find in May and June
more navigable seas."

"Yes; but we must get through this first."

"We must get through, Doctor; in June and July we should have found
the passage free, as do the whalers; but our orders were strict; we
had to be here in April. If I'm not very much mistaken, our captain is
a sound fellow with an idea firm in his head; his only reason for
leaving so early was to go far. Whoever survives will see."

The doctor was right about the falling of the temperature; at noon the
thermometer stood at 6°, and a breeze was blowing from the northwest,
which, while it cleared the sky, aided the current in accumulating the
floating ice in the path of the _Forward_. It did not all follow the
same course; often some pieces, and very high ones, too, floated in
the opposite direction under the influence of a submarine current.

The difficulties of this navigation may be readily understood; the
engineers had no repose; the engines were controlled from the bridge
by means of levers, which started, stopped, and reversed them
instantly, at the orders of the officer in command. Sometimes it was
necessary to hasten forward to enter an opening in the ice, again to
race with a mass of ice which threatened to block up their only
egress, or some piece, suddenly upsetting, obliged the brig to back
quickly, in order to escape destruction. This mass of ice, carried and
accumulated by the great polar current, was hurried through the
strait, and if the frost should unite it, it would present an
impassable barrier to the _Forward_.

[Illustration]

In these latitudes numberless birds were to be found; petrels and
contremaitres were flying here and there, with deafening cries; there
were also many gulls, with their large heads, short necks, and small
beaks, which were extending their long wings and braving the snow
which the storm was whirling about. This profusion of winged beings
enlivened the scene.

Numerous pieces of wood were drifting along, clashing continually into
one another; a few whales with large heads approached the ship; but
they could not think of chasing them, although Simpson, the harpooner,
earnestly desired it. Towards evening several seals were seen, which,
with their noses just above the water, were swimming among the great
pieces of ice.

On the 22d the temperature was still falling; the _Forward_ carried a
great deal of steam to reach an easier sailing-place; the wind blew
steadily from the northwest; the sails were furled.

During Sunday the sailors had little to do. After divine service,
which was read by Shandon, the crew betook themselves to chasing wild
birds, of which they caught a great many. These birds, prepared
according to Dr. Clawbonny's method, were an agreeable addition to the
messes of the officers and crew.

At three o'clock in the afternoon, the _Forward_ sighted the Kin of
Sael, which lay east one quarter northeast, and the Mount Sukkertop,
southeast one quarter east half-east; the sea was very high; from time
to time a dense fog descended suddenly from the gray sky.
Notwithstanding, at noon they were able to take an observation. The
ship was found to be in latitude 65° 20' and longitude 54° 22'. They
would have to go two degrees farther north before they would find
clearer sailing.

During the three following days, the 24th, 25th, and 26th of April,
they had uninterruptedly to fight with the ice; the management of the
engines became very tedious; every minute steam was shut off or
reversed, and escaped from the safety-valve.

In the dense mist their approach to the icebergs could be known only
by the dull roar of the avalanches; then the vessel would shift its
course at once; then there was the danger of running into the masses
of frozen fresh water, which were as clear as crystal and as hard as
stone. Richard Shandon used to take aboard a quantity of this ice
every day to supply the ship with fresh water.

The doctor could not accustom himself to the optical illusions
produced by refraction; indeed, an iceberg ten or twelve miles distant
used to seem to him to be a small piece of ice close by; he tried to
get used to this strange phenomenon, in order to be able by and by to
overcome the mistakes of his eyesight.

At last, both by towing the brig along the fields of ice and by
pushing off threatening blocks with poles, the crew was thoroughly
exhausted; and yet, on the 27th of April, the _Forward_ was still
detained on the impassable Polar Circle.

[Illustration]




CHAPTER VIII.
THE TALK OF THE CREW.


Nevertheless, by taking advantages of such openings as there were, the
_Forward_ succeeded in getting a few minutes farther north; but,
instead of escaping the enemy, it would soon be necessary to attack
it; ice-fields of many miles in extent were drawing together, and as
these moving masses often represent a pressure of ten millions of
tons, they were obliged to take every precaution against being crushed
by them. Ice-saws were placed outside the vessel, where they could be
used without delay.

Some of the crew endured their hard toil without a murmur, but others
complained or even refused to obey orders. While they were putting the
saws in place, Garry, Bolton, Pen, and Gripper exchanged their diverse
opinions as follows.

"Deuce take it," said Bolton, cheerfully; "I don't know why it just
occurs to me that in Water Street there's a comfortable tavern, where
one might be very well off between a glass of gin and a bottle of
porter. Can you see it from here, Gripper?"

"To tell the truth," answered the sailor who had been addressed, and
who generally pretended to be very sullen, "I must say I can't see it
from here."

"That's merely your way of talking, Gripper; it is evident that, in
those snow towns which Dr. Clawbonny is always admiring, there's no
tavern where a poor sailor can moisten his throat with a drink or two
of brandy."

"You may be sure of that, Bolton; and you might add that on board of
this ship there's no way of getting properly refreshed. A strange
idea, sending people into the northern seas, and giving them nothing
to drink!"

"Well," answered Garry, "have you forgotten, Gripper, what the doctor
said? One must go without spirits if he expects to escape the scurvy,
remain in good health, and sail far."

"I don't care to sail far, Garry; and I think it's enough to have come
as far as this, and to try to get through here where the Devil doesn't
mean to let us through."

"Well, we sha'n't get through," retorted Pen. "O, when I think I have
already forgotten how gin tastes!"

"But," said Bolton, "remember what the doctor said."

"O," answered Pen, with his rough voice, "that's all very well to say!
I fancy that they are economizing it under the pretext of saving our
health."

"Perhaps that devil Pen is right," said Gripper.

"Come, come!" replied Bolton, "his nose is too red for that; and if a
little abstinence should make it a trifle paler, Pen won't need to be
pitied."

"Don't trouble yourself about my nose," was the answer, for Pen was
rather vexed. "My nose doesn't need your advice; it doesn't ask for
it; you'd better mind your own business."

"Come, don't be angry, Pen; I didn't think your nose was so tender. I
should be as glad as any one else to have a glass of whiskey,
especially on such a cold day; but if in the long run it does more
harm than good, why, I'm very willing to get along without it."

"You may get along without it," said Warren, the stoker, who had
joined them, "but it's not everybody on board who gets along without
it."

"What do you mean, Warren?" asked Garry, looking at him intently.

"I mean that for one purpose or another there is liquor aboard, and I
fancy that aft they don't get on without it."

"What do you know about it?" asked Garry.

Warren could not answer; he spoke for the sake of speaking.

"You see, Garry," continued Bolton, "that Warren knows nothing about
it."

"Well," said Pen, "we'll ask the commander for a ration of gin; we
deserve it, and we'll see what he'll say."

"I advise you not to," said Garry.

"Why not?" cried Pen and Gripper.

"Because the commander will refuse it. You knew what the conditions
were when you shipped; you ought to think of that now."

"Besides," said Bolton, who was not averse to taking Garry's side, for
he liked him, "Richard Shandon is not master; he's under orders like
the rest of us."

"Whose orders?" asked Pen.

"The captain's."

"Ah, that ridiculous captain's!" cried Pen. "Don't you know there's no
more captain than there is tavern on the ice? That's a mean way of
refusing politely what we ask for."

"But there is a captain," persisted Bolton; "and I'll wager two
months' pay that we shall see him before long."

"All right!" said Pen; "I should like to give him a piece of my mind."

"Who's talking about the captain?" said a new speaker.

It was Clifton, who was inclined to be superstitious and envious at
the same time.

"Is there any news about the captain?" he asked.

"No," a single voice answered.

"Well, I expect to find him settled in his cabin some fine morning,
and without any one's knowing how or whence he came aboard."

"Nonsense!" answered Bolton; "you imagine, Clifton, that he's an imp,
a hobgoblin such as are seen in the Scotch Highlands."

"Laugh if you want to, Bolton; that won't alter my opinion. Every day
as I pass the cabin I peep in through the keyhole, and one of these
days I'll tell you what he looks like, and how he's made."

"O, the devil!" said Pen; "he'll look like everybody else. And if he
wants to lead us where we don't want to go, we'll let him know what we
think about it."

"All right," said Bolton; "Pen doesn't know him, and wants to quarrel
with him already."

"Who doesn't know all about him?" asked Clifton, with the air of a man
who has the whole story at his tongue's end; "I should like to know
who doesn't."

"What do you mean?" asked Gripper.

"I know very well what I mean."

"But we don't."

"Well, Pen has already had trouble with him."

"With the captain?"

"Yes, the dog-captain; for it's the same thing precisely."

The sailors gazed at one another, incapable of replying.

"Dog or man," muttered Pen, between his teeth, "I'll bet he'll get his
account settled one of these days."

"Why, Clifton," asked Bolton, seriously, "do you imagine, as Johnson
said in joke, that that dog is the real captain?"

"Certainly, I do," answered Clifton, with some warmth; "and if you had
watched him as carefully as I have, you'd have noticed his strange
ways."

"What ways? Tell us."

"Haven't you noticed the way he walks up and down the poop-deck as if
he commanded the ship, keeping his eye on the sails as if he were on
watch?"

"That's so," said Gripper; "and one evening I found him with his paws
on the wheel."

[Illustration]

"Impossible!" said Bolton.

"And then," continued Clifton, "doesn't he run out at night on the
ice-fields without caring for the bears or the cold?"

"That's true," said Bolton.

"Did you ever see him making up to the men like an honest dog, or
hanging around the kitchen, and following the cook when he's carrying
a savory dish to the officers? Haven't you all heard him at night,
when he's run two or three miles away from the vessel, howling so that
he makes your blood run cold, and that's not easy in weather like
this? Did you ever seen him eat anything? He never takes a morsel from
any one; he never touches the food that's given him, and, unless some
one on board feeds him secretly, I can say he lives without eating.
Now, if that's not strange, I'm no better than a beast myself."

"Upon my word," answered Bell, the carpenter, who had heard all of
Clifton's speech, "it may be so."

But all the other sailors were silent.

"Well, as for me," continued Clifton, "I can say that if you don't
believe, there are wiser people on board who don't seem so sure."

"Do you mean the mate?" asked Bolton.

"Yes, the mate and the doctor."

"Do you think they fancy the same thing?"

"I have heard them talking about it, and they could make no more out
of it than we can; they imagined a thousand things which did not
satisfy them in the least."

"Did they say the same things about the dog that you did, Clifton?"
asked the carpenter.

"If they were not talking about the dog," answered Clifton, who was
fairly cornered, "they were talking about the captain; it's exactly
the same thing, and they confessed it was all very strange."

"Well, my friends," said Bell, "do you want to hear my opinion?"

"What is it!" they all cried.

"It is that there is not, and there will not be, any other captain
than Richard Shandon."

"And the letter?" said Clifton.

"The letter was genuine," answered Bell; "it is perfectly true that
some unknown person has equipped the _Forward_ for an expedition in
the ice; but the ship once off, no one will come on board."

"Well," asked Bolton, "where is the ship going to?"

"I don't know; at the right time, Richard Shandon will get the rest of
the instructions."

"But from whom?"

"From whom?"

"Yes, in what way?" asked Bolton, who was becoming persistent.

"Come, Bell, an answer," said the other sailors.

"From whom? in what way? O, I'm sure I don't know!"

"Well, from the dog!" cried Clifton. "He has already written once, and
he can again. O, if I only knew half as much as he does, I might be
First Lord of the Admiralty!"

"So," added Bolton, in conclusion, "you persist in saying that dog is
the captain?"

"Yes, I do."

"Well," said Pen, gruffly, "if that beast doesn't want to die in a
dog's skin, he'd better hurry and turn into a man; for, on my word,
I'll finish him."

"Why so?" asked Garry.

"Because I want to," answered Pen, brutally; "and I don't care what
any one says."

"You have been talking long enough, men," shouted the boatswain,
advancing at the moment when the conversation threatened to become
dangerous; "to work, and have the saws put in quicker! We must get
through the ice."

"Good! on Friday too," answered Clifton, shrugging his shoulders. "You
won't find it so easy to cross the Polar Circle."

Whatever the reason may have been, the exertions of the crew on that
day were nearly fruitless. The _Forward_, plunging, under a full head
of steam, against the floes, could not separate them; they were
obliged to lie at anchor that night.

On Saturday, the temperature fell still lower under the influence of
an east-wind; the sky cleared up, and they all had a wide view over
the white expense, which shone brilliantly beneath the bright rays of
the sun. At seven o'clock in the morning, the thermometer stood at 8°
above zero.

The doctor was tempted to remain quietly in his cabin, or read over
the accounts of arctic journeys; but he asked himself, following his
usual habit, what would be the most disagreeable thing he could do at
that moment. He thought that to go on deck on such a cold day and help
the men would not be attractive. So, faithful to his line of conduct,
he left his well-warmed cabin, and went out to help tow the ship. He
looked strange with his green glasses, which he wore to protect his
eyes against the brilliancy of the sun, and after that he always took
good care to wear snow-spectacles as a security against the
inflammation of the eyes, which is so common in these latitudes.

[Illustration]

By evening the _Forward_ had got several miles farther north, thanks
to the energy of the men and the intelligence of Shandon, who was
quick at utilizing every favorable circumstance; at midnight they
crossed the sixty-sixth parallel, and the lead announcing a depth of
twenty-three fathoms, Shandon knew that he was in the neighborhood of
the shoal on which her Majesty's ship _Victory_ grounded. Land lay
thirty miles to the east.

But then the mass of ice, which had hitherto been stationary,
separated, and began to move; icebergs seemed to rise in all points of
the horizon; the brig was caught in a number of whirlpools of
irresistible force; controlling her became so hard, that Garry, the
best steersman, took the helm; the masses began to close behind the
brig, hence it was necessary to cut through the ice; both prudence and
duty commanded them to go forward. The difficulties were enhanced by
the impossibility of Shandon's fixing the direction of the brig among
all the changing points, which were continually shifting and
presenting no definite point to be aimed at.

The crew were divided into two forces, and one stationed on the
starboard, the other on the larboard side; every man was given a long
iron-headed pole, with which to ward off threatening pieces of ice.
Soon the _Forward_ entered such a narrow passage between two lofty
pieces, that the ends of the yards touched its solid walls; gradually
it penetrated farther into a winding valley filled with a whirlwind of
snow, while the floating ice was crashing ominously all about.

But soon it was evident that there was no outlet to this gorge; a huge
block, caught in the channel, was floating swiftly down to the
_Forward_; it seemed impossible to escape it, and equally impossible
to return through an already closed path.

Shandon and Johnson, standing on the forward deck, were viewing their
position. Shandon with his right hand signalled to the man at the
wheel what direction he was to take, and with his left hand he
indicated to James Wall the orders for the engines.

"What will be the end of this?" asked the doctor of Johnson.

"What pleases God," answered the boatswain.

The block of ice, eight hundred feet high, was hardly more than a
cable's length from the _Forward_, and threatened to crush it.

Pen broke out with a fearful oath.

"Silence!" cried a voice which it was impossible to recognize in the
roar of the hurricane.

The mass appeared to be falling upon the brig, and there was an
indefinable moment of terror; the men, dropping their poles, ran aft
in spite of Shandon's orders.

Suddenly, a terrible noise was heard; a real water-spout fell on the
deck of the brig, which was lifted in the air by a huge wave. The crew
uttered a cry of terror, while Garry, still firm at the wheel, kept
the course of the _Forward_ steady, in spite of the fearful lurch.

[Illustration]

And when they looked for the mountain of ice, it had disappeared; the
passage was free, and beyond, a long channel, lit up by the sun,
allowed the brig to continue her advance.

"Well, Dr. Clawbonny," said Johnson, "can you explain that?"

"It's very simple, my friend," answered the doctor. "It happens very
often; when these floating masses get detached in a thaw, they float
away in perfect equilibrium; but as they get towards the south, where
the water is relatively warmer, their base, eaten away by running into
other pieces, begins to melt, and be undermined; then comes a moment
when the centre of gravity is displaced, and they turn upside down.
Only, if this had happened two minutes later, it would have fallen on
the brig and crushed us beneath it."

[Illustration]




CHAPTER IX.
ANOTHER LETTER.


The Polar Circle was crossed at last; on the 30th of April, at midday,
the _Forward_ passed by Holsteinborg; picturesque mountains arose in
the east. The sea appeared almost free of ice, or, more exactly, the
ice could be avoided. The wind was from the southeast, and the brig,
under foresail, staysail, and topsails, sailed up Baffin's Bay.

That day was exceptionally calm and the crew was able to get some
rest; numerous birds were swimming and flying about the ship; among
others, the doctor noticed some wild birds which were very like teal,
with black neck, wings, and back, and a white breast; they were
continually diving, and often remained more than forty seconds under
water.

This day would not have been marked by any new incident, if the
following extraordinary fact had not taken place.

At six o'clock in the morning, on returning to his cabin after his
watch was over, Richard Shandon found on his table a letter, addressed
as follows:--

_To_ COMMANDER RICHARD SHANDON,
On board the _Forward_,
BAFFIN'S BAY.

[Illustration]

Shandon could not believe his eyes; but before reading it, he summoned
the doctor, James Wall, and the boatswain, and showed them the letter.

"It's getting interesting," said Johnson.

"It's delightful," thought the doctor.

"Well," cried Shandon, "at last we shall know his secret."

He tore open the envelope rapidly, and read the following:--


COMMANDER: The captain of the _Forward_ is satisfied with the
coolness, skill, and courage which the crew, officers, and you,
yourself, have shown of late; he begs of you to express his thanks to
the crew.

Be good enough to sail due north towards Melville Bay, and thence try
to penetrate into Smith's Sound.

K. Z.,
_Captain of the Forward_.

Monday, April 30, OFF CAPE WALSINGHAM.


"And is that all?" cried the doctor.

"That's all," answered Shandon.

The letter fell from his hands.

"Well," said Wall, "this imaginary captain says nothing about coming
on board. I don't believe he ever will."

"But how did this letter get here?" asked Johnson.

Shandon was silent.

"Mr. Wall is right," answered the doctor, who had picked up the
letter, and who was turning it over with hands as well as in his mind.
"The captain won't come on board, and for an excellent reason."

"What is it?" asked Shandon, quickly.

"Because he's on board now," answered the doctor, simply.

"Now!" exclaimed Shandon, "what do you mean?"

"How else can you explain the arrival of this letter?"

Johnson nodded approvingly.

"Impossible!" said Shandon, warmly. "I know all the men in the crew;
can he have smuggled himself into their number since we left? It's
impossible, I tell you. For more than two years I've seen every one of
them more than a hundred times in Liverpool; so your conjecture,
Doctor, is untenable."

"Well, what do you admit, Shandon?"

"Everything, except that. I admit that the captain or some tool of
his, for all I know, may have taken advantage of the darkness, the
mist, or whatever you please, to slip on board; we are not far from
shore; there are the kayaks of the Esquimaux which could get through
the ice without our seeing them; so some one may have come on board
the ship, left the letter,--the fog was thick enough to make this
possible."

"And to prevent them from seeing the brig," answered the doctor; "if
we didn't see the intruder slip aboard the _Forward_, how could he see
the _Forward_ in the fog?"

"That's true," said Johnson.

"So I return to my explanation," said the doctor; "what do you think
of it, Shandon?"

"Whatever you please," answered Shandon, hotly, "except that the man
is on board."

"Perhaps," added Wall, "there is some man in the crew who is acting
under his instructions."

"Perhaps," said the doctor.

"But who can it be?" asked Shandon. "I've known all my men for a long
time."

"At any rate," resumed Johnson, "if this captain presents himself,
whether as man or devil, we shall receive him; but there's something
else to be drawn from this letter."

"What is that?" asked Shandon.

"It is that we must go not only into Melville Bay, but also into
Smith's Sound."

"You are right," said the doctor.

"Smith's Sound," repeated Shandon, mechanically.

"So it's very plain," continued Johnson, "that the _Forward_ is not
intended to seek the Northwest Passage, since we leave to the left,
the only way towards it, that is to say, Lancaster Sound. This would
seem to promise a difficult journey in unknown seas."

"Yes, Smith's Sound," replied Shandon; "that's the route Kane, the
American, took in 1853, and it was full of dangers. For a long time he
was given up for lost. Well, if we must go, we'll go. But how far? To
the Pole?"

"And why not?" cried the doctor.

The mention of such a foolhardy attempt made the boatswain shrug his
shoulders.

"Well," said James Wall, "to come back to the captain, if he exists. I
don't see that there are any places on the coast of Greenland except
Disco and Upernavik, where he can be waiting for us; in a few days
that question will be settled."

"But," asked the doctor of Shandon, "are you not going to tell the
crew about this letter?"

"With the commander's permission," answered Johnson, "I should not do
so."

"And why not?" asked Shandon.

"Because everything mysterious and extraordinary tends to discourage
the men; they are already very much troubled, as it is, about the
nature of the journey. Now, if any supernatural circumstances should
become known, it might be harmful, and perhaps at a critical moment we
should not be able to count on them. What do you think, Commander?"

"And what do you think, Doctor?" asked Shandon.

"Boatswain Johnson seems to me to reason well," answered the doctor.

"And you, James?"

"Having no better opinion, I agree with these gentlemen."

Shandon reflected for a few minutes; he reread the letter attentively.

"Gentlemen," said he, "your opinion is certainly worthy of respect,
but I cannot adopt it."

"Why not, Shandon?" asked the doctor.

"Because the instructions in this letter are formal; it tells me to
give the captain's thanks to the crew; now, hitherto I have strictly
obeyed his orders, in whatever way they have been given to me, and I
cannot--"

"Still--" interposed Johnson, who had a warrantable dread of the
effect of such communications on the men's spirits.

"My dear Johnson," said Shandon, "I understand your objection; your
reasons are very good, but read that:--

"He begs of you to express his thanks to the crew."

"Do as he bids," replied Johnson, who was always a strict
disciplinarian. "Shall I assemble the crew on deck?"

"Yes," answered Shandon.

The news of a message from the captain was immediately whispered
throughout the ship. The sailors took their station without delay, and
the commander read aloud the mysterious letter.

It was received with dead silence; the crew separated under the
influence of a thousand suppositions; Clifton had plenty of material
for any superstitious vagaries; a great deal was ascribed by him to
the dog-captain, and he never failed to salute him every time he met
him.

"Didn't I tell you," he used to say to the sailors, "that he knew how
to write?"

No one made any answer, and even Bell, the carpenter, would have found
it hard to reply.

Nevertheless, it was plain to every one, that if the captain was not
on board, his shade or spirit was watching them; henceforth, the
wisest kept their opinions to themselves.

At midday of May 1st, their observation showed them that they were in
latitude 68° and longitude 56° 32'. The temperature had risen, the
thermometer standing at 25° above zero.

The doctor amused himself with watching the gambols of a she-bear and
two cubs on some pack-ice near the shore. Accompanied by Wall and
Simpson, he tried to chase them in a canoe; but she was in a very
peaceful mood, and ran away with her young, so that the doctor had to
give up his attempt.

[Illustration]

During the night a favorable breeze carried them well to the north,
and soon the lofty mountains of Disco were peering above the horizon;
Godharn Bay, where the governor of the Danish settlements lived, was
left on the right. Shandon did not consider it necessary to land, and
he soon passed by the canoes of the Esquimaux, who had put out to meet
him.

The island of Disco is also called Whale Island; it is from here that,
on the 12th of July, 1845, Sir John Franklin wrote to the Admiralty
for the last time, and it was also here that Captain MacClintock
stopped on his way back, bringing too sure proofs of the loss of that
expedition.

This coincidence was not unknown to the doctor; the place was one of
sad memories, but soon the heights of Disco were lost to view.

There were many icebergs on its shores, which no thaws ever melt away;
this gives the island a singular appearance from the sea.

The next day, at about three o'clock, Sanderson's Hope appeared in the
northeast; land lay about fifteen miles to starboard; the mountains
appeared of a dusky red hue. During the evening many fin-backs were
seen playing in the ice, and occasionally blowing.

[Illustration]

It was in the night of May 3d, that the doctor for the first time saw
the sun touch the horizon without setting; since January 31st its
orbit had been getting longer every day, and now there was unbroken
daylight.

For those who were unaccustomed to it, this continuance of the day is
a cause of perpetual surprise, and even of weariness; it is difficult
to believe how necessary the darkness of the night is for the eyes;
the doctor actually suffered from the continual brilliancy, which was
increased by the reflection from the ice.

May 5th the _Forward_ passed the sixty-second parallel. Two months
later they would have met numerous whalers in these latitudes; but the
straits were not yet free enough to allow easy ingress into Baffin's
Bay.

The next day, the brig, after passing Woman's Island, came in sight of
Upernavik, the northernmost station of Denmark in these lands.

CHAPTER X.
DANGEROUS SAILING.


Shandon, Dr. Clawbonny, Johnson, Foker, and Strong, the cook, got into
one of the boats and made their way to shore.

The Governor, his wife and five children, all Esquimaux, received
their visitors kindly. The doctor, who was the philologist of the
party, knew enough Danish to establish friendly relations; moreover,
Foker, the interpreter of the party as well as ice-master, knew a
dozen or two words of the language of the Greenlanders, and with that
number of words one can express a great deal, if he is not too
ambitious.

[Illustration]

The Governor was born on the island of Disco, and he has never left
the place; he did the honors of his capital, which consisted of three
wooden houses, for himself and the Lutheran minister, of a school, and
shops which were supplied by what was cast upon the shore from wrecked
ships. The rest of the town consisted of snow huts, into which the
Esquimaux crawl through a single opening.

A great part of the population came out to meet the _Forward_, and
more than one of them went as far as the middle of the bay in his
kayak, fifteen feet long and two broad at the widest part.

The doctor knew that the word Esquimaux meant "eater of raw fish"; but
he knew too that this name is considered an insult in this country, so
he forbore giving it to the inhabitants of Greenland.

And yet, from the oily sealskin clothes and boots, from their squat,
fat figures, which make it hard to distinguish the men from the women,
it was easy to declare the nature of their food; besides, like all
fish-eating people, they were somewhat troubled by leprosy, but their
general health was not impaired by it.

The Lutheran minister and his wife, with whom the doctor had promised
himself an interesting talk, happened to be away on the shore of
Proven, south of Upernavik; hence he was compelled to seek the company
of the Governor. The chief magistrate did not appear to be very well
informed: a little less, he would have been a fool; a little more, and
he would have known how to read.

In spite of that, the doctor questioned him about the commerce,
habits, and manners of the Esquimaux; and he learned, by means of
gestures, that the seals were worth about forty pounds when delivered
at Copenhagen; a bear-skin brought forty Danish dollars, the skin of a
blue fox four, and of a white fox two or three dollars.

In order to make his knowledge complete, the doctor wanted to visit an
Esquimaux hut; a man who seeks information is capable of enduring
anything; fortunately the opening of these huts was too small, and the
enthusiastic doctor could not get through. It was fortunate for him,
for there is nothing more repulsive than the sight of that crowd of
living and dead objects, of seal's bodies and Esquimaux-flesh, decayed
fish and unclean clothing, which fill a Greenland hut; there is no
window to renew that suffocating air; there is only a hole at the top
of the cabin which lets the smoke out, but gives no relief to the
stench.

[Illustration: "Fortunately the opening of these huts was too small,
and the enthusiastic doctor could not get through."]

Foker gave all these details to the doctor, but he none the less
bewailed his portliness. He wanted to judge for himself these
emanations _sui generis_.

"I am sure," said he, "that one could get used to it in time." _In
time_ shows clearly the doctor's character.

During these ethnographic studies on his part, Shandon was busying
himself, according to his instructions, with procuring means of travel
on the ice; he was obliged to pay four pounds for a sledge and six
dogs, and the natives were reluctant to sell even at this price.

[Illustration]

Shandon would have liked to engage Hans Christian, the skilful driver
of the dogs, who accompanied Captain MacClintock, but Hans was then in
Southern Greenland.

Then came up the great question of the day; was there at Upernavik a
European awaiting the arrival of the _Forward_? Did the Governor know
of any stranger, probably an Englishman, who had come into these
latitudes? How recently had they seen any whalers or other ships?

To these questions the Governor answered that no stranger had landed
on that part of the coast for more than ten months.

Shandon asked the names of the whalers which had last arrived; he
recognized none. He was in despair.

"You must confess, Doctor, that it passes all comprehension," he said
to his companion. "Nothing at Cape Farewell! nothing at Disco! nothing
at Upernavik!"

"Tell me in a few days from now, nothing at Melville Bay, my dear
Shandon, and I will salute you as sole captain of the _Forward_."

The boat returned to the brig towards evening, bringing back the
visitors to the shore; Strong had bought several dozen eider-duck's
eggs, which were twice as large as hen's eggs, and of a greenish
color. It was not much, but it was very refreshing for a crew
accustomed to little but salt meat.

The next day the wind was fair, but yet Shandon did not set sail; he
wanted to wait another day, and, to satisfy his conscience, to give
time for any member of the human race to rejoin the _Forward_; he even
fired off, every hour, the ship's gun, which re-echoed among the
icebergs; but he only succeeded in frightening the flocks of
molly-mokes[1] and rotches.[1] During the night many rockets were set
off; but in vain. He had to give the order to set sail.

[Footnote 1: Sea-birds common in these latitudes.]

The 8th of May, at six o'clock in the morning, the _Forward_, under
her topsails, foresail, and main-top-gallant-sail, soon lost sight of
the station of Upernavik, and hideous long poles on which were hanging
along the shore the seals' entrails and deers' stomachs.

The wind was southeast, the thermometer stood at 32°. The sun pierced
through the fog and the ice melted a little.

The reflection, however, injured the sight of many of the crew.
Wolston, the armorer, Gripper, Clifton, and Bell were attacked by
snow-blindness, which is very common in the spring, and which totally
blinds many of the Esquimaux. The doctor advised all, the unharmed as
well as the suffering, to cover their faces with a green veil, and he
was the first to follow his own recommendation.

The dogs bought by Shandon at Upernavik were rather wild; but they
soon got used to their new quarters, and Captain showed no dislike of
his new companions; he seemed to know their ways. Clifton was not the
last to remark that Captain seemed to be familiar with the dogs of
Greenland. And they, always half starved on shore, only thought of
making up for it when at sea.

The 9th of May the _Forward_ passed within a few cable-lengths of the
westernmost of the Baffin Islands. The doctor noticed many rocks
between the islands and the mainland which were what are called
crimson cliffs; they were covered with snow as red as carmine, which
Dr. Kane says is of purely vegetable origin; Clawbonny wanted to
examine this singular phenomenon, but the ice forbade their
approaching them; although the temperature was rising, it was easy to
see that the icebergs and ice-streams were accumulating toward the
north of Baffin's Bay.

After leaving Upernavik the land presented a different appearance, and
huge glaciers were sharply defined against the gray horizon. On the
10th the _Forward_ left on its right Kingston Bay, near the
seventy-fourth degree of latitude; Lancaster Sound opened into the sea
many hundred miles to the west.

But then this vast expanse of water was hidden beneath enormous fields
of ice, in which arose the hummocks, uniform as a homogeneous
crystallization. Shandon had the furnace-fires lighted, and until the
11th of May the _Forward_ advanced by a tortuous course, tracing with
her smoke against the sky the path she was following through the
water.

But new obstacles soon presented themselves; the passages were closing
in consequence of the incessant crowding of the floating masses; every
moment threatened to close up the clear water before the _Forward_,
and if she were nipped, it would be hard to get her out. Every one
knew it and was thinking about it.

Hence, on board of this ship without any definite aim, any known
destination, which was blindly pushing on northward, some symptoms of
hesitation began to appear; among these men accustomed to dangers,
many, forgetting the advantages which were promised them, regretted
having ventured so far. A certain demoralization became common, which
was further increased by the fears of Clifton and the talk of two or
three ringleaders, such as Pen, Gripper, Warren, and Wolston.

Exhausting fatigue was added to the moral disquiet of the crew, for,
on the 12th of May, the brig was caught fast; the steam was of no
avail. A path had to be cut through the ice. It was no easy task to
manage the saws in the floes which were six or seven feet thick; when
two parallel grooves had divided the ice for a hundred feet, it was
necessary to break the part that lay between with axes and bars; next
they had to fasten anchors in a hole made by a huge auger; then the
crew would turn the capstan and haul the ship along by the force of
their arms; the greatest difficulty consisted in driving the detached
pieces beneath the floes, so as to give space for the vessel, and they
had to be pushed under by means of long iron-headed poles.

[Illustration]

Moreover, this continued toil with saws, capstan, and poles, all of
which was persistent, compulsory, and dangerous, amid the dense fog or
snow, while the air was so cold, and their eyes so exposed, their
doubt so great, did much to weaken the crew of the _Forward_ and to
act on their imagination.

When sailors have to deal with a man who is energetic, bold, and
determined, who knows what he wants, whither he is going, what aim he
has in view, confidence animates them all in spite of themselves; they
are firmly united to their leader, strong with his force and calm with
his calmness. But on board of the brig they were aware of the
commander's uncertainty, they knew that he hesitated before the
unknown aim and destination. In spite of the energy of his character,
his uncertainty was clearly to be seen by his uncertain orders,
incomplete manoeuvres, his sudden outbursts, and a thousand petty
details which could not escape the sharp eyes of the crew.

And then, Shandon was not the captain of the ship, the master under
God, which was enough to encourage the discussion of his orders; and
from discussion to disobedience is but a short step.

The malcontents soon brought over to their number the first engineer,
who, hitherto, had been a slave to his duty.

The 16th of May, six days after the _Forward_ had reached the ice,
Shandon had not made two miles to northward. They were threatened with
being detained in the ice until the next season. Matters had a serious
look.

Towards eight o'clock of the evening, Shandon and the doctor,
accompanied by Garry, went out to reconnoitre the vast plains; they
took care not to go too far from the ship, for it was hard to find any
fixed points in this white solitude, which was ever changing in
appearance. Refraction kept producing strange effects, much to the
doctor's astonishment; at one place, where he thought he had but an
easy jump before him, he had to leap some five or six feet; or else
the contrary happened, and in either case the result was a tumble,
which if not dangerous was at any rate painful, for the ice was as
hard and slippery as glass.

Shandon and his two companions went out to seek a possible passage;
three miles from the ship, they succeeded with some difficulty in
ascending an iceberg about three hundred feet high. From that point
nothing met their eyes but a confused mass, like the ruins of a vast
city, with shattered monuments, overthrown towers, and prostrate
palaces,--a real chaos. The sun was just peering above the jagged
horizon, and sent forth long, oblique rays of light, but not of heat,
as if something impassable for heat lay between it and this wild
country.

[Illustration]

The sea appeared perfectly covered as far as eye could reach.

"How shall we get through?" asked the doctor.

"I don't know," answered Shandon; "but we shall get through, if we
have to blow our way through with powder. I certainly sha'n't stay in
the ice till next spring."

"But that happened to the _Fox_, and not far from here. Bah!" said the
doctor; "we shall get through with a little philosophy. You will see
that is worth all the machinery in the world."

"I must say," answered Shandon, "this year does not begin very well."

"True, Shandon, and I notice also that Baffin's Bay seems to be
returning to the state it was in before 1817."

"Don't you think, Doctor, it has always been as it is now?"

"No, my dear Shandon, from time to time there have been great
breakings of the ice which no one can explain; so, up to 1817 this sea
was continually full, when an enormous sort of inundation took place,
which cast the icebergs into the ocean, most of which reached the
banks of Newfoundland. From that day Baffin's Bay was nearly free, and
was visited by whalers."

"So," asked Shandon, "from that time voyages to the North became
easier?"

"Incomparably; but for some years it has been noticed that the bay
seems to be resuming its old ways and threatens to become closed,
possibly for a long time, to sailors. An additional reason, by the
way, for pushing on as far as possible. And yet it must be said, we
look like people who are pushing on in unknown ways, with the doors
forever closing behind us."

"Would you advise me to go back?" asked Shandon, trying to read into
the depths of the doctor's eyes.

"I! I have never retreated yet, and, even if we should never get back,
I say go on. Still, I want to make it clear that if we act
imprudently, we do it with our eyes open."

"And you, Garry, what do you think about it?" asked Shandon of the
sailor.

"I, Commander, should go straight on; I agree with Dr. Clawbonny; but
do as you please; command, we shall obey."

"They don't all talk as you do, Garry," resumed Shandon; "they are not
all ready to obey. And if they refuse to obey my orders?"

"I have given you my opinion, Commander," answered Garry, coldly,
"because you asked for it; but you are not obliged to follow it."

Shandon did not answer; he scanned the horizon closely, and then
descended with his companions to the ice-fields.




CHAPTER XI.
THE DEVIL'S THUMB.


During the commander's absence the men had been variously busied in
attempts to relieve the ship from the pressure of the ice. Pen,
Clifton, Bolton, Gripper, and Simpson had this in charge; the fireman
and the two engineers came to the aid of their comrades, for, as soon
as the engines did not require their attention, they became sailors,
and as such could be employed in all that was going on aboard the
ship.

But there was a great deal of discontent among them.

"I declare I've had enough," said Pen; "and if we are not free in
three days, I swear I sha'n't stir a finger to get the ship out."

"Not stir a finger!" answered Plover; "you'd better use them in
getting back. Do you think we want to stay here till next year?"

"It certainly would be a hard winter," said Pen, "for we are exposed
on all sides."

"And who knows," said Brunton, "whether next spring the sea will be
any freer than it is now?"

"Never mind about next spring," answered Pen; "to-day is Thursday; if
the way is not clear Sunday morning, we shall turn back to the south."

"Good!" cried Clifton.

"Don't you agree with me?" asked Pen.

"We do," cried his companions.

"That's so," said Warren; "for if we have to work in this way and haul
the ship along with our own arms, I think it would be as well to haul
her backwards."

"We shall do that on Sunday," said Wolston.

"Only give me the order," resumed Brunton, "and my fires shall be
lighted."

"Well," remarked Clifton, "we shall light them ourselves."

"If any officer," said Pen, "is anxious to spend the winter here, he
can; we can leave him here contentedly; he'll find it easy to build a
hut like the Esquimaux."

"Not at all, Pen," retorted Brunton, quickly; "we sha'n't abandon any
one here; do you understand that, all of you? I think it won't be hard
to persuade the commander; he seems to me to be very much discouraged,
and if we propose it to him gently--"

"But," interrupted Plover, "Richard Shandon is often very obstinate;
we shall have to sound him cautiously."

"When I think," said Bolton, with a sigh of longing, "that in a month
we might be back in Liverpool! We can easily pass the line of ice at
the south! Davis Strait will be open by the beginning of June, and
then we shall have nothing but the free Atlantic before us."

"Besides," said the cautious Clifton, "if we take the commander back
with us, and act under his commands, we shall have earned our pay; but
if we go back without him, it's not so sure."

"True," said Plover; "Clifton talks sense. Let's try not to get into
any trouble with the Admiralty, that's safer, and don't let us leave
any one behind."

"But if they refuse to come with us?" continued Pen, who wished to
compel his companions to stand by him.

They found it hard to answer the question thus squarely put them.

"We shall see about that when the time comes," replied Bolton; "it
will be enough to bring Richard Shandon over to our side, and I fancy
that won't be hard."

"There's one I shall leave here," exclaimed Pen with fierce oaths,
"even if he should bite my arm off."

"O, the dog!" said Plover.

"Yes, that dog! I shall soon settle accounts with him."

"So much the better," retorted Clifton, returning to his favorite
theory; "he is the cause of all our troubles."

"He has thrown an evil spell upon us," said Plover.

"He led us into the ice," remarked Gripper.

"He brought more ice in our way," said Wolston, "than was ever seen at
this season."

"He made my eyes sore," said Brunton.

"He shut off the gin and brandy," cried Pen.

"He's the cause of everything," they all exclaimed excitedly.

"And then," added Clifton, "he's the captain."

"Well, you unlucky Captain," cried Pen, whose unreasonable fury grew
with the sound of his own words, "you wanted to come here, and here
you shall stay!"

"But how shall we get hold of him?" said Plover.

"Well, now is a good time," answered Clifton. "The commander is away;
the second mate is asleep in his cabin; the fog is so thick that
Johnson can't see us--"

"But the dog?" said Pen.

"He's asleep in the coal," answered Clifton, "and if any one wants--"

"I'll see to it," replied Pen, angrily.

"Take care, Pen; his teeth would go through a bar of iron."

"If he stirs, I'll rip him open," answered Pen, drawing his knife.

And he ran down between decks, followed by Warren, who was anxious to
help him.

Soon they both returned, carrying the dog in their arms; his mouth and
paws were securely tied; they had caught him asleep, and the poor dog
could not escape them.

"Hurrah for Pen!" cried Plover.

"And what are you going to do with him now?" asked Clifton.

"Drown him, and if he ever comes back--" answered Pen with a smile of
satisfaction.

Two hundred feet from the vessel there was a hole in the ice, a sort
of circular crevasse, made by the seals with their teeth, and always
dug out from the inside to the outside; it was there that the seals
used to come to breathe on the surface of the ice; but they were
compelled to take care to prevent the aperture from closing, for the
shape of their jaws did not permit them to make the hole from the
outside, and in any danger they would not be able to escape from their
enemies.

Pen and Warren hastened to this crevasse, and then, in spite of his
obstinate struggles, the dog was pitilessly cast into the sea; a huge
cake of ice they then rolled over the aperture, closing all means of
escape for the poor dog, thus locked in a watery prison.

[Illustration]

"A pleasant journey, Captain!" cried the brutal sailor.

Soon they returned on board; Johnson had seen nothing of it all; the
fog was growing thick about the ship, and the snow was beginning to
fall with violence.

An hour later, Richard Shandon, the doctor, and Garry regained the
_Forward_.

Shandon had observed in the northeast a passage, which he determined
to try. He gave his orders to that effect; the crew obeyed with a
certain activity; they wanted to convince Shandon of the impossibility
of a farther advance, and besides, they had before them three days of
obedience.

During a part of the following night and day the sawing and towing
went on busily; the _Forward_ made about two miles of progress. On the
18th they were in sight of land, five or six cable-lengths from a
strange peak, to which its singular shape had given the name of the
Devil's Thumb.

[Illustration]

At this very place the _Prince Albert_, in 1851, the _Advance_, with
Kane, in 1853, had been caught in the ice for many weeks.

The odd shape of the Devil's Thumb, the barren and desolate
surroundings, which consisted of huge icebergs often more than three
hundred feet high, the cracking of the ice, repeated indefinitely by
the echo, made the position of the _Forward_ a very gloomy one.
Shandon saw that it was necessary to get away from there; within
twenty-four hours, he calculated he would be able to get two miles
from the spot. But that was not enough. Shandon felt himself
embarrassed by fear, and the false position in which he was placed
benumbed his energy; to obey his instructions in order to advance, he
had brought his ship into a dangerous position; the towing wore out
his men; more than three hours were necessary to cut a canal twenty
feet in length through ice which was generally four or five feet
thick; the health of the crew gave signs of failing. Shandon was
astonished at the silence of the men, and their unaccustomed
obedience; but he feared it was only the calm that foreboded a storm.

We can, then, easily judge of the painful surprise, disappointment,
and even despair which seized upon him, when he noticed that by means
of an imperceptible movement in the ice, the _Forward_ lost in the
night of the 18th all that had been gained by such toilsome efforts;
on Saturday morning he was opposite the Devil's Thumb, in a still more
critical position; the icebergs increased in number and passed by in
the mist like phantoms.

Shandon was thoroughly demoralized; it must be said that fear seized
both this bold man and all his crew. Shandon had heard of the
disappearance of the dog; but he did not dare to punish the guilty
persons; he feared exciting a mutiny.

The weather during that day was horrible; the snow, caught up in dense
whirls, covered the brig with an impenetrable veil; at times, under
the influence of the hurricane, the fog would rise, and their
terror-stricken eyes beheld the Devil's Thumb rising on the shore like
a spectre.

The _Forward_ was anchored to a large piece of ice; there was nothing
to be done, nothing to be tried; darkness was spreading about them,
and the man at the helm could not see James Wall, who was on watch
forward.

Shandon withdrew to his cabin, a prey to perpetual disquiet; the
doctor was arranging his notes of the expedition; some of the crew
were on the deck, others in the common room.

At a moment when the violence of the storm was redoubling, the Devil's
Thumb seemed to rise immoderately from the mist.

"Great God!" exclaimed Simpson, recoiling with terror.

"What's the matter?" asked Foker.

Soon shouts were heard on all sides.

"It's going to crush us!"

"We are lost!"

"Mr. Wall, Mr. Wall!"

"It's all over!"

"Commander, Commander!"

All these cries were uttered by the men on watch.

Wall hastened to the after-deck; Shandon, followed by the doctor, flew
to the deck and looked out.

Through a rift in the mist, the Devil's Thumb appeared to have
suddenly come near the brig; it seemed to have grown enormously in
size; on its summit was balanced a second cone, upside down, and
revolving on its point; it threatened to crush the ship with its
enormous mass; it wavered, ready to fall down. It was an alarming
sight. Every one drew back instinctively, and many of the men, jumping
upon the ice, abandoned the ship.

[Illustration]

"Let no one move!" cried the commander with a loud voice; "every one
to his place!"

"My friends, don't be frightened," said the doctor, "there is no
danger! See, Commander, see, Mr. Wall, that's the mirage and nothing
else."

"You are right, Dr. Clawbonny," replied Johnson; "they've all been
frightened by a shadow."

When they had heard what the doctor said, most of the sailors drew
near him, and from terror they turned to admiration of this wonderful
phenomenon, which soon passed from their view.

"They call that a mirage," said Clifton; "the Devil's at the bottom of
it, I'm sure."

"That's true," growled Gripper.

But the break in the fog had given the commander a glimpse of a broad
passage which he had not expected to find; it promised to lead him
away from the shore; he resolved to make use of it at once; men were
sent out on each side of the canal; hawsers were given them, and they
began to tow the ship northward.

During long hours this work was prosecuted busily but silently;
Shandon had the furnace-fires lighted to help him through this passage
so providentially discovered.

"That's great luck," he said to Johnson, "and if we can only get on a
few miles, we may be free. Make a hot fire, Mr. Brunton, and let me
know as soon as you get steam on. Meanwhile, men, the farther on we
get, the more gained! You want to get away from the Devil's Thumb;
well, now is your chance!"

Suddenly the brig stopped. "What's the matter?" shouted Shandon.
"Wall, have the tow-ropes broken?"

"No," answered Wall, leaning over the railing. "See, there are the men
running back; they are climbing on board; they seem very much
frightened."

"What's happened?" cried Shandon, running forward.

"On board, on board!" cried the sailors, evidently exceedingly
terrified.

Shandon looked towards the north, and shuddered in spite of himself.

A strange animal, with alarming motions, whose steaming tongue hung
from huge jaws, was bounding along within a cable's length from the
ship; it seemed more than twenty feet high; its hair stood on end; it
was chasing the sailors as if about to seize them, while its tail,
which was at least ten feet long, lashed the snow and tossed it about
in dense gusts. The sight of the monster froze the blood in the veins
of the boldest.

[Illustration: "A strange animal was bounding along within a cable's
length from the ship."]

"It's an enormous bear," said one.

"It's the beast of Gévaudan!"

"It's the lion of the Apocalypse!"

Shandon ran to his cabin to get a gun which he kept always loaded; the
doctor seized his arms, and made ready to fire at the beast, which by
its size, recalled antediluvian monsters.

It drew near with long leaps; Shandon and the doctor fired at the same
time, and suddenly the report of the pieces agitated the air and
produced an unlooked-for effect.

The doctor gazed attentively, and could not help bursting out
laughing. "It's refraction!" said he.

"Refraction!" cried Shandon.

But a terrible cry from the crew interrupted them.

"The dog!" shouted Clifton.

"The dog-captain!" repeated his companions.

"It's he!" cried Pen.

In fact, it was the dog who had burst his bonds and had made his way
to the surface of the ice through another hole. At that moment the
refraction, by a phenomenon common in these latitudes, exaggerated his
size, and this had only been broken by the report of the guns; but,
notwithstanding, a disastrous impression had been produced upon the
minds of the sailors, who were not very much inclined to admit any
explanation of the fact from physical causes. The adventure of the
Devil's Thumb, the reappearance of the dog under such peculiar
circumstances, completely upset them, and murmurs arose on all sides.




CHAPTER XII.
CAPTAIN HATTERAS.


The _Forward_ was advancing rapidly under steam between the ice-fields
and the mountains of ice. Johnson was at the helm. Shandon was
examining the horizon with his snow-spectacles; but his joy was brief,
for he soon saw that the passage was blocked up by a circle of
mountains.

Nevertheless, he preferred to take his chances with pushing on, to
returning.

The dog followed the brig on the ice, but he kept at a respectful
distance. Only, if he lagged too far, there was to be heard a singular
whistle which at once brought him on.

The first time that this whistle was heard, the sailors looked around;
they were alone on the deck, talking together; there was no unknown
person there; and yet this whistle was often repeated.

Clifton was the first to take alarm.

"Do you hear that?" he said; "and do you see how the dog starts as
soon as he hears it?"

"It's past belief," said Gripper.

"Very well!" cried Pen; "I'm not going any farther."

"Pen is right," said Brunton; "it's tempting Providence."

"Tempting the Devil," answered Clifton. "I should rather give up all
my share of the pay than go on."

"We shall never get back," said Bolton, dejectedly.

The crew was exceedingly demoralized.

"Not a foot farther!" cried Wolston; "is that your opinion?"

"Yes, yes!" answered the sailors.

"Well," said Bolton, "let's go find the commander; I'll undertake to
tell him."

The sailors in a dense group made their way to the quarter-deck.

[Illustration]

The _Forward_ was then advancing into a large arena, which had a
diameter of about eight hundred feet; it was completely closed, with
the exception of one place through which the ship entered.

Shandon saw that he was locking himself in. But what was to be done?
How could he retreat? He felt all the responsibility, and his hand
nervously grasped his glass.

The doctor looked on in silence, with folded arms; he gazed at the
walls of ice, the average height of which was about three hundred
feet. A cloud of fog lay like a dome above the gulf.

Then it was that Bolton spoke to the commander.

"Commander," said he in a broken voice, "we can't go any farther."

"What's that you are saying?" said Shandon, who felt enraged at the
slight given to his authority.

"We have come to say, Commander," resumed Bolton, "that we have done
enough for this invisible captain, and that we have made up our minds
not to go on any farther."

"Made up your minds?" cried Shandon. "Is that the way you talk to me,
Bolton? Take care."

"You need not threaten," retorted Pen, brutally, "we are not going any
farther."

Shandon stepped towards the mutinous sailors, when the boatswain said
to him in a low voice,--

"Commander, if we want to get out of this place, we have not a moment
to lose. There's an iceberg crowding towards the entrance; it may
prevent our getting out and imprison us here."

Shandon returned to look at the state of affairs.

"You will account for this afterwards," he said to the mutineers.
"Now, go about!"

The sailors hastened to their places. The _Forward_ went about
rapidly; coal was heaped on the fires; it was necessary to beat the
iceberg. There was a race between them; the brig stood towards the
south, the berg was drifting northward, threatening to bar the way.

"Put on all the steam, Brunton, do you hear?" said Shandon.

The _Forward_ glided like a bird through the broken ice, which her
prow cut through easily; the ship shook with the motion of the screw,
and the gauge indicated a full pressure of steam, the deafening roar
of which resounded above everything.

"Load the safety-valve!" cried Shandon.

The engineer obeyed at the risk of bursting the boilers.

But these desperate efforts were vain; the iceberg, driven by a
submarine current, moved rapidly towards the exit; the brig was still
three cable-lengths distant, when the mountain, entering the vacant
space like a wedge, joined itself to its companions, and closed the
means of escape.

"We are lost!" cried Shandon, who was unable to restrain that unwise
speech.

"Lost!" repeated the crew.

"Lower the boats!" cried many.

"To the steward's pantry!" cried Pen and some of his set; "if we must
drown, let us drown in gin!"

The wildest confusion raged among these half-wild men. Shandon felt
unable to assert his authority; he wanted to give some orders; he
hesitated, he stammered; his thoughts could find no words. The doctor
walked up and down nervously. Johnson folded his arms stoically, and
said not a word.

Suddenly a strong, energetic, commanding voice was heard above the
din, uttering these words:--

"Every man to his place! Prepare to go about!"

[Illustration]

Johnson shuddered, and, without knowing what he did, turned the wheel
rapidly.

It was time; the brig, going under full steam, was about crashing
against the walls of its prison.

But while Johnson instinctively obeyed, Shandon, Clawbonny, the crew,
all, even down to Warren the fireman, who had abandoned his fires, and
Strong the cook, who had fled from his galley, were collected on the
deck, and all saw issuing from the cabin, the key of which he alone
possessed, a man.

This man was the sailor Garry.

"Sir!" cried Shandon, turning pale, "Garry--by what right do you give
orders here?"

"Duke!" said Garry, repeating the whistle which had so surprised the
crew.

The dog, on hearing his real name, sprang on the quarter-deck, and lay
down quietly at his master's feet.

The crew did not utter a word. The key which the captain alone should
possess, the dog which he had sent and which had identified him, so to
speak, the tone of command which it was impossible to mistake,--all
this had a strong influence on the minds of the sailors, and was
enough to establish firmly Garry's authority.

Besides, Garry was hardly to be recognized; he had removed the thick
whiskers which had surrounded his face, thereby giving it a more
impassible, energetic, and commanding expression; he stood before them
clothed in a captain's uniform, which he had had placed in his cabin.

So the crew of the _Forward_, animated in spite of themselves,
shouted,--

"Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah for the captain!"

"Shandon," he said to his first officer, "have the crew put in line; I
want to inspect them."

Shandon obeyed, and gave the requisite orders with an agitated voice.

The captain walked in front of the officers and men, saying a word to
each, and treating him according to his past conduct.

When he had finished his inspection, he went back to the quarter-deck,
and calmly uttered these words:--

"Officers and sailors, I am an Englishman like you all, and my motto
is that of Lord Nelson,--'England expects every man to do his duty.'

"As Englishmen, I am unwilling, we are unwilling, that others should
go where we have not been. As Englishmen, I shall not endure, we shall
not endure, that others should have the glory of going farther north
than we. If human foot is ever to reach the Pole, it must be the foot
of an Englishman! Here is the flag of our country. I have equipped
this ship, I have devoted my fortune to this undertaking, I shall
devote to it my life and yours, but this flag shall float over the
North Pole. Fear not. You shall receive a thousand pounds sterling for
every degree that we get farther north after this day. Now we are at
the seventy-second, and there are ninety in all. Figure it out. My
name will be proof enough. It means energy and patriotism. I am
Captain Hatteras."

"Captain Hatteras!" cried Shandon. And this name, familiar to them
all, soon spread among all the crew.

"Now," resumed Hatteras, "let us anchor the brig to the ice; let the
fires be put out, and every one return to his usual occupation.
Shandon, I want to speak with you about the ship. You will join me in
my cabin with the doctor, Wall, and the boatswain. Johnson, dismiss
the men."

Hatteras, calm and cold, quietly left the poop-deck, while Shandon had
the brig made fast to the ice.

Who was this Hatteras, and why did his name make so deep an impression
upon the crew?

John Hatteras, the only son of a London brewer, who died in 1852,
worth six million pounds, took to the sea at an early age, unmindful
of the large fortune which was to come to him. Not that he had any
commercial designs, but a longing for geographical discovery possessed
him; he was continually dreaming of setting foot on some spot
untrodden of man.

When twenty years old, he had the vigorous constitution of thin,
sanguine men; an energetic face, with well-marked lines, a high
forehead, rising straight from the eyes, which were handsome but cold,
thin lips, indicating a mouth chary of words, medium height, well-knit
muscular limbs, indicated a man ready for any experience. Any one who
saw him would have called him bold, and any one who heard him would
have called him coldly passionate; he was a man who would never
retreat, and who would risk the lives of others as coldly as his own.
One would hence think twice before following him in his expeditions.

John Hatteras had a great deal of English pride, and it was he who
once made this haughty reply to a Frenchman.

The Frenchman said with what he considered politeness, and even
kindness,--

"If I were not a Frenchman, I should like to be an Englishman."

"If I were not an Englishman, I should like to be an Englishman!"

That retort points the nature of the man.

He would have liked to reserve for his fellow-countrymen the monopoly
of geographical discovery; but much to his chagrin, during previous
centuries, they had done but little in the way of discovery.

America was discovered by the Genoese, Christopher Columbus; the East
Indies by the Portuguese, Vasco de Gama; China by the Portuguese,
Fernao d'Andrada; Terra del Fuego by the Portuguese, Magellan; Canada
by the Frenchman, Jacques Cartier; the islands of Sumatra, Java, etc.,
Labrador, Brazil, the Cape of Good Hope, the Azores, Madeira,
Newfoundland, Guinea, Congo, Mexico, White Cape, Greenland, Iceland,
the South Pacific Ocean, California, Japan, Cambodia, Peru,
Kamschatka, the Philippine Islands, Spitzbergen, Cape Horn, Behring
Strait, New Zealand, Van Diemen's Land, New Britain, New Holland, the
Louisiana, Island of Jan-Mayen, by Icelanders, Scandinavians,
Frenchmen, Russians, Portuguese, Danes, Spaniards, Genoese, and
Dutchmen; but no Englishmen figured among them, and it was a constant
source of grief to Hatteras to see his fellow-countrymen excluded from
the glorious band of sailors who made the great discoveries of the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.

Hatteras consoled himself somewhat when he considered modern times:
the English took their revenge with Stuart, McDougall Stuart, Burke,
Wells, King, Gray, in Australia; with Palliser in America; with
Havnoan in Syria; with Cyril Graham, Waddington, Cunningham, in India;
and with Barth, Burton, Speke, Grant, and Livingstone in Africa.

But this was not enough; for Hatteras these men were rather finishers
than discoverers; something better was to be done, so he invented a
country in order to have the honor of discovering it.

Now he had noticed that if the English were in a minority with regard
to the early discoveries, that if it was necessary to go back to Cook
to make sure of New Caledonia in 1774, and of the Sandwich Islands
where he was killed in 1778, there was nevertheless one corner of the
globe on which they had centred all their efforts.

This was the northern seas and lands of North America.

In fact, the list of polar discoveries runs as follows:--

  Nova Zembla, discovered by Willoughby in 1553.
  Island of Wiegehts, discovered by Barrow in 1556.
  West Coast of Greenland, discovered by Davis in 1585.
  Davis Strait, discovered by Davis in 1587.
  Spitzbergen, discovered by Willoughby in 1596.
  Hudson's Bay, discovered by Hudson in 1610.
  Baffin's Bay, discovered by Baffin in 1616.

During recent years Hearne, Mackenzie, John Ross, Parry, Franklin,
Richardson, Beechey, James Ross, Back, Dease, Simpson, Rae,
Inglefield, Belcher, Austin, Kellet, Moore, MacClure, Kennedy,
MacClintock, were incessantly exploring these unknown regions.

The northern coast of America had been accurately made out, the
Northwest Passage nearly discovered, but that was not enough; there
was something greater to be done, and this John Hatteras had twice
tried, fitting out ships at his own expense; he wanted to reach the
Pole itself, and thus to crown the list of English discoveries by a
glorious success.

To reach the Pole itself was the aim of his life.

After many successful voyages in the southern seas, Hatteras tried for
the first time in 1846 to reach the North through Baffin's Bay, but he
could get no farther than latitude 74°; he sailed in the sloop
_Halifax_; his crew suffered terribly, and John Hatteras carried his
temerity so far that henceforth sailors were averse to undertaking a
similar expedition under such a leader.

Notwithstanding, in 1850, Hatteras succeeded in obtaining for the
schooner _Farewell_ about twenty determined men, but who were
persuaded especially by the high pay offered their boldness. It was
then that Dr. Clawbonny began to correspond with John Hatteras, whom
he did not know, about accompanying him; but the post of surgeon was
filled, fortunately for the doctor.

The _Farewell_, following the route taken by the _Neptune_ of Aberdeen
in 1817, went to the north of Spitzbergen, as far as latitude 76°.
There they were obliged to winter; but their sufferings were such, and
the cold so intense, that of all on board, Hatteras alone returned to
England. He was picked up by a Danish whaler after he had walked more
than two hundred miles across the ice.

The excitement produced by the return of this man alone was intense;
who, after this, would accompany Hatteras in his bold attempts? Still
he did not abandon the hope of trying again. His father, the brewer,
died, and he came into possession of an enormous fortune.

Meanwhile something had happened which cut John Hatteras to the heart.

A brig, the _Advance_, carrying seventeen men, equipped by Mr.
Grinnell, a merchant, commanded by Dr. Kane, and sent out in search of
Franklin, went as far north, through Baffin's Bay and Smith's Sound,
as latitude 82°, nearer to the Pole than any of his predecessors had
gone.

Now this was an American ship. Grinnell was an American, Kane was an
American!

It is easy to understand how the customary disdain of the Englishman
for the Yankee turned to hatred in the heart of Hatteras; he made up
his mind, at any price, to beat his bold rival, and to reach the Pole
itself.

For two years he lived at Liverpool incognito. He was taken for a
sailor. He saw in Richard Shandon the man he wanted; he presented his
plans by an anonymous letter to him and to Dr. Clawbonny. The
_Forward_ was built and equipped. Hatteras kept his name a secret;
otherwise no one would have gone with him. He resolved only to take
command of the brig at some critical juncture, and when his crew had
gone too far to be able to retreat; he kept in reserve, as we have
seen, the power of making generous offers to the men, so that they
would follow him to the end of the world.

In fact, it was to the end of the world that he wanted to go.

Now matters looked very serious, and John Hatteras made himself known.

His dog, the faithful Duke, the companion of his expeditions, was the
first to recognize him, and fortunately for the bold, and
unfortunately for the timid, it was firmly established that the
captain of the _Forward_ was John Hatteras.

[Illustration: "John Hatteras."]




CHAPTER XIII.
THE CAPTAIN'S PLANS.


The appearance of this famous person was variously received by the
different members of the crew: some allied themselves strongly with
him, moved both by boldness and by avarice; others took renewed
interest in the expedition, but they reserved to themselves the right
of protesting later; besides, at that time, it was hard to make any
resistance to such a man. Hence every man went back to his place. The
20th of May was Sunday, and consequently a day of rest for the crew.

The officers took counsel together in the doctor's cabin; there were
present Hatteras, Shandon, Wall, Johnson, and the doctor.

"Gentlemen," said the captain, with his peculiarly gentle but
impressive voice, "you know my project of going to the Pole; I want to
get your opinion of the undertaking. What do you think about it,
Shandon?"

"I have not to think, Captain," answered Shandon, coldly; "I have only
to obey."

Hatteras was not surprised at this answer.

"Richard Shandon," he resumed with equal coldness, "I ask your opinion
about our probable chance of success."

"Well, Captain," answered Shandon, "facts must answer for me; all
attempts hitherto have failed; I hope we may be more fortunate."

"We shall be. And, gentlemen, what do you think?"

"As for me," replied the doctor, "I consider your design practicable,
Captain; and since there is no doubt but that at some time or other
explorers will reach the Pole, I don't see why we should not do it."

"There are very good reasons why we should," answered Hatteras, "for
we have taken measures to make it possible, and we shall profit by the
experience of others. And, Shandon, you must accept my thanks for the
care you have given to the equipment of the brig; there are some
ill-disposed men in the crew, whom I shall soon bring to reason; but
on the whole, I can give nothing but praise."

[Illustration]

Shandon bowed coldly. His position on the _Forward_, of which he had
thought himself commander, was a false one. Hatteras understood this,
and said nothing more about it.

"As for you, gentlemen," he resumed, addressing Wall and Johnson, "I
could not myself have chosen officers more skilled and intrepid."

"On my word, Captain, I am your man," answered Johnson; "and although
I think your plan a very bold one, you can count on me to the end."

"And on me too," said Wall.

"As for you, Doctor, I know your worth--"

"Well, you know then a great deal more than I do," answered the
doctor, quickly.

"Now, gentlemen," said Hatteras, "it is well that you should know on
what good grounds I have made up my mind about the accessibility of
the Pole. In 1817 the _Neptune_, of Aberdeen, went to the north of
Spitzbergen, as far as latitude 82°. In 1826 the celebrated Parry,
after his third voyage in polar seas, started also from the extremity
of Spitzbergen, and on sledges went one hundred and fifty miles
farther north. In 1852, Captain Inglefield reached, through Smith's
Sound, latitude 78° 35'. All these were English ships, and were
commanded by Englishmen, our fellow-countrymen."

Here Hatteras paused.

"I ought to add," he resumed with some formality, and as if he could
hardly bring himself to utter the words,--"I ought to add that in 1854
the American, Captain Kane, in the brig _Advance_, went still farther
north, and that his lieutenant, Morton, journeying over the ice,
hoisted the United States flag beyond the eighty-second degree. Having
once said this, I shall not return to it. Now the main point is that
the captains of the _Neptune_, the _Enterprise_, the _Isabella_, and
the _Advance_ agree in the statement that beyond these high latitudes
there is an open polar sea, entirely free from ice."

"Free from ice!" cried Shandon, interrupting the captain, "it's
impossible!"

"You will notice, Shandon," observed Hatteras, quietly, while his eye
lighted up for an instant, "that I quote both facts and authorities. I
must add that in 1851, when Penny was stationed by the side of
Wellington Channel, his lieutenant, Stewart, found himself in the
presence of an open sea, and that his report was confirmed when, in
1853, Sir Edward Belcher wintered in Northumberland Bay, in latitude
76° 52', and longitude 99° 20'; these reports are indisputable, and
one must be very incredulous not to admit them."

"Still, Captain," persisted Shandon, "facts are as contradictory--"

"You're wrong, Shandon, you're wrong!" cried Dr. Clawbonny; "facts
never contradict a scientific statement; the captain will, I trust,
excuse me."

"Go on, Doctor!" said Hatteras.

"Well, listen to this, Shandon; it results very clearly from
geographical facts, and from the study of isothermal lines, that the
coldest spot on the globe is not on the Pole itself; like the magnetic
pole, it lies a few degrees distant. So the calculations of Brewster,
Berghaus, and other physicists prove that in our hemisphere there are
two poles of extreme cold: one in Asia in latitude 79° 30' N., and
longitude 120° E.; the other is in America, in latitude 78° N., and
longitude 97° W. This last alone concerns us, and you see, Shandon,
that it is more than twelve degrees below the Pole. Well, I ask you
why, then, the sea should not be as free from ice as it often is in
summer in latitude 66°, that is to say, at the southern end of
Baffin's Bay?"

"Well put," answered Johnson; "Dr. Clawbonny talks of those things
like a man who understands them."

"It seems possible," said James Wall.

"Mere conjectures! nothing but hypotheses!" answered Shandon,
obstinately.

"Well, Shandon," said Hatteras, "let us consider the two cases; either
the sea is free from ice, or it is not, and in neither case will it be
impossible to reach the Pole. If it is free, the _Forward_ will take
us there without difficulty; if it is frozen, we must try to reach it
over the ice by our sledges. You will confess that it is not
impracticable; having once come with our brig to latitude 83°, we
shall have only about six hundred miles between us and the Pole."

"And what are six hundred miles," said the doctor, briskly, "when it
is proved that a Cossack, Alexis Markoff, went along the frozen sea,
north of Russia, on sledges drawn by dogs, for a distance of eight
hundred miles, in twenty-four days?"

"You hear him, Shandon," answered Hatteras, "and will you say that an
Englishman cannot do as much as a Cossack?"

"Never!" cried the enthusiastic doctor.

"Never!" repeated the boatswain.

"Well, Shandon?" asked the captain.

"Captain," answered Shandon, coldly, "I can only repeat what I have
said,--I shall obey you."

"Well. Now," continued Hatteras, "let us consider our present
situation; we are caught in the ice, and it seems to me impossible for
us to reach Smith's Sound this year. This is what we must do."

Hatteras unfolded on the table one of the excellent charts published
in 1859 by the order of the Admiralty.

"Be good enough to look here. If Smith's Sound is closed, Lancaster
Sound is not, to the west of Baffin's Bay; in my opinion, we ought to
go up this sound as far as Barrow Strait, and thence to Beechey
Island. This has been done a hundred times by sailing-vessels; we
shall have no difficulty, going under steam. Once at Beechey Island,
we shall follow Wellington Sound as far northward as possible, to
where it meets the channel, connecting it with Queen's Sound, at the
place where the open sea was seen. It is now only the 20th of May; if
nothing happens, we shall be there in a month, and from there we shall
start for the Pole. What do you say to that, gentlemen?"

"Evidently," said Johnson, "it's the only way open to us."

"Well, we shall take it, and to-morrow. Let Sunday be a day of rest;
you will see, Shandon, that the Bible is read as usual; the religious
exercises do the men good, and a sailor more than any one ought to put
his trust in God."

"Very well, Captain," answered Shandon, who went away with the second
officer and the boatswain.

"Doctor," said Hatteras, pointing at Shandon, "there's an offended
man, whose pride has ruined him; I can no longer depend upon him."

Early the next day the captain had the launch lowered; he went to
reconnoitre the icebergs about the basin, of which the diameter was
hardly more than two hundred yards. He noticed that by the gradual
pressure of the ice, this space threatened to grow smaller; hence it
became necessary to make a breach somewhere, to save the ship from
being crushed; by the means he employed, it was easy to see that John
Hatteras was an energetic man.

In the first place he had steps cut, by which he climbed to the top of
an iceberg; from that point he saw it would be easy to open a path to
the southwest; by his orders an opening was made in the middle of an
iceberg, a task which was completed by Monday evening.

[Illustration]

Hatteras could not depend on his blasting-cylinders of eight or ten
pounds of powder, whose action would have been insignificant against
such large masses; they were only of use to break the field-ice; hence
he placed in the opening a thousand pounds of powder, carefully laying
it where it should be of the utmost service. This chamber, to which
ran a long fuse, surrounded by gutta-percha, opened on the outside.
The gallery, leading thereto, was filled with snow and lumps of ice,
to which the cold of the next night gave the consistency of granite.
In fact, the temperature, under the influence of the east-wind, fell
to 12°.

The next day at seven o'clock the _Forward_ was under steam, ready to
seize any chance of escape. Johnson was charged with lighting the
mine; the fuse was calculated to burn half an hour before exploding
the powder. Hence Johnson had plenty of time to get back to the ship;
indeed, within ten minutes he was at his post.

The crew were all on deck; the day was dry and tolerably clear; the
snow was no longer falling; Hatteras, standing on the deck with
Shandon and the doctor, counted the minutes on his watch.

At thirty-five minutes after eight a dull explosion was heard, much
less deafening than had been anticipated. The outline of the mountains
was suddenly changed, as by an earthquake; a dense white smoke rose
high in the air, and long cracks appeared in the side of the iceberg,
of which the upper part was hurled to a great distance, and fell in
fragments about the _Forward_.

But the way was by no means free yet; huge lumps of ice were suspended
upon the neighboring icebergs, and their fall threatened to close the
exit.

Hatteras saw their situation in a flash of the eye.

"Wolston!" he shouted.

The gunner hastened to him.

"Captain!" he said.

"Put a triple charge in the forward gun, and ram it in as hard as
possible!"

"Are we going to batter the iceberg down with cannon-balls?" asked the
doctor.

"No," answered Hatteras. "That would do no good. No balls, Wolston,
but a triple charge of powder. Be quick!"

In a few moments the gun was loaded.

"What is he going to do without a ball?" muttered Shandon between his
teeth.

"We'll soon see," answered the doctor.

"We are all ready, Captain," cried Wolston.

"Well," answered Hatteras. "Brunton!" he shouted to the engineer,
"make ready! Forward a little!"

Brunton opened the valves, and the screw began to move; the _Forward_
drew near the blown-up iceberg.

"Aim carefully at the passage!" cried the captain to the gunner.

He obeyed; when the brig was only half a cable-length distant,
Hatteras gave the order,--

"Fire!"

A loud report followed, and the fragments of ice, detached by the
commotion of the air, fell suddenly into the sea. The simple
concussion had been enough.

[Illustration]

"Put on full steam, Brunton!" shouted Hatteras. "Straight for the
passage, Johnson!"

Johnson was at the helm; the brig, driven by the screw, which tossed
the water freely, entered easily the open passage. It was time. The
_Forward_ had hardly passed through the opening, before it closed
behind it.

It was an exciting moment, and the only calm and collected man on
board was the captain. So the crew, amazed at the success of this
device, could not help shouting,--

"Hurrah for John Hatteras!"




CHAPTER XIV.
THE EXPEDITIONS IN SEARCH OF FRANKLIN.


Wednesday, the 21st of May, the _Forward_ resumed her perilous voyage,
making her way dexterously through the packs and icebergs, thanks to
steam, which is seldom used by explorers in polar seas; she seemed to
sport among the moving masses; one would have said she felt the hand
of a skilled master, and that, like a horse under a skilful rider, she
obeyed the thought of her captain.

The weather grew warmer. At six o'clock in the morning the thermometer
stood at 26°, at six in the evening at 29°, and at midnight at 25°;
the wind was light from the southeast.

Thursday, at about three o'clock in the morning, the _Forward_ arrived
in sight of Possession Bay, on the American shore, at the entrance of
Lancaster Sound; soon Cape Burney came into sight. A few Esquimaux
came out to the ship; but Hatteras could not stop to speak with them.

[Illustration]

The peaks of Byam Martin, which rise above Cape Liverpool, were passed
on the left, and they soon disappeared in the evening mist; this hid
from them Cape Hay, which has a very slight elevation, and so is
frequently confounded with ice about the shore, a circumstance which
very often renders the determination of the coast-line in polar
regions very difficult.

Puffins, ducks, and white gulls appeared in great numbers. By
observation the latitude was 74° 1', and the longitude, according to
the chronometer, 77° 15'.

The two mountains, Catherine and Elizabeth, raised their snowy heads
above the clouds.

At ten o'clock on Friday Cape Warrender was passed on the right side
of the sound, and on the left Admiralty Inlet, a bay which has never
been fully explored by navigators, who are always hastening westward.
The sea ran rather high, and the waves often broke over the bows,
covering the deck with small fragments of ice. The land on the north
coast presented a strange appearance with its high, flat table-lands
sparkling beneath the sun's rays.

Hatteras would have liked to skirt these northern lands, in order to
reach the sooner Beechey Island and the entrance of Wellington
Channel; but, much to his chagrin, the bank-ice obliged him to take
only the passes to the south.

Hence, on the 26th of May, in the midst of a fog and a snow-storm, the
_Forward_ found herself off Cape York; a lofty, steep mountain was
soon recognized; the weather got a little clearer, and at midday the
sun appeared long enough to permit an observation to be taken:
latitude 74° 4', and longitude 84° 23'. The _Forward_ was at the end
of Lancaster Sound.

[Illustration]

Hatteras showed the doctor on the chart the route he had taken and
that which he was to follow. At that time the position of the brig was
interesting.

"I should have liked to be farther north," he said, "but it was
impossible; see, here is our exact position."

The captain pointed to a spot near Cape York.

"We are in the middle of this open space, exposed to every wind; into
it open Lancaster Sound, Barrow Strait, Wellington Channel, and
Regent's Inlet; here, of necessity, come all northern explorers."

"Well," answered the doctor, "so much the worse for them; it is indeed
an open space, where four roads meet, and I don't see any sign-post to
point out the right way! What did Parry, Ross, and Franklin do?"

"They didn't do anything in particular; they let themselves be
governed by circumstances; they had no choice, I can assure you; at
one time Barrow Strait would be closed against one, and the next year
it would be open for another; again the ship would be irresistibly
driven towards Regent's Inlet. In this way we have at last been able
to learn the geography of these confused seas."

"What a strange region!" said the doctor, gazing at the chart. "How
everything is divided and cut up, without order or reason! It seems as
if all the land near the Pole were divided in this way in order to
make the approach harder, while in the other hemisphere it ends in
smooth, regular points, like Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope, and
the Indian peninsula! Is it the greater rapidity at the equator which
has thus modified things, while the land lying at the extremity, which
was fluid at the beginning of the world, could not condense and unite
as elsewhere, on account of slower rotation?"

"That may be, for there is a reason for everything, and nothing
happens without a cause, which God sometimes lets students find out;
so, Doctor, find it out if you can."

"I shall not waste too much time over it, Captain. But what is this
fierce wind?" added the doctor, wrapping himself up well.

"The north-wind is the common one, and delays our progress."

"Still it ought to blow the ice toward the south, and leave our way
free."

"It ought to, Doctor, but the wind doesn't always do what it ought to.
See, that ice looks impenetrable. We shall try to reach Griffith
Island, then to get around Cornwallis Island to reach Queen's Channel,
without going through Wellington Channel. And yet I am anxious to
touch at Beechey Island to get some more coal."

"How will you do that?" asked the astonished doctor.

"Easily; by order of the Admiralty, a great amount has been placed on
this island, to supply future expeditions, and although Captain
MacClintock took some in 1859, I can assure you there is still some
left for us."

"In fact, these regions have been explored for fifteen years, and
until certain proof of Franklin's death was received, the Admiralty
always kept five or six ships cruising in these waters. If I'm not
mistaken, Griffith Island, which I see in the middle of the open
space, has become a general rendezvous for explorers."

"True, Doctor, and Franklin's ill-fated expedition has been the means
of our learning so much about these parts."

"Exactly; for there have been a great many expeditions since 1845. It
was not till 1848 that there was any alarm about the continued
non-appearance of the _Erebus_ and the _Terror_, Franklin's two ships.
Then the admiral's old friend, Dr. Richardson, seventy years of age,
went through Canada, and descended Coppermine River to the Polar Sea;
on the other side, James Ross, in command of the _Enterprise_ and the
_Investigator_, sailed from Upernavik in 1848, and reached Cape York,
where we are now. Every day he threw overboard a cask containing
papers telling where he was; during fogs he fired cannon; at night he
burned signal-fires and sent off rockets, carrying always but little
sail; finally, he wintered at Leopold's Harbor in 1848-49; there he
caught a large number of white foxes; he had put on their necks copper
collars on which was engraved a statement of the position of the ship
and where supplies had been left, and he drove them away in every
direction; then, in the spring, he explored the coast of North
Somerset on sledges, amid dangers and privations which disabled nearly
all his men. He built cairns, enclosing copper cylinders with
instructions to the absent expedition; during his absence, Lieutenant
MacClure explored fruitlessly the northern coast of Barrow Strait. It
is noteworthy, Captain, that James Ross had among his officers two men
who afterwards became celebrated,--MacClure, who found the Northwest
Passage, and MacClintock, who found the last remains of the Franklin
expedition."

[Illustration: "He caught a large number of white foxes; he had put on
their necks copper collars."]

"Two good and brave captains, two brave Englishmen; go on, Doctor,
with this account which you know so well; there is always something to
be learned from the account of bold adventurers."

"Well, to conclude with James Ross, I have only to add that he tried
to go farther west from Melville Island; but he nearly lost his ships,
and being caught in the ice he was carried, against his will, to
Baffin's Bay."

"Carried," said Hatteras, frowning,--"carried against his will!"

"He had discovered nothing," resumed the doctor; "it was only after
1850 that English ships were always exploring there, when a reward of
twenty thousand pounds was offered to any one who should discover the
crews of the _Erebus_ and _Terror_. Already, in 1848, Captains Kellet
and Moore, in command of the _Herald_ and the _Plover_, tried to make
their way through by Behring Strait. I ought to say that the winter of
1850-51, Captain Austin passed at Cornwallis Island; Captain Penny,
with the _Assistance_ and _Resolute_, explored Wellington Channel; old
John Ross, who discovered the magnetic pole, started in his yacht, the
_Felix_, in search of his friend; the brig _Prince Albert_ made her
first voyage at the expense of Lady Franklin; and, finally, two
American ships, sent out by Grinnell, under Captain Haven, carried
beyond Wellington Channel, were cast into Lancaster Sound. It was
during this year that MacClintock, Austin's lieutenant, pushed on to
Melville Island and to Cape Dundas, the extreme points reached by
Parry in 1819, and on Beechey Island were found traces of Franklin's
wintering there in 1845."

"Yes," answered Hatteras, "three of his sailors were buried there,
three fortunate men!"

"From 1851 to 1852," continued the doctor, with a gesture of
agreement, "we find the _Prince Albert_ making a second attempt with
the French lieutenant, Bellot; he winters at Batty Bay in Prince
Regent's Sound, explores the southwest of Somerset, and reconnoitres
the coast as far as Cape Walker. Meanwhile, the _Enterprise_ and
_Investigator_, having returned to England, came under the command of
Collinson and MacClure, and they rejoined Kellet and Moore at Behring
Strait; while Collinson returned to winter at Hong-Kong, MacClure went
on, and after three winters, 1850-51, 1851-52, and 1852-53, he
discovered the Northwest Passage without finding any traces of
Franklin. From 1852 to 1853, a new expedition, consisting of three
sailing-vessels, the _Assistance_, the _Resolute_, the _North Star_,
and two steam-vessels, the _Pioneer_ and the _Intrepid_, started out
under the orders of Sir Edward Belcher, with Captain Kellet second in
command; Sir Edward visited Wellington Channel, wintered in
Northumberland Bay, and explored the coast, while Kellet, pushing on
as far as Brideport on Melville Island, explored that region without
success. But then it was rumored in England that two ships, abandoned
in the ice, had been seen not far from New Caledonia. At once Lady
Franklin fitted out the little screw-steamer _Isabella_, and Captain
Inglefield, after ascending Baffin's Bay to Victoria Point, at the
eightieth parallel, returned to Beechey Island with equal unsuccess.
At the beginning of 1855 the American Grinnell defrays the expense of
a new expedition, and Dr. Kane, trying to reach the Pole--"

"But he did not succeed," cried Hatteras with violence, "and thank God
he did not! What he did not do, we shall!"

"I know it, Captain," answered the doctor, "and I only speak of it on
account of its connection with the search for Franklin. Besides, it
accomplished nothing. I nearly forgot to say that the Admiralty,
regarding Beechey Island as a general rendezvous, ordered the steamer
_Phoenix_, Captain Inglefield, in 1853, to carry provisions there; he
sailed with Lieutenant Bellot, who for the second, and last, time
offered his services to England; we can get full details about the
catastrophe, for Johnson, our boatswain, was eye-witness of this sad
affair."

"Lieutenant Bellot was a brave Frenchman," said Hatteras, "and his
memory is honored in England."

"Then," resumed the doctor, "the ships of Belcher's squadron began to
return one by one; not all, for Sir Edward had to abandon the
_Assistance_ in 1854, as McClure had the _Investigator_ in 1853.
Meanwhile Dr. Rae, in a letter dated July 29, 1854, written from
Repulse Bay, gave information that the Esquimaux of King William's
Land had in their possession different objects belonging to the
_Erebus_ and _Terror_; then there was no doubt possible about the fate
of the expedition; the _Phoenix_, the _North Star_, and the ship of
Collinson returned to England; there was then no English ship in these
waters. But if the government seemed to have lost all hope, Lady
Franklin did not despair, and with what was left of her fortune she
fitted out the _Fox_, commanded by MacClintock; he set sail in 1857,
wintered about where you made yourself known to us, Captain; he came
to Beechey Island, August 11, 1858; the next winter he passed at
Bellot Sound; in February, 1859, he began his explorations anew; on
the 6th of May he found the document which left no further doubt as to
the fate of the _Erebus_ and _Terror_, and returned to England at the
end of the same year. That is a complete account of all that has been
done in these regions during the last fifteen years; and since the
return of the _Fox_, no ship has ventured among these dangerous
waters!"

"Well, we shall try it!" said Hatteras.




CHAPTER XV.
THE FORWARD DRIVEN SOUTHWARD.


Towards evening the weather cleared up, and land was clearly to be
seen between Cape Sepping and Cape Clarence, which juts out to the
east, then to the south, and is connected to the mainland on the west
by a low tongue of land. There was no ice at the entrance of Regent's
Sound; but it was densely massed beyond Leopold Harbor, as if to form
an impassable barrier to the northward progress of the _Forward_.

Hatteras, who, although he carefully concealed his feelings, was
exceedingly annoyed, had to blow out a way with powder in order to
enter Leopold Harbor; he reached it at midday, on Sunday, May 27th;
the brig was securely anchored to the large icebergs, which were as
firm, solid, and hard as rock.

At once the captain, followed by the doctor, Johnson, and his dog
Duke, leaped out upon the ice and soon reached the land. Duke leaped
about with joy; besides, since the captain had made himself known, he
had become very sociable and very gentle, preserving his ill-temper
for some of the crew, whom his master disliked as much as he did.

The harbor was free from the ice which is generally forced there by
the east-wind; the sharp peaks, covered with snow, looked like a
number of white waves. The house and lantern, built by James Ross,
were still in a tolerable state of preservation; but the provisions
appeared to have been eaten by foxes, and even by bears, of which
fresh traces were to be seen; part of the devastation was probably due
to the hand of man, for some ruins of Esquimaux huts were to be seen
on the shores of the bay.

The six tombs, enclosing six sailors of the _Enterprise_ and the
_Investigator_, were recognizable by little mounds of earth; they had
been respected by all, by both men and beasts.

On first setting his foot on this northern earth, the doctor was
really agitated; it would not be easy to describe the emotions one
feels at the sight of these ruined houses, tents, huts, supplies,
which nature preserves so perfectly in cold countries.

[Illustration]

"There," said he to his companions,--"there is the spot which James
Ross himself named Camp Refuge! If Franklin's expedition had reached
this spot, it would have been saved. Here is the engine which was
taken out and left here, and the furnace which warmed the crew of the
_Prince Albert_ in 1851; everything remains as it was left, and one
might fancy that Kennedy, her captain, had sailed away from here
yesterday. This is the launch that sheltered them for some days, for
Kennedy was separated from his ship, and only saved by Lieutenant
Bellot, who braved the cold of October to join him."

"A brave and excellent officer he was," said Johnson. "I knew him."

While the doctor eagerly sought for traces of previous winterings
there, Hatteras busied himself with collecting the scanty fragments of
fuel and provisions which lay there. The next day was devoted to
carrying them on board ship. The doctor explored the whole
neighborhood, never going too far from the brig, and sketched the most
remarkable views. The weather gradually grew milder; the snow-drifts
began to melt. The doctor made a tolerably large collection of
northern birds, such as gulls, divers, molly-nochtes, and eider-ducks,
which resemble ordinary ducks, with a white back and breast, a blue
belly, the top of the head blue, the rest of the plumage white, shaded
with different tints of green; many of them had already plucked from
their bellies the eider-down, which both the male and the female
devote to lining their nests. The doctor also saw great seals
breathing at the surface of the water, but he was unable to draw one.

[Illustration]

In his wanderings he discovered the stone on which is engraved the
following inscription:--

  [E I]
  1849,

which marks the passage of the _Enterprise_ and _Investigator_; he
pushed on to Cape Clarence, to the spot where, in 1833, John and James
Ross waited so impatiently for the ice to thaw. The earth was covered
with the skulls and bones of animals, and traces of the dwellings of
Esquimaux were to be seen.

[Illustration]

The doctor thought of erecting a cairn at Leopold Harbor, and of
leaving a letter there to indicate the passage of the _Forward_ and
the aim of the expedition. But Hatteras formally objected; he did not
wish to leave behind him any traces which might be of use to a rival.
In spite of all he could say, the doctor was obliged to yield to the
captain's will. Shandon was ready enough to blame this obstinacy, for,
in case of accident, no ship could have put out to the aid of the
_Forward_.

Hatteras refused to comply. Having completed his preparations on
Monday, he tried once more to go to the north through the ice, but,
after dangerous efforts, he was obliged to descend again Regent's
Channel; he was utterly averse to remaining at Leopold's Harbor, which
is open one day and closed the next by the unheralded motion of the
ice,--a frequent phenomenon in these seas, and one against which
navigators have to be ever on their guard.

If Hatteras kept his anxiety from the others, he was at heart very
anxious; he wanted to go northward, and he was obliged to retreat to
the south! Where would that bring him? Was he going as far back as
Victoria Harbor in the Gulf of Boothia, where Sir John Ross wintered
in 1833? Should he find Bellot Sound free at this time, and, by going
around North Somerset, could he ascend through Peel Sound? Or should
he, like his predecessors, be caught for many winters, and be obliged
to consume all his supplies and provisions?

These fears tormented him; but he had to decide; he put about and
started for the south.

Prince Regent's Channel is of nearly uniform width from Leopold's
Harbor to Adelaide Bay. The _Forward_ went rapidly through the ice,
with better fortune than many other ships, most of which required a
month to descend the channel, even in a better season; it is true that
none of these ships, except the _Fox_, had steam at their command, and
were obliged to do their best against frequent unfavorable winds.

The crew seemed overjoyed at leaving the northern regions; they had
but a slight desire to reach the Pole; they were alarmed at Hatteras's
plans, for his reputation as a fearless man inspired them with but
little confidence. Hatteras tried to make use of every opportunity to
go forward, whatever the consequences might be. And yet in these
parts, to advance is all very well, but one must also maintain his
position and not run the risk of losing it.

The _Forward_ went on under full steam; the black smoke whirled in
spirals about the sparkling summits of the icebergs; the weather was
changeable, turning from a dry cold to a snowstorm with inconceivable
rapidity. Since the brig drew but little water, Hatteras hugged the
west shore; he did not want to miss the entrance of Bellot Sound, for
the Gulf of Boothia has no other entrance towards the south than the
slightly known sound of the _Fury_ and the _Hecla_; hence the gulf
would be impassable, if Bellot Sound were missed or found
impracticable.

By evening the _Forward_ was in sight of Elwin Bay, which was
recognized by its high, steep cliffs; Tuesday morning Batty Bay was
seen, where, on the 10th of September, 1851, the _Prince Albert_
anchored for the winter. The doctor examined the coast with interest
through his glass. From this point started the expeditions which
determined the shape of North Somerset. The weather was clear enough
for them to see the deep ravines surrounding the bay.

The doctor and Johnson were probably the only ones who took any
interest in these deserted countries. Hatteras, always studying his
charts, talked little; his silence increased as the ship drew
southward; he often went upon the quarter-deck, and there he would
remain for hours, with folded arms, gazing absently at the horizon.
His orders, when he gave any, were short and quick. Shandon maintained
a cold silence, and drawing more and more into himself, he had nothing
more to do with Hatteras than was officially required; James Wall
remained devoted to Shandon, and modelled his conduct after that of
his friend. The rest of the crew waited for whatever might turn up,
ready to make the best use of it for their own profit. On board there
was none of the unanimity which is so necessary for the accomplishment
of great things. Hatteras knew this well.

During the day two whalers were seen making toward the south; a white
bear, too, was saluted with a few rifle-shots, but apparently without
success. The captain knew the worth of an hour at that time, and
refused permission to chase the animal.

[Illustration]

Wednesday morning the end of Regent Channel was passed; the angle of
the west coast was followed by a deep curve in the land. On examining
his chart, the doctor recognized Somerset-House Point, or Point Fury.

"There," he said to his usual companion,--"there is where the first
English ship was lost that was sent to these seas in 1815, in Parry's
third voyage; the _Fury_ was so much injured by the ice in her second
winter, that the crew were obliged to abandon her and to return to
England in her companion, the _Hecla_."

"A good reason for having another ship," answered Johnson; "that is a
precaution which polar explorers should not neglect; but Captain
Hatteras was not the man to burden himself with a companion!"

"Do you consider him rash, Johnson?" asked the doctor.

"I? O, I don't say anything of the sort, Dr. Clawbonny! But see those
piles there, with fragments of a tent hanging to them."

"Yes, Johnson, it is there Parry unloaded all his ship's supplies,
and, if my memory serves me right, the roof of the hut he built was
made out of a mainsail covered by the running-rigging of the _Fury_."

"That must have changed a good deal since 1825."

"Not so very much. In 1829, John Ross kept his crew safe and sound in
this light building. In 1851, when Prince Albert sent out an
expedition, this hut was still standing; Captain Kennedy repaired it
nine years ago. It would be interesting to visit it, but Hatteras is
unwilling to stop."

"And he is probably right, Dr. Clawbonny; if in England time is money,
here it is safety, and for the delay of a day, of an hour even, the
whole voyage might be rendered useless. We must let him do as he
pleases."

On Thursday, June 1st, the _Forward_ sailed diagonally across Creswell
Bay; from Point Fury the coast rises in steep rocks three hundred feet
high; towards the south, it is lower; a few snowy summits are to be
seen, of a regular shape, while others, more fantastic, were hidden in
the clouds.

During that day the weather grew milder, but cloudier; they lost sight
of land; the thermometer rose to 32°; a few water-quail were to be
seen, and flocks of wild geese flew toward the north; the crew laid
aside some of their thick clothes; they began to be aware of the
approach of summer in the arctic regions.

Toward evening the _Forward_ doubled Cape Garry, a quarter of a mile
from the shore. The lead marked ten to twelve fathoms, and they bore
along the shore to Brentford Bay. In this latitude they were to find
Bellot Sound, a sound which entirely escaped the notice of Sir John
Ross in his expedition of 1828; his charts indicated an unbroken
coast-line, with the least irregularities indicated with the utmost
care; hence it is to be supposed that when he passed by the entrance
of the sound, it was completely closed with ice and so could not be
distinguished from the land.

This sound was really discovered by Captain Kennedy in an excursion
made in April, 1852; he named it after Lieutenant Bellot, as "a just
tribute," as he said, "to the important services rendered to our
expedition by the French officer."




CHAPTER XVI.
THE MAGNETIC POLE.


As Hatteras drew near this sound he felt his anxiety redoubling; in
fact, the success of his expedition was at stake; so far he had done
nothing more than his predecessors, the most successful of whom,
MacClintock, had consumed fifteen months in reaching this spot; but
that was little, indeed nothing, if he could not make Bellot Sound;
being unable to return, he would be kept a prisoner until the next
year.

Hence he took upon himself the care of examining the coast; he went up
to the lookout, and on Saturday passed many hours there.

The crew were all acquainted with the situation of the ship; an
unbroken silence reigned on board; the engine was slackened; the
_Forward_ ran as near shore as possible; the coast was lined with ice
which the warmest summers could not melt; a practised eye was needed
to make out an entrance through them.

Hatteras was comparing his charts with the coast-line. The sun having
appeared for a moment at noon, Shandon and Wall took an observation,
the result of which was at once told him.

There was half a day of anxiety for all. But suddenly, at about two
o'clock, these words were shouted from aloft,--

"Head to the west, and put on all steam."

The brig obeyed at once, turning to the point directed; the screw
churned the water, and the _Forward_ plunged under a full head of
steam between two swiftly running ice-streams.

The path was found; Hatteras came down to the quarter-deck, and the
ice-master went aloft.

"Well, Captain," said the doctor, "we have entered this famous sound
at last!"

"Yes," answered Hatteras; "but entering is not all, we have got to get
out of it too."

And with these words he went to his cabin.

"He is right," thought the doctor; "we are in a sort of trap, without
much space to turn about in, and if we had to winter here!--well, we
shouldn't be the first to do it, and where others lived through it,
there is no reason why we should not!"

The doctor was right. It was at this very place, in a little sheltered
harbor called Port Kennedy by MacClintock himself, that the _Fox_
wintered in 1858. At that moment it was easy to recognize the lofty
granite chains, and the steep beaches on each side.

Bellot Sound, a mile broad and seventeen long, with a current running
six or seven knots, is enclosed by mountains of an estimated height of
sixteen hundred feet; it separates North Somerset from Boothia; it is
easy to see that there is not too much sailing room there. The
_Forward_ advanced carefully, but still she advanced; tempests are
frequent in this narrow pass, and the brig did not escape their usual
violence; by Hatteras's orders, all the topsail-yards were lowered,
and the topmasts also; in spite of everything the ship labored
fearfully; the heavy seas kept the deck continually deluged with
water; the smoke flew eastward with inconceivable rapidity; they went
on almost at haphazard through the floating ice; the barometer fell to
29°; it was hard to stay on deck, so most of the men were kept below
to spare them unnecessary exposure.

Hatteras, Johnson, and Shandon remained on the quarter-deck, in spite
of the whirlwinds of snow and rain; and the doctor, who had just asked
himself what was the most disagreeable thing to be done at that time,
soon joined them there; they could not hear, and hardly could they
see, one another; so he kept his thoughts to himself.

[Illustration]

Hatteras tried to pierce the dense cloud of mist, for, according to
his calculation, they should be through the strait at six o'clock of
the evening. At that time exit seemed closed, and Hatteras was obliged
to stop and anchor to an iceberg; but steam was kept up all night.

The weather was terrible. Every moment the _Forward_ threatened to
snap her cables; there was danger, too, lest the mountain should be
driven by the wind and crush the brig. The officers kept on the alert,
owing to their extreme anxiety; besides the snow, large lumps of
frozen spray were blown about by the hurricane like sharp arrows.

The temperature arose strangely in that terrible night; the
thermometer marked 57°; and the doctor, to his great surprise, thought
he noticed some flashes of lightning followed by distant thunder. This
seemed to corroborate the testimony of Scoresby, who noticed the same
phenomenon above latitude 65°. Captain Parry also observed it in 1821.

Towards five o'clock in the morning the weather changed with singular
rapidity; the temperature fell to the freezing-point; the wind shifted
to the north and grew quiet. The western opening of the strait could
be seen, but it was entirely closed. Hatteras gazed anxiously at the
coast, asking himself if there really were any exit.

Nevertheless, the brig put out slowly into the ice-streams, while the
ice crushed noisily against her bows; the packs at this time were six
or seven feet thick; it was necessary carefully to avoid them, for if
the ship should try to withstand them, it ran the risk of being lifted
half out of the water and cast on her beam-ends.

At noon, for the first time, a magnificent solar phenomenon could be
observed, a halo with two parhelions; the doctor observed it, and took
its exact dimensions; the exterior arc was only visible for about
thirty degrees each side of the horizontal diameter; the two images of
the sun were remarkably clear; the colors within the luminous area
were, going toward the outside, red, yellow, green, faint blue, and
last of all white, gently fading away, without any sharp line of
termination.

[Illustration]

The doctor remembered Thomas Young's ingenious theory about these
meteors; he supposed that certain clouds composed of prisms of ice are
hanging in the air; the sun's rays falling on these prisms are
refracted at angles of sixty and ninety degrees. The halos can only be
formed in a clear sky. The doctor thought this an ingenious
explanation.

Sailors, who are familiar with northern seas, consider this phenomenon
a forerunner of heavy snow. If this should be the case, the position
of the _Forward_ was very critical. Hence Hatteras resolved to push
on; during the rest of that day and the next night he took no rest,
but examined the horizon through his glass, entering every inlet, and
losing no opportunity to get out of the strait.

But in the morning he was compelled to stop before the impenetrable
ice. The doctor joined him on the quarter-deck. Hatteras led him clear
aft where they could talk without fear of being overheard.

"We are caught," said Hatteras. "It's impossible to go on."

"Impossible?" said the doctor.

"Impossible! All the powder on board the _Forward_ would not open a
quarter of a mile to us."

"What are we to do?" asked the doctor.

"I don't know. Curse this unlucky year!"

"Well, Captain, if we must go into winter-quarters, we'll do it. As
well here as anywhere else!"

"Of course," said Hatteras in a low voice, "but we ought not to be
going into winter-quarters, especially in the month of June. It is
demoralizing, and bad for the health. The spirits of the crew are soon
cast down during this long rest among real sufferings. So I had made
up my mind to winter at a latitude nearer the Pole."

"Yes, but, unluckily, Baffin's Bay was closed."

"Any one else would have found it open," cried Hatteras; "that
American, that--"

"Come, Hatteras," said the doctor, purposely interrupting him, "it's
now only the 5th of June; we should not despair; a path may open
before us suddenly; you know the ice often breaks into separate
pieces, even when the weather is calm, as if it were driven apart by
some force of repulsion; at any moment we may find the sea free."

"Well, if that happens, we shall take advantage of it. It is not
impossible that beyond Bellot Strait we might get northward through
Peel Sound or MacClintock Channel, and then--"

"Captain," said James Wall, approaching, "the ice threatens to tear
away the rudder."

"Well," answered Hatteras, "never mind; I sha'n't unship it; I want to
be ready at any hour, day or night. Take every precaution, Mr. Wall,
and keep the ice off; but don't unship it, you understand."

"But--" began Wall.

"I don't care to hear any remarks, sir," said Hatteras, severely.
"Go!"

Wall returned to his post.

"Ah!" said Hatteras, angrily, "I would give five years of my life to
be farther north! I don't know any more dangerous place; and besides,
we are so near the magnetic pole that the compass is of no use; the
needle is inactive, or always shifting its direction."

"I confess," said the doctor, "that it is not plain sailing; but
still, those who undertook it were prepared for such dangers, and
there is no need to be surprised."

"Ah, Doctor! the crew has changed very much, and you have seen that
the officers have begun to make remarks. The high pay offered the
sailors induced them to ship; but they have their bad side, for as
soon as they are off they are anxious to get back. Doctor, I have no
encouragement in my undertaking, and if I fail, it won't be the fault
of such or such a sailor, but of the ill-will of certain officers. Ah,
they'll pay dearly for it!"

"You are exaggerating, Hatteras."

"Not at all! Do you fancy the crew are sorry for the obstacles we are
meeting? On the contrary, they hope I shall be compelled to abandon my
plans. So they do not murmur, and when the _Forward_ is headed for the
south, it will be the same thing. Fools! They imagine they are
returning to England! But when I'm turned towards the north, you will
see a difference! I swear solemnly that no living being shall make me
swerve from my course! Give me a passage, an opening through which my
brig can go, and I shall take it, if I have to leave half her
sheathing behind!"

The desires of the captain were destined to be satisfied in a measure.
As the doctor had foretold, there was a sudden change in the evening;
under some influence of the wind, the ice-fields separated; the
_Forward_ pushed on boldly, breaking the ice with her steel prow; all
the night they advanced, and towards six o'clock they were clear of
Bellot Strait.

But great was Hatteras's anger at finding the way to the north closed!
He was able to hide his despair; and as if the only open path were the
one of his choice, he turned the _Forward_ towards Franklin Sound.
Being unable to go up Peel Sound, he determined to go around Prince of
Wales Land, to reach MacClintock Channel. But he knew that Shandon and
Wall could not be deceived, and were conscious of the failure of his
hopes.

Nothing especial happened on the 6th of June; snow fell, and the
prophecy of the halo came true.

For thirty-six hours the _Forward_ followed the sinuosities of the
coast of Boothia, without reaching Prince of Wales Land. Hatteras put
on all steam, burning his coal extravagantly; he still intended to get
further supplies on Beechey Island; on Thursday he arrived at Franklin
Sound, and he still found the way northward impassable.

His position was a desperate one; he could not return; the ice pushed
him onward, and he saw his path forever closing behind him, as if
there were no open sea where he had passed but an hour before.

Hence, not only was the _Forward_ unable to go toward the north, but
she could not stop for a moment lest she should be imprisoned, and she
fled before the ice like a ship before a storm.

Friday, June 7th, she arrived near the coast of Boothia, at the
entrance of James Ross Sound, which had to be avoided because its only
exit is to the west, close to the shore of America.

The observations taken at noon showed them to be in latitude 70° 5'
17", and longitude 96° 46' 45"; when the doctor heard this he examined
his chart, and found that they were at the magnetic pole, at the very
point where James Ross, the nephew of Sir John, came to determine its
situation.

The land was low near the coast, and it rose only about sixty feet at
the distance of a mile from the sea.

The boiler of the _Forward_ needed cleaning; the captain anchored his
ship to a field of ice, and gave the doctor leave to go ashore with
the boatswain. For himself, being indifferent to everything outside of
his own plans, he shut himself up in his cabin, and studied the chart
of the Pole.

The doctor and his companion easily reached land; the first-named
carried a compass for his experiments; he wanted to test the work of
James Ross; he easily made out the mound of stones erected by him; he
ran towards it; an opening in the cairn let him see a tin box in which
James Ross had placed an account of his discovery. No living being had
visited this lonely spot for thirty years.

At this place a needle suspended as delicately as possible assumed a
nearly vertical position under the magnetic influence; hence the
centre of attraction was near, if not immediately beneath, the needle.

[Illustration]

The doctor made the experiment with all care. But if James Ross, owing
to the imperfection of his instruments, found a declination of only
89° 50', the real magnetic point is found within a minute of this
spot. Dr. Clawbonny was more fortunate, and at a little distance from
there he found a declination of 90°.

"This is exactly the magnetic pole of the earth!" he cried, stamping
on the ground.

"Just here?" asked Johnson.

"Precisely here, my friend!"

"Well, then," resumed the boatswain, "we must give up all the stories
of a magnetic mountain or large mass."

"Yes, Johnson," answered the doctor, laughing, "those are empty
hypotheses! As you see, there is no mountain capable of attracting
ships, of drawing their iron from them anchor after anchor, bolt after
bolt! and your shoes here are as light as anywhere in the world."

"But how do you explain--"

"There is no explanation, Johnson; we are not wise enough for that.
But what is mathematically certain is that the magnetic pole is at
this very spot!"

"Ah, Dr. Clawbonny, how glad the captain would be to say as much of
the North Pole!"

"He'll say it, Johnson; he'll say it!"

"God grant it!" was the answer.

The doctor and his companion raised a cairn at the spot where they
tried their experiment, and the signal for their return being made,
they returned to the ship at five o'clock of the evening.




CHAPTER XVII.
THE FATE OF SIR JOHN FRANKLIN.


The _Forward_ succeeded, though not without difficulty, in getting by
James Ross Sound, by frequent use of the ice-saws and gunpowder; the
crew was very much fatigued. Fortunately the temperature was
agreeable, and even thirty degrees above what James Ross found at the
same time of year. The thermometer marked 34°.

Saturday they doubled Cape Felix at the northern end of King William's
Land, one of the smaller islands of northern seas.

At that time the crew became very much depressed; they gazed wistfully
and sadly at its far-stretching shores.

In fact, they were gazing at King William's Land, the scene of one of
the saddest tragedies of modern times! Only a few miles to the west
the _Erebus_ and _Terror_ were lost.

The sailors of the _Forward_ were familiar with the attempts made to
find Franklin, and the result they had obtained, but they did not know
all the sad details. Now, while the doctor was following on his chart
the course of the ship, many of them, Bell, Bolton, and Simpson, drew
near him and began to talk with him. Soon the others followed to
satisfy their curiosity; meanwhile the brig was advancing rapidly, and
the bays, capes, and promontories of the coast passed before their
gaze like a gigantic panorama.

[Illustration]

Hatteras was pacing nervously to and fro on the quarter-deck; the
doctor found himself on the bridge, surrounded by the men of the crew;
he readily understood the interest of the situation, and the
impression that would be made by an account given under those
circumstances, hence he resumed the talk he had begun with Johnson.

"You know, my friends, how Franklin began: like Cook and Nelson, he
was first a cabin-boy; after spending his youth in long sea-voyages,
he made up his mind, in 1845, to seek the Northwest Passage; he
commanded the _Erebus_ and the _Terror_, two stanch vessels, which had
visited the antarctic seas in 1840, under the command of James Ross.
The _Erebus_, in which Franklin sailed, carried a crew of seventy men,
all told, with Fitz-James as captain; Gore and Le Vesconte,
lieutenants; Des Voeux, Sargent, and Couch, boatswains; and Stanley,
surgeon. The _Terror_ carried sixty-eight men. Crozier was the
captain; the lieutenants were Little, Hodgson, and Irving; boatswains,
Horesby and Thomas; the surgeon, Peddie. In the names of the bays,
capes, straits, promontories, channels, and islands of these latitudes
you find memorials of most of these unlucky men, of whom not one has
ever again seen his home! In all one hundred and thirty-eight men! We
know that the last of Franklin's letters were written from Disco
Island, and dated July 12, 1845. He said, 'I hope to set sail to-night
for Lancaster Sound.' What followed his departure from Disco Bay? The
captains of the whalers, the _Prince of Wales_ and the _Enterprise_,
saw these two ships for the last time in Melville Bay, and nothing
more was heard of them. Still we can follow Franklin in his course
westward; he went through Lancaster and Barrow Sounds and reached
Beechey Island, where he passed the winter of 1845-46."

"But how is this known?" asked Bell, the carpenter.

"By three tombs which the Austin expedition found there in 1850. Three
of Franklin's sailors had been buried there; and, moreover, by a paper
found by Lieutenant Hobson of the _Fox_, dated April 25, 1848. We know
also that, after leaving winter-quarters, the _Erebus_ and _Terror_
ascended Wellington Channel as far as latitude 77°; but instead of
pushing to the north, which they doubtless found impossible, they
returned towards the south--"

"And that was a fatal mistake!" uttered a grave voice. "Safety lay to
the north."

Every one turned round. It was Hatteras, who, leaning on the rail of
the quarter-deck, had just made that solemn remark.

"Without doubt," resumed the doctor, "Franklin intended to make his
way to the American shore; but tempests beset him, and September 12,
1846, the two ships were caught in the ice, a few miles from here, to
the northwest of Cape Felix; they were carried to the north-northwest
of Point Victory; there," said the doctor, pointing out to the sea.
"Now," he added, "the ships were not abandoned till April 22, 1848.
What happened during these nineteen months? What did these poor men
do? Doubtless they explored the surrounding lands, made every effort
to escape, for the admiral was an energetic man; and if he did not
succeed--"

"It's because his men betrayed him," said Hatteras in a deep voice.

The sailors did not dare to lift their eyes; these words made them
feel abashed.

"To be brief, this paper, of which I spoke, tells us, besides, that
Sir John Franklin died, worn out by his sufferings, June 11, 1847. All
honor to his memory!" said the doctor, removing his hat.

The men did the same in silence.

"What became of these poor men, deprived of their leader, during the
next ten months? They remained on board of their ships, and it was not
till April, 1848, that they made up their mind to abandon them; one
hundred and five men survived out of the hundred and thirty-eight.
Thirty-three had died! Then Captains Crozier and Fitz-James erected a
cairn at Point Victory, and left their last paper there. See, my
friends, we are passing by that point. You can see traces of the
cairn, placed, so to speak, at the farthest point reached by John Ross
in 1831! There is Cape Jane Franklin! There Point Franklin! There
Point Le Vesconte! There Erebus Bay, where the launch, made of pieces
of one of the ships, was found on a sledge! There were found silver
spoons, plenty of food, chocolate, tea, and religious books. The
hundred and five survivors, under the command of Captain Crozier, set
out for Great Fish River. How far did they get? Did they reach
Hudson's Bay? Have any survived? What became of them after that?--"

"I will tell you what became of them," said John Hatteras in an
energetic voice. "Yes, they tried to reach Hudson's Bay, and separated
into several parties. They took the road to the south. In 1854 a
letter from Dr. Rae states that in 1850 the Esquimaux had met in King
William's Land a detachment of forty men, chasing sea-cows, travelling
on the ice, dragging a boat along with them, thin, pale, and worn out
with suffering and fatigue. Later, they discovered thirty corpses on
the mainland and five on a neighboring island, some half buried,
others left without burial; some lying beneath an overturned boat,
others under the ruins of a tent; here lay an officer with his glass
swung around his shoulder, and his loaded gun near him; farther on
were kettles with the remains of a horrible meal. At this news, the
Admiralty urged the Hudson's Bay Company to send its most skilful
agents to this place. They descended Black River to its mouth. They
visited Montreal and Maconochie Islands, and Point Ogle. In vain! All
these poor fellows had died of misery, suffering, and starvation,
after trying to prolong their lives by having recourse to cannibalism.
That is what became of them along their way towards the south, which
was lined with their mutilated bodies. Well, do you want to follow
their path?"

[Illustration: "All these poor fellows had died of misery, suffering,
and starvation."]

Hatteras's ringing voice, passionate gestures, and glowing face
produced an indescribable effect. The crew, moved by the sight of
these ill-omened lands, cried with one voice,--

"To the north! to the north!"

"Well, to the north! Safety and glory await us there at the north!
Heaven is declaring for us! The wind is changing! The passage is free!
Prepare to go about!"

The sailors hastened to their places; the ice-streams grew slowly
free; the _Forward_ went about rapidly, and ran under full steam
towards MacClintock's Channel.

Hatteras was justified in counting on a freer sea; on his way he
retraced the probable path of Franklin; he went along the eastern side
of Prince of Wales Land, which is clearly defined, while the other
shore is still unknown. Evidently the clearing away of the ice towards
the south took place through the eastern strait, for it appeared
perfectly clear; so the _Forward_ was able to make up for lost time;
she was put under full steam, so that the 14th they passed Osborne
Bay, and the farthest points reached by the expeditions of 1851. There
was still a great deal of ice about them, but there was every
indication that the _Forward_ would have clear sailing-way before her.




CHAPTER XVIII.
THE WAY NORTHWARD.


The crew seemed to have returned to their habits of discipline and
obedience. Their duties were slight and infrequent, so that they had
plenty of leisure. The temperature never fell below the
freezing-point, and the thaw removed the greatest obstacles from their
path.

Duke had made friends with Dr. Clawbonny. They got on admirably
together. But as in friendship one friend is always sacrificed to the
other, it must be said that the doctor was not the other. Duke did
with him whatever he pleased. The doctor obeyed him as a dog obeys his
master. Moreover, Duke conducted himself very amicably with most of
the officers and sailors; only, instinctively doubtless, he avoided
Shandon; he had, too, a grudge against Pen and Foker; his hatred for
them manifested itself in low growls when they came near him. They,
for their part, did not dare attack the captain's dog, "his familiar
spirit," as Clifton called him.

In a word, the crew had taken courage again.

[Illustration]

"It seems to me," said James Wall one day to Richard Shandon, "that
the men took the captain's words for earnest; they seem to be sure of
success."

"They are mistaken," answered Shandon; "if they would only reflect,
and consider our condition, they would see we are simply going from
one imprudence to another."

"Still," resumed Wall, "we are in a more open sea; we are going along
a well-known route; don't you exaggerate somewhat, Shandon?"

"Not a bit, Wall; the hate and jealousy, if you please, with which
Hatteras inspires me, don't blind my eyes. Say, have you seen the
coal-bunkers lately?"

"No," answered Wall.

"Well! go below, and you'll see how near we are to the end of our
supply. By right, we ought to be going under sail, and only starting
our engine to make headway against currents or contrary winds; our
fuel ought to be burned only with the strictest economy, for who can
say where and for how long we may be detained? But Hatteras is pushed
by this mania of going forward, of reaching the inaccessible Pole, and
he doesn't care for such a detail. Whether the wind is fair or foul,
he goes on under steam; and if he goes on we run a risk of being very
much embarrassed, if not lost."

"Is that so, Shandon? That is serious!"

"You are right, Wall, it is; not only would the engine be of no use to
us if we got into a tight place, but what are we to do in the winter?
We ought to take some precautions against the cold in a country where
the mercury often freezes in the thermometer."

"But if I'm not mistaken, Shandon, the captain intends getting a new
supply at Beechey Island; they say there is a great quantity there."

"Can any one choose where he'll go in these seas, Wall? Can one count
on finding such or such a channel free of ice? And if he misses
Beechey Island, or can't reach it, what is to become of us?"

"You are right, Shandon; Hatteras seems to me unwise; but why don't
you say something of this sort to him?"

"No, Wall," answered Shandon, with ill-disguised bitterness, "I have
made up my mind not to say a word; I am not responsible any longer for
the ship; I shall await events; if I receive any commands, I obey, and
I don't proclaim my opinions."

"Let me tell you you are wrong, Shandon; for the well-being of all is
at stake, and the captain's imprudence may cost us all dear."

"And if I were to speak, Wall, would he listen to me?"

Wall did not dare say he would.

"But," he added, "he would perhaps listen to remonstrances of the
crew."

"The crew," said Shandon, shrugging his shoulders; "but, my dear Wall,
haven't you noticed that they care for everything else more than for
their safety? They know they're getting near latitude 72°, and that a
thousand pounds is paid for every degree of latitude beyond which is
reached."

"You are right, Shandon," answered Wall, "and the captain has taken
the surest means of securing his men."

"Without doubt," answered Shandon; "for the present, at least."

"What do you mean?"

"I mean that all will go very well in the absence of all dangers and
fatigues, in an open sea; Hatteras has caught them by his money; but
what is done for pay is ill done. But once let hardships, dangers,
discomfort, sickness, melancholy, and fierce cold stare them in the
face,--and we are flying towards them now,--and you will see whether
they remember the pay they are to get."

"So, in your opinion, Shandon, Hatteras will fail?"

"Exactly; he will fail. In such an enterprise, there should be an
identity of interests among the leaders, a sympathy which is lacking
here. Besides, Hatteras is mad; his whole past proves it! But we shall
see! Circumstances may arise in which the command of the ship will
have to be given to a less foolhardy captain--"

"Still," said Wall, shaking his head doubtfully, "Hatteras will always
have on his side--"

"He will have," interrupted Shandon,--"he will have that Dr.
Clawbonny, who only cares to study; Johnson, who is a slave to
discipline, and who never takes the trouble to reason; perhaps one or
two besides, like Bell, the carpenter,--four at the most, and there
are eighteen on board! No, Wall, Hatteras has not the confidence of
the crew; he knows it well, and he tries to make up for it by bribery;
he made a good use of the account of Franklin's catastrophe to create
a different feeling in their excited minds; but that won't last, I
tell you; and if he don't reach Beechey Island, he is lost!"

"If the crew suspected--"

"I beg of you," said Shandon, quickly, "not to say a word about this
to the crew; they'll find it out for themselves. Now, at any rate, it
is well to go on towards the north. But who can say whether what
Hatteras takes for a step towards the Pole may not be really retracing
our steps? At the end of MacClintock Channel is Melville Bay, and
thence open the straits which lead back to Baffin's Bay. Hatteras had
better take care! The way west is easier than the way north."

From these words Shandon's state of mind may be judged, and how
justified the captain was in suspecting a treacherous disposition in
him.

Shandon, moreover, was right when he ascribed the present satisfaction
of the crew to the prospect they had of passing latitude 72°. This
greed of gold seized the least audacious. Clifton had made out every
one's share with great exactness. Leaving out the captain and the
doctor, who could not be admitted to the division, there were sixteen
men on board the _Forward_. The amount was a thousand pounds, that was
£72 10_s_. for each man, for every degree. If they should ever reach
the Pole the eighteen degrees to be crossed would give each one a sum
of £1,125, a fair fortune. This whim would cost the captain £18,000;
but he was rich enough to pay for such a costly trip to the Pole.

These calculations aroused wonderfully the avarice of the crew, as can
be readily believed, and more than one longed to pass latitude 72°,
who, a fortnight before, rejoiced to be sailing southward.

The _Forward_ sailed by Cape Alworth June 16th. Mount Rawlinson raised
its white peaks towards the sky; the snow and mist exaggerated its
size so that it appeared colossal; the temperature remained a few
degrees above the freezing-point; cascades and cataracts appeared on
the sides of the mountain; avalanches kept falling with a roar like
that of artillery. The long stretches of glaciers made a loud echo.
The contrast between this wintry scene and the thaw made a wonderful
sight. The brig sailed along very near the coast; they were able to
see on some sheltered rocks a few bushes bearing modest little roses,
some reddish moss, and a budding dwarf willow barely rising above the
ground.

At last, June 19th, in latitude 72°, they doubled Point Minto, which
forms one of the extremities of Ommanney Bay; the brig entered
Melville Bay, called "the Sea of Money" by Bolton; this good-natured
fellow used to be always jesting on this subject, much to Clawbonny's
amusement.

The obstacles to their course were but few, for June 23d, in the teeth
of a strong northeasterly breeze, they passed latitude 74°. This was
at the middle of Melville Bay, one of the largest seas of this region.
It was first crossed by Captain Parry, in his great expedition of
1819, and there it was that his crew won the £5,000 promised by act of
Parliament.

Clifton contented himself with remarking that there were two degrees
between latitude 72° and latitude 74°: that was £125 to his credit.
But they told him that a fortune did not amount to much up there, and
that a man could be called rich only when he could have a chance to
drink to his wealth; it seemed better to wait for the moment when they
could meet at some tavern in Liverpool before rejoicing and rubbing
their hands.




CHAPTER XIX.
A WHALE IN SIGHT.


Melville Bay, although perfectly navigable, was not wholly free of
ice; immense ice-fields could be seen stretching to the horizon; here
and there appeared a few icebergs, but they stood motionless as if
anchored in the ice. The _Forward_ went under full steam through broad
passes where she had plenty of sailing-room. The wind shifted
frequently from one point of the compass to another.

The variability of the wind in the arctic seas is a remarkable fact,
and very often only a few minutes intervene between a calm and a
frightful tempest. This was Hatteras's experience on the 23d of June,
in the middle of this huge bay.

The steadiest winds blow generally from the ice to the open sea, and
are very cold. On that day the thermometer fell several degrees; the
wind shifted to the southward, and the heavy gusts, having passed over
the ice, discharged themselves of their dampness under the form of a
thick snow. Hatteras immediately ordered the sails which were aiding
the engine to be reefed; but before this could be done his
main-topsail was carried away.

Hatteras gave his orders with the utmost coolness, and did not leave
the deck during the storm; he was obliged to run before the gale. The
wind raised very heavy waves which hurled about pieces of ice of every
shape, torn from the neighboring ice-fields; the brig was tossed about
like a child's toy, and ice was dashed against its hull; at one moment
it rose perpendicularly to the top of a mountain of water; its steel
prow shone like molten metal; then it sank into an abyss, sending
forth great whirls of smoke, while the screw revolved out the water
with a fearful clatter. Rain and snow fell in torrents.

The doctor could not miss such a chance to get wet to the skin; he
remained on deck, gazing at the storm with all the admiration such a
spectacle cannot fail to draw forth. One standing next to him could
not have heard his voice; so he said nothing, but looked, and soon he
saw a singular phenomenon, one peculiar to the northern seas.

[Illustration]

The tempest was confined to a small space of about three or four
miles; in fact, the wind loses much of its force in passing over the
ice, and cannot carry its violence very far; every now and then the
doctor would see, through some rift in the storm, a clear sky and a
quiet sea beyond the ice-fields; hence the _Forward_ had only to make
her way through the passes to find smooth sailing; but she ran a risk
of being dashed against the moving masses which obeyed the motion of
the waves. Notwithstanding, Hatteras succeeded in a few hours in
carrying his vessel into smooth water, while the violence of the
storm, now at its worst at the horizon, was dying away within a few
cable-lengths from the _Forward_.

Melville Bay then looked very different; by the influence of the winds
and waves a large number of icebergs had been detached from the shores
and were now floating northward, continually crashing against one
another. They could be counted by hundreds; but the bay is very broad,
and the brig avoided them without difficulty. The sight of these
floating masses, which seemed to be racing together, was indeed
magnificent.

The doctor was wild with enthusiasm about it, when Simpson, the
harpooner, came up to him and asked him to notice the changing tints
of the sea, which varied from deep blue to olive green; long bands ran
from north to south with edges so sharply cut that the line of
division could be seen as far as the horizon. Sometimes a transparent
sheet would stretch out from an opaque one.

"Well, Dr. Clawbonny, what do you think of that?" said Simpson.

"I agree, my friend, with what Scoresby said about these differently
colored waters," answered the doctor, "namely, that the blue water
does not contain the millions of animalcules and medusæ which the
green water contains; he made a great many experiments to test it, and
I am ready to agree with him."

"O, but there's something else it shows!"

"What is that?"

"Well, if the _Forward_ were only a whaler, I believe we should have
some sport."

"But," answered the doctor, "I don't see any whales."

"We shall very soon, though, I promise you. It's great luck for a
whaler to see those green patches in these latitudes."

"Why so?" asked the doctor, whose curiosity was aroused by these
remarks of a man who had had experience in what he was talking about.

"Because," answered Simpson, "it is in that green water that most of
the whales are caught."

"What is the reason, Simpson?"

"Because they get more food there."

"You are sure of that?"

"O, I have seen it a hundred times in Baffin's Bay! I don't see why
the same shouldn't be the case in Melville Bay."

"You must be right, Simpson."

"And see," Simpson continued as he leaned over the rail,--"see there,
Doctor."

"One would say it was the track of a ship."

"Well," said Simpson, "it's an oily substance that the whale leaves
behind it. Really, the whale itself can't be far off."

In fact, the atmosphere was filled with a strong fishy smell. The
doctor began to examine the surface of the sea, and the harpooner's
prediction was soon verified. Foker was heard shouting from aloft,--

"A whale to leeward!"

All turned their eyes in that direction; a low spout was seen rising
from the sea about a mile from the brig.

"There she spouts!" shouted Simpson, whose experienced eye soon
detected it.

[Illustration]

"It's gone," said the doctor.

"We could soon find it again, if it were necessary," said Simpson,
regretfully.

But to his great surprise, although no one had dared to ask it,
Hatteras gave the order to lower and man the whale-boat; he was glad
to give the men some distraction, and also to get a few barrels of
oil. They heard the order with great satisfaction.

Four sailors took their places in the whale-boat; Johnson took the
helm; Simpson stood in the bow, harpoon in hand. The doctor insisted
on joining the party. The sea was quite smooth. The whale-boat went
very fast, and in about ten minutes she was a mile from the brig.

The whale, having taken another breath, had dived again; but soon it
came up and projected fifteen feet into the air that combination of
gases and mucous fluid which escapes from its vent-holes.

"There, there!" cried Simpson, pointing to a place about eight hundred
yards from the boat.

They approached it rapidly; and the brig, having also seen it, drew
near slowly.

The huge monster kept appearing above the waves, showing its black
back, which resembled a great rock in the sea; a whale never swims
rapidly unless pursued, and this one was letting itself be rocked by
the waves.

The hunters approached in silence, choosing the green water, which was
so opaque as to prevent the whale from seeing them. It is always
exciting to watch a frail boat attacking one of these monsters; this
one was about one hundred and thirty feet long, and often between
latitude 72° and 80° whales are found more than one hundred and
twenty-four feet long; ancient writers have often spoken of some
longer than seven hundred feet, but they are imaginary animals.

Soon the boat was very near the whale. Simpson made a sign, the men
stopped rowing, and, brandishing his harpoon, he hurled it skilfully;
this, with sharp barbs, sank into the thick layers of fat. The wounded
whale dived rapidly. At once the four oars were unshipped; the rope
which was attached to the harpoon ran out rapidly, and the boat was
dragged along while Johnson steered it skilfully.

The whale swam away from the brig and hastened towards the moving
icebergs; for half an hour it went on in this way; the cord had to be
kept wet to prevent its taking fire from friction. When the animal
seemed to go more slowly, the rope was dragged back and carefully
coiled; the whale rose again to the surface, lashing violently with
its tail; huge spouts of water were dashed up by it and fell in
torrents on the boat, which now approached rapidly; Simpson had taken
a long lance and was prepared to meet the whale face to face.

[Illustration: "The whale swam away from the brig and hastened towards
the moving icebergs."]

But it plunged rapidly into a pass between two icebergs. Further
pursuit seemed dangerous.

"The devil!" said Johnson.

"Forward, forward, my friends," shouted Simpson, eager for the chase;
"the whale is ours."

"But we can't follow it among the icebergs," answered Johnson, turning
the boat away.

"Yes, yes!" cried Simpson.

"No, no!" said some of the sailors.

"Yes!" cried others.

During this discussion the whale had got between two icebergs which
the wind and waves were driving together.

The whale-boat was in danger of being dragged into this dangerous
pass, when Johnson sprang forward, axe in hand, and cut the line.

It was time; the two icebergs met with irresistible force, crushing
the whale between them.

"Lost!" cried Simpson.

"Saved!" said Johnson.

"Upon my word," said the doctor, who had not flinched, "that was well
worth seeing!"

The crushing power of these mountains is enormous. The whale was the
victim of an accident that is very frequent in these waters. Scoresby
tells us that in the course of a single summer thirty whalers have
been lost in this way in Baffin's Bay; he saw a three-master crushed
in one minute between two walls of ice, which drew together with
fearful rapidity and sank the ship with all on board. Two other ships
he himself saw cut through, as if by a long lance, by huge pieces of
ice more than a hundred feet long.

A few moments later the whale-boat returned to the brig, and was
hauled up to its usual place on deck.

"That's a lesson," said Shandon, aloud, "for those who are foolhardy
enough to venture into the passes!"




CHAPTER XX.
BEECHEY ISLAND.


June 25th the _Forward_ sighted Cape Dundas, at the northwest
extremity of Prince of Wales Land. There they found more serious
difficulties amid thicker ice. The channel here grows narrower, and
the line of Crozier, Young, Day, and Lowther Islands ranged in a line,
like forts in a harbor, drive the ice-streams nearer together. What
would otherwise have taken the brig a day now detained her from June
25th to the end of the month; she was continually obliged to stop, to
retreat, and to wait for a favorable chance to reach Beechey Island.
Meanwhile a great deal of coal was consumed; though during the
frequent halts only small fires were kept burning, sufficient to keep
steam up day and night.

Hatteras knew as well as Shandon the reduced state of their supply;
but feeling sure that he would find fuel at Beechey Island, he did not
wish to lose a minute for the sake of economy; he had been very much
delayed by running south; and, although he had taken the precaution of
leaving England in April, he now found himself no farther advanced
than previous expeditions had been at that time of year.

The 30th they passed Cape Walker at the northeast extremity of Prince
of Wales Land; this is the farthest point seen by Kennedy and Bellot,
May 3d, 1852, after an expedition across North Somerset. In 1851,
Captain Ommaney of the Austin expedition had been fortunate enough to
get fresh supplies there for his detachment.

[Illustration]

This cape, which is very lofty, is remarkable for its reddish-brown
color; in clear weather one can see as far as the entrance of
Wellington Channel. Towards evening they saw Cape Bellot, separated
from Cape Walker by MacLeon's Bay. Cape Bellot was so named in
presence of that young French officer to whom the English expedition
gave three cheers. At this place the coast consists of a yellowish
limestone, very rough in appearance; it is protected by huge masses of
ice which the north-wind collects there in the most imposing way. It
was soon no longer to be seen from the _Forward's_ deck, as she was
making her way amid the loose ice towards Beechey Island through
Barrow Strait.

Hatteras, having resolved to go on in a straight line, in order not to
be carried past the island, hardly left the deck during the subsequent
days; he would go aloft to the cross-trees in order to pick out the
most favorable path for the brig. All that skill, coolness, boldness,
and even maritime genius could do, was done by him while sailing
through the strait. It is true that fortune did not favor him, for at
that season he ought to have found the sea nearly open. But by dint of
sparing neither steam, his men, nor himself, he succeeded in his aim.

July 3d, at eleven o'clock in the morning, the ice-master saw land to
the north; Hatteras soon made it out as Beechey Island, the general
rendezvous for arctic explorers. Almost all the ships which sail in
these latitudes touch here. Here Franklin passed his first winter
before advancing into Wellington Channel. Here Creswell, MacClure's
lieutenant, after a march of four hundred and sixty miles on the ice,
rejoined the _Phoenix_ and returned to England. The last ship which
anchored at Beechey Island before the _Forward_ was the _Fox_;
MacClintock took in supplies there, August 11, 1855, and repaired the
dwellings and storehouses; that was but a short time previous.
Hatteras knew all these details.

The boatswain's heart beat strongly at the sight of this island; when
he had last seen it he had been quartermaster on the _Phoenix_;
Hatteras asked him about the coast, the place for anchoring, the
possible change of the bottom. The weather was perfect; the
thermometer marked 57°.

"Well, Johnson," said the captain, "do you recognize this place?"

"Yes, Captain, it's Beechey Island! Only we ought to bear a little
farther north; the coast is more easily approached there."

"But the buildings, the stores?" said Hatteras.

"O, you can't see them till you get ashore; they are hidden behind
those hillocks you see there!"

"And did you carry large supplies there?"

"Yes, they were large. The Admiralty sent us here in 1853, under the
command of Captain Inglefield, with the steamer _Phoenix_ and a
transport, the _Breadalbane_, loaded with supplies; we carried enough
to revictual a whole expedition."

"But did not the commander of the _Fox_ take a great deal away in
1855?" said Hatteras.

"O, don't be anxious, Captain!" answered Johnson; "there will be
enough left for you; the cold keeps everything wonderfully, and we
shall find everything as fresh and in as good condition as on the
first day."

"I'm not so anxious about the provisions," answered Hatteras; "I have
enough for several years; what I stand in need of is coal."

"Well, Captain, we left more than a thousand tons there; so you can
feel easy about that."

"Let us stand nearer," resumed Hatteras, who, glass in hand, kept
examining the shore.

"You see that point," said Johnson; "when we've doubled it, we shall
be near our anchorage. Yes, it's from there we started for England
with Lieutenant Creswell and twelve sick men of the _Investigator_.
But if we were fortunate enough to be of service to Captain MacClure's
lieutenant, Bellot, the officer who accompanied us on the _Phoenix_,
never saw his home again! Ah, that's a sad memory! But, Captain, I
think it's here we ought to anchor."

"Very well," answered Hatteras.

And he gave the proper orders. The _Forward_ lay in a little harbor
sheltered from the north, east, and south winds, about a cable-length
from the shore.

"Mr. Wall," said Hatteras, "you will lower the launch and send six men
to bring coal aboard."

"Yes, sir," answered Wall.

"I am going ashore in the gig with the doctor and the boatswain; Mr.
Shandon, will you go with us?"

"At your orders," answered Shandon.

A few minutes later the doctor, with gun and baskets for any specimens
he might find, took his place in the gig with his companions; ten
minutes later they stepped out on a low, rocky shore.

"Lead the way, Johnson," said Hatteras; "do you remember it?"

"Perfectly, Captain; only here is a monument which I did not expect to
find here."

"That," shouted the doctor, "I know what it is; let's go look at it;
it will tell us of itself why it was put here."

The four men went up to it, and the doctor, baring his head, said,--

"This, my friends, is a monument raised to the memory of Franklin and
his companions."

[Illustration]

In fact, Lady Franklin having, in 1855, sent a tablet of black marble
to Dr. Kane, gave another in 1858 to MacClintock to be placed on
Beechey Island. MacClintock discharged his duty, and placed this
tablet near a funeral pile raised to the memory of Bellot by Sir John
Barrow.

This tablet bore the following inscription:--


                        TO THE MEMORY OF
                 FRANKLIN, CROZIER, FITZ-JAMES,
  AND ALL THEIR GALLANT BROTHER OFFICERS AND FAITHFUL COMPANIONS
                 Who have suffered and perished
     in the cause of science and the service of their country.
                          THIS TABLET
   Is erected near the spot where they passed their first arctic
                             Winter,
     and whence they issued forth to conquer difficulties or
                             TO DIE.
  It commemorates the grief of their Admiring Countrymen and Friends,
                and the anguish, subdued by Faith,
   of her who has lost, in the heroic Leader of the Expedition, the
                          Most Devoted
                  and Affectionate of Husbands.

   "_And so he bringeth them unto the Haven where they would be._"
                              1855.


This stone, on a lonely shore of these remote regions, touched every
one's heart; the doctor felt the tears rising in his eyes. On the very
spot whence Franklin and his men sailed, full of hope and strength,
there was now merely a slab of marble to commemorate them; and in
spite of this solemn warning of fate, the _Forward_ was about to
follow the path of the _Erebus_ and _Terror_.

Hatteras was the first to rouse himself; he ascended quickly a rather
high hillock, which was almost entirely bare of snow.

"Captain," said Johnson, following him, "from there we ought to see
the stores."

Shandon and the doctor joined them just as they reached the top of the
hill.

But their eyes saw nothing but large plains with no trace of a
building.

"This is very strange," said the boatswain.

"Well, these stores?" said Hatteras, quickly.

"I don't know,--I don't see--" stammered Johnson.

"You must have mistaken the path," said the doctor.

"Still it seems to me," resumed Johnson after a moment's reflection,
"that at this very spot--"

"Well," said Hatteras, impatiently, "where shall we go?"

"Let's go down again," said the boatswain, "for it's possible I've
lost my way! In seven years I may have forgotten the place."

"Especially," said the doctor, "when the country is so monotonous."

"And yet--" muttered Johnson.

Shandon said not a word. After walking a few minutes, Johnson stopped.

"No," he said, "I'm not mistaken."

"Well," said Hatteras, looking around.

"What makes you say so, Johnson?" asked the doctor.

"Do you see this little rise in the earth?" asked the boatswain,
pointing downwards to a mound in which three elevations could be
clearly seen.

"What does that mean?" asked the doctor.

"There," answered Johnson, "are the three tombs of Franklin's sailors.
I'm sure of it! I'm not mistaken, and the stores must be within a
hundred paces of us, and if they're not there,--it's because--"

He durst not finish his sentence; Hatteras ran forward, and terrible
despair seized him. There ought to stand those much-needed
storehouses, with supplies of all sorts on which he had been counting;
but ruin, pillage, and destruction had passed over that place where
civilized hands had accumulated resources for battered sailors. Who
had committed these depredations? Wild animals, wolves, foxes, bears?
No, for they would have destroyed only the provisions; and there was
left no shred of a tent, not a piece of wood, not a scrap of iron, no
bit of any metal, nor--what was more serious for the men of the
_Forward_--a single lump of coal.

Evidently the Esquimaux, who have often had much to do with European
ships, had finally learned the value of these objects; since the visit
of the _Fox_ they had come frequently to this great storehouse, and
had pillaged incessantly, with the intention of leaving no trace of
what had been there; and now a long drift of half-melted snow covered
the ground.

Hatteras was baffled. The doctor gazed and shook his head. Shandon
said nothing, but an attentive observer would have noticed a wicked
smile about his lips.

At this moment the men sent by Wall arrived. They took it all in at a
glance. Shandon went up to the captain and said,--

"Mr. Hatteras, we need not despair; fortunately we are near the
entrance to Barrow Strait, which will carry us back to Baffin's Bay."

"Mr. Shandon," answered Hatteras, "we are fortunately near the
entrance of Wellington Channel, and it will lead us to the north."

"And how shall we go, Captain?"

"Under sail, sir. We have two months' fuel left, and that is more than
we shall need for next winter."

"Permit me to say," began Shandon.

"I permit you to follow me to the ship, sir," was Hatteras's answer.

And turning his back on his first officer, he returned to the brig and
locked himself in his cabin.

For two days the wind was unfavorable; the captain did not come on
deck. The doctor profited by this forced delay to examine Beechey
Island; he collected a few plants which a comparatively high
temperature let grow here and there on some rocks which projected from
the snow, such as heather, a few lichens, a sort of yellow ranunculus,
a plant like sorrel with leaves a trifle larger, and some sturdy
saxifrages.

[Illustration]

The fauna of this country was much richer; the doctor saw large flocks
of geese and cranes flying northward; partridges, eider-ducks,
northern divers, numerous ptarmigans, which are delicious eating,
noisy flocks of kittiwakes, and great white-bellied loons represented
the winged tribe. The doctor was lucky enough to kill some gray hares,
which had not yet put on their white winter coat of fur, and a blue
fox, which Duke skilfully caught. A few bears, evidently accustomed to
fear men, could not be approached, and the seals were very timid,
probably for the same reason. The harbor was full of a very good
tasting shellfish. The genus _articulata_, order _diptera_, family
_culicides_, division _nemocera_, was represented by a simple
mosquito, a single one, which the doctor, though much bitten, had the
pleasure of catching. As a conchologist, he was less fortunate, and he
was obliged to content himself with a sort of mussel and some
bivalves.

[Illustration]




CHAPTER XXI.
THE DEATH OF BELLOT.


The temperature remained at 57° during July 3d and 4th; this was the
highest temperature observed. But on Thursday, the 5th, the wind
shifted to the southeast, with violent snow-squalls. The thermometer
fell twenty-three degrees in the preceding night. Hatteras,
indifferent to the hostility of the crew, gave the order to set sail.
For thirteen days, ever since passing Cape Dundas, the _Forward_ had
not gone a single degree farther north; hence the party represented by
Clifton was dissatisfied; their wishes, it is true, coincided with
those of the captain, namely, that they should make their way through
Wellington Channel, and they were all glad to be off once more.

It was with difficulty that sail was set; but having in the course of
the night run up the mainsail and topsails, Hatteras plunged boldly
into the ice, which the current was driving towards the south. The
crew became very tired of this tortuous navigation, which kept them
very busy with the sails.

Wellington Channel is not very broad; it lies between North Devon on
the east and Cornwallis Island on the west; for a long time this
island was considered a peninsula. It was Sir John Franklin who
circumnavigated it, in 1846, from the western side, going about its
northern coast.

[Illustration: "The _Forward_ in Wellington Channel."]

The exploration of Wellington Channel was made in 1851, by Captain
Penny, in the whale-ships _Lady Franklin_ and _Sophia_; one of his
lieutenants, Stewart, who reached Cape Beechey, latitude 76° 20',
discovered the open sea. The open sea! It was for that Hatteras
longed.

"What Stewart found, I shall find," he said to the doctor; "and I
shall be able to get to the Pole under sail."

"But," answered the doctor, "don't you fear lest the crew--"

"The crew!" said Hatteras, coldly.

Then in a lower tone he murmured,--

"Poor men!" much to the doctor's surprise.

It was the first sentiment of this sort which he had ever noticed in
the captain.

"No," he went on warmly, "they must follow me, and they shall."

Still, if the _Forward_ need not fear collision with the ice-streams,
she made but little way northward, being much delayed by contrary
winds. With some difficulty they got by Capes Spencer and Innis, and
Tuesday, the 10th, latitude 75° was at last reached, much to Clifton's
joy.

The _Forward_ was now at the very spot where the American ships, the
_Rescue_ and the _Advance_, commanded by Captain Haven, ran such
terrible dangers. Dr. Kane accompanied this expedition; towards the
end of September, 1850, these ships were caught in the ice, and
carried with irresistible force into Lancaster Sound.

Shandon told James Wall about it in the presence of some of the men.

"The _Advance_ and the _Rescue_," he said, "were so tossed about by
ice, that they could keep no fires on board; and yet the thermometer
stood at 18° below zero. During the whole winter the crews were kept
imprisoned, ready to abandon their ships, and for three weeks they did
not take off their clothes! It was a terrible situation; after
drifting a thousand miles, they were driven to the middle of Baffin's
Bay!"

One may easily judge of the effect of such a narration on a crew
already discontented.

While this conversation was going on, Johnson was talking with the
doctor about an event which had taken place here; the doctor, at his
request, told him the exact moment when the brig reached latitude 75°
30'.

"There it is! there it is!" said Johnson, "there is that unlucky
land!"

And so speaking, tears came into the boatswain's eyes.

"You mean Lieutenant Bellot's death," said the doctor.

"Yes, sir, of that brave, good man!"

"And it was here, you say, that it took place?"

"Just here, on this part of the coast of North Devon. It was very
great ill-luck, and this would not have happened if Captain Pullen had
come on board sooner."

"What do you mean, Johnson?"

"Listen, Doctor, and you will see by how slight a thread life is held.
You know that Lieutenant Bellot had already made an expedition in
search of Franklin, in 1850?"

"Yes; in the _Prince Albert_."

"Well, in 1853, having returned to France, he got permission to sail
in the _Phoenix_, in which I was a sailor, under Captain Inglefield.
We came with the _Breadalbane_ to carry supplies to Beechey Island."

"Those which we did not find!"

"Exactly, Doctor. We arrived at Beechey Island at the beginning of
August; the 10th of that month, Captain Inglefield left the _Phoenix_
to rejoin Captain Pullen, who had been away for a month from his ship,
the _North Star_. He intended on his return to send the Admiralty
despatches to Sir Edward Belcher, who was wintering in Wellington
Channel. Now, shortly after our captain's departure, Captain Pullen
reached his ship. If he had only come back before Captain Inglefield
had left! Lieutenant Bellot, fearing that our captain's absence might
be a long one, and knowing that the Admiralty despatches were
important, offered to carry them himself. He left the two ships under
Captain Pullen's charge, and left August 12, with a sledge and an
india-rubber canoe. He took with him Harvey, quartermaster of the
_North Star_, and three sailors, Madden, David Hook, and me. We
thought that Sir Edward Belcher would be somewhere near Cape Beecher,
at the northern part of the channel; hence we made for that part in
our sledge, keeping on the east bank. The first day we encamped three
miles from Cape Innis; the next day we stopped on the ice nearly three
miles from Cape Bowden. During the night, which was as bright as day,
land being only three miles distant, Lieutenant Bellot determined to
go and camp there; he tried to reach it in the canoe; a violent
southeast breeze drove him back twice; Harvey and Madden tried in
their turn, and with success; they carried a rope, and with it they
established communication with the shore; three objects were carried
across by it; but at the fourth attempt, we felt the ice moving away
from us; Mr. Bellot shouted to his companions to loosen the rope, and
we (the lieutenant, David Hook, and I) were carried to a great
distance from the shore. Then a strong southeaster was blowing, and
snow was falling. But we were not in any great danger, and he might
have been saved, since the rest of us were saved."

Johnson stopped for a moment, and gazed at the ill-fated shore, then
he went on:--

"After losing sight of our companions, we tried at first to shelter
ourselves under the cover of our sledge, but in vain; then with our
knives we began to cut a house in the ice. Mr. Bellot sat down for
half an hour, and talked with us about the danger of our situation; I
told him I was not afraid. 'With God's protection,' he said, 'not a
hair of our heads shall be hurt.' I then asked him what time it was.
He answered, 'About quarter past six.' It was quarter past six in the
morning of Thursday, August 18th. Then Mr. Bellot bound on his books,
and said he wanted to go and see how the ice was moving; he was gone
only four minutes, when I went to seek him behind the floe which
sheltered us; but I did not find him, and, returning to our retreat, I
saw his stick on the opposite side of a crevasse about three fathoms
wide, where the ice was all broken. I shouted, but there was no
answer. At that time the wind was blowing very hard. I searched all
around, but I could find no trace of the poor lieutenant."

"And what do you suppose became of him?" asked the doctor, who was
much moved by this account.

[Illustration]

"I suppose that when he left the shelter, the wind drove him into the
crevasse, and that, being thickly clad, he could not swim to the
surface. O Dr. Clawbonny, I never felt worse in my life! I could not
believe it! That brave officer fell a victim to his sense of duty! For
you know that it was in order to obey Captain Pullen's instructions
that he was trying to reach the land before the ice began to break! He
was a brave man, liked by every one, faithful, courageous! All England
mourned him, and even the Esquimaux, when they heard of his death from
Captain Inglefield, when he returned from Pound Bay, did nothing but
weep and repeat, 'Poor Bellot! Poor Bellot!'"

[Illustration]

"But you and your companions, Johnson," asked the doctor, much moved
by this touching account,--"how did you manage to get to shore?"

"O, it was very simple! We remained twenty-four hours on the ice
without food or fire, but finally we reached a firmly fastened
ice-field; we sprang upon it, and with an oar we got near a floe
capable of supporting us, and being controlled like a boat. In that
way we reached the shore, but alone, without our brave officer."

At the end of this account the _Forward_ had passed by this fatal
shore, and Johnson soon lost sight of the scene of this terrible
catastrophe. The next day they left Griffin's Bay on the starboard,
and two days later, Capes Grinnell and Helpman; finally, July 14th,
they doubled Osborne Point, and the 15th the brig anchored in Baring
Bay at the end of the channel. The navigation had not been very
difficult; Hatteras found a sea nearly as free as that by which
Belcher profited to go and winter with the _Pioneer_ and _Assistance_
in latitude 77°. That was his first winter, 1852-53, for the next he
spent in Baring Bay, where the _Forward_ now lay at anchor.

It was in consequence of the most terrible dangers and trials that he
was obliged to abandon the _Assistance_ in the midst of the eternal
ice.

Shandon gave a full account of this catastrophe to the demoralized
sailors. Was Hatteras aware of the treachery of his first officer? It
is impossible to say, but, at any rate, he said nothing about it.

At the end of Baring Bay is a narrow canal uniting Wellington Channel
with Queen's Strait. There the ice had accumulated very closely.
Hatteras made vain efforts to get through the passages to the north of
Hamilton Island; the wind was unfavorable; hence it was necessary to
go between Hamilton and Cornwallis Islands; five precious days were
lost in vain attempts. The air grew colder, and, July 19th, fell as
low as 26°; the next day was warmer, but this harbinger of the arctic
winter warned Hatteras not to linger longer. The wind seemed to blow
steadily from the west and delayed his progress. And yet he was in
haste to reach the point whence Stewart saw an open sea. The 19th he
resolved to enter the channel at any price; the wind blew dead against
the brig, which, with her screw, could have made headway against the
violent snow-squalls, but Hatteras had before all to be economical
with the fuel; on the other hand, the channel was too broad to permit
of the brig being towed. Hatteras, without taking into account the
fatigue of his crew, made use of a device which whalers often employ
under similar circumstances. He lowered the small boats to the surface
of the water, not letting them free from their tackle; then they were
made fast, fore and aft; oars were put out, to starboard on one side
and to port on the other; the men sat on the thwarts and rowed
vigorously, so as to propel the brig against the wind.

[Illustration: Hatteras made use of a device which whalers employ.]

The _Forward_ made slight headway; this method of working was very
fatiguing; the men began to murmur. For four days they advanced in
that way, until July 23d, when they reached Baring Island, in Queen's
Channel.

The wind was still unfavorable. The crew could go no farther. The
doctor found the strength of the crew much pulled down, and he thought
he detected the first symptoms of scurvy; he used every precaution
against this terrible disease, having abundant supplies of lime-juice
and chalk-pastilles.

Hatteras soon saw there was nothing more to be got from his crew;
kindness and persuasion were fruitless; he resolved to employ
severity, and, if need be, to be pitiless; he distrusted especially
Richard Shandon, and even James Wall, who, however, never dared to
speak too loud. Hatteras had on his side the doctor, Johnson, Bell,
and Simpson; these were all devoted to him body and soul. Among the
uncertain were Foker, Bolton, Wolston, the gunner, Brunton, the first
engineer, who might at any moment declare against him. As to the
others, Pen, Gripper, Clifton, and Warren, they openly meditated
mutiny; they wanted to bring their companions over and compel the
_Forward_ to return to England.

Hatteras soon saw that he could get no more work from his dispirited
crew, who now were worn out with fatigue from their hard work. For
twenty-four hours they remained in sight of Baring Island without
getting a foot forward. Still the weather grew colder, and in these
high latitudes even July felt the influence of the approaching winter.
The 24th, the thermometer fell to 22°. The young ice formed during the
night to a depth of about half an inch; if snow should fall on it, it
would soon be strong enough to bear the weight of a man. The sea soon
acquired the turbid tint which indicates the formation of the first
crystals.

Hatteras read aright these alarming signs; if the passes should close,
he would be obliged to winter here, far from the aim of his voyage,
and without even having seen that open sea which he must have got very
near, according to the accounts of his predecessors. Hence he resolved
to get on at any price a few degrees farther north; seeing that he
could neither try rowing with his crew exhausted, nor going under sail
with the wind always unfavorable, he ordered the fires to be lighted.




CHAPTER XXII.
THE FIRST SIGNS OF MUTINY.


At this unexpected command, the surprise on board of the _Forward_ was
very great.

"Light the fires!" said some.

"With what?" said others.

"When we have only two months' supply in the hold!" cried Pen.

"And how are we to keep warm in the winter?" asked Clifton.

"We shall have to burn the ship down to the water-line, I suppose,"
said Gripper.

"And cram all the masts into the stove," answered Warren, "from the
foretopmast to the jib-boom."

Shandon gazed intently at Wall. The surprised engineers hesitated to
go down into the engine-room.

"Did you hear what I said?" shouted the captain, angrily.

Brunton walked toward the hatchway; but he stopped before going down.

"Don't go, Brunton," some one said.

"Who spoke then?" shouted Hatteras.

"I did," said Pen, approaching the captain.

"And what is it you're saying?" asked the captain.

"I say--I say," answered Pen with many oaths,--"I say that we have had
enough of this, that we are not going any farther, that we don't want
to wear ourselves out with fatigue and cold during the winter, and
that the fires shall not be lighted."

"Mr. Shandon," answered Hatteras, coldly, "have this man put in
irons."

"But, Captain," said Shandon, "what this man said--"

"If you repeat what this man said," retorted Hatteras, "I shall order
you to your cabin and confine you there. Seize that man! Do you hear?"

Johnson, Bell, and Simpson stepped towards the sailor, who was beside
himself with wrath.

"The first man who lays a finger on me--" he cried, seizing a
handspike, which he flourished about his head.

Hatteras walked towards him.

"Pen," he said very quietly, "if you move hand or foot, I shall blow
your brains out!"

With these words he drew a revolver and aimed it at the sailor.

[Illustration]

A murmur arose from the crew.

"Not a word from any of you," said Hatteras, "or he's a dead man."

At that moment Johnson and Bell disarmed Pen, who no longer resisted,
and suffered himself to be led to the bottom of the hold.

"Now go below, Brunton," said Hatteras.

The engineer, followed by Plover and Warren, went below. Hatteras
returned to the quarter-deck.

"That Pen is a worthless fellow," the doctor said to him.

"No man was ever nearer death," answered the captain, simply.

Soon there was enough steam on; the anchors of the _Forward_ were
raised; and the brig started eastward, heading for Point Beecher, and
cutting through the newly formed ice.

A great number of islands lie between Baring Island and Point Beecher,
scattered in the midst of the ice-fields; the ice-streams crowd in
great numbers in the little straits into which they divide the sea;
when the weather is cold they have a tendency to accumulate; here and
there hummocks were forming, and it was easy to see that the floes,
already harder and more crowded, would, under the influence of the
first frosts, soon form an impenetrable mass.

It was with great difficulty that the _Forward_ made her way through
the whirling snow. Still, with the variability which is a peculiarity
of these regions, the sun would appear from time to time; the air grew
much milder; the ice melted as if by enchantment, and a clear expanse
of water, a most welcome sight to the eyes of the crew, spread out
before them where a few moments before the ice had blocked their
progress. All over the horizon there spread magnificent orange tints,
which rested their eyes, weary with gazing at the eternal snow.

Thursday, July 26th, the _Forward_ coasted along Dundas Island, and
then stood more northward; but there she found herself face to face
with a thick mass of ice, eight or nine feet high, consisting of
little icebergs washed away from the shore; they had to prolong the
curve they were making to the west. The continual cracking of the ice,
joining with the creaking of the rolling ship, sounded like a gloomy
lamentation. At last the brig found a passage and advanced through it
slowly; often a huge floe delayed her for hours; the fog embarrassed
the steersman; at one moment he could see a mile ahead, and it was
easy to avoid all obstacles; but again the snow-squalls would hide
everything from their sight at the distance of a cable's length. The
sea ran very high.

[Illustration]

Sometimes the smooth clouds assumed a strange appearance, as if they
were reflecting the ice-banks; there were days when the sun could not
pierce the dense mist.

The birds were still very numerous, and their cries were deafening;
the seals, lying lazily on the drifting ice, raised their heads
without being frightened, and turned their long necks to watch the
ship go by. Often, too, the brig would leave bits of sheathing on the
ice against which she grazed.

[Illustration]

Finally, after six days of this slow sailing, August 1st, Point
Beecher was made, sighted in the north; Hatteras passed the last hours
in the lookout; the open sea, which Stewart had seen May 30, 1851,
towards latitude 76° 20', could not be far off, and yet, as far as
Hatteras could see, he could make out no sign of an open polar sea. He
came down without saying a word.

"Do you believe in an open sea?" asked Shandon of the second mate.

"I'm beginning to have my doubts," answered James Wall.

"Wasn't I right in considering this pretended discovery as a mere
hypothesis? No one agreed with me, and you too, Wall,--you sided
against me."

"They'll believe you next time, Shandon."

"Yes," he answered, "when it's too late."

And he returned to his cabin, where he had kept himself almost
exclusively since his discussion with the captain.

Towards evening the wind shifted to the south. Hatteras then set his
sails and had the fires put out; for many days the crew were kept hard
at work; every few minutes they had to tack or bear away, or to
shorten sail quickly to stop the course of the brig; the braces could
not run easily through the choked-up pulleys, and added to the fatigue
of the crew; more than a week was required for them to reach Point
Barrow. The _Forward_ had not made thirty miles in ten days.

Then the wind flew around to the north, and the engine was started
once more. Hatteras still hoped to find an open sea beyond latitude
77°, such as Edward Belcher had seen.

And yet, if he believed in Penny's account, the part of the sea which
he was now crossing ought to have been open; for Penny, having reached
the limit of the ice, saw in a canoe the shores of Queen's Channel at
latitude 77°.

Must he regard their reports as apochryphal, or had an unusually early
winter fallen upon these regions?

August 15th, Mount Percy reared into the mist its peaks covered with
eternal snow; a violent wind was hurling in their teeth a fierce
shower of hail. The next day the sun set for the first time,
terminating at last the long series of days twenty-four hours long.
The men had finally accustomed themselves to this perpetual daylight;
but the animals minded it very little; the Greenland dogs used to go
to sleep at the usual hour, and even Duke lay down at the same hour
every evening, as if the night were dark.

Still, during the nights following August 16th the darkness was never
very marked; the sun, although it had set, still gave light enough by
refraction.

August 19th, after taking a satisfactory observation, Cape Franklin
was seen on the eastern side, and opposite it Cape Lady Franklin; at
what was probably the farthest point reached by this bold explorer,
his fellow-countrymen wanted the name of his devoted wife should be
remembered along with his own, as an emblem of the sympathy which
always united them. The doctor was much moved by this sight in this
distant country.

In accordance with Johnson's advice, he began to accustom himself to
enduring low temperature; he kept almost all the time on deck, braving
the cold, wind, and snow. Although he had grown a little thinner, he
did not suffer from the severity of the climate. Besides, he expected
other dangers, and he rejoiced, almost, as he saw the winter
approaching.

"See," said he one day to Johnson,--"see those flocks of birds flying
south! How they fly and cry adieu!"

"Yes, Dr. Clawbonny," answered Johnson, "something has told them it
was time to go, and they are off."

[Illustration]

"More than one of our men, Johnson, would be glad to imitate them, I
fancy."

"They are timid fellows, Doctor; what a bird can't do, a man ought to
try! Those birds have no supply of food, as we have, and they must
support themselves elsewhere. But sailors, with a good deck under the
feet, ought to go to the end of the world."

"You hope, then, that Hatteras will succeed in his projects?"

"He will succeed, Doctor."

"I agree with you, Johnson, even if only one faithful man accompanies
him--"

"There will be two of us!"

"Yes, Johnson," the doctor answered, pressing the brave sailor's hand.

Prince Albert's Land, along which the _Forward_ was now coasting, is
also called Grinnell's Land; and although Hatteras, from his dislike
to Americans, never was willing to give it this name, nevertheless, it
is the one by which it is generally known. This is the reason of this
double title: at the same time that the Englishman Penny gave it the
name of Prince Albert, the captain of the _Rescue_, Lieutenant
DeHaven, named it Grinnell's Land, in honor of the American merchant
who had fitted out the expedition in New York.

As the brig followed the coast it met with serious difficulties, going
sometimes under sail, sometimes under steam. August 18th, Mount
Britannia was sighted through the mist, and the next day the _Forward_
cast anchor in Northumberland Bay. The ship was completely protected.




CHAPTER XXIII.
ATTACKED BY THE ICE.


Hatteras, after seeing to the anchorage of the ship, returned to his
cabin, took out his chart, and marked his position on it very
carefully; he found himself in latitude 76° 57', and longitude 99°
20', that is to say, only three minutes from latitude 77°. It was here
that Sir Edward Belcher passed his first winter with the _Pioneer_ and
_Assistance_. It was from here that he organized his sledge and canoe
expeditions; he discovered Table Island, North Cornwall, Victoria
Archipelago, and Belcher Channel. Having gone beyond latitude 78°, he
saw the coast inclining towards the southeast. It seemed as if it
ought to connect with Jones's Strait, which opens into Baffin's Bay.
But, says the report, an open sea, in the northwest, "stretched as far
as the eye could reach."

Hatteras gazed with emotion at that portion of the charts where a
large white space marked unknown regions, and his eyes always returned
to the open polar sea.

"After so many statements," he said to himself,--"after the accounts
of Stewart, Penny, and Belcher, doubt is impossible! These bold
sailors saw, and with their own eyes! Can I doubt their word? No! But
yet if this sea is closed by an early winter-- But no, these
discoveries have been made at intervals of several years; this sea
exists, and I shall find it! I shall see it!"

[Illustration]

Hatteras went upon the quarter-deck. A dense mist enveloped the
_Forward_; from the deck one could hardly see the top of the mast.
Nevertheless, Hatteras ordered the ice-master below, and took his
place; he wanted to make use of the first break in the fog to look at
the horizon in the northwest.

Shandon took occasion to say to the second mate,--

"Well, Wall, and the open sea?"

"You were right, Shandon," answered Wall, "and we have only six weeks'
coal in the bunkers."

"The doctor will invent some scientific way," continued Shandon, "of
heating us without fuel. I've heard of making ice with fire; perhaps
he will make fire with ice."

Shandon returned to his cabin, shrugging his shoulders.

The next day, August 20th, the fog lifted for a few minutes. From the
deck they saw Hatteras in his lofty perch gazing intently towards the
horizon; then he came down without saying a word and ordered them to
set sail; but it was easy to see that his hopes had been once more
deceived.

The _Forward_ heaved anchor and resumed her uncertain path northward.
So wearisome was it that the main-topsail and fore-topsail yards were
lowered with all their rigging; the masts were also lowered, and it
was no longer possible to place any reliance on the varying wind,
which, moreover, the winding nature of the passes made almost useless;
large white masses were gathering here and there in the sea, like
spots of oil; they indicated an approaching thaw; as soon as the wind
began to slacken, the sea began to freeze again, but when the wind
arose this young ice would break and disperse. Towards evening the
thermometer fell to 17°.

When the brig arrived at the end of a closed pass, it rushed on at
full steam against the opposing obstacle. Sometimes they thought her
fairly stopped; but some unexpected motion of the ice-streams would
open a new passage into which she would plunge boldly; during these
stoppages the steam would escape from the safety-valves and fall on
the deck in the form of snow. There was another obstacle to the
progress of the brig; the ice would get caught in the screw, and it
was so hard that the engine could not break it; it was then necessary
to reverse the engines, turn the brig back, and send some men to free
the snow with axes and levers; hence arose many difficulties,
fatigues, and delays.

It went on in this way for thirteen days; the _Forward_ advanced
slowly through Penny Strait. The crew murmured, but obeyed; they knew
that retreat was now impossible. The advance towards the north was
less perilous than a return to the south; it was time to think of
going into winter-quarters.

The sailors talked together about their condition, and one day they
even began to talk with Shandon, who, they knew, was on their side. He
so far forgot his duty as an officer as to allow them to discuss in
his presence the authority of his captain.

"So you say, Mr. Shandon," asked Gripper, "that we can't go back now?"

"No, it's too late," answered Shandon.

"Then," said another sailor, "we need only look forward to going into
winter-quarters?"

"It's our only resource! No one would believe me--"

"The next time," said Pen, who had returned to duty, "they will
believe you."

"Since I sha'n't be in command--" answered Shandon.

"Who can tell?" remarked Pen. "John Hatteras is free to go as far as
he chooses, but no one is obliged to follow him."

"Just remember," resumed Gripper, "his first voyage to Baffin's Bay
and what came of it!"

"And the voyage of the _Farewell_," said Clifton, "which was lost in
the Spitzenberg seas under his command."

"And from which he came back alone," added Gripper.

"Alone, but with his dog," said Clifton.

"We don't care to sacrifice ourselves for the whims of that man,"
continued Pen.

"Nor to lose all the wages we've earned so hard."

They all recognized Clifton by those words.

"When we pass latitude 78°," he added, "and we are not far from it,
that will make just three hundred and seventy-five pounds for each
man, six times eight degrees."

"But," asked Gripper, "sha'n't we lose them if we go back without the
captain?"

"No," answered Clifton, "if we can prove that it was absolutely
necessary to return."

"But the captain--still--"

"Don't be uneasy, Gripper," answered Pen; "we shall have a captain,
and a good one, whom Mr. Shandon knows. When a captain goes mad, he is
dismissed and another appointed. Isn't that so, Mr. Shandon?"

"My friends," answered Shandon, evasively, "you will always find me
devoted to you. But let us wait and see what turns up."

The storm, as may be seen, was gathering over Hatteras's head; but he
pushed on boldly, firm, energetic, and confident. In fact, if he had
not always managed the brig as he wanted to, and carried her where he
was anxious to go, he had still been very successful; the distance
passed over in five months was as great as what it had taken other
explorers two or three years to make. Hatteras was now obliged to go
into winter-quarters, but this would not alarm men of courage,
experience, and confidence. Had not Sir John Ross and MacClure spent
three successive winters in the arctic regions? Could not he do what
they had done?

"Yes, of course," Hatteras used to say, "and more too, if need be.
Ah!" he said regretfully to the doctor, "why was I unable to get
through Smith's Sound, at the north of Baffin's Bay? I should be at
the Pole now!"

"Well," the doctor used invariably to answer,--if necessary he could
have invented confidence,--"we shall get there, Captain, but, it is
true, at the ninety-ninth meridian instead of the seventy-fifth; but
what difference does that make? If every road leads to Rome, it is
even surer that every meridian leads to the Pole."

August 31st, the thermometer fell to 13°. The end of the summer was
evidently near; the _Forward_ left Exmouth Island to starboard, and
three days afterward she passed Table Island, lying in the middle of
Belcher Channel. Earlier in the season it would have been possible to
reach Baffin's Bay through this channel, but at this time it was
impossible to think of it. This arm of the sea was completely filled
with ice, and would not have offered a drop of open water to the prow
of the _Forward_; for the next eight months their eyes would see
nothing but boundless, motionless ice-fields.

Fortunately, they could still get a few minutes farther north, but
only by breaking the new ice with huge beams, or by blowing it up with
charges of powder. They especially had cause to fear calm weather
while the temperature was so low, for the passes closed quickly, and
they rejoiced even at contrary winds. A calm night, and everything was
frozen!

Now the _Forward_ could not winter where she was, exposed to the wind,
icebergs, and the drift of the channel; a safe protection was the
first thing to be found; Hatteras hoped to gain the coast of New
Cornwall, and to find, beyond Point Albert, a bay sufficiently
sheltered. Hence he persisted in crowding northward.

But, September 8, an impenetrable, continuous mass of ice lay between
him and the north; the temperature fell to 10°. Hatteras, with an
anxious heart, in vain sought for a passage, risking his ship a
hundred times and escaping from his perils with wonderful skill. He
might have been accused of imprudence, recklessness, folly, blindness,
but he was one of the best of sailors.

The situation of the _Forward_ became really dangerous; in fact, the
sea was closing behind her, and in a few hours the ice grew so hard
that men could run upon it and tow the brig in perfect safety.

Hatteras, not being able to get around this obstacle, determined to
attack it boldly in front. He made use of his strongest blasting
cylinders, containing eight or ten pounds of powder. The men would dig
a hole in the broadest part of the ice, close the orifice with snow,
after having placed the cylinder in a horizontal position, so that a
greater extent of ice might be exposed to the explosion; then a fuse
was lighted, which was protected by a gutta-percha tube.

In this way they tried to break the ice; it was impossible to saw it,
for the fissures would close immediately. Still, Hatteras was hoping
to get through the next day.

But during the night the wind blew a gale; the sea raised the crust of
ice, and the terrified pilot was heard shouting,--

"Look out there aft, look out there aft!"

Hatteras turned his eyes in that direction, and what he saw in the dim
light was indeed alarming.

A great mass of ice, drifting northward with the tide, was rushing
towards the brig with the speed of an avalanche.

"All hands on deck!" shouted the captain.

This floating mountain was hardly half a mile away; the ice was all in
confusion and crashing together like huge grains of sand before a
violent tempest; the air was filled with a terrible noise.

"That, Doctor," said Johnson, "is one of the greatest perils we have
yet met with."

"Yes," answered the doctor, quietly; "it is terrible enough."

"A real attack which we must repel," resumed the boatswain.

"In fact, one might well think it was an immense crowd of antediluvian
animals, such as might have lived near the Pole. How they hurry on, as
if they were racing!"

"Besides," added Johnson, "some carry sharp lances, of which you had
better take care, Doctor."

"It's a real siege," shouted the doctor. "Well, let us run to the
ramparts!"

He ran aft where the crew, provided with beams and bars, were standing
ready to repel this formidable assault.

The avalanche came on, growing larger at every moment as it caught up
the floating ice in its eddy; by Hatteras's orders the cannon was
loaded with ball to break the threatening line. But it came on and ran
towards the brig; a crash was heard, and as it came against the
starboard-quarter, part of the rail had given way.

[Illustration: "A crash was heard, and as it came against the
starboard-quarter, part of the rail had given way."]

"Let no one stir!" shouted Hatteras. "Look out for the ice!"

They swarmed on board the ship with an irresistible force; lumps of
ice, weighing many hundredweight, scaled the sides of the ship; the
smallest, hurled as high as the yards, fell back in sharp arrows,
breaking the shrouds and cutting the rigging. The men were overcome by
numberless enemies, who were heavy enough to crush a hundred ships
like the _Forward_. Every one tried to drive away these lumps, and
more than one sailor was wounded by their sharp ends; among others,
Bolton, who had his left shoulder badly torn. The noise increased
immensely. Duke barked angrily at these new enemies. The darkness of
the night added to the horrors of the situation, without hiding the
ice which glowed in the last light of the evening.

Hatteras's orders sounded above all this strange, impossible,
supernatural conflict of the men with the ice. The ship, yielding to
this enormous pressure, inclined to larboard, and the end of the
main-yard was already touching the ice, at the risk of breaking the
mast.

Hatteras saw the danger; it was a terrible moment; the brig seemed
about to be overturned, and the masts might be easily carried away.

A large block, as large as the ship, appeared to be passing along the
keel; it arose with irresistible power; it came on past the
quarter-deck; if it fell on the _Forward_, all was over; soon it rose
even above the topmasts, and began to totter.

A cry of terror escaped from every one's lips. Every one ran back to
starboard.

But at that moment the ship was relieved. They felt her lifted up, and
for an instant she hung in the air, then she leaned over and fell back
on the ice, and then she rolled so heavily that her planks cracked.
What had happened?

Raised by this rising tide, driven by the ice which attacked her aft,
she was getting across this impenetrable ice. After a minute of this
strange sailing, which seemed as long as a century, she fell back on
the other side of the obstacle on a field of ice; she broke it with
her weight, and fell back into her natural element.

"We have got by the thick ice!" shouted Johnson, who had run forward.

"Thank God!" said Hatteras.

[Illustration]

In fact, the brig lay in the centre of a basin of ice, which entirely
surrounded her, and although her keel lay under water she could not
stir; but if she were motionless, the field was drifting along.

"We are drifting, Captain!" shouted Johnson.

"All right," answered Hatteras.

Indeed, how was it possible to resist it?

Day broke, and it was evident that under the influence of a submarine
current the bank of ice was floating northward with great rapidity.
This floating mass carried the _Forward_ with it, in the midst of the
ice-field, the edge of which could not be seen; to provide for any
accident that might happen, Hatteras had a large supply of provisions
carried on deck, as well as materials for camping, clothing, and
cover; as MacClure had done under similar circumstances, he surrounded
the ship with hammocks filled with air to protect her from damage.
Soon it was so cold (7°), that the ship was surrounded by a wall from
which only the masts issued.

For seven days they sailed in this way; Point Albert, which forms the
western extremity of New Cornwall, was seen September 10th, and soon
disappeared; the ice-field was seen to be drifting eastward from that
time. Where was it going? Where would it stop? Who could say?

The crew waited with folded arms. At last, September 15th, towards
three o'clock in the afternoon, the ice-field, having probably run
against another one, stopped suddenly; the ship was jarred violently;
Hatteras, who had kept his reckoning all along, looked at his chart;
he found himself in the north, with no land in sight, in longitude 95°
35', and latitude 78° 15', in the centre of the region of the unknown
sea, which geographers have considered the place of greatest cold.




CHAPTER XXIV.
PREPARATIONS FOR WINTERING.


The same latitude is colder in the southern than in the northern
hemisphere; but the temperature of the New World is fifteen degrees
beneath that of the other parts of the world; and in America these
countries, known under the name of the region of greatest cold, are
the most inclement.

The mean temperature for the whole year is two degrees below zero.
Physicists have explained this fact in the following way, and Dr.
Clawbonny shared their opinion.

According to them, the most constant winds in the northern regions of
America are from the southwest; they come from the Pacific Ocean, with
an equal and agreeable temperature; but before they reach the arctic
seas they are obliged to cross the great American continent, which is
covered with snow; the contact chills them, and communicates to these
regions their intense cold.

Hatteras found himself at the pole of cold, beyond the countries seen
by his predecessors; he consequently expected a terrible winter, on a
ship lost amid the ice, with a turbulent crew. He resolved to meet
these dangers with his usual energy. He faced what awaited him without
flinching.

He began, with Johnson's aid and experience, to take all the measures
necessary for going into winter-quarters. According to his calculation
the _Forward_ had been carried two hundred and fifty miles from any
known land, that is to say, from North Cornwall; she was firmly fixed
in a field of ice, as in a bed of granite, and no human power could
extricate her.

[Illustration]

There was not a drop of open water in these vast seas chained by the
fierce arctic winter. The ice-fields stretched away out of sight, but
without presenting a smooth surface. Far from it. Numerous icebergs
stood up in the icy plain, and the _Forward_ was sheltered by the
highest of them on three points of the compass; the southeast wind
alone reached them. Let one imagine rock instead of ice, verdure
instead of snow, and the sea again liquid, and the brig would have
quietly cast anchor in a pretty bay, sheltered from the fiercest
blasts. But what desolation here! What a gloomy prospect! What a
melancholy view!

The brig, although motionless, nevertheless had to be fastened
securely by means of anchors; this was a necessary precaution against
possible thaws and submarine upheavals. Johnson, on hearing that the
_Forward_ was at the pole of cold, took even greater precautions for
securing warmth.

"We shall have it severe enough," he had said to the doctor; "that's
just the captain's luck, to go and get caught at the most disagreeable
spot on the globe! Bah! you will see that we shall get out of it."

As to the doctor, at the bottom of his heart he was simply delighted.
He would not have changed it for any other. Winter at the pole of
cold! What good luck!

At first, work on the outside occupied the crew; the sails were kept
furled on the yards instead of being placed at the bottom of the hold,
as the earlier explorers did; they were merely bound up in a case, and
soon the frost covered them with a dense envelope; the topmasts were
not unshipped, and the crow's-nest remained in its place. It was a
natural observatory; the running-rigging alone was taken down.

It became necessary to cut away the ice from the ship to relieve the
pressure. That which had accumulated outside was quite heavy, and the
ship did not lie as deep as usual. This was a long and laborious task.
At the end of some days the ship's bottom was freed, and could be
inspected; it had not suffered, thanks to its solidity; only its
copper sheathing was nearly torn away. The ship, having grown lighter,
drew about nine inches less than she did earlier; the ice was cut away
in a slope, following the make of the hull; in this way the ice formed
beneath the brig's keel and so resisted all pressure.

The doctor took part in this work; he managed the ice-cutter well; he
encouraged the sailors by his good-humor. He instructed them and
himself. He approved of this arrangement of the ice beneath the ship.

"That is a good precaution," he said.

"Without that, Dr. Clawbonny," answered Johnson, "resistance would be
impossible. Now we can boldly raise a wall of snow as high as the
gunwale; and, if we want to, we can make it ten feet thick, for there
is no lack of material."

"A capital idea," resumed the doctor; "the snow is a bad conductor of
heat; it reflects instead of absorbing, and the inside temperature
cannot escape."

"True," answered Johnson; "we are building a fortification against the
cold, and also against the animals, if they care to visit us; when
that is finished, it will look well, you may be sure; in this snow we
shall cut two staircases, one fore, the other aft; when the steps are
cut in the snow, we shall pour water on them; this will freeze as hard
as stone, and we shall have a royal staircase."

"Precisely," answered the doctor; "and it must be said it is fortunate
that cold produces both snow and ice, by which to protect one's self
against it. Without that, one would be very much embarrassed."

In fact, the ship was destined to disappear beneath a thick casing of
ice, which was needed to preserve its inside temperature; a roof made
of thick tarred canvas and covered with snow was built above the deck
over its whole length; the canvas was low enough to cover the sides of
the ship. The deck, being protected from all outside impressions,
became their walk; it was covered with two and a half feet of snow;
this snow was crowded and beaten down so as to become very hard; so it
resisted the radiation of the internal heat; above it was placed a
layer of sand, which as it solidified became a sort of macadamized
cover of great hardness.

"A little more," said the doctor, "and with a few trees I might
imagine myself at Hyde Park, or even in the hanging-gardens at
Babylon."

A trench was dug tolerably near the brig; this was a circular space in
the ice, a real pit, which had to be kept always open. Every morning
the ice formed overnight was broken; this was to secure water in case
of fire or for the baths which were ordered the crew by the doctor; in
order to spare the fuel, the water was drawn from some distance below
the ice, where it was less cold. This was done by means of an
instrument devised by a French physicist (François Arago); this
apparatus, lowered for some distance into the water, brought it up to
the surface through a cylinder.

[Illustration]

Generally in winter everything which encumbers the ship is removed,
and stored on land. But what was practicable near land is impossible
for a ship anchored on the ice.

Every preparation was made to fight the two great enemies of this
latitude, cold and dampness; the first produces the second, which is
far more dangerous. The cold may be resisted by one who succumbs to
dampness; hence it was necessary to guard against it.

The _Forward_, being destined to a journey in arctic seas, contained
the best arrangements for winter-quarters: the large room for the crew
was well provided for; the corners, where dampness first forms, were
shut off; in fact, when the temperature is very low, a film of ice
forms on the walls, especially in the corners, and when it melts it
keeps up a perpetual dampness. If it had been round, the room would
have been more convenient; but, being heated by a large stove, and
properly ventilated, it was very comfortable; the walls were lined
with deerskins, not with wool, for wool absorbs the condensed moisture
and keeps the air full of dampness.

Farther aft the walls of the quarter were taken down, and the officers
had a larger common-room, better ventilated, and heated by a stove.
This room, like that of the crew, had a sort of antechamber, which cut
off all communication with the outside. In this way, the heat could
not be lost, and one passed gradually from one temperature to the
other. In the anterooms were left the snow-covered clothes; the shoes
were cleansed on the scrapers, so as to prevent the introduction of
any unwholesomeness with one into the room.

Canvas hose served to introduce air for the draught of the stoves;
other pieces of hose permitted the steam to escape. In addition two
condensers were placed in the two rooms, and collected this vapor
instead of letting it form into water; twice a week they were emptied,
and often they contained several bushels of ice. It was so much taken
from the enemy.

The fire was perfectly and easily controlled, by means of the canvas
hose; by use of merely a small quantity of coal it was easy to keep
the temperature of 50°. Still, Hatteras, having examined the bunkers,
soon saw that the greatest economy was necessary, for there was not
two months' fuel on board.

A drying-room was set apart for the clothes which were to be washed;
they could not be dried in the open air, for they would freeze and
tear.

The delicate pieces of the machinery were carefully taken down, and
the room which contained them was hermetically closed.

The life on board became the object of serious meditation; Hatteras
regulated it with the utmost caution, and the order of the day was
posted up in the common-room. The men arose at six o'clock in the
morning; three times a week the hammocks were aired; every morning the
floors were scoured with hot sand; tea was served at every meal, and
the bill of fare varied as much as possible for every day of the week;
it consisted of bread, farina, suet and raisins for puddings, sugar,
cocoa, tea, rice, lemon-juice, potted meats, salt beef and pork,
cabbages, and vegetables in vinegar; the kitchen lay outside of the
living-rooms; its heat was consequently lost; but cooking is a
perpetual source of evaporation and dampness.

The health of the men depends a great deal on the sort of food they
get; in high latitudes, the greatest amount of animal food ought to be
eaten. The doctor had supervised the sort of food to be given.

"We ought to follow the Esquimaux," he used to say; "they have
received their lessons from nature, and are our masters in that; if
the Arabs and Africans can content themselves with a few dates and a
handful of rice, here it is important to eat, and to eat a good deal.
The Esquimaux take from ten to fifteen pounds of oil a day. If that
fare does not please you, we must try food rich in sugar and fat. In a
word, we need carbon, so let us manufacture carbon! It is well to put
coal in the stove, but don't let us forget to fill that precious stove
we carry about with us."

With this bill of fare, strict cleanliness was enforced; every other
day each man was obliged to bathe in the half-frozen water which the
iron pump brought up, and this was an excellent way of preserving
their health. The doctor set the example; he did it at first as a
thing which ought to be very disagreeable; but this pretext was
quickly forgotten, for he soon took real pleasure in this healthy
bath.

When work or hunting or distant expeditions took the men off in the
severe cold, they had to take special care not to be frost-bitten; if
they were, rubbing with snow would restore the circulation. Moreover,
the men, who all wore woollen clothes, put on coats of deerskin and
trousers of sealskin, which perfectly resist the wind.

The different arrangements of the ship, the getting-to-rights on
board, took about three weeks, and they reached October 10th without
any special incident.




CHAPTER XXV.
ONE OF JAMES ROSS'S FOXES.


On that day the thermometer fell to three degrees below zero. The day
was calm; the cold was very endurable in the absence of wind. Hatteras
took advantage of the clearness of the air to reconnoitre the
surrounding plains; he ascended one of the highest icebergs to the
north, but even with his glass he could make out nothing but a series
of ice-mountains and ice-fields. There was no land in sight, nothing
but gloomy confusion. He returned, and tried to calculate the probable
length of their imprisonment.

The hunters, and among them the doctor, James Wall, Simpson, Johnson,
and Bell, kept them supplied with fresh meat. The birds had
disappeared, seeking a milder climate in the south. The ptarmigans
alone, a sort of rock-partridge peculiar to this latitude, did not
flee the winter; it was easy to kill them, and there were enough to
promise a perpetual supply of game.

[Illustration]

Hares, foxes, wolves, ermines, and bears were plentiful; a French,
English, or Norwegian hunter would have had no right to complain; but
they were so shy that it was hard to approach them; besides, it was
hard to distinguish them on the white plain, they being white
themselves, for in winter they acquire that colored fur. In opposition
to the opinions of some naturalists, the doctor held that this change
was not due to the lowering of the temperature, since it took place
before October; hence it was not due to any physical cause, but rather
providential foresight, to secure these animals against the severity
of an arctic winter.

Often, too, they saw sea-cows and sea-dogs, animals included under the
name of seals; all the hunters were specially recommended to shoot
them, as much for their skins as for their fat, which was very good
fuel. Besides, their liver made a very good article of food; they
could be counted by hundreds, and two or three miles north of the ship
the ice was continually perforated by these huge animals; only they
avoided the hunter with remarkable instinct, and many were wounded who
easily escaped by diving under the ice.

[Illustration]

Still, on the 19th, Simpson succeeded in getting one four hundred
yards distant from the ship; he had taken the precaution to close its
hole in the ice, so that it could not escape from its pursuers. He
fought for a long time, and died only after receiving many bullets. He
was nine feet long; his bull-dog head, the sixteen teeth in his jaw,
his large pectoral fins shaped like little wings, his little tail with
another pair of fins, made him an excellent specimen. The doctor
wished to preserve his head for his collection of natural history, and
his skin for future contingences, hence he prepared both by a rapid
and economical process. He plunged the body in the hole, and thousands
of little prawns removed the flesh in small pieces; at the end of half
a day the work was half finished, and the most skilful of the
honorable corporation of tanners at Liverpool could not have done
better.

When the sun had passed the autumn equinox, that is to say, September
23d, the winter fairly begins in the arctic regions. The sun, having
gradually sunk to the horizon, disappeared at last, October 23d,
lighting up merely the tops of the mountains with its oblique rays.
The doctor gave it his last farewell. He could not see it again till
the month of February.

Still the darkness was not complete during this long absence of the
sun; the moon did its best to replace it; the stars were exceedingly
brilliant, the auroras were very frequent, and the refractions
peculiar to the snowy horizons; besides, the sun at the time of its
greatest southern declension, December 21st, approaches within
thirteen degrees of the polar horizon; hence, every day there was a
certain twilight for a few hours. Only the mist and snow-storms often
plunged these regions in the deepest obscurity.

Still, up to this time the weather was very favorable; the partridges
and hares alone had reason to complain, for the hunters gave them no
rest; a great many traps were set for foxes, but these crafty animals
could not be caught; very often they scraped the snow away beneath the
trap and took the bait without running any risk; the doctor cursed
them, being very averse to making them such a present.

[Illustration]

October 25th, the thermometer fell as low as -4°. A violent hurricane
raged; the air was filled with thick snow, which permitted no ray of
light to reach the _Forward_. For several hours there was some anxiety
about the fate of Bell and Simpson, who had gone some distance away
hunting; they did not reach the ship till the next day, having rested
for a whole day wrapped up in their furs, while the hurricane swept
over them and buried them under five feet of snow. They were nearly
frozen, and the doctor found it very hard to restore their
circulation.

The tempest lasted eight days without interruption. No one could set
foot outside. In a single day there were variations in the temperature
of fifteen or twenty degrees.

During this enforced leisure every one kept to himself, some sleeping,
others smoking, others again talking in a low tone and stopping at the
approach of Johnson or the doctor; there was no moral tie between the
men of the crew; they only met at evening prayers and at Sunday
services.

Clifton knew perfectly well that when the seventy-eighth parallel was
passed, his share of the pay would amount to three hundred and
seventy-five pounds; he thought it a good round sum, and his ambition
did not go any further. His opinion was generally shared, and all
looked forward to the day when they should enjoy this hardly-earned
fortune.

Hatteras kept almost entirely out of sight. He never took part in the
hunts or the walks from the ship. He took no interest in the
meteorological phenomena which kept the doctor in a constant state of
admiration. He lived with but a single idea; it consisted of three
words,--The North Pole. He only thought of when the _Forward_, free at
last, should resume her bold course.

In fact, the general feeling on board was one of gloom. Nothing was so
sad as the sight of this captive vessel, no longer resting in its
natural element, but with its shape hidden beneath thick layers of
ice; it looks like nothing; it cannot stir, though made for motion; it
is turned into a wooden storehouse, a sedentary dwelling, this ship
which knows how to breast the wind and the storms. This anomaly, this
false situation, filled their hearts with an indefinable feeling of
disquiet and regret.

During these idle hours the doctor arranged the notes he had taken,
from which this book is made up; he was never out of spirits, and
never lost his cheerfulness. Yet he was glad to see the end of the
storm, and prepared to resume his hunting.

November 3d, at six o'clock in the morning, with a temperature of -5°,
he set off in company with Johnson and Bell; the expanse of ice was
unbroken; all the snow which had fallen so abundantly during the
preceding days was hardened by the frost, and made good walking; the
air was keen and piercing; the moon shone with incomparable purity,
glistening on the least roughness in the ice; their footprints glowed
like an illuminated trail, and their long shadows stood out almost
black against the brilliant ice.

[Illustration: "The moon shone with incomparable purity, glistening on
the least roughness in the ice."]

The doctor had taken Duke with him; he preferred him to the Greenland
dogs to hunt game, and he was right; for they are of very little use
under such circumstances, and they did not appear to possess the
sacred fire of the race of the temperate zone. Duke ran along with his
nose on the ground, and he often stopped on the recent marks of bears.
Still, in spite of his skill, the hunters did not find even a hare in
two hours' walking.

"Has all the game felt it necessary to go south?" said the doctor,
stopping at the foot of a hummock.

"I should fancy it must be so, Doctor," answered the carpenter.

"I don't think so," said Johnson; "the hares, foxes, and bears are
accustomed to this climate; I think this last storm must have driven
them away; but they will come back with the south-winds. Ah, if you
were to talk about reindeer and musk-deer, that might be different!"

"And yet at Melville Island numberless animals of this sort are
found," resumed the doctor; "it lies farther south, it is true, and
during the winters he spent there Parry always had plenty of this
magnificent game."

"We have much poorer luck," answered Bell; "if we could only get
enough bear's meat, we would do very well."

"The difficulty is," said the doctor, "the bears seem to me very rare
and very wild; they are not civilized enough to come within gun-shot."

"Bell is talking about the flesh of the bear," said Johnson, "but his
grease is more useful than his flesh or his fur."

"You are right, Johnson," answered Bell; "you are always thinking of
the fuel."

"How can I help it? Even with the strictest economy, we have only
enough for three weeks!"

"Yes," resumed the doctor, "that is the real danger, for we are now
only at the beginning of November, and February is the coldest month
in the frigid zone; still, if we can't get bear's grease, there's no
lack of seal's grease."

"But not for a very long time, Doctor," answered Johnson; "they will
soon leave us; whether from cold or fright, soon they won't come upon
the ice any more."

"Then," continued the doctor, "we shall have to fall back on the bear,
and I confess the bear is the most useful animal to be found in these
countries, for he furnishes food, clothing, light, and fuel to men. Do
you hear, Duke?" he said, patting the dog's head, "we want some bears,
my friend, bears! bears!"

Duke, who was sniffing at the ice at that time, aroused by the voices,
and caresses of the doctor, started off suddenly with the speed of an
arrow. He barked violently and, far off as he was, his loud barks
reached the hunters' ears.

The extreme distance to which sound is carried when the temperature is
low is an astonishing fact; it is only equalled by the brilliancy of
the constellations in the northern skies; the waves of light and sound
are transmitted to great distances, especially in the dry cold of the
nights.

The hunters, guided by his distant barking, hastened after him; they
had to run a mile, and they got there all out of breath, which happens
very soon in such an atmosphere. Duke stood pointing about fifty feet
from an enormous mass which was rolling about on the top of a small
iceberg.

"Just what we wanted!" shouted the doctor, cocking his gun.

"A fine bear!" said Bell, following the doctor's example.

"A curious bear!" said Johnson, who intended to fire after his
companions.

Duke barked furiously. Bell advanced about twenty feet, and fired; but
the animal seemed untouched, for he continued rolling his head slowly.

Johnson came forward, and, after taking careful aim, he pulled the
trigger.

"Good!" said the doctor; "nothing yet! Ah, this cursed refraction! We
are too far off; we shall never get used to it! That bear is more than
a mile away."

"Come on!" answered Bell.

The three companions hastened toward the animal, which had not been
alarmed by the firing; he seemed to be very large, but, without
weighing the danger, they gave themselves up already to the joy of
victory. Having got within a reasonable distance, they fired; the bear
leaped into the air and fell, mortally wounded, on the level ice
below.

[Illustration]

Duke rushed towards him.

"That's a bear," said the doctor, "which was easily conquered."

"Only three shots," said Bell with some scorn, "and he's down!"

"That's odd," remarked Johnson.

"Unless we got here just as he was going to die of old age," continued
the doctor, laughing.

"Well, young or old," added Bell, "he's a good capture."

Talking in this way they reached the small iceberg, and, to their
great surprise, they found Duke growling over the body of a white fox.

[Illustration]

"Upon my word," said Bell, "that's too much!"

"Well," said the doctor, "we've fired at a bear, and killed a fox!"

Johnson did not know what to say.

"Well," said the doctor with a burst of laughter in which there was a
trace of disappointment, "that refraction again! It's always deceiving
us."

"What do you mean, Doctor?" asked the carpenter.

"Yes, my friend; it deceived us with respect to its size as well as
the distance! It made us see a bear in a fox's skin! Such a mistake is
not uncommon under similar circumstances! Well, our imagination alone
was wrong!"

"At any rate," answered Johnson, "bear or fox, he's good eating. Let's
carry him off."

But as the boatswain was lifting him to his shoulders:--

"That's odd," he said.

"What is it?" asked the doctor.

"See there, Doctor, he's got a collar around his neck."

"A collar?" asked the doctor again, examining the fox.

In fact, a half-worn-out copper collar appeared under his white fur;
the doctor thought he saw letters engraved upon it; he unfastened it
from the animal's neck, about which it seemed to have been for a long
time.

"What does that mean?" asked Johnson.

"That means," said the doctor, "that we have just killed a fox more
than twelve years old,--a fox who was caught by James Ross in 1848."

"Is it possible?" said Bell.

"There's no doubt about it. I'm sorry we killed him! While he was in
winter-quarters, James Ross thought of trapping a large number of
white foxes; he fastened on their necks copper collars on which was
engraved the position of his ships, the _Enterprise_ and
_Investigator_, as well as where the supplies were left. These animals
run over immense distances in search of food, and James Ross hoped
that one of them might fall into the hands of one of the men of the
Franklin expedition. That's the simple explanation; and this poor
beast, who might have saved the life of two crews, has fallen
uselessly beneath our guns."

"Well, we won't eat it," said Johnson, "especially if it's twelve
years old. But we shall keep the skin as a memento."

Johnson raised it to his shoulders. The hunters made their way to the
ship, guiding themselves by the stars; their expedition was not wholly
without result; they were able to bring back several ptarmigans.

An hour before reaching the _Forward_, there was a singular phenomenon
which greatly interested the doctor. It was a real shower of
shooting-stars; they could be counted by thousands, flying over the
heavens like rockets; they dimmed the light of the moon. For hours
they could have stood gazing at this beautiful sight. A similar
phenomenon was observed in Greenland in 1799, by the Moravians. It
looked like an exhibition of fireworks. The doctor after his return to
the ship spent the whole night gazing at the sight, which lasted till
seven o'clock in the morning, while the air was perfectly silent.

[Illustration]




CHAPTER XXVI.
THE LAST PIECE OF COAL.


The bears, it seemed, could not be caught; a few seals were killed on
the 4th, 5th, and 6th of November, and the wind shifted and the
weather grew much milder; but the snow-drifts began again with
incomparable severity. It became impossible to leave the ship, and it
was hard to subdue the dampness. At the end of the week the condensers
contained several bushels of ice.

The weather changed again November 15th, and the thermometer, under
the influence of certain atmospheric conditions, sank to -24°. That
was the lowest temperature they had yet observed. This cold would have
been endurable in calm weather; but the wind was blowing at that time,
and it seemed as if the air was filled with sharp needles.

The doctor regretted his captivity, for the snow was hardened by the
wind, so as to make good walking, and he might have gone very far from
the ship.

Still, it should be said that the slightest exercise in so low a
temperature is very exhausting. A man can perform hardly more than a
quarter of his usual work; iron utensils cannot be touched; if the
hand seizes them, it feels as if it were burned, and shreds of skin
cleave to the object which had been incautiously seized.

The crew, being confined to the ship, were obliged to walk on the
covered deck for two hours a day, where they had leave to smoke, which
was forbidden in the common-room.

There, when the fire got low, the ice used to cover the walls and the
intervals between the planks; every nail and bolt and piece of metal
was immediately covered with a film of ice.

The celerity of its formation astonished the doctor. The breath of the
men condensed in the air, and, changing from a fluid to a solid form,
it fell about them in the form of snow. A few feet from the stove it
was very cold, and the men stood grouped around the fire.

Still, the doctor advised them to harden themselves, and to accustom
themselves to the cold, which was not so severe as what yet awaited
them; he advised them to expose their skin gradually to this intense
temperature, and he himself set the example; but idleness or numbness
nailed most of them to their place; they refused to stir, and
preferred sleeping in that unhealthy heat.

Yet, according to the doctor, there was no danger in exposing one's
self to great cold after leaving a heated room; these sudden changes
only inconvenience those who are in a perspiration; the doctor quoted
examples in support of his opinion, but his lessons were for the most
part thrown away.

As for John Hatteras, he did not seem to mind the inclement cold. He
walked to and fro silently, never faster or slower. Did not the cold
affect his powerful frame? Did he possess to a very great degree the
principle of natural heat which he wanted his men to possess? Was he
so bound up in his meditations that he was indifferent to outside
impressions? His men saw him with great astonishment braving a
temperature of -24°; he would leave the ship for hours, and come back
without appearing to suffer from the cold.

"He's a singular man," said the doctor to Johnson; "he astonishes me!
He carries a glowing furnace within him! He is one of the strongest
natures I ever saw!"

"The fact is," answered Johnson, "he goes and comes and circulates in
the open air, without dressing any more thickly than in the month of
June."

"O, it doesn't make much difference what one wears!" answered the
doctor; "what is the use of dressing warmly if one can't produce heat
within himself? It's like trying to heat ice by wrapping it up in
wool! But Hatteras doesn't need it; he's built that way, and I should
not be surprised if his side was as warm as the neighborhood of a
glowing coal."

Johnson, who was charged with clearing away the water-hole every
morning, noticed that the ice was ten feet thick.

Almost every night the doctor could observe the magnificent auroras;
from four o'clock till eight of the evening, the sky in the north was
slightly lighted up; then this took a regular shape, with a rim of
light yellow, the ends of which seemed to touch the field of ice.
Gradually the brilliancy arose in the heavens, following the magnetic
meridian, and appeared striped with black bands; jets of luminosity
shot with varying brightness here and there; when it reached the
zenith it was often composed of several arcs bathed in waves of red,
yellow, or green light. It was a dazzling sight. Soon the different
curves met in a single point, and formed crowns of celestial richness.
Finally the arcs all crowded together, the splendid aurora grew dim,
the intense colors faded away into pale, vague, uncertain tints, and
this wonderful phenomenon vanished gradually, insensibly, in the dark
clouds of the south.

[Illustration: "Almost every night the doctor could observe the
magnificent auroras."]

It is difficult to realize the wonderful, magical beauty of such a
spectacle in high latitudes, less than eight degrees from the pole;
the auroras which are seen in the temperate zone give no idea of it;
it seems as if Providence wished to reserve the greatest wonders for
these regions.

Numerous mock-moons appeared also while the moon was shining, and a
great many would appear in the sky, adding to the general brilliancy;
often, too, simple lunar halos surrounded the moon with a circle of
splendid lustre.

[Illustration]

November 26th the tide rose very high, and the water came through the
hole with great violence; the thick crust of ice seemed pushed up by
the force of the sea, and the frequent cracking of the ice proclaimed
the conflict that was going on beneath; fortunately the ship remained
firm in her bed, but her chains worked noisily; it was as a precaution
against just such an event, that Hatteras had made the brig fast.

The following days were still colder; a dense fog hid the sky; the
wind tossed the snow about; it was hard to determine whether it came
from the clouds or from the ice-fields; everything was in confusion.

The crew kept busy with various interior occupations, the principal
one being the preparation of the grease and oil from the seal; it was
frozen into blocks of ice, which had to be cut with a hatchet; it was
broken into small fragments, which were as hard as marble; ten barrels
full were collected. As may be seen, every vessel became nearly
useless, besides the risk of its breaking when the contents froze.

The 28th the thermometer fell to -32°; there was only ten days' coal
on board, and every one awaited with horror the moment when it should
come to an end.

Hatteras, for the sake of economy, had the fire in the stove in the
after-room put out; and from that time Shandon, the doctor, and he
were compelled to betake themselves to the common-room of the crew.
Hatteras was hence brought into constant communication with his men,
who gazed at him with surly, dejected glances. He heard their
fault-finding, their reproaches, even their threats, without being
able to punish them. However, he seemed deaf to every remark. He never
went near the fire. He remained in a corner, with folded arms, without
saying a word.

[Illustration]

In spite of the doctor's recommendations, Pen and his friends refused
to take the slightest exercise; they passed whole days crouching about
the stove or under their bedclothes; hence their health began to
suffer; they could not react against the rigor of the climate, and
scurvy soon made its appearance on board.

The doctor had long since begun to distribute, every morning,
lemon-juice and lime pastilles; but these precautions, which were
generally so efficacious, did very little good to the sick; and the
disease, following its usual course, soon showed its most horrible
symptoms.

Terrible indeed it was to see those wretches with their nerves and
muscles contracted with pain! Their legs were fearfully swollen, and
were covered with large bluish-black patches; their bleeding gums,
their swollen lips, permitted them to utter only inarticulate sounds;
their blood was poisoned, deprived of fibrine, and no longer carried
life to the extremities.

Clifton was the first to be attacked by this cruel malady; soon
Gripper, Brunton, and Strong had to keep to their hammocks. Those whom
the illness spared could not avoid the sight of the sufferings of
their friends; the common-room was the only place where they could
stay; so it was soon transformed into a hospital, for of the eighteen
sailors of the _Forward_, thirteen were soon down with scurvy. It
seemed as if Pen would escape the contagion; his strong constitution
preserved him; Shandon felt the first symptoms, but it went no further
with him, and plenty of exercise soon restored him to good health.

The doctor tended his patients with the greatest devotion, and his
heart would bleed at the sight of the sufferings he could not assuage.
Still, he inspired as much cheerfulness as he could in the lonely
crew; his words, his consolations, his philosophical reflections, his
fortunate inventions, broke the monotony of those long days of
suffering; he would read aloud to them; his wonderful memory kept him
supplied with amusing anecdotes, while the men who were well stood
pressing closely around the stove; but the groans of the sick, their
complaints, and their cries of despair would continually interrupt
him, and, breaking off in the middle of a story, he would become the
devoted and attentive physician.

Besides, his health remained good; he did not grow thin; his
corpulence stood him in better stead than the thickest raiment, and he
used to say he was as well clad as a seal or a whale, who, thanks to
their thick layers of fat, easily support the rigors of the winter.

Hatteras did not suffer physically or morally. The sufferings of the
crew did not seem to depress him. Perhaps he would not let his
emotions appear on his face, while an acute observer would have
detected the heart of a man beneath this mask of iron.

The doctor analyzed him, studied him, and could not classify this
strange organization, this unnatural temperament.

The thermometer fell still lower; the deck was entirely deserted; the
Esquimaux dogs alone walked up and down it, barking dismally.

There was always a man on guard near the stove, who superintended
putting on the coal; it was important not to let it go out; when the
fire got low the cold crept into the room, formed on the walls, and
the moisture suddenly condensed and fell in the form of snow on the
unfortunate occupants of the brig.

It was among these terrible sufferings that they reached December 8th;
that morning the doctor went as usual to look at the thermometer. He
found the mercury entirely frozen in the bulb.

"Forty-four degrees below zero!" he said with terror.

And on that day the last piece of coal on board was thrown into the
stove.




CHAPTER XXVII.
THE GREAT COLD AT CHRISTMAS.


For a moment he had a feeling of despair. The thought of death, and
death by cold, appeared in all its horror; this last piece of coal
burned with an ominous splutter; the fire seemed about to go out, and
the temperature of the room fell noticeably. But Johnson went to get
some of the new fuel which the marine animals had furnished to them,
and with it he filled the stove; he added to it some tow filled with
frozen oil, and soon obtained sufficient heat. The odor was almost
unendurable; but how get rid of it? They had to get used to it.
Johnson agreed that his plan was defective, and that it would not be
considered a success in Liverpool.

"And yet," he added, "this unpleasant smell will, perhaps, produce
good results."

"What are they?" asked the carpenter.

"It will doubtless attract the bears this way, for they are fond of
the smell."

"Well," continued Bell, "what is the need of having bears?"

"Bell," replied Johnson, "we can't count on seals any longer; they're
gone away, and for a long time; if bears don't come in their place to
supply us with their share of fuel, I don't know what is to become of
us."

"True, Johnson, our fate is very uncertain; our position is a most
alarming one. And if this sort of fuel gives out, I don't see how--"

"There might be another--"

"Another?" asked Bell.

"Yes, Bell! in despair on account of--but the captain would never--but
yet we shall perhaps have to come to it."

And Johnson shook his head sadly, and fell to thinking gloomily. Bell
did not interrupt him. He knew that the supply of fat, which it had
been so hard to acquire, would only last a week, even with the
strictest economy.

The boatswain was right. A great many bears, attracted by the scent,
were seen to leeward of the _Forward_; the healthy men gave chase; but
these animals are very swift of foot, and crafty enough to escape most
stratagems; it was impossible to get near them, and the most skilful
gunners could not hit them.

The crew of the brig was in great danger of dying from the cold; it
could not withstand, for forty-eight hours, such a temperature as
would exist in the common-room. Every one looked forward with terror
to getting to the end of the fuel.

Now this happened December 20th, at three o'clock in the afternoon;
the fire went out; the sailors, grouped about the empty stove, gazed
at one another with haggard eyes. Hatteras remained without moving in
his corner; the doctor, as usual, paced up and down excitedly; he did
not know what was to be done.

The temperature in the room fell at once to -7°.

But if the doctor was baffled and did not know what they should turn
their hands to, others knew very well. So Shandon, cold and resolute,
Pen, with wrath in his eyes, and two or three of his companions, such
as he could induce to accompany him, walked towards Hatteras.

"Captain!" said Shandon.

Hatteras, absorbed in his thoughts, did not hear him.

"Captain!" repeated Shandon, touching him with his hand.

Hatteras arose.

"Sir," he said.

"Captain, the fire is out."

"Well?" continued Hatteras.

"If you intend that we shall freeze to death," Shandon went on with
grim irony, "we should be glad if you would tell us."

"My intention," answered Hatteras with a deep voice, "is that every
man shall do his duty to the end."

"There's something superior to duty, Captain," answered his first
officer, "and that is the right of self-preservation. I repeat it, we
have no fire; and if this goes on, in two days not one of us will be
alive."

"I have no wood," answered Hatteras, gloomily.

"Well," shouted Pen, violently, "when the wood gives out, we must go
cut it where it grows!"

Hatteras grew pale with anger.

"Where is that?" he asked.

"On board," answered the sailor, insolently.

"On board!" repeated the captain, with clinched fists and sparkling
eyes.

"Of course," answered Pen, "when the ship can't carry the crew, the
ship ought to be burned."

At the beginning of this sentence Hatteras had grasped an axe; at its
end, this axe was raised above Pen's head.

[Illustration]

"Wretch!" he cried.

The doctor sprang in front of Pen, and thrust him back; the axe fell
on the floor, making a deep gash. Johnson, Bell, and Simpson gathered
around Hatteras, and seemed determined to support him. But plaintive,
grievous cries arose from the berths, transformed into death-beds.

"Fire, fire!" they cried, shivering beneath their now insufficient
covering.

Hatteras by a violent effort controlled himself, and after a few
moments of silence, he said calmly,--

"If we destroy the ship, how shall we get back to England?"

"Sir," answered Johnson, "perhaps we can without doing any material
damage burn the less important parts, the bulwarks, the nettings--"

"The small boats will be left," said Shandon; "and besides, why might
we not make a smaller vessel out of what is left of the old one?"

"Never!" answered Hatteras.

"But--" interposed many of the men, shouting together.

"We have a large quantity of spirits of wine," suggested Hatteras;
"burn all of that."

"All right; we'll take the spirits of wine!" answered Johnson,
assuming an air of confidence which he was far from feeling.

And with the aid of long wicks, dipped into this liquid of which the
pale flame licked the walls of the stove, he was able to raise the
temperature of the room a few degrees.

In the following days the wind came from the south again and the
thermometer rose; the snow, however, kept falling. Some of the men
were able to leave the ship for the driest hours of the day; but
ophthalmia and scurvy kept most of them on board; besides, neither
hunting nor fishing was possible.

But this was only a respite in the fearful severity of the cold, and
on the 25th, after a sudden change of wind, the frozen mercury
disappeared again in the bulb of the instrument; then they had to
consult the spirit-thermometer, which does not freeze even in the most
intense colds.

The doctor, to his great surprise, found it marking -66°. Seldom has
man been called upon to endure so low a temperature.

The ice stretched in long, dark lines upon the floor; a dense mist
filled the room; the dampness fell in the form of thick snow; the men
could not see one another; their extremities grew cold and blue; their
heads felt as if they wore an iron band; and their thoughts grew
confused and dull, as if they were half delirious. A terrible symptom
was that their tongues refused to articulate a sound.

[Illustration]

From the day the men threatened to burn the ship, Hatteras would walk
for hours upon the deck, keeping watch. This wood was flesh and blood
to him. Cutting a piece from it would have been like cutting off a
limb. He was armed, and he kept constant guard, without minding the
cold, the snow, or the ice, which stiffened his clothing as if it
covered it with a granite cuirass. Duke understood him, and followed
him, barking and howling.

[Illustration: "He was armed, and he kept constant guard, without
minding the cold, the snow, or the ice."]

Nevertheless, December 25th he went down into the common-room. The
doctor, with all the energy he had left, went up to him and said,--

"Hatteras, we are going to die from want of fire!"

"Never!" said Hatteras, knowing very well what request he was
refusing.

"We must," continued the doctor, mildly.

"Never!" repeated Hatteras more firmly; "I shall never give my
consent! Whoever wishes, may disobey me."

Thus was permission given them. Johnson and Bell hastened to the deck.
Hatteras heard the wood of the brig crashing under the axe, and wept.

That was Christmas Day, the great family festival in England, one
specially devoted to the amusement of the children. What a painful
recollection was that of the happy children gathered about the green
Christmas tree! Every one recalled the huge pieces of roast meat, cut
from the fattened ox, and the tarts, the mince-pies, and other
luxuries so dear to the English heart! But here was nothing but
suffering, despair, and wretchedness, and for the Christmas log, these
pieces of a ship lost in the middle of the frigid zone!

Nevertheless, under the genial influence of the fire, the spirits and
strength of the men returned; the hot tea and coffee brought great and
immediate consolation, and hope is so firm a friend of man, that they
even began to hope for some luckier fate. It was thus that the year
1860 passed away, the early winter of which had so interfered with
Hatteras's plans.

Now it happened that this very New Year's Day was marked by an
unexpected discovery. It was a little milder than the previous days
had been; the doctor had resumed his studies; he was reading Sir
Edward Belcher's account of his expedition in the polar regions.
Suddenly, a passage which he had never noticed before filled him with
astonishment; he read it over again; doubt was no longer possible.

Sir Edward Belcher states that, having come to the end of Queen's
Channel, he found there many traces of the presence of men. He says:--

"There are remains of dwellings far superior to what can be attributed
to the savage habits of the wandering tribes of Esquimaux. The walls
are firmly placed on deep-dug foundations; the inside, covered with a
thick layer of gravel, has been paved. Skeletons of moose, reindeer,
and seals abound. We found coal there."

At these last words an idea occurred to the doctor; he took his book
and ran to tell Hatteras.

"Coal!" shouted the captain.

"Yes, Hatteras, coal; that is to say, our preservation!"

"Coal, on this lonely shore!" continued Hatteras; "no, that's
impossible!"

"How can you doubt it, Hatteras? Belcher would not have mentioned it
if he had not been sure, without having seen it with his own eyes."

"Well, what then, Doctor?"

"We are not a hundred miles from the place where Belcher saw this
coal! What is a journey of a hundred miles? Nothing. Longer
expeditions have often been made on the ice, and with the cold as
intense. Let us go after it, Captain!"

"We'll go!" said Hatteras, who had made up his mind quickly; and with
his active imagination he saw the chance of safety.

Johnson was informed of the plan, of which he approved highly; he told
his companions; some rejoiced, others heard of it with indifference.

"Coal on these shores!" said Wall from his sick-bed.

"We'll let them go," answered Shandon, mysteriously.

But before they had begun to make preparations for the trip, Hatteras
wanted to fix the position of the _Forward_ with the utmost
exactitude. The importance of this calculation it is easy to see. Once
away from the ship, it could not be found again without knowing its
position precisely.

So Hatteras went up on deck; he took observations at different moments
of several lunar distances, and the altitude of the principal stars.
He found, however, much difficulty in doing this, for when the
temperature was so low, the glass and the mirrors of the instrument
were covered with a crust of ice from Hatteras's breath; more than
once his eyelids were burned by touching the copper eye-pieces. Still,
he was able to get very exact bases for his calculations, and he
returned to the common-room to work them out. When he had finished, he
raised his head with stupefaction, took his chart, marked it, and
looked at the doctor.

"Well?" asked the latter.

"What was our latitude when we went into winter-quarters?"

"Our latitude was 78° 15', and the longitude 95° 35', exactly the pole
of cold."

"Well," added Hatteras in a low voice, "our ice-field is drifting! We
are two degrees farther north and farther west,--at least three
hundred miles from your coal-supply!"

"And these poor men who know nothing about it!" cried the doctor.

"Not a word!" said Hatteras, raising his finger to his lips.




CHAPTER XXVIII.
PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE.


Hatteras did not wish to let his crew know about this new condition of
affairs. He was right. If they had known that they were being driven
towards the north with irresistible force, they would have given way
to despair. The doctor knew this, and approved of the captain's
silence.

Hatteras had kept to himself the impressions which this discovery had
caused within him. It was his first moment of joy during these long
months of struggle with the hostile elements. He was one hundred and
fifty miles farther north; hardly eight degrees from the Pole! But he
hid his joy so well that the doctor did not even suspect it; he asked
himself why Hatteras's eye shone with so unusual a lustre; but that
was all, and the natural reply to this question did not enter his
head.

The _Forward_, as it approached the Pole, had drifted away from the
coal which had been seen by Sir Edward Belcher; instead of a hundred
miles, it would have to be sought two hundred and fifty miles farther
south. Still, after a short discussion between Hatteras and Clawbonny,
they determined to make the attempt.

If Belcher was right, and his accuracy could not be doubted, they
would find everything just at he had left it. Since 1853, no new
expedition had visited these remote continents. Few, if any, Esquimaux
are found in this latitude. The disaster which had befallen at Beechey
Island could not be repeated on the shores of North Cornwall.
Everything seemed to favor an excursion across the ice.

They estimated that they would be gone forty days at the outside, and
preparations were made by Johnson for that time of absence.

In the first place, he saw about the sledge; it was of the shape of
those used in Greenland, thirty-five inches broad and twenty-four feet
long. The Esquimaux sometimes make them fifty feet long. It was built
of long planks, bent at each end, and kept in position by two strong
cords. This shape adapted it to resist violent shocks. The sledge ran
easily upon the ice; but before the snow had hardened, it was
necessary to place two vertical frames near together, and being raised
in this way, it could run on without cutting too much into the snow.
Besides, by rubbing it with a mixture of sulphur and snow in the
Esquimaux fashion, it ran very easily.

[Illustration]

It was drawn by six dogs; they were strong in spite of their thinness,
and did not appear to be injured by the severity of the winter; the
harnesses of deerskin were in good condition; perfect reliance could
be placed on the equipment, which the Greenlanders at Upernavik had
sold in conscience. These six animals alone could draw a weight of two
thousand pounds without inordinate fatigue.

They carried with them a tent, in case it should be impossible to
build a snow-house; a large sheet of mackintosh to spread over the
snow, so that it should not melt at contact with their bodies; and,
last of all, many coverings of wool and buffalo-skin. In addition,
they carried the Halkett-boat.

Their provisions consisted of five chests of pemmican, weighing four
hundred and fifty pounds; a pound of pemmican was allotted for each
man and dog; of the latter there were seven, including Duke; there
were to be four men. They carried, besides, twelve gallons of spirits
of wine, weighing nearly a hundred and fifty pounds; tea and biscuit,
in proper amounts; a little portable kitchen, with a great many wicks;
and much tow, ammunition, and four double-barrelled guns. The men of
the party made use of Captain Parry's invention, and wore girdles of
india-rubber in which the heat of the body and the motion in walking
could keep tea, coffee, and water in a liquid state.

Johnson took special care of the preparation of snow-shoes, with their
wooden frames and leathern straps; they served as skates; on
thoroughly frozen spots deerskin moccasins could be worn with comfort;
every man carried two pairs of each.

These preparations, which were so important because the omission of a
single detail might have caused the ruin of the whole expedition,
required four whole days. Every day at noon Hatteras took an
observation of the ship's position; it was no longer drifting, and
this had to be perfectly sure in order to secure their return.

Hatteras undertook to choose the four men who were to accompany him.
It was not an easy decision to take; some it was not advisable to
take, but then the question of leaving them on board had also to be
considered. Still, the common safety demanded the success of this
trip, and the captain deemed it right to choose sure and experienced
men.

Hence Shandon was left out, but not much to his regret. James Wall was
too ill to go. The sick grew no worse; their treatment consisted of
repeated rubbing and strong doses of lemon-juice; this was easily seen
to without the presence of the doctor being essential. Hence he
enrolled himself among those who should go, and no voice was raised
against it. Johnson would have gladly gone with the captain in his
dangerous expedition; but Hatteras drew him to one side and said to
him in an affectionate, almost weeping voice,--

"Johnson, you are the only man I can trust. You are the only officer
with whom I can leave the ship. I must know that you are here to keep
an eye on Shandon and the others. They are kept to the ship by the
winter; but who can say what plans they are not capable of forming?
You shall receive my formal instructions, which shall place the
command in your hands. You shall take my place. We shall be absent
four or five weeks at the most, and I shall be at ease having you here
where I cannot be. You need wood, Johnson. I know it! But, as much as
possible, spare my ship. Do you understand, Johnson?"

"I understand, Captain," answered the old sailor, "and I will remain
if you prefer it."

"Thanks!" said Hatteras, pressing the boatswain's hand; and he added,
"In case we don't come back, Johnson, wait till the next thaw, and try
to push on to the Pole. If the rest refuse, don't think of us, but
take the _Forward_ back to England."

"That is your wish, Captain?"

"It is," answered Hatteras.

"Your orders shall be obeyed," said Johnson, quietly.

The doctor regretted that his friend was not going to accompany him,
but he was obliged to recognize the wisdom of Hatteras's plan.

His two other companions were Bell the carpenter, and Simpson. The
first, who was sturdy, brave, and devoted, would be of great service
in their camping in the snow; the other, although less resolute,
nevertheless determined to take part in this expedition in which he
might be of use as hunter and fisher.

So this detachment consisted of Hatteras, Clawbonny, Bell, Simpson,
and the faithful Duke, making in all four men and seven dogs to be
fed. A suitable amount of provisions was made ready.

During the early days of January the mean temperature was -33°.
Hatteras waited impatiently for milder weather; he frequently
consulted the barometer, but no confidence could be placed in this
instrument, which in these high latitudes seems to lose some of its
customary accuracy; in these regions there are many exceptions to the
general laws of nature: for instance, a clear sky was not always
accompanied by cold, nor did a fall of snow raise the temperature; the
barometer was uncertain, as many explorers in these seas have noticed;
it used to fall when the wind was from the north or east; when low it
foretold fine weather; when high, rain or snow. Hence its indications
could hardly be relied on.

Finally, January 5th an easterly breeze brought with it a rise in the
thermometer of fifteen degrees, so that it stood at -18°. Hatteras
resolved to start the next day; he could no longer endure seeing his
ship torn to pieces before his eyes; the whole quarter-deck had been
burned up.

So, January 6th, amid squalls of snow, the order to depart was given;
the doctor gave his last words of advice to the sick; Bell and Simpson
shook hands silently with their companions. Hatteras wanted to make a
farewell speech to the men, but he saw nothing but angry faces around
him. He fancied he saw an ironical smile playing about Shandon's lips.
He held his peace. Perhaps he had a momentary pang at parting as he
gazed at the _Forward_.

But it was too late for him to change his mind; the sledge, loaded and
harnessed, was waiting on the ice; Bell was the first to move; the
others followed. Johnson accompanied the travellers for a quarter of a
mile; then Hatteras asked him to return, which he did after a long
leave-taking. At that moment, Hatteras, turning for the last time
towards the brig, saw the tops of her masts disappearing in the dark
snow-clouds.




CHAPTER XXIX.
ACROSS THE ICE-FIELDS.


The little band made their way towards the southeast. Simpson drove
the sledge. Duke aided him much, without being disturbed at the
occupation of his mates. Hatteras and the doctor followed behind on
foot, while Bell, who was charged with making a road, went on in
advance, testing the ice with the iron point of his stick.

[Illustration: "The little band made their way towards the
southeast."]

The rise in the thermometer foretold a fall of snow, and soon it came,
beginning in large flakes. This added to the hardships of their
journey; they kept straying from a straight line; they could not go
quickly; nevertheless, they averaged three miles an hour.

The ice-field, under the pressure of the frost, presented an unequal
surface; the sledge was often nearly turned over, but they succeeded
in saving it.

Hatteras and his companions wrapped themselves up in their fur clothes
cut in the Greenland fashion; they were not cut with extraordinary
neatness, but they suited the needs of the climate; their faces were
enclosed in a narrow hood which could not be penetrated by the snow or
wind; their mouths, noses, and eyes were alone exposed to the air, and
they did not need to be protected against it; nothing is so
inconvenient as scarfs and nose-protectors, which soon are stiff with
ice; at night they have to be cut away, which, even in the arctic
seas, is a poor way of undressing. It was necessary to leave free
passage for the breath, which would freeze at once on anything it met.

The boundless plain stretched out with tiresome monotony; everywhere
there appeared heaped-up ice-hills, hummocks, blocks, and icebergs,
separated by winding valleys; they walked staff in hand, saying but
little. In this cold atmosphere, to open the mouth was painful; sharp
crystals of ice suddenly formed between the lips, and the heat of the
breath could not melt them. Their progress was silent, and every one
beat the ice with his staff. Bell's footsteps were visible in the
fresh snow; they followed them mechanically, and where he had passed,
the others could go safely.

Numerous tracks of bears and foxes crossed one another everywhere; but
during this first day not one could be seen; to chase them would have
been dangerous and useless: they would only have overloaded the
already heavy sledge.

Generally, in excursions of this sort, travellers take the precaution
of leaving supplies along their path; they hide them from the animals,
in the snow, thus lightening themselves for their trip, and on their
return they take the supplies which they did not have the trouble of
carrying with them.

Hatteras could not employ this device on an ice-field which perhaps
was moving; on firm land it would have been possible; and the
uncertainty of their route made it doubtful whether they would return
by the same path.

At noon, Hatteras halted his little troop in the shelter of an
ice-wall; they dined off pemmican and hot tea; the strengthening
qualities of this beverage produced general comfort, and the
travellers drank a large quantity. After an hour's rest they started
on again; in the first day they walked about twenty miles; that
evening men and dogs were tired out.

Still, in spite of their fatigue, they had to build a snow-house in
which to pass the night; the tent would not have been enough. This
took them an hour and a half. Bell was very skilful; the blocks of
ice, which were cut with a knife, were placed on top of one another
with astonishing rapidity, and they took the shape of a dome, and a
last piece, the keystone of the arch, established the solidity of the
building; the soft snow served as mortar in the interstices; it soon
hardened and made the whole building of a single piece.

[Illustration]

Access was had into this improvised grotto by means of a narrow
opening, through which it was necessary to crawl on one's hands and
knees; the doctor found some difficulty in entering, and the others
followed. Supper was soon prepared on the alcohol cooking-stove. The
temperature inside was very comfortable; the wind, which was raging
without, could not get in.

"Sit down!" soon shouted the doctor in his most genial manner.

And this meal, though the same as the dinner, was shared by all. When
it was finished their only thought was sleep; the mackintoshes, spread
out upon the snow, protected them from the dampness. At the flame of
the portable stove they dried their clothes; then three of them,
wrapped up in their woollen coverings, fell asleep, while one was left
on watch; he had to keep a lookout on the safety of all, and to
prevent the opening from being closed, otherwise they ran a risk of
being buried alive.

Duke shared their quarters; the other dogs remained without, and after
they had eaten their supper they lay down and were soon hidden by the
snow.

Their fatigue soon brought sound sleep. The doctor took the watch
until three of the morning. In the night the hurricane raged
furiously. Strange was the situation of these lonely men lost in the
snow, enclosed in this vault with its walls rapidly thickening under
the snow-fall.

The next morning at six o'clock their monotonous march was resumed;
there were ever before them the same valleys and icebergs, a
uniformity which made the choice of a path difficult. Still, a fall of
several degrees in the temperature made their way easier by hardening
the snow. Often they came across little elevations, which looked like
cairns or storing-places of the Esquimaux; the doctor had one
destroyed to satisfy his curiosity, but he found nothing except a cake
of ice.

"What do you expect to find, Clawbonny?" asked Hatteras; "are we not
the first men to penetrate into this part of the globe?"

"Probably," answered the doctor, "but who knows?"

"Don't let us waste our time in useless searching," resumed the
captain; "I am in a hurry to rejoin the ship, even if this long-wanted
fuel should not be found."

"I have great hopes of finding it," said the doctor.

"Doctor," Hatteras used to say frequently, "I did wrong to leave the
_Forward_; it was a mistake! The captain's place is on board, and
nowhere else."

"Johnson is there."

"Yes! but--let us hurry on!"

They advanced rapidly; Simpson's voice could be heard urging on the
dogs; they ran along on a brilliant surface, all aglow with a
phosphorescent light, and the runners of the sledge seemed to toss up
a shower of sparks. The doctor ran on ahead to examine this snow, when
suddenly, as he was trying to jump upon a hummock, he disappeared from
sight. Bell, who was near him, ran at once towards the place.

"Well, Doctor," he cried anxiously, while Hatteras and Simpson joined
him, "where are you?"

"Doctor!" shouted the captain.

"Down here, at the bottom of a hole," was the quiet answer. "Throw me
a piece of rope, and I'll come up to the surface of the globe."

They threw a rope down to the doctor, who was at the bottom of a pit
about ten feet deep; he fastened it about his waist, and his three
companions drew him up with some difficulty.

"Are you hurt?" asked Hatteras.

"No, there's no harm done," answered the doctor, wiping the snow from
his smiling face.

"But how did it happen?"

"O, it was in consequence of the refraction," he answered, laughing;
"I thought I had about a foot to step over, and I fell into this deep
hole! These optical illusions are the only ones left me, my friends,
and it's hard to escape from them! Let that be a lesson to us all
never to take a step forward without first testing the ice with a
staff, for our senses cannot be depended on. Here our ears hear wrong,
and our eyes deceive us! It's a curious country!"

"Can you go on?" asked the captain.

"Go on, Hatteras, go on! This little fall has done me more good than
harm."

They resumed their march to the southeast, and at evening they halted,
after walking about twenty-five miles; they were all tired, but still
the doctor had energy enough to ascend an ice-mountain while the
snow-hut was building.

[Illustration: "The doctor had energy enough to ascend an ice-mountain
while the snow-hut was building."]

The moon, which was nearly at its full, shone with extraordinary
brilliancy in a clear sky; the stars were wonderfully brilliant; from
the top of the iceberg a boundless plain could be seen, which was
covered with strangely formed hillocks of ice; in the moonlight they
looked like fallen columns or overthrown tombstones; the scene
reminded the doctor of a huge, silent graveyard barren of trees, in
which twenty generations of human beings might be lying in their long
sleep.

In spite of the cold and fatigue, Clawbonny remained for a long time
in a revery, from which it was no easy task for his companions to
arouse him; but they had to think of resting; the snow-hut was
completed; the four travellers crawled in like moles, and soon were
all asleep.

The following days went on without any particular incident; at times
they went on slowly, at times quickly, with varying ease, according to
the changes in the weather; they wore moccasins or snow-shoes, as the
nature of the ice demanded.

In this way they went on till January 15th; the moon, now in its last
quarter, was hardly visible; the sun, although always beneath the
horizon, gave a sort of twilight for six hours every day, but not
enough to light up the route, which had to be directed by the compass.
Then Bell went on ahead; Hatteras followed next; Simpson and the
doctor sought also to keep in a straight line behind, with their eyes
on Hatteras alone; and yet, in spite of all their efforts, they often
got thirty or forty degrees from the right way, much to their
annoyance.

Sunday, January 15th, Hatteras judged that they had come about one
hundred miles to the south; this morning was set aside to mending
their clothes and materials; the reading of divine service was not
forgotten.

At noon they started again; the temperature was very low; the
thermometer marked only -22°; the air was very clear.

Suddenly, without warning, a frozen vapor arose into the air from the
ice, to a height of about ninety feet, and hung motionless; no one
could see a foot before him; this vapor formed in long, sharp crystals
upon their clothing.

[Illustration]

The travellers, surprised by this phenomenon, which is called
frost-rime, only thought of getting together; so immediately various
shouts were heard:--

"O Simpson!"

"Bell, this way!"

"Dr. Clawbonny!"

"Doctor!"

"Captain, where are you?"

They began to look for one another with outstretched arms, wandering
through the fog which their eyes could not pierce. But to their
disappointment they could hear no answer; the vapor seemed incapable
of carrying sound.

Each one then thought of firing his gun as a signal to the others. But
if their voices were too feeble, the reports of the fire-arms were too
loud; for the echoes, repeated in every direction, made but a confused
roar, in which no particular direction could be perceived.

Then they began to act, each one as he thought best. Hatteras stood
still and folded his arms. Simpson contented himself with stopping the
sledge. Bell retraced his steps, feeling them with his hand. The
doctor, stumbling over the blocks of ice, wandered here and there,
getting more and more bewildered.

At the end of five minutes he said to himself,--

"This can't last long! Singular climate! This is too much! There is
nothing to help us, without speaking of these sharp crystals which cut
my face. Halloo, Captain!" he shouted again.

But he heard no answer; he fired his gun, but in spite of his thick
gloves the iron burned his hands. Meanwhile he thought he saw a
confused mass moving near him.

"There's some one," he said. "Hatteras! Bell! Simpson! Is that you?
Come, answer!"

A dull roar was alone heard.

"Ah!" thought the doctor, "what is that?"

The object approached; it lost its first size and appeared in more
definite shape. A terrible thought flashed into the doctor's mind.

"A bear!" he said to himself.

In fact, it was a huge bear; lost in the fog, it came and went with
great danger to the men, whose presence it certainly did not suspect.

"Matters are growing complicated!" thought the doctor, standing still.

Sometimes he felt the animal's breath, which was soon lost in the
frost-rime; again he would see the monster's huge paws beating the air
so near him that his clothes were occasionally torn by its sharp
claws; he jumped back, and the animal disappeared like a
phantasmagoric spectre.

[Illustration]

But as he sprang back he found an elevation beneath his feet; he
climbed up first one block of ice, then another, feeling his way with
his staff.

"An iceberg!" he said to himself; "if I can get to the top I am safe."

With these words he climbed up an elevation of about ninety feet with
surprising agility; he arose above the frozen mist, the top of which
was sharply defined.

"Good!" he said to himself; and looking about him he saw his three
companions emerging from the vapor.

"Hatteras!"

"Dr. Clawbonny!"

"Bell!"

"Simpson!"

These names were shouted out almost at the same time; the sky, lit up
by a magnificent halo, sent forth pale rays which colored the
frost-rime as if it were a cloud, and the top of the icebergs seemed
to rise from a mass of molten silver. The travellers found themselves
within a circle of less than a hundred feet in diameter. Thanks to the
purity of the air in this upper layer in this low temperature, their
words could be easily heard, and they were able to talk on the top of
this iceberg. After the first shots, each one, hearing no answer, had
only thought of climbing above the mist.

"The sledge!" shouted the captain.

"It's eighty feet beneath us," answered Simpson.

"Is it all right?"

"All right."

"And the bear?" asked the doctor.

"What bear?" said Bell.

"A bear!" said Hatteras; "let's go down."

"No!" said the doctor; "we shall lose our way, and have to begin it
all over again."

"And if he eats our dogs--" said Hatteras.

At that moment Duke was heard barking, the sound rising through the
mist.

"That's Duke!" shouted Hatteras; "there's something wrong. I'm going
down."

All sorts of howling arose to their ears; Duke and the dogs were
barking furiously. The noise sounded like a dull murmur, like the roar
of a crowded, noisy room. They knew that some invisible struggle was
going on below, and the mist was occasionally agitated like the sea
when marine monsters are fighting.

"Duke, Duke!" shouted the captain, as he made ready to enter again
into the frost-rime.

"Wait a moment, Hatteras,--wait a moment! It seems to me that the fog
is lifting."

It was not lifting, but sinking, like water in a pool; it appeared to
be descending into the ground from which it had risen; the summits of
the icebergs grew larger; others, which had been hidden, arose like
new islands; by an optical illusion, which may be easily imagined, the
travellers, clinging to these ice-cones, seemed to be rising in the
air, while the top of the mist sank beneath them.

Soon the top of the sledge appeared, then the harnessed dogs, and then
about thirty other animals, then great objects moving confusedly, and
Duke leaping about with his head alternately rising and sinking in the
frozen mist.

"Foxes!" shouted Bell.

"Bears!" said the doctor; "one, two, three."

"Our dogs, our provisions!" cried Simpson.

A troop of foxes and bears, having come across the sledge, were
ravaging the provisions. Their instinct of pillaging united them in
perfect harmony; the dogs were barking furiously, but the animals paid
no heed, but went on in their work of destruction.

"Fire!" shouted the captain, discharging his piece.

[Illustration: "'Fire!' shouted the captain, discharging his piece."]

His companions did the same. But at the combined report the bears,
raising their heads and uttering a singular roar, gave the signal to
depart; they fell into a little trot which a galloping horse could not
have kept up with, and, followed by the foxes, they soon disappeared
amid the ice to the north.




CHAPTER XXX.
THE CAIRN.


This phenomenon, which is peculiar to the polar regions, had lasted
three quarters of an hour; the bears and foxes had had plenty of time;
these provisions arrived opportunely for these animals, who were
nearly starved during the inclement weather; the canvas cover of the
sledge was torn by their strong claws, the casks of pemmican were
opened and emptied; the biscuit-sacks pillaged, the tea spilled over
the snow, a barrel of alcohol torn open and its contents lost, their
camping materials scattered and damaged, bore witness to the ferocity
of these wild beasts, and their greediness.

"This is a misfortune," said Bell, gazing at this scene of ruin.

"Which is probably irreparable," said Simpson.

"Let us first estimate the loss," interrupted the doctor, "and we'll
talk about it afterwards."

Hatteras, without saying a word, began to gather the scattered boxes
and sacks; they collected the pemmican and biscuits which could be
eaten; the loss of part of their alcohol was much to be regretted; for
if that was gone there would be nothing warm to drink; no tea, no
coffee. In making an inventory of the supplies left, the doctor found
two hundred pounds of pemmican gone, and a hundred and fifty pounds of
biscuit; if their journey continued they would have to subsist on
half-rations.

They then began to discuss what should be done, whether they should
return to the ship and start out again. But how could they make up
their minds to lose the hundred and fifty miles they had already made?
To return without fuel would have a depressing effect upon the spirits
of the crew. Could men be found again to resume their march across the
ice?

Evidently it was better to push on, even at the risk of severe
privations.

The doctor, Hatteras, and Bell were of this opinion; Simpson wanted to
go back; the fatigue of the journey had worn upon his health; he was
visibly weaker; but finding himself alone of this opinion, he resumed
his place at the head of the sledge, and the little caravan continued
its journey to the south.

During the three next days, from the 15th to the 17th of January, all
the monotonous incidents of the voyage were repeated; they advanced
more slowly, and with much fatigue; their legs grew tired; the dogs
dragged the sledge with difficulty; their diminished supply of food
could not comfort men or beasts. The weather was very variable,
changing from intense, dry cold to damp, penetrating mists.

January 18th the aspect of the ice-fields changed suddenly; a great
number of peaks, like sharp-pointed pyramids, and very high, appeared
at the horizon; the ground in certain places came through the snow; it
seemed formed of gneiss, schist, and quartz, with some appearance of
limestone. The travellers at last touched earth again, and this land
they judged to be that called North Cornwall.

The doctor could not help striking the earth with joy; they had now
only a hundred miles to go before reaching Cape Belcher, but their
fatigue increased strangely on this soil, covered with sharp rocks,
and interspersed with dangerous points, crevasses, and precipices;
they had to go down into the depths of these abysses, climb steep
ascents, and cross narrow gorges, in which the snow was drifted to the
depth of thirty or forty feet.

[Illustration]

The travellers soon regretted the almost easy journey over the
ice-fields, which so well suited the sledge; now it had to be dragged
by main force; the weary dogs were insufficient; the men, compelled to
take their place alongside of them, wore themselves out with hauling;
often they had to take off the whole load to get over some steep
hills; a place only ten feet wide often kept them busy for hours; so
in this first day they made only five miles in North Cornwall, which
is certainly well named, for it exhibits all the roughness, the sharp
points, the steep gorges, the confused rockiness, of the southwest
coast of England.

The next day the sledge reached the top of the hills near the shore;
the exhausted travellers, being unable to make a snow-hut, were
obliged to pass the night under the tent, wrapped up in buffalo-skins,
and drying their wet stockings by placing them about their bodies. The
inevitable consequences of such conduct are easily comprehended; that
night the thermometer fell below -44°, and the mercury froze.

Simpson's health caused great anxiety; a persistent cough, violent
rheumatism, and intolerable pain obliged him to lie on the sledge
which he could no longer guide. Bell took his place; he too was
suffering, but not so much as to be incapacitated. The doctor also
felt the consequences of this trip in this terrible weather; but he
uttered no complaint; he walked on, resting on his staff; he made out
the way and helped every one. Hatteras, impassible, and as strong as
on the first day, followed the sledge in silence.

January 20th the weather was so severe that the slightest effort
produced complete prostration. Still, the difficulties of the way were
so great, that Hatteras, the doctor, and Bell harnessed themselves
with the dogs; sudden shocks had broken the front of the sledge, and
they had to stop to repair it. Such delays were frequent every day.

The travellers followed a deep ravine, up to their waists in snow, and
perspiring violently in spite of the intense cold. They did not say a
word. Suddenly Bell, who was near the doctor, looked at him with some
alarm; then, without uttering a word, he picked up a handful of snow
and began rubbing his companion's face violently.

[Illustration]

"Well, Bell!" said the doctor, resisting.

But Bell continued rubbing.

"Come, Bell," began the doctor again, his mouth, nose, and eyes full
of snow, "are you mad? What's the matter?"

"If you have a nose left," answered Bell, "you ought to be grateful to
me."

"A nose!" answered the doctor, quickly, clapping his hand to his face.

"Yes, Doctor, you were frost-bitten; your nose was white when I looked
at you, and if I had not done as I did, you would have lost that
ornament which is in the way on a journey, but agreeable to one's
existence."

In fact, the doctor's nose was almost frozen; the circulation of the
blood was restored in time, and, thanks to Bell, all danger was gone.

"Thanks, Bell!" said the doctor; "I'll be even with you yet."

"I hope so, Doctor," the carpenter answered; "and may Heaven protect
us from worse misfortunes!"

"Alas, Bell," continued the doctor, "you mean Simpson! The poor fellow
is suffering terribly."

"Do you fear for his life?" asked Hatteras, quickly.

"Yes, Captain," answered the doctor.

"And why?"

"He has a violent attack of scurvy; his legs have begun to swell, and
his gums too; the poor fellow lies half frozen on the sledge, and
every movement redoubles his suffering. I pity him, Hatteras, and I
can't do anything to relieve him."

"Poor Simpson!" murmured Bell.

"Perhaps we shall have to halt for a day or two," resumed the doctor.

"Halt!" shouted Hatteras, "when the lives of eighteen men are hanging
on our return!"

"Still--" said the doctor.

"Clawbonny, Bell, listen to me," said Hatteras; "we have food for only
twenty days! Judge for yourselves whether we can stop for a moment!"

Neither the doctor nor Bell made any reply, and the sledge resumed its
progress, which had been delayed for a moment. That evening they
stopped beneath a hillock of ice, in which Bell at once cut a cavern;
the travellers entered it; the doctor passed the night attending to
Simpson; the scurvy had already made fearful ravages, and his
sufferings caused perpetual laments to issue from his swollen lips.

"Ah, Dr. Clawbonny!"

"Courage, my dear fellow!" said the doctor.

"I shall never get well! I feel it! I'd rather die!"

The doctor answered these despairing words by incessant cares;
although worn out by the fatigue of the day, he spent the night in
composing a soothing potion for his patient; but the lime-juice was
ineffectual, and continual friction could not keep down the progress
of the scurvy.

[Illustration]

The next day he had to be placed again upon the sledge, although he
besought them to leave him behind to die in peace; then they resumed
their dreary and difficult march.

The frozen mists penetrated the three men to the bone; the snow and
sleet dashed against them; they were working like draught-horses, and
with a scanty supply of food.

Duke, like his master, kept coming and going, enduring every fatigue,
always alert, finding out by himself the best path; they had perfect
confidence in his wonderful instinct.

During the morning of January 23d, amid almost total darkness, for the
moon was new, Duke had run on ahead; for many hours he was not seen;
Hatteras became uneasy, especially because there were many traces of
bears to be seen; he was uncertain what to do, when suddenly a loud
barking was heard.

Hatteras urged on the sledge, and soon he found the faithful animal at
the bottom of a ravine. Duke stood as motionless as if turned to
stone, barking before a sort of cairn made of pieces of limestone,
covered with a cement of ice.

"This time," said the doctor, detaching his harness, "it's a cairn,
there's no doubt of that."

"What's that to us?" asked Hatteras.

"Hatteras, if it is a cairn, it may contain some document of value for
us; perhaps some provisions, and it would be worth while to see."

"What European could have come as far as this?" asked Hatteras,
shrugging his shoulders.

"But in lack of Europeans," answered the doctor, "cannot Esquimaux
have made it here to contain what they have fished or shot? It's their
habit, I think."

"Well, go and look at it," continued Hatteras; "but I'm afraid it will
be hardly worth your while."

Clawbonny and Bell walked to the cairn with picks in their hands. Duke
continued barking furiously. The limestones were firmly fastened
together by the ice; but a few blows scattered them on the ground.

"There's something there, evidently," said the doctor.

"I think so," answered Bell.

They rapidly destroyed the cairn. Soon they found a bundle and in it a
damp paper. The doctor took it with a beating heart. Hatteras ran
forward, seized the paper, and read:--

"Altam..., _Porpoise_, December 13, 1860, longitude 12..°, latitude
8..° 35'."

"The _Porpoise_?" said the doctor.

"The _Porpoise_!" replied Hatteras. "I never heard of a ship of this
name in these seas."

"It is clear," resumed the doctor, "that travellers, perhaps
shipwrecked sailors, have been here within two months."

"That is sure," said Bell.

"What are we going to do?" asked the doctor.

"Push on," answered Hatteras, coldly. "I don't know anything about any
ship called the _Porpoise_, but I know that the brig _Forward_ is
waiting for our return."




CHAPTER XXXI.
THE DEATH OF SIMPSON.


They resumed their journey; the mind of every one was filled with new
and unexpected ideas, for to meet any one in these regions is about
the most remarkable event that can happen. Hatteras frowned uneasily.

"The _Porpoise_!" he kept saying to himself; "what ship is that? And
what is it doing so near the Pole?"

At the thought, he shuddered. The doctor and Bell only thought of the
two results which might follow the discovery of this document, that
they might be of service in saving some one, or, possibly, that they
might be saved by them. But the difficulties, obstacles, and dangers
soon returned, and they could only think of their perilous position.

[Illustration: "They could only think of their perilous position."]

Simpson's condition grew worse; the doctor could not be mistaken about
the symptoms of a speedy death. He could do nothing; he was himself
suffering from a painful ophthalmia, which might be accompanied by
deafness if he did not take care. The twilight at that time gave light
enough, and this light, reflected by the snow, was bad for the eyes;
it was hard to protect them from the reflection, for glasses would be
soon covered with a layer of ice which rendered them useless. Hence
they had to guard carefully against accident by the way, and they had
to run the risk of ophthalmia; still, the doctor and Bell covered
their eyes and took turns in guiding the sledge. It ran far from
smoothly on its worn runners; it became harder and harder to drag it;
their path grew more difficult; the land was of volcanic origin, and
all cut up with craters; the travellers had been compelled gradually
to ascend fifteen hundred feet to reach the top of the mountains. The
temperature was lower, the storms were more violent, and it was a
sorry sight to see these poor men on these lonely peaks.

[Illustration]

They were also made sick by the whiteness of everything; the uniform
brilliancy tired them; it made them giddy; the earth seemed to wave
beneath their feet with no fixed point on the immense white surface;
they felt as one does on shipboard when the deck seems to be giving
way beneath the foot; they could not get over the impression, and the
persistence of the feeling wearied their heads. Their limbs grew
torpid, their minds grew dull, and often they walked like men half
asleep; then a slip or a sudden fall would rouse them for a few
moments from their sluggishness.

January 25th they began to descend the steep slopes, which was even
more fatiguing; a false step, which it was by no means easy to avoid,
might hurl them down into deep ravines where they would certainly have
perished. Towards evening a violent tempest raged about the snowy
summit; it was impossible to withstand the force of the hurricane;
they had to lie down on the ground, but so low was the temperature
that they ran a risk of being frozen to death at once.

Bell, with Hatteras's aid, built with much difficulty a snow-house, in
which the poor men sought shelter; there they partook of a few
fragments of pemmican and a little hot tea; only four gallons of
alcohol were left; and they had to use this to allay their thirst, for
snow cannot be absorbed if taken in its natural state; it has to be
melted first. In the temperate zone, where the cold hardly ever sinks
much below the freezing-point, it can do no harm; but beyond the Polar
Circle it is different; it reaches so low a temperature that the bare
hand can no more touch it than it can iron at a white heat, and this,
although it is a very poor conductor of heat; so great is the
difference of temperature between it and the stomach that its
absorption produces real suffocation. The Esquimaux prefer severe
thirst to quenching it with this snow, which does not replace water,
and only augments the thirst instead of appeasing it. The only way the
travellers could make use of it was by melting it over the
spirit-lamp.

At three in the morning, when the tempest was at its height, the
doctor took his turn at the watch; he was lying in a corner of the hut
when a groan of distress from Simpson attracted his attention; he
arose to see to him, but in rising he hit his head sharply against the
icy roof; without paying any attention to that, he bent over Simpson
and began to rub his swollen, discolored legs; after doing this for a
quarter of an hour he started to rise, and bumped his head again,
although he was on his knees.

"That's odd," he said to himself.

He raised his hand above his head; the roof was perceptibly sinking.

"Great God!" he cried; "wake up, my friends!"

At his shouts Hatteras and Bell arose quickly, striking their heads
against the roof; they were in total darkness.

"We shall be crushed!" said the doctor; "let's get out!"

And all three, dragging Simpson after them, abandoned their dangerous
quarters; and it was high time, for the blocks of ice, ill put
together, fell with a loud crash.

[Illustration]

The poor men found themselves then without shelter against the
hurricane. Hatteras attempted to raise the tent, but it was
impossible, so severe was the wind, and they had to shelter themselves
beneath the canvas, which was soon covered with a thick layer of snow;
but this snow prevented the radiation of their warmth and kept them
from being frozen to death.

The storm lasted all night; Bell, when he was harnessing the
half-starved dogs, noticed that three of them had begun to eat the
leather straps; two were very sick and seemed unable to go on. Still,
they set out as well as they could; they had sixty miles between them
and the point they wished to reach.

On the 26th, Bell, who was ahead, shouted suddenly to his companions.
They ran towards him, and he pointed with astonishment to a gun
resting on a piece of ice.

[Illustration]

"A gun!" cried the doctor.

Hatteras took it; it was in good condition, and loaded.

"The men of the _Porpoise_ can't be far off."

Hatteras, as he was examining the gun, noticed that it was of American
make; his hands clinched nervously its barrel.

"Forward!" he said calmly.

They continued to descend the mountains. Simpson seemed deprived of
all feeling; he had not even strength left to moan.

The tempest continued to rage; the sledge went on more and more
slowly; they made but a few miles in twenty-four hours, and, in spite
of the strictest economy, their supplies threatened to give out; but
so long as enough was left to carry them back, Hatteras pushed on.

On the 27th they found, partly buried beneath the snow, a sextant and
then a flask, which contained brandy, or rather a piece of ice, in the
middle of which all the spirit of the liquor had collected in the form
of snow; it was of no use.

Evidently, without meaning it, Hatteras was following in the wake of
some great disaster; he went on by the only possible route, collecting
the traces of some terrible shipwreck. The doctor kept a sharp lookout
for other cairns, but in vain.

Sad thoughts beset him: in fact, if he should discover these wretches,
of what service could he be to them? He and his companions were
beginning to lack everything; their clothing was torn, their supplies
were scanty. If the survivors were many, they would all starve to
death. Hatteras seemed inclined to flee from them! Was he not
justified, since the safety of the crew depended upon him? Ought he to
endanger the safety of all by bringing strangers on board?

But then strangers were men, perhaps their countrymen! Slight as was
their chance of safety, ought they to be deprived of it? The doctor
wanted to get Bell's opinion; but Bell refused to answer. His own
sufferings had hardened his heart. Clawbonny did not dare ask
Hatteras: so he sought aid from Providence.

Towards the evening of that day, Simpson appeared to be failing fast;
his cold, stiff limbs, his impeded breathing, which formed a mist
about his head, his convulsive movements, announced that his last hour
had come. His expression was terrible to behold; it was despairing,
with a look of impotent rage at the captain. It contained a whole
accusation, mute reproaches which were full of meaning, and perhaps
deserved.

Hatteras did not go near the dying man. He avoided him, more silent,
more shut into himself than ever!

The following night was a terrible one; the violence of the tempest
was doubled; three times the tent was thrown over, and snow was blown
over the suffering men, blinding them, and wounding them with the
pieces torn from the neighboring masses. The dogs barked incessantly.
Simpson was exposed to all the inclemency of the weather. Bell
succeeded in again raising the canvas, which, if it did not protect
them from the cold, at least kept off the snow. But a sudden squall
blew it down for the fourth time and carried it away with a fierce
blast.

"Ah, that is too much!" shouted Bell.

"Courage, courage!" answered the doctor, stooping down to escape being
blown away.

Simpson was gasping for breath. Suddenly, with a last effort, he half
rose, stretched his clinched fist at Hatteras, who was gazing steadily
at him, uttered a heart-rending cry, and fell back dead in the midst
of his unfinished threat.

[Illustration: "Suddenly, with a last effort, he half rose."]

"Dead!" said the doctor.

"Dead!" repeated Bell.

Hatteras, who was approaching the corpse, drew back before the
violence of the wind.

He was the first of the crew who succumbed to the murderous climate,
the first to offer up his life, after incalculable sufferings, to the
captain's persistent obstinacy. This man had considered him an
assassin, but Hatteras did not quail before the accusation. But a
tear, falling from his eyes, froze on his pale cheek.

The doctor and Bell looked at him in terror. Supported by his long
staff, he seemed like the genius of these regions, straight in the
midst of the fierce blast, and terrible in his stern severity.

He remained standing, without stirring, till the first rays of the
twilight appeared, bold and unconquerable, and seeming to defy the
tempest which was roaring about him.

[Illustration]




CHAPTER XXXII.
THE RETURN TO THE FORWARD.


Toward six o'clock in the morning the wind fell, and, shifting
suddenly to the north, it cleared the clouds from the sky; the
thermometer stood at -33°. The first rays of the twilight appeared on
the horizon above which it would soon peer.

Hatteras approached his two dejected companions and said to them,
sadly and gently,--

"My friends, we are more than sixty miles from the point mentioned by
Sir Edward Belcher. We have only just enough food left to take us back
to the ship. To go farther would only expose us to certain death,
without our being of service to any one. We must return."

"That is a wise decision, Hatteras," answered the doctor; "I should
have followed you anywhere, but we are all growing weaker every day;
we can hardly set one foot before the other; I approve of returning."

"Is that your opinion, Bell?" asked Hatteras.

"Yes, Captain," answered the carpenter.

"Well," continued Hatteras, "we will take two days for rest. That's
not too much. The sledge needs a great many repairs. I think, too, we
ought to build a snow-house in which we can repose."

This being decided, the three men set to work energetically. Bell took
the necessary precautions to insure the solidity of the building, and
soon a satisfactory retreat arose at the bottom of the ravine where
they had last halted.

[Illustration]

It was doubtless after a hard struggle that Hatteras had decided to
discontinue his journey. So much effort and fatigue thrown away! A
useless trip, entailing the death of one of his men! To return without
a scrap of coal: what would the crew say? What might it not do under
the lead of Shandon? But Hatteras could not continue the struggle any
longer.

He gave all his attention to their preparations for returning; the
sledge was repaired; its load, too, had become much lighter, and only
weighed two hundred pounds. They mended their worn-out, torn clothes,
all soaked through and through by the snow; new moccasins and
snow-shoes replaced those which were no longer serviceable. This kept
them busy the whole of the 29th and the morning of the 30th; then they
all sought what rest they could get, and prepared for what was before
them.

During the thirty-six hours spent in or near the snow-house, the
doctor had been noticing Duke, whose singular behavior did not seem to
him to be natural; the dog kept going in circles which seemed to have
a common centre; there was a sort of elevation in the soil, produced
by accumulated layers of ice; Duke, as he ran around this place, kept
barking gently and wagging his tail impatiently, looking at his master
as if asking something.

The doctor, after reflecting a moment, ascribed this uneasiness to the
presence of Simpson's corpse, which his companions had not yet had
time to bury. Hence he resolved to proceed to this sad ceremony on
that very day; the next morning they were to start. Bell and the
doctor, picks in hand, went to the bottom of the ravine; the elevation
which Duke had noticed offered a suitable place for the grave, which
would have to be dug deep to escape the bears.

The doctor and Bell began by removing the soft snow, then they
attacked the solid ice; at the third blow of his pick the doctor
struck against some hard body; he picked up the pieces and found them
the fragments of a glass bottle. Bell brought to light a stiffened
bag, in which were a few crumbs of fresh biscuit.

"What's this?" said the doctor.

"What can it be?" asked Bell, stopping his work.

The doctor called to Hatteras, who came at once.

Duke barked violently, and with his paws tried to tear up the ice.

"Have we by any possibility come across a supply of provisions?" said
the doctor.

"It looks like it," answered Bell.

"Go on!" said Hatteras.

A few bits of food were found and a box quarter full of pemmican.

"If we have," said Hatteras, "the bears have visited it before we did.
See, these provisions have been touched already."

"It is to be feared," answered the doctor, "for--"

He did not finish his sentence; a cry from Bell interrupted him; he
had turned over a tolerably large piece of ice and showed a stiff,
frozen human leg in the ice.

"A corpse!" cried the doctor.

"It's a grave," said Hatteras.

It was the body of a sailor about thirty years old, in a perfect state
of preservation; he wore the usual dress of Arctic sailors; the doctor
could not say how long he had been dead.

After this, Bell found another corpse, that of a man of fifty,
exhibiting traces of the sufferings that had killed him.

[Illustration]

"They were never buried," cried the doctor; "these poor men were
surprised by death as we find them."

"You are right, Doctor," said Bell.

"Go on, go on!" said Hatteras.

Bell hardly dared. Who could say how many corpses lay hidden here?

"They were the victims of just such an accident as we nearly perished
by," said the doctor; "their snow-house fell in. Let us see if one may
not be breathing yet!"

The place was rapidly cleared away, and Bell brought up a third body,
that of a man of forty; he looked less like a corpse than the others;
the doctor bent over him and thought he saw some signs of life.

"He's alive!" he shouted.

Bell and he carried this body into the snow-house, while Hatteras
stood in silence, gazing at the sunken dwelling.

[Illustration]

The doctor stripped the body; it bore no signs of injury; with Bell's
aid he rubbed it vigorously with tow dipped in alcohol, and he saw
life gradually reviving within it; but the man was in a state of
complete prostration, and unable to speak; his tongue clove to his
palate as if it were frozen.

The doctor examined his patient's pockets; they were empty. No paper.
He let Bell continue rubbing, and went out to Hatteras.

He found him in the ruined snow-house, clearing away the floor; soon
he came out, bearing a half-burned piece of an envelope. A few words
could be deciphered:--

  ....tamont
    ...._orpoise_
      ....w York.

"Altamont!" shouted the doctor, "of the _Porpoise_! of New York!"

"An American!" said Hatteras.

"I shall save him," said the doctor; "I'll answer for it, and we shall
find out the explanation of this puzzle."

He returned to Altamont, while Hatteras remained pensive. The doctor
succeeded in recalling the unfortunate man to life, but not to
consciousness; he neither saw, heard, nor spoke, but at any rate he
was alive!

The next morning Hatteras said to the doctor,--

"We must start."

"All right, Hatteras! The sledge is not loaded; we shall carry this
poor fellow back to the ship with us.

"Very well," said Hatteras. "But first let us bury these corpses."

The two unknown sailors were placed beneath the ruins of the
snow-house; Simpson's body took the place of Altamont's.

The three travellers uttered a short prayer over their companion, and
at seven o'clock in the morning they set off again for the ship.

Two of the dogs were dead. Duke volunteered to drag the sledge, and he
worked as resolutely as a Greenland dog.

For twenty days, from January 31st to February 19th, the return was
very much like the first part of the journey. Save that it was in the
month of February, the coldest of the whole year, and the ice was
harder; the travellers suffered terribly from the cold, but not from
the wind or snow-storm.

The sun reappeared for the first time January 31st; every day it rose
higher above the horizon. Bell and the doctor were at the end of their
strength, almost blind and quite lame; the carpenter could not walk
without crutches. Altamont was alive, but continued insensible;
sometimes his life was despaired of, but unremitting care kept him
alive! And yet the doctor needed to take the greatest care of himself,
for his health was beginning to suffer.

Hatteras thought of the _Forward_! In what condition was he going to
find it? What had happened on board? Had Johnson been able to
withstand Shandon and his allies? The cold had been terrible! Had they
burned the ship? Had they spared her masts and keel?

While thinking of this, Hatteras walked on as if he had wished to get
an early view of the _Forward_.

February 24th, in the morning, he stopped suddenly. Three hundred
paces before him appeared a reddish glow, above which rose an immense
column of black smoke, which was lost in the gray clouds of the sky.

"See that smoke!" he shouted.

His heart beat as if it would burst.

"See that smoke!" he said to his companions. "My ship is on fire!"

"But we are more than three miles from it," said Bell. "It can't be
the _Forward_!"

"Yes, but it is," answered the doctor; "the mirage makes it seem
nearer."

"Let us run!" cried Hatteras.

They left the sledge in charge of Duke, and hastened after the
captain. An hour later they came in sight of the ship. A terrible
sight! The brig was burning in the midst of the ice, which was melting
about her; the flames were lapping her hull, and the southerly breeze
brought to Hatteras's ears unaccustomed sounds.

Five hundred feet from the ship stood a man raising his hands in
despair; he stood there, powerless, facing the fire which was
destroying the _Forward_.

The man was alone; it was Johnson.

Hatteras ran towards him.

"My ship! my ship!" he cried.

"You! Captain!" answered Johnson; "you! stop! not a step farther!"

"Well?" asked Hatteras with a terrible air.

"The wretches!" answered Johnson, "they've been gone forty-eight
hours, after firing the ship!"

"Curse them!" groaned Hatteras.

Then a terrible explosion was heard; the earth trembled; the icebergs
fell; a column of smoke rose to the clouds, and the _Forward_
disappeared in an abyss of fire.

[Illustration: "Then a terrible explosion was heard."]

At that moment the doctor and Bell came up to Hatteras. He roused
himself suddenly from his despair.

"My friends," he said energetically, "the cowards have taken flight!
The brave will succeed! Johnson, Bell, you are bold; Doctor, you are
wise; as for me, I have faith! There is the North Pole! Come, to
work!"

Hatteras's companions felt their hearts glow at these brave words.

And yet the situation was terrible for these four men and the dying
man, abandoned without supplies, alone at the eighty-fourth degree of
latitude, in the very heart of the polar regions.

THE DESERT OF ICE.




THE DESERT OF ICE.




CHAPTER I.
THE DOCTOR'S INVENTORY.


The design which Captain Hatteras had formed of exploring the North,
and of giving England the honor of discovering the Pole, was certainly
a bold one. This hardy sailor had just done all that human skill could
do. After struggling for nine months against contrary winds and seas,
after destroying icebergs and ice-fields, after enduring the severity
of an unprecedentedly cold winter, after going over all that his
predecessors had done, after carrying the _Forward_ beyond the seas
which were already known, in short, after completing half his task, he
saw his grand plans completely overthrown. The treachery, or rather
the demoralization of his wearied crew, the criminal folly of some of
the ringleaders, left him in a terrible situation; of the eighteen men
who had sailed in the brig, four were left, abandoned without
supplies, without a boat, more than twenty-five hundred miles from
home!

The explosion of the _Forward_, which had just blown up before their
eyes, took from them their last means of subsistence. Still,
Hatteras's courage did not abandon him at this terrible crisis. The
men who were left were the best of the crew; they were genuine heroes.
He made an appeal to the energy and wisdom of Dr. Clawbonny, to the
devotion of Johnson and Bell, to his own faith in the enterprise; even
in these desperate straits he ventured to speak of hope; his brave
companions listened to him, and their courage in the past warranted
confidence in their promises for the future.

The doctor, after listening to the captain's words, wanted to get an
exact idea of their situation; and, leaving the others about five
hundred feet from the ship, he made his way to the scene of the
catastrophe.

Of the _Forward_, which had been built with so much care, nothing was
left; pieces of ice, shapeless fragments all blackened and charred,
twisted pieces of iron, ends of ropes still burning like fuse, and
scattered here and there on the ice-field, testified to the force of
the explosion. The cannon had been hurled to some distance, and was
lying on a piece of ice that looked like a gun-carriage. The surface
of the ice, for a circle of six hundred feet in diameter, was covered
with fragments of all sorts; the brig's keel lay under a mass of ice;
the icebergs, which had been partly melted by the fire, had already
recovered their rock-like hardness.

The doctor then began to think of his ruined cabin, of his lost
collections, of his precious instruments destroyed, his books torn,
burned to ashes. So much that was valuable gone! He gazed with tearful
eyes at this vast disaster, thinking not of the future, but of the
irreparable misfortune which dealt him so severe a blow. He was
immediately joined by Johnson; the old sailor's face bore signs of his
recent sufferings; he had been obliged to struggle against his
revolted companions, defending the ship which had been intrusted to
his care. The doctor sadly pressed the boatswain's hand.

[Illustration]

"Well, my friend, what is going to become of us?" asked the doctor.

"Who can say?" answered Johnson.

"At any rate," continued the doctor, "don't let us give way to
despair; let us be men!"

"Yes, Doctor," answered the old sailor, "you are right; it's when
matters look worst that we most need courage; we are in a bad way; we
must see how we can best get out of it."

"Poor ship!" said the doctor, sighing; "I had become attached to it; I
had got to look on it as on my own home, and there's not left a piece
that can be recognized!"

"Who would think, Doctor, that this mass of dust and ashes could be so
dear to our heart?"

"And the launch," continued the doctor, gazing around, "was it
destroyed too?"

"No, Doctor; Shandon and the others, who left, took it with them."

"And the gig?"

"Was broken into a thousand pieces. See, those sheets of tin are all
that's left of her."

"Then we have nothing but the Halkett-boat?"[1]

[Footnote 1: Made of india-rubber, and capable of being inflated at
pleasure.]

"That is all, and it is because you insisted on our taking it, that we
have that."

"It's not of much use," said the doctor.

"They were a pack of miserable, cowardly traitors who ran away!" said
Johnson. "May they be punished as they deserve!"

"Johnson," answered the doctor, mildly, "we must remember that their
suffering had worn upon them very much. Only exceptional natures
remain stanch in adversity, which completely overthrows the weak. Let
us rather pity than curse them!"

After these words the doctor remained silent for a few minutes, and
gazed around uneasily.

"What is become of the sledge?" asked Johnson.

"We left it a mile back."

"In care of Simpson?"

"No, my friend; poor Simpson sank under the toil of the trip."

"Dead!" cried the boatswain.

"Dead!" answered the doctor.

"Poor fellow!" said Johnson; "but who knows whether we may not soon be
reduced to envying his fate?"

"But we have brought back a dying man in place of the one we lost,"
answered the doctor.

"A dying man?"

"Yes, Captain Altamont."

The doctor gave the boatswain in a few words an account of their
finding him.

"An American!" said Johnson, thoughtfully.

"Yes; everything seems to point that way. But what was this _Porpoise_
which had evidently been shipwrecked, and what was he doing in these
waters?"

"He came in order to be lost," answered Johnson; "he brought his crew
to death, like all those whose foolhardiness leads them here. But,
Doctor, did the expedition accomplish what it set out for?"

"Finding the coal?"

"Yes," answered Johnson.

The doctor shook his head sadly.

"None at all?" asked the old sailor.

"None; our supplies gave out, fatigue nearly conquered us. We did not
even reach the spot mentioned by Edward Belcher."

"So," continued Johnson, "you have no fuel?"

"No."

"Nor food?"

"No."

"And no boat with which to reach England?"

They were both silent; they needed all their courage to meet this
terrible situation.

"Well," resumed the boatswain, "there can be no doubts about our
condition! We know what we have to expect! But the first thing to do,
when the weather is so cold, is to build a snow-house."

"Yes," answered the doctor, "with Bell's aid that will be easy; then
we'll go after the sledge, we'll bring the American here, and then
we'll take counsel with Hatteras."

"Poor captain!" said Johnson, forgetting his own griefs; "he must
suffer terribly."

With these words they returned to their companions. Hatteras was
standing with folded arms, as usual, gazing silently into space. His
face wore its usual expression of firmness. Of what was this
remarkable man thinking? Of his desperate condition and shattered
hopes? Was he planning to return, since both men and the elements had
combined against his attempt?

No one could have read his thoughts, which his face in no way
expressed. His faithful Duke was with him, braving a temperature of
-32°.

Bell lay motionless on the ice; his insensibility might cost him his
life; he was in danger of being frozen to death. Johnson shook him
violently, rubbed him with snow, and with some difficulty aroused him
from his torpor.

"Come, Bell, take courage!" he said; "don't lose heart; get up; we
have to talk matters over, and we need a shelter. Have you forgotten
how to make a snow-house? Come, help me, Bell! There's an iceberg we
can cut into! Come, to work! That will give us what we need, courage!"

Bell, aroused by these words, obeyed the old sailor.

"Meanwhile," Johnson went on, "the doctor will be good enough to go to
the sledge and bring it back with the dogs."

"I am ready," answered the doctor; "in an hour I shall be back."

"Shall you go too, Captain?" added Johnson, turning to Hatteras.

Although he was deep in thought, the captain heard the boatswain's
question, for he answered gently,--

"No, my friend, if the doctor is willing to go alone. We must form
some plan of action, and I want to be alone to think matters over. Go.
Do what you think right for the present. I will be thinking of the
future."

Johnson turned to the doctor.

"It's singular," he said; "the captain seems to have forgotten his
anger; his voice never was so gentle before."

"Well!" answered the doctor; "he has recovered his presence of mind.
Mark my words, Johnson, that man will be able to save us!"

Thereupon the doctor wrapped himself up as well as he could, and,
staff in hand, walked away towards the sledge in the midst of a fog
which the moonlight made almost bright. Johnson and Bell set to work
immediately; the old sailor encouraged the carpenter, who wrought on
in silence; they did not need to build, but to dig into the solid ice;
to be sure it was frozen very hard, and so rendered the task
difficult, but it was thereby additionally secure; soon Johnson and
Bell could work comfortably in the orifice, throwing outside all that
they took from the solid mass.

[Illustration]

From time to time Hatteras would walk fitfully, stopping suddenly
every now and then; evidently he did not wish to reach the spot where
his brig had been. As he had promised, the doctor was soon back; he
brought with him Altamont, lying on the sledge beneath all the
coverings; the Greenland dogs, thin, tired, and half starved, could
hardly drag the sledge, and were gnawing at their harness; it was high
time that men and beasts should take some rest.

While they were digging the house, the doctor happened to stumble upon
a small stove which had not been injured by the explosion, and with a
piece of chimney that could be easily repaired: the doctor carried it
away in triumph. At the end of three hours the house was inhabitable;
the stove was set in and filled with pieces of wood; it was soon
roaring and giving out a comfortable warmth.

The American was brought in and covered up carefully; the four
Englishmen sat about the fire. The last supplies of the sledge, a
little biscuit and some hot tea, gave them some comfort. Hatteras did
not speak; every one respected his silence. When the meal was finished
the doctor made a sign for Johnson to follow him outside.

"Now," he said, "we are going to make an inventory of what is left. We
must know exactly what things we have; they are scattered all about;
we must pick them up; it may snow at any moment, and then it would be
impossible to find a scrap."

"Don't let us lose any time, then," answered Johnson; "food and wood
is what we need at once."

"Well, let us each take a side," answered the doctor, "so as to cover
the whole ground; let us begin at the centre and go out to the
circumference."

They went at once to the bed of ice where the _Forward_ had lain; each
examined with care all the fragments of the ship beneath the dim light
of the moon. It was a genuine hunt; the doctor entered into this
occupation with all the zest, not to say the pleasure, of a sportsman,
and his heart beat high when he discovered a chest almost intact; but
most were empty, and their fragments were scattered everywhere.

The violence of the explosion had been considerable; many things were
but dust and ashes; the large pieces of the engine lay here and there,
twisted out of shape; the broken flanges of the screw were hurled
twenty fathoms from the ship and buried deeply in the hardened snow;
the bent cylinders had been torn from their pivots; the chimney, torn
nearly in two, and with chains still hanging to it, lay half hid under
a large cake of ice; the bolts, bars, the iron-work of the helm, the
sheathing, all the metal-work of the ship, lay about as if it had been
fired from a gun.

[Illustration: "The large pieces of the engine lay here and there,
twisted out of shape."]

But this iron, which would have made the fortune of a tribe of
Esquimaux, was of no use under the circumstances; before anything else
food had to be found, and the doctor did not discover a great deal.

"That's bad," he said to himself; "it is evident that the store-room,
which was near the magazine, was entirely destroyed by the explosion;
what wasn't burned was shattered to dust. It's serious; and if Johnson
is not luckier than I am, I don't see what's going to become of us."

Still, as he enlarged his circles, the doctor managed to collect a few
fragments of pemmican, about fifteen pounds, and four stone bottles,
which had been thrown out upon the snow and so had escaped
destruction; they held five or six pints of brandy.

Farther on he picked up two packets of grains of cochlearia, which
would well make up for the loss of their lime-juice, which is so
useful against the scurvy.

Two hours later the doctor and Johnson met. They told one another of
their discoveries; unfortunately they had found but little to eat:
some few pieces of salt pork, fifty pounds of pemmican, three sacks of
biscuit, a little chocolate, some brandy, and about two pounds of
coffee, picked up berry by berry on the ice.

No coverings, no hammocks, no clothing, were found; evidently the fire
had destroyed all. In short, the doctor and boatswain had found
supplies for three weeks at the outside, and with the strictest
economy; that was not much for them in their state of exhaustion. So,
in consequence of these disasters, Hatteras found himself not only
without any coal, but also short of provisions.

As to the fuel supplied by the fragments of the ship, the pieces of
the masts and the keel, they might hold out about three weeks; but
then the doctor, before using it to heat their new dwelling, asked
Johnson whether out of it they might not build a new ship, or at least
a launch.

"No, Doctor," answered the boatswain, "it's impossible; there's not a
piece of wood large enough; it's good for nothing except to keep us
warm for a few days and then--"

"Then?" asked the doctor.

"God alone knows," answered the sailor.

Having made out their list, the doctor and Johnson went after the
sledge; they harnessed the tired dogs, returned to the scene of the
explosion, packed up the few precious objects they had found, and
carried them to their new house; then, half frozen, they took their
place near their companions in misfortune.

[Illustration: "They harnessed the tired dogs."]




CHAPTER II.
ALTAMONT'S FIRST WORDS.


Towards eight o'clock in the evening the snow-clouds cleared away for
a few minutes; the constellations shone brilliantly in the clear air.
Hatteras made use of this change to get the altitude of some stars; he
went out without saying a word, carrying his instruments with him. He
wished to ascertain his position and see if the ice-field had not been
drifting again. After an absence of half an hour he came back, lay
down in a corner, and remained perfectly still, although not asleep.

The next day snow began to fall heavily; the doctor could not help
being glad that he had made his examination the day before, for a
white curtain soon covered the whole expanse, and every trace of the
explosion was hidden under three feet of snow.

On that day they could not set foot outside; fortunately their
quarters were comfortable, or at least seemed so to the exhausted
travellers. The little stove worked well, except occasionally when
violent gusts drove the smoke into the room; with its heat they could
make coffee and tea, which are both so serviceable beverages when the
temperature is low.

The castaways, for they deserve the name, found themselves more
comfortable than they had been for a long time; hence they only
thought of the present, of the agreeable warmth, of the brief rest,
forgetting, or even indifferent to the future, which threatened with
speedy death.

The American suffered less, and gradually returned to life; he opened
his eyes, but he did not say anything; his lips bore traces of the
scurvy, and could not utter a sound; he could hear, and was told where
he was and how he got there. He moved his head as a sign of gratitude;
he saw that he had been saved from burial beneath the snow; the doctor
forbore telling him how very short a time his death had been delayed,
for, in a fortnight or three weeks at the most, their supply of food
would be exhausted.

Towards midday Hatteras arose and went up to the doctor, Johnson, and
Bell.

"My friends," he said to them, "we are going to take a final
resolution as to the course we must follow. In the first place, I must
ask Johnson to tell me under what circumstances this act of treachery
came to pass."

"Why should we know?" said the doctor; "the fact is certain, we need
give it no more thought."

"I am thinking of it, all the same," answered Hatteras. "But after
I've heard what Johnson has to say, I shall not think of it again."

[Illustration: Johnson's Story.]

"This is the way it happened," went on the boatswain; "I did all I
could to prevent the crime--"

"I am sure of that, Johnson, and I will add that the leaders had been
plotting it for some time."

"So I thought," said the doctor.

"And I too," continued Johnson; "for very soon after your departure,
Captain, on the very next day, Shandon, who was angry with you and was
egged on by the others, took command of the ship; I tried to resist,
but in vain. After that, every one acted as he saw fit; Shandon did
not try to control them; he wanted to let the crew see that the time
of suffering and privation had gone by. Hence there was no economy; a
huge fire was lighted in the stove; they began to burn the brig. The
men had the provisions given them freely, and the spirits too, and you
can easily imagine the abuse they made of them after their long
abstinence. Things went on in this way from the 7th to the 15th of
January."

"So," said Hatteras, in a grave voice, "it was Shandon who incited the
men to revolt?"

"Yes, Captain."

"Say nothing more about him. Go on, Johnson."

"It was towards January 24th or 25th, that the plan of leaving the
ship was formed. They determined to reach the western coast of
Baffin's Bay; from there, in the launch, they could meet whalers, or,
perhaps, the settlements on the eastern side. Their supplies were
abundant; the sick grew better with the hope of reaching home. So they
made their plans for leaving; they built a sledge for the transport of
their food, fuel, and the launch; the men were to drag it themselves.
This occupied them until February 15th. I kept anxiously awaiting your
return, Captain, and yet I feared having you present; you would have
had no influence over the crew, who would rather have killed you than
have remained on board. They were wild with the hope of escape. I took
all my companions aside and spoke to them, I besought them to stay; I
pointed out all the dangers of such a journey, as well as the
cowardliness of abandoning you. I could get nothing, even from the
best. They chose February 22d for leaving. Shandon was impatient. They
heaped upon the sledge all the food and liquor it could hold; they
took a great deal of wood; the whole larboard side had been cut away
to the water-line. The last day they passed carousing; they ravaged
and stole everything, and it was during this drunkenness that Pen and
two or three others set fire to the ship. I resisted, and struggled
against them; they threw me down and struck me; at last, these
villains, with Shandon at their head, fled to the east, and
disappeared from my sight. I remained alone; what could I do against
this fire which was seizing the whole ship? The water-hole was frozen
over; I hadn't a drop of water. For two days the _Forward_ was wrapped
in flames, and you know the rest."

Having finished this account, a long silence prevailed in this
ice-house; the gloomy tale of the burning of the ship, the loss of
their precious brig, appeared so vividly before the minds of the
castaways; they found themselves before an impossibility, and that was
a return to England. They did not dare to look at one another, for
fear of seeing on each other's faces blank despair. There was nothing
to be heard save the hasty breathing of the American.

At last Hatteras spoke.

"Johnson," said he, "I thank you; you have done all you could to save
my ship. But you could not do anything alone. Again I thank you, and
now don't let us speak again of this misfortune. Let us unite our
efforts for the common safety. There are four of us here, four
friends, and the life of one is of no more worth than the life of
another. Let each one give his opinion on what should be done."

"Ask us, Hatteras," answered the doctor; "we are all devoted to you,
our answers shall be sincere. And, in the first place, have you any
plan?"

"I can't have any alone," said Hatteras, sadly. "My opinion might seem
interested; I want to hear your opinion first."

"Captain," said Johnson, "before speaking on such weighty matters, I
have an important question to ask you."

"What is it?"

"You ascertained our position yesterday; well, has the ice-field
drifted any more, or are we in just the same place?"

"It has not stirred," answered Hatteras. "The latitude before we left
was 80° 15', and longitude 97° 35'."

"And," said Johnson, "how far are we from the nearest sea to the
west?"

"About six hundred miles," answered Hatteras.

"And this water is--"

"Smith's Sound."

"The same which we could not cross last April?"

"The same."

"Well, Captain, now we know where we are, and we can make up our minds
accordingly."

"Speak, then," said Hatteras, letting his head sink into his hands.

In that way he could hear his friends without looking at them.

"Well, Bell," said the doctor, "what do you think is the best course
to follow?"

"It isn't necessary to reflect a long time," answered the carpenter;
"we ought to return, without wasting a day or an hour, either to the
south or the west, and reach the nearest coast, even if it took us two
months!"

"We have supplies for only three weeks," answered Hatteras, without
raising his head.

"Well," continued Johnson, "we must make that distance in three weeks,
since it's our only chance of safety; if we have to crawl on our knees
at the end, we must leave, and arrive in twenty-five days."

"This part of the northern continent is not known," answered Hatteras.
"We may meet obstacles, such as mountains and glaciers, which will
completely bar our progress."

"I don't consider that," answered the doctor, "a sufficient reason for
not attempting the journey; evidently, we shall suffer a great deal;
we ought to reduce our daily supply to the minimum, unless luck in
hunting--"

"There's only half a pound of powder left," answered Hatteras.

"Come, Hatteras," resumed the doctor, "I know the weight of all your
objections, and I don't nourish any vain hopes. But I think I can read
your thoughts; have you any practicable plan?"

"No," answered the captain, after a few moments' hesitation.

"You do not doubt our courage," continued the doctor; "we are willing
to follow you to the last, you know very well; but should we not now
abandon all hope of reaching the Pole? Mutiny has overthrown your
plans; you fought successfully against natural obstacles, but not
against the weakness and perfidy of men; you have done all that was
humanly possible, and I am sure you would have succeeded; but, in the
present condition of affairs, are you not compelled to give up your
project, and in order to take it up again, should you not try to reach
England without delay?"

"Well, Captain?" asked Johnson, when Hatteras had remained a long time
silent.

At last the captain raised his head, and said in a constrained tone,--

"Do you think you are sure of reaching the shore of the sound, tired
as you are, and almost without food?"

"No," answered the doctor; "but it's sure the shore won't come to us;
we must go to it. Perhaps we shall find to the south tribes of
Esquimaux who may aid us."

"Besides," added Johnson, "may we not find in the sound some ship that
has been forced to winter there."

"And if need be," continued the doctor, "when we've reached the sound,
may we not cross it, and reach the west coast of Greenland, and then,
either by Prudhoe's Land, or Cape York, get to some Danish settlement?
Nothing of that sort is to be found on the ice-field. The way to
England is down there to the south, and not here to the north!"

"Yes," said Bell, "Dr. Clawbonny is right; we must go, and go at once.
Hitherto we have forgotten home too much, and those who are dear to
us."

"Do you agree, Johnson?" Hatteras asked again.

"Yes, Captain."

"And you, Doctor?"

"Yes, Hatteras."

Hatteras still remained silent; in spite of all he could do, his face
expressed his agitation. His whole life depended on the decision he
should take; if he should return, it was all over with his bold plans;
he could not hope to make the attempt a fourth time.

The doctor, seeing the captain was silent, again spoke.

"I ought to add, Hatteras," he said, "that we ought not to lose an
instant; we ought to load the sledge with all our provisions, and take
as much wood as possible. A journey of six hundred miles under such
circumstances is long, I confess, but not insuperable; we can, or
rather we ought, to make twenty miles a day, which would bring us to
the coast in a month, that is to say, towards March 26th."

"But," said Hatteras, "can't we wait a few days?"

"What do you hope for?" answered Johnson.

"I don't know. Who can foretell the future? Only a few days yet! It's
hardly enough to rest your wearied bodies. We couldn't go two stages
without dropping from weariness, without any snow-house to shelter
us!"

"But a terrible death certainly awaits us here!" cried Bell.

"My friends," continued Hatteras in a tone almost of entreaty, "you
are despairing too soon! I should propose to seek safety to the north,
were it not that you would refuse to follow me. And yet are there not
Esquimaux near the Pole, as well as at Smith's Sound? That open sea,
of which the existence is uncertain, ought to surround a continent.
Nature is logical in everything it does. Well, we ought to believe
that vegetation appears when the greatest cold ceases. Is there not a
promised land awaiting us at the north, and which you want to fly from
without hope of return?"

Hatteras warmed as he spoke; his heated imagination called up
enchanting visions of these countries, whose existence was still so
problematical.

"One more day," he repeated, "a single hour!"

Dr. Clawbonny, with his adventurous character and his glowing
imagination, felt himself gradually aroused; he was about to yield;
but Johnson, wiser and colder, recalled him to reason and duty.

"Come, Bell," he said, "to the sledge!"

"Come along!" answered Bell.

The two sailors turned towards the door of the snow-house.

"O Johnson! you! you!" shouted Hatteras. "Well, go! I shall stay!"

"Captain!" said Johnson, stopping in spite of himself.

"I shall stay, I say! Go! leave me like the rest! Go!--Come, Duke, we
two shall stay!"

The brave dog joined his master, barking. Johnson looked at the
doctor. He did not know what to do; the best plan was to calm
Hatteras, and to sacrifice a day to his fancies. The doctor was about
making up his mind to this effect, when he felt some one touch his
arm.

He turned round. The American had just left the place where he had
been lying; he was crawling on the floor; at last he rose to his
knees, and from his swollen lips a few inarticulate sounds issued.

The doctor, astonished, almost frightened, gazed at him silently.
Hatteras approached the American, and examined him closely. He tried
to make out the words which the poor fellow could not pronounce. At
last, after trying for five minutes, he managed to utter this word:--

"_Porpoise_."

"The _Porpoise_?" asked the captain.

The American bowed affirmatively.

"In these seas?" asked Hatteras with beating heart.

The same sign from the sick man.

"To the north?"

"Yes."

"And you know where it lies?"

"Yes."

"Exactly?"

There was a moment's silence. The bystanders were all excited.

"Now, listen carefully," said Hatteras to the sick man; "we must know
where this ship lies. I am going to count the degrees aloud; you will
stop me by a sign."

The American bowed his head to show that he understood.

"Come," said Hatteras, "we'll begin with the longitude. One hundred
and five? No.--Hundred and six? Hundred and seven? Hundred and eight?
Far to the west?"

"Yes," said the American.

"Let us go on. Hundred and nine? Ten? Eleven? Twelve? Fourteen?
Sixteen? Eighteen? Nineteen? Twenty?"

"Yes," answered Altamont.

"Longitude one hundred and twenty?" said Hatteras. "And how many
minutes? I shall count."

Hatteras began at number one. At fifteen Altamont made a sign for him
to stop.

"All right!" said Hatteras. "Now for the latitude. You understand?
Eighty? Eighty-one? Eighty-two? Eighty-three?"

The American stopped him with a gesture.

"Well! And the minutes? Five? Ten? Fifteen? Twenty? Twenty-five?
Thirty? Thirty-five?"

Another sign from Altamont, who smiled slightly.

"So," continued Hatteras, in a deep voice, "the _Porpoise_ lies in
longitude 120° 15', and 83° 35' latitude?"

"Yes!" said the American, as he fell fainting into the doctor's arms.
This exertion had exhausted him.

[Illustration: "'Yes!' said the American."]

"My friends," cried Hatteras, "you see that safety lies to the north,
always to the north! We shall be saved!"

But after these first words of joy, Hatteras seemed suddenly struck by
a terrible thought. His expression changed, and he felt himself stung
by the serpent of jealousy.

Some one else, an American, had got three degrees nearer the Pole! And
for what purpose?




CHAPTER III.
SEVENTEEN DAYS OF LAND JOURNEY.


This new incident, these first words which Altamont uttered, had
completely altered the situation of the castaways; but just now they
had been far from any possible aid, without a reasonable chance of
reaching Baffin's Bay, threatened with starvation on a journey too
long for their wearied bodies, and now, within four hundred miles from
their snow-house, there was a ship which offered them bounteous
supplies, and perhaps the means of continuing their bold course to the
Pole. Hatteras, the doctor, Johnson, and Bell, all began to take heart
after having been so near despair; they were nearly wild with joy.

But Altamont's account was still incomplete, and, after a few moments'
repose, the doctor resumed his talk with him; he framed his questions
in such a way that a simple sign of the head or a motion of the eyes
would suffice for an answer.

Soon he made out that the _Porpoise_ was an American bark from New
York, that it had been caught in the ice with a large supply of food
and fuel; and, although she lay on her beam-ends, she must have
withstood the ice, and it would be possible to save her cargo.

Two months before, Altamont and the crew had abandoned her, carrying
the launch upon a sledge; they wanted to get to Smith's Sound, find a
whaling-vessel, and be carried in her to America; but gradually
fatigue and disease had fallen upon them, and they fell aside on the
way. At last only the captain and two sailors were left of a crew of
thirty men, and Altamont's life was the result of what was really a
miracle.

Hatteras wanted to find out from the American what he was doing in
these high latitudes.

Altamont managed to make him understand that he had been caught in the
ice and carried by it without possibility of resisting it.

Hatteras asked him anxiously for what purpose he was sailing.

Altamont gave them to understand that he had been trying the Northwest
Passage.

Hatteras did not persist, and asked no other question of the sort.

The doctor then began to speak.

"Now," he said, "all our efforts should be directed to finding the
_Porpoise_; instead of struggling to Baffin's Bay, we may, by means of
a journey only two thirds as long, reach a ship which will offer us
all the resources necessary for wintering."

"There's nothing more to be done," said Bell.

"I should add," said the boatswain, "that we should not lose a moment;
we should calculate the length of our journey by the amount of our
supplies, instead of the other and usual way, and be off as soon as
possible."

"You are right, Johnson," said the doctor; "if we leave to-morrow,
Tuesday, February 26th, we ought to reach the _Porpoise_ March 15th,
at the risk of starving to death. What do you think of that,
Hatteras?"

"Let us make our preparations at once," said the captain, "and be off.
Perhaps we shall find the way longer than we suppose."

"Why so?" asked the doctor. "This man seemed certain of the situation
of his ship."

"But," answered Hatteras, "supposing the _Porpoise_ has been drifting
as the _Forward_ did?"

"True," said the doctor, "that's not unlikely."

Johnson and Bell had nothing to urge against the possibility of a
drift of which they had themselves been victims.

But Altamont, who was listening to the conversation, gave the doctor
to understand that he wished to speak. After an effort of about a
quarter of an hour, Clawbonny made out that the _Porpoise_ was lying
on a bed of rocks, and so could not have drifted away. This
information calmed the anxiety of the Englishmen; still it deprived
them of their hope of returning to Europe, unless Bell should be able
to build a small boat out of the timbers of the _Porpoise_. However
that might be, it was now of the utmost importance that they should
reach the wreck.

The doctor put one more question to the American, namely, whether he
had found an open sea at latitude 83°.

"No," answered Altamont.

There the conversation stopped. They began at once to prepare for
departure; Bell and Johnson first began to see about the sledge, which
needed complete repairing. Since they had plenty of wood, they made
the uprights stronger, availing themselves of the experience of their
southern trip. They had learned the dangers of this mode of transport,
and since they expected to find plenty of deep snow, the runners were
made higher.

On the inside Bell made a sort of bed, covered with the canvas of the
tent, for the American; the provisions, which were unfortunately
scanty, would not materially augment the weight of the sledge, but
still they made up for that by loading it with all the wood it could
carry.

The doctor, as he packed all the provisions, made out a very careful
list of their amount; he calculated that each man could have three
quarters of a ration for a journey of three weeks. A whole ration was
set aside for the four dogs which should draw it. If Duke aided them,
he was to have a whole ration.

[Illustration]

These preparations were interrupted by the need of sleep and rest,
which they felt at seven o'clock in the evening; but before going to
bed they gathered around the stove, which was well filled with fuel,
and these poor men luxuriated in more warmth than they had enjoyed for
a long time; some pemmican, a few biscuits, and several cups of coffee
soon put them in good-humor, especially when their hopes had been so
unexpectedly lighted up. At seven in the morning they resumed work,
and finished it at three in the afternoon. It was already growing
dark. Since January 31st the sun had appeared above the horizon, but
it gave only a pale and brief light; fortunately the moon would rise
at half past six, and with this clear sky it would make their path
plain. The temperature, which had been growing lower for several days,
fell at last to -33°.

The time for leaving came. Altamont received the order with joy,
although the jolting of the sledge would increase his sufferings; he
told the doctor that medicine against the scurvy would be found on
board of the _Porpoise_. He was carried to the sledge and placed there
as comfortably as possible; the dogs, including Duke, were harnessed
in; the travellers cast one last glance at the spot where the
_Forward_ had lain. A glow of rage passed over Hatteras's face, but he
controlled it at once, and the little band set out with the air very
dry at first, although soon a mist came over them.

[Illustration]

Each one took his accustomed place, Bell ahead pointing out the way,
the doctor and Johnson by the sides of the sledge, watching and
lending their aid when it was necessary, and Hatteras behind,
correcting the line of march.

They went along tolerably quickly; now that the temperature was so
low, the ice was hard and smooth for travel; the five dogs easily drew
the sledge, which weighed hardly more than nine hundred pounds. Still,
men and beasts panted heavily, and often they had to stop to take
breath.

Towards seven o'clock in the evening, the moon peered through mist on
the horizon. Its rays threw out a light which was reflected from the
ice; towards the northwest the ice-field looked like a perfectly
smooth plain; not a hummock was to be seen. This part of the sea
seemed to have frozen smooth like a lake.

It was an immense, monotonous desert.

Such was the impression that this spectacle made on the doctor's mind,
and he spoke of it to his companion.

"You are right, Doctor," answered Johnson; "it is a desert, but we
need not fear dying of thirst."

"A decided advantage," continued the doctor; "still, this immensity
proves one thing to me, and that is that we are far distant from any
land; in general, the proximity of land is indicated by a number of
icebergs, and not one is to be seen near us."

"We can't see very far for the fog," said Johnson.

"Without doubt; but since we started we have crossed a smooth field of
which we cannot see the end."

"Do you know, Doctor, it's a dangerous walk we are taking! We get used
to it and don't think of it, but we are walking over fathomless
depths."

"You are right, my friend, but we need not fear being swallowed; with
such cold as this the ice is very strong. Besides, it has a constant
tendency to get thicker, for snow falls nine days out of ten, even in
April, May, and June, and I fancy it must be something like thirty or
forty feet thick."

"That is a comfort," said Johnson.

"In fact, we are very much better off than those who skate on the
Serpentine, and who are in constant dread of falling through; we have
no such fear."

"Has the resistance of ice been calculated?" asked the old sailor, who
was always seeking information from the doctor.

"Yes," the latter answered: "everything almost that can be measured is
now known, except human ambition! and is it not that which is carrying
us towards the North Pole? But to return to your question, my answer
is this. Ice two inches thick will bear a man; three and a half inches
thick, a horse and rider; five inches thick, an eight-pound cannon;
eight inches, a fully harnessed artillery-piece; and ten inches, an
army, any number of men! Where we are now, the Liverpool Custom House
or the Halls of Parliament in London could be built."

"One can hardly imagine such strength," said Johnson; "but just now,
Doctor, you spoke of snow falling nine days out of ten; that is true,
but where does all the snow come from? The sea is all frozen, and I
don't see how the vapor can rise to form the clouds."

"A very keen observation, Johnson; but, in my opinion, the greatest
part of the snow or rain which we receive in the polar regions is
formed from the water of the seas in the temperate zones. One flake
arose into the air under the form of vapor from some river in Europe,
it helped make a cloud, and finally came here to be condensed; it is
not impossible that we who drink it may be quenching our thirst at the
rivers of our own country."

"That is true," answered Johnson.

At that moment Hatteras's voice was heard directing their steps and
interrupting their conversation. The fog was growing thicker, and
making a straight line hard to follow.

Finally the little band halted at about eight o'clock in the evening,
after walking nearly fifteen miles; the weather was dry; the tent was
raised, the fire lighted, supper cooked, and all rested peacefully.

Hatteras and his companions were really favored by the weather. The
following days brought no new difficulties, although the cold became
extremely severe and the mercury remained frozen in the thermometer.
If the wind had risen, no one could have withstood the temperature.
The doctor was able to corroborate Parry's observations, which he made
during his journey to Melville Island; he said that a man comfortably
dressed could walk safely in the open air exposed to great cold, if
the air were only calm; but as soon as the slightest wind arose, a
sharp pain was felt in the face, and an extreme headache which is soon
followed by death. The doctor was very anxious, for a slight wind
would have frozen the marrow in their bones.

March 5th he observed a phenomenon peculiar to these latitudes: the
sky was clear and thick with stars, and thick snow began to fall
without any cloud being visible; the constellations shone through the
flakes which fell regularly on the ice-field. This went on for about
two hours, and stopped before the doctor had found a satisfactory
explanation of its fall.

The last quarter of the moon had then disappeared; total darkness
reigned for seventeen hours out of the twenty-four; the travellers had
to tie themselves together by a long cord, to avoid being separated;
it was almost impossible for them to go in a straight line.

Still, these bold men, although animated by an iron will, began to
grow weary; their halts were more frequent, and yet they ought not to
lose an hour, for their supplies were rapidly diminishing. Hatteras
would often ascertain their position by observation of the moon and
stars. As he saw the days pass by and the destination appear as remote
as before, he would ask himself sometimes if the _Porpoise_ really
existed, whether the American's brain might not have been deranged by
his sufferings, or whether, through hate of the English, and seeing
himself without resources, he did not wish to drag them with him to
certain death.

He expressed his fears to the doctor, who discouraged them greatly,
but he readily understood the lamentable rivalry which existed between
the American and English captains.

"They are two men whom it will be hard to make agree," he said to
himself.

March 14th, after journeying for sixteen days, they had only reached
latitude 82°; their strength was exhausted, and they were still a
hundred miles from the ship; to add to their sufferings, they had to
bring the men down to a quarter-ration, in order to give the dogs
their full supply.

They could not depend on their shooting for food, for they had left
only seven charges of powder and six balls; they had in vain fired at
some white hares and foxes, which besides were very rare. None had
been hit.

Nevertheless, on the 18th, the doctor was fortunate enough to find a
seal lying on the ice; he wounded him with several balls; the animal,
not being able to escape through his hole in the ice, was soon slain.
He was of very good size. Johnson cut him up skilfully, but he was so
very thin that he was of but little use to the men, who could not make
up their minds to drink his oil, like the Esquimaux. Still the doctor
boldly tried to drink the slimy fluid, but he could not do it. He
preserved the skin of the animal, for no special reason, by a sort of
hunter's instinct, and placed it on the sledge.

[Illustration: "The doctor was fortunate enough to find a seal."]

The next day, the 16th, they saw a few icebergs on the horizon. Was it
a sign of a neighboring shore, or simply a disturbance of the ice? It
was hard to say.

When they had reached one of these hummocks, they dug in it with a
snow-knife a more comfortable retreat than that afforded by the tent,
and after three hours of exertion they were able to rest about their
glowing stove.




CHAPTER IV.
THE LAST CHARGE OF POWDER.


Johnson had admitted the tired dogs into the snow-house; when the snow
is falling heavily it serves as a covering to the animals, preserving
their natural heat. But in the open air, with a temperature of -40°,
they would soon have frozen to death.

Johnson, who made an excellent dog-driver, tried feeding the dogs with
the dark flesh of the seals which the travellers could not swallow,
and to his great surprise they made a rich feast out of it; the old
sailor in his delight told the doctor. He, however, was not in the
least surprised; he knew that in the north of America the horses make
fish their main article of food, and what a herbivorous horse could
content himself with would certainly satisfy an omnivorous dog.

Before going to rest, although sleep became an imperious necessity for
men who had walked fifteen miles on the ice, the doctor wished to have
a few serious words with his companions about the dangers of their
situation.

"We are only at latitude 82°," he said, "and our supplies are already
running short."

"A reason for losing no time," answered Hatteras; "we must push on;
the strong can draw the feeble."

"Shall we find a ship when we get there?" asked Bell, who was much
depressed by the fatigue of the journey.

"Why doubt it?" said Johnson; "the American's safety depends on ours."

To make sure, the doctor was anxious to question Altamont again. He
could speak easily, although his voice was weak; he confirmed all the
statements he had already made; he repeated that the ship was aground
on some granite rocks, where it could not stir, and that it lay in
longitude 120° 15', and latitude 83° 35'.

"We can't doubt this statement," resumed the doctor; "the difficulty
is not whether the _Porpoise_ is there, but the way of getting to
her."

"How much food have we left?" asked Hatteras.

"Enough for three days at the outside," answered the doctor.

"Well, we must get to her in three days," said the captain, firmly.

"We must indeed," continued the doctor, "and if we succeed we shall
have no need to complain, for we shall have been favored by faultless
weather; the snow has given us a fortnight's respite, and the sledge
has glided easily on the hardened ice! Ah, if it only carried two
hundred pounds of food! Our dogs could have managed it easily enough.
But still we can't help it!"

"With luck and skill," said Johnson, "we might put to some use the few
charges of powder which are left us. If we should kill a bear we
should be supplied for all the rest of the journey."

"Without doubt," answered the doctor, "but these animals are rare and
shy; and then, when one thinks of the importance of a shot, his hand
will shake and his aim be lost."

"But you are a good shot," answered Bell.

"Yes, when four men's dinners do not depend on my hitting; still, I
will do my best if I get a chance. Meanwhile let us try to satisfy
ourselves with this thin soup of scraps of pemmican, then go to sleep,
and to-morrow early we'll start forth again."

A few moments later excessive fatigue outweighed every other feeling,
and they all sank into a heavy sleep. Early on Saturday Johnson awoke
his companions; the dogs were harnessed to the sledge, and they took
up again their journey northward.

The heavens were magnificent, the air was very clear, the temperature
very low; when the sun appeared above the horizon it appeared like an
elongated ellipse; its horizontal diameter appeared, in consequence of
refraction, to be double its vertical diameter. It sent forth its
clear, cold rays over the vast icy plain. This return to light, if not
to heat, rejoiced them all.

[Illustration]

The doctor, gun in hand, walked off for a mile or two, braving the
cold and solitude; before going he measured the supply carefully; only
four charges of powder were left, and three balls; that was a small
supply when one remembers that a strong animal like the polar bear
often falls only after receiving ten or twelve shots. Hence the doctor
did not go in search of so fierce game; a few hares or two or three
foxes would have satisfied him and given him plenty of provisions. But
during that day, if he saw one, or could not approach one, or if he
were deceived by refraction, he would lose his shot; and this day, as
it was, cost him a charge of powder and a ball. His companions, who
trembled with hope at the report of his gun, saw him returning with
downcast looks; they did not say anything; that evening they went to
sleep as usual, after putting aside two quarter-rations reserved for
the two following days. The next day their journey seemed more
laborious; they hardly walked, they rather dragged along; the dogs had
eaten even the entrails of the seal, and they were beginning to gnaw
their harness.

A few foxes passed at some distance from the sledge, and the doctor,
having missed another shot as he chased them, did not dare to risk his
last ball and his last charge save one of powder.

That evening they halted early, unable to set one foot before the
other, and, although their way was lighted by a brilliant aurora, they
could not go on. This last meal, eaten Sunday evening under their icy
tent, was very melancholy. If Heaven did not come to their aid, they
were lost. Hatteras did not speak, Bell did not even think, Johnson
reflected in silence, but the doctor did not yet despair.

Johnson thought of setting some traps that night; but since he had no
bait, he had very little hope of success, and in the morning he found,
as he expected, that, although a great many foxes had left their marks
around, yet not one had been caught. He was returning much
disappointed, when he saw an enormous bear sniffing the air at about
thirty yards from the sledge. The old sailor thought Providence had
sent this animal to him to be slain; without awakening his companions
he seized the doctor's gun and made his way towards the bear.

Having got quite near he took aim, but just as he was about to pull
the trigger he felt his arm trembling; his large fur gloves were in
his way; he took them off quickly, and seized his gun with a firmer
hand. Suddenly, a cry of pain escaped him; the skin of his fingers,
burned by the cold of the gun-barrel, remained clinging to it, while
the gun fell to the ground, and went off from the shock, sending the
last ball off into space. At the sound of the report the doctor ran;
he understood everything at a glance; he saw the animal trot quickly
away; Johnson was in despair, and thought no more of the pain.

[Illustration]

"I'm as tender as a baby," he cried, "not to be able to endure that
pain! And an old man like me!"

"Come back, Johnson," the doctor said to him, "you'll get frozen; see,
your hands are white already; come back, come!"

"I don't deserve your attentions, Doctor," answered the boatswain;
"leave me!"

"Come along, you obstinate fellow! Come along! It will soon be too
late!"

And the doctor, dragging the old sailor under the tent, made him
plunge his hands into a bowl of water, which the heat of the stove had
kept liquid, although it was not much above the freezing-point; but
Johnson's hands had no sooner touched it than it froze at once.

"You see," said the doctor, "it was time to come back, otherwise I
should have had to amputate your hands."

Thanks to his cares, all danger was gone in an hour; but it was no
easy task, and constant friction was necessary to recall the
circulation into the old sailor's fingers. The doctor urged him to
keep his hands away from the stove, the heat of which might produce
serious results.

That morning they had to go without breakfast; of the pemmican and the
salt meat nothing was left. There was not a crumb of biscuit, and only
half a pound of coffee. They had to content themselves with drinking
this hot, and then they set out.

"There's nothing more!" said Bell to Johnson, in a despairing accent.

"Let us trust in God," said the old sailor; "he is able to preserve
us!"

"This Captain Hatteras!" continued Bell; "he was able to return from
his first expeditions, but he'll never get back from this one, and we
shall never see home again!"

"Courage, Bell! I confess that the captain is almost foolhardy, but
there is with him a very ingenious man."

"Dr. Clawbonny?" said Bell.

"Yes," answered Johnson.

"What can he do in such circumstances?" retorted Bell, shrugging his
shoulders. "Can he change these pieces of ice into pieces of meat? Is
he a god, who can work by miracles?"

"Who can say?" the boatswain answered his companion's doubts; "I trust
in him."

Bell shook his head, and fell into a silent apathy, in which he even
ceased to think.

That day they made hardly three miles; at evening they had nothing to
eat; the dogs threatened to devour one another; the men suffered
extremely from hunger. Not a single animal was to be seen. If there
had been one, of what use would it have been? They could not go
hunting with a knife. Only Johnson thought he recognized a mile to
leeward the large bear, who was following the ill-fated little party.

"It is spying us!" he said to himself; "it sees a certain prey in us!"

But Johnson said no word to his companions; that evening they made
their accustomed halt, and their supper consisted only of coffee. They
felt their eyes growing haggard, their brain growing confused, and,
tortured by hunger, they could not get an hour's sleep; strange and
painful dreams took possession of their minds.

At a latitude in which the body imperiously demands refreshment, these
poor men had not eaten solid food for thirty-six hours, when Tuesday
morning came. Nevertheless, inspired by superhuman energy, they
resumed their journey, pushing on the sledge which the dogs were
unable to draw. At the end of two hours they fell, exhausted. Hatteras
wanted to push on. He, still strong, besought his companions to rise,
but they were absolutely unable. Then, with Johnson's assistance, he
built a resting-place in an iceberg. It seemed as if they were digging
their own graves.

[Illustration: "At the end of two hours they fell, exhausted."]

"I am willing to die of hunger," said Hatteras, "but not of cold."

After much weariness the house was ready, and they all entered it.

[Illustration]

So that day passed. In that evening, while his companions lay inert,
Johnson had a sort of hallucination; he dreamed of an immense bear.
That word, which he kept repeating, attracted the doctor's attention,
so that he shook himself free from his stupor, and asked the old
sailor why he kept talking about a bear, and what bear he meant.

"The bear which is following us," answered Johnson.

"The bear which is following us?" repeated the doctor.

"Yes, the last two days."

"The last two days! Have you seen him?"

"Yes, he's a mile to leeward."

"And you didn't tell us, Johnson?"

"What was the use?"

"True," said the doctor; "we have no ball to fire at him."

"Not a slug, a bit of iron, nor a bolt!" said the old sailor.

The doctor was silent, and began to think intently. Soon he said to
the boatswain,--

"You are sure the bear is following us?"

"Yes, Doctor, he's lying in wait to eat us. He knows we can't escape
him!"

"Johnson!" said the doctor, touched by the despairing accent of his
companion.

"His food is sure," continued the poor man, who was beginning to be
delirious; "he must be half famished, and I don't see why we need keep
him waiting any longer!"

"Be quiet, Johnson!"

"No, Doctor; if we've got to come to it, why should we prolong the
animal's sufferings? He's hungry as we are; he has no seal to eat!
Heaven sends him us men; well, so much the better for him!"

Thereupon Johnson went out of his mind; he wanted to leave the
snow-house. The doctor had hard work to prevent him, and he only
succeeded by saying, as if he meant it,--

"To-morrow I shall kill that bear!"

"To-morrow!" said Johnson, as if he had awakened from a bad dream.

"Yes, to-morrow."

"You have no ball!"

"I shall make one."

"You have no lead!"

"No, but I have some quicksilver."

Thereupon the doctor took the thermometer; it marked +50°. He went
outside, placed the instrument on the ice, and soon returned. The
outside temperature was -50°. Then he said to the old sailor,--

"Now go to sleep, and wait till to-morrow."

That night they endured the horrors of hunger; only the doctor and the
boatswain were able to temper them with a little hope. The next
morning, at dawn, the doctor rushed out, followed by Johnson, and ran
to the thermometer; all the mercury had sunk into the bulb, in the
form of a compact cylinder. The doctor broke the instrument, and
seized in his gloved fingers a piece of very hard metal. It was a real
bullet.

"Ah, Doctor," shouted the old sailor, "that's a real miracle! You are
a wonderful man!"

"No, my friend," answered the doctor, "I am only a man with a good
memory, who has read a good deal."

"Why, what do you mean?"

"I happened to remember something Captain Ross related in the account
of his voyage: he said he shot through an inch plank with a bullet of
frozen mercury; if I had any oil it would amount to nearly the same
thing, for he speaks of a ball of sweet almond, which was fired
against a post and fell back to the ground unbroken."

"That is hardly credible!"

"But it is true, Johnson; this piece of metal may save our lives; let
us leave it here in the air before we take it, and go and see whether
the bear is still following us."

At that moment Hatteras came out of the hut; the doctor showed him the
bullet, and told him what he thought of doing; the captain pressed his
hand, and the three went off to inspect. The air was very clear.
Hatteras, who was ahead of his companions, discovered the bear about a
half-mile off. The animal, seated on his hind quarters, was busily
moving his head about, sniffing towards these new arrivals.

"There he is!" shouted the captain.

"Silence!" said the doctor.

But the huge beast did not stir when he saw the hunters. He gazed at
them without fear or anger. Still, it would be found hard to approach
him.

[Illustration]

"My friends," said Hatteras, "we have not come out for sport, but to
save our lives. Let us act cautiously."

"Yes," answered the doctor; "we can only have one shot, and we must
not miss; if he were to run away, he would be lost, for he can run
faster than a hare."

"Well, we must go straight for him," said Johnson; "it is dangerous,
but what does it matter? I am willing to risk my life."

"No, let me go!" cried the doctor.

"No, I shall go," answered Hatteras, quietly.

"But," said Johnson, "are not you of more use to the others than I
should be?"

"No, Johnson," answered the captain, "let me go; I shall run no
needless risk; perhaps, too, I shall call on you to help me."

"Hatteras," asked the doctor, "are you going to walk straight towards
the bear?"

"If I were sure of hitting him, I would do so, even at the risk of
having my head torn open, but he would flee at my approach. He is very
crafty; we must try to be even craftier."

"What do you intend to do?"

"To get within ten feet of him without his suspecting it."

"How are you going to do it?"

"By a simple but dangerous method. You kept, did you not, the skin of
the seal you shot?"

"Yes, it is on the sledge."

"Well, let us go back to the snow-house, while Johnson stays here on
watch."

The boatswain crept behind a hummock which hid him entirely from the
sight of the bear, who stayed in the same place, continually sniffing
the air.




CHAPTER V.
THE SEAL AND THE BEAR.


Hatteras and the doctor went back to the house.

"You know," said the captain, "that the polar bears chase seals, which
are their principal food. They watch for days at their
breathing-holes, and seize them the moment they come upon the ice. So
a bear will not be afraid of a seal; far from it."

"I understand your plan," said the doctor, "but it's dangerous."

"But there is a chance of success," answered the captain, "and we must
try it. I am going to put on the sealskin and crawl over the ice. Let
us lose no time. Load the gun and give it to me."

The doctor had nothing to say; he would himself have done what his
companion was about to try; he left the house, carrying two axes, one
for Johnson, the other for himself; then, accompanied by Hatteras, he
went to the sledge.

There Hatteras put on the sealskin, which very nearly covered him.
Meanwhile, Hatteras loaded the gun with the last charge of powder, and
dropped in it the quicksilver bullet, which was as hard as steel and
as heavy as lead. Then he handed Hatteras the gun, which he hid
beneath the sealskin. Then he said to the doctor,--

"You go and join Johnson; I shall wait a few moments to puzzle the
enemy."

"Courage, Hatteras!" said the doctor.

"Don't be uneasy, and above all don't show yourselves before you hear
my gun."

The doctor soon reached the hummock which concealed Johnson.

"Well?" the latter asked.

"Well, we must wait. Hatteras is doing all this to save us."

The doctor was agitated; he looked at the bear, which had grown
excited, as if he had become conscious of the danger which threatened
him. A quarter of an hour later the seal was crawling over the ice; he
made a circuit of a quarter of a mile to baffle the bear; then he
found himself within three hundred feet of him. The bear then saw him,
and settled down as if he were trying to hide. Hatteras imitated
skilfully the movements of a seal, and if he had not known, the doctor
would certainly have taken him for one.

"That's true!" whispered Johnson.

The seal, as he approached the bear, did not appear to see him; he
seemed to be seeking some hole through which to reach the water. The
bear advanced towards him over the ice with the utmost caution; his
eager eyes betrayed his excitement; for one or perhaps two months he
had been fasting, and fortune was now throwing a sure prey before him.
The seal had come within ten feet of his enemy; the bear hastened
towards him, made a long leap, and stood stupefied three paces from
Hatteras, who, casting aside the sealskin, with one knee resting on
the ground, was aiming at the bear's heart.

The report was sounded, and the bear rolled over on the ice.

"Forward!" shouted the doctor. And, followed by Johnson, he hastened
to the scene of combat. The huge beast rose, and beat the air with one
paw while with the other he tore up a handful of snow to stanch the
wound. Hatteras did not stir, but waited, knife in hand. But his aim
had been accurate, and his bullet had hit its mark; before the arrival
of his friends he had plunged his knife into the beast's throat, and
it fell, never to rise.

[Illustration: "He plunged his knife into the beast's throat."]

"Victory!" shouted Johnson.

"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!" cried the doctor.

Hatteras, with folded arms, was gazing calmly at the corpse of his
foe.

"It's now my turn," said Johnson; "it's very well to have killed it,
but there is no need of waiting till it's frozen as hard as a stone,
when teeth and knife will be useless for attacking it."

Johnson began by skinning the bear, which was nearly as large as an
ox; it was nine feet long and six feet in circumference; two huge
tusks, three inches long, issued from his mouth. On opening him,
nothing was found in his stomach but water; the bear had evidently
eaten nothing for a long time; nevertheless, he was very fat, and he
weighed more than fifteen hundred pounds; he was divided into four
quarters, each one of which gave two hundred pounds of meat, and the
hunters carried this flesh back to the snow-house, without forgetting
the animal's heart, which went on beating for three hours.

The others wanted to eat the meat raw, but the doctor bade them wait
until it should be roasted. On entering the house he was struck by the
great cold within it; he went up to the stove and found the fire out;
the occupations as well as the excitement of the morning had made
Johnson forget his customary duty. The doctor tried to rekindle the
fire, but there was not even a spark lingering amid the cold ashes.

"Well, we must have patience!" he said to himself. He then went to the
sledge to get some tinder, and asked Johnson for his steel, telling
him that the fire had gone out. Johnson answered that it was his
fault, and he put his hand in his pocket, where he usually kept it; he
was surprised not to find it there. He felt in his other pockets with
the same success; he went into the snow-house and examined carefully
the covering under which he had slept in the previous night, but he
could not find it.

"Well?" shouted the doctor.

Johnson came back, and stared at his companions.

"And haven't you got the steel, Dr. Clawbonny?" he asked.

"No, Johnson."

"Nor you, Captain?"

"No," answered Hatteras.

"You have always carried it," said the doctor.

"Well, I haven't got it now--" murmured the old sailor, growing pale.

"Not got it!" shouted the doctor, who could not help trembling. There
was no other steel, and the loss of this might bring with it terrible
consequences.

"Hunt again!" said the doctor.

Johnson ran to the piece of ice behind which he had watched the bear,
then to the place of combat, where he had cut him up; but he could not
find anything. He returned in despair. Hatteras looked at him without
a word of reproach.

"This is serious," he said to the doctor.

"Yes," the latter answered.

"We have not even an instrument, a glass from which we might take the
lens to get fire by means of it!"

"I know it," answered the doctor; "and that is a great pity, because
the rays of the sun are strong enough to kindle tinder."

"Well," answered Hatteras, "we must satisfy our hunger with this raw
meat; then we shall resume our march and we shall try to reach the
ship."

"Yes," said the doctor, buried in reflection; "yes, we could do that
if we had to. Why not? We might try--"

"What are you thinking of?" asked Hatteras.

"An idea which has just occurred to me--"

"An idea," said Johnson; "one of your ideas! Then we are saved!"

"It's a question," answered the doctor, "whether it will succeed."

"What is your plan?" said Hatteras.

"We have no lens; well, we will make one."

"How?" asked Johnson.

"With a piece of ice which we shall cut out."

"Why, do you think--"

"Why not? We want to make the sun's rays converge to a common focus,
and ice will do as much good as crystal."

"Is it possible?" asked Johnson.

"Yes, only I should prefer fresh to salt water; it is more
transparent, and harder."

"But, if I am not mistaken," said Johnson, pointing to a hummock a
hundred paces distant, "that dark green block shows--"

"You are right; come, my friends; bring your hatchet, Johnson."

The three men went towards the block which, as they supposed, was
formed of fresh water.

The doctor had a piece, a foot in diameter, cut through, and he began
to smooth it with the hatchet; then he equalized the surface still
further with his knife; then he polished it with his hand, and he
obtained soon a lens as transparent as if it had been made of the most
magnificent crystal. Then he returned to the snow-house, where he took
a piece of tinder and began his experiment. The sun was shining
brightly; the doctor held the lens so that the rays should be focused
on the tinder, which took fire in a few seconds.

[Illustration]

"Hurrah! hurrah!" cried Johnson, who could hardly trust his eyes. "O
Doctor, Doctor!"

The old sailor could not restrain his joy; he was coming and going
like a madman. The doctor had returned to the house; a few minutes
later the stove was roaring, and soon a delicious odor of cooking
aroused Bell from his torpor. It may be easily imagined how the feast
was enjoyed; still the doctor advised his friends to partake in
moderation; he set an example, and while eating he again began to
talk.

"To-day is a lucky day," he said; "we have food enough for our
journey. But we mustn't fall asleep in the delights of Capua, and we'd
better start out again."

"We can't be more than forty-eight hours from the _Porpoise_," said
Altamont, who could now begin to speak once more.

"I hope," said the doctor, smiling, "that we shall find material for a
fire there."

"Yes," said the American.

"For, if my ice lens is good," continued the doctor, "there would
still be something desired on cloudy days, and there are many of them
less than four degrees from the Pole."

"True!" said Altamont with a sigh, "less than four degrees! My ship
has gone nearer than any yet has been!"

"Forward!" said Hatteras, quickly.

"Forward!" repeated the doctor, gazing uneasily at the two captains.

The strength of the travellers soon returned; the dogs had eaten
freely of the bear's flesh, and they continued their journey
northward. During their walk the doctor tried to draw from Altamont
the object of his expedition, but the American gave only evasive
answers.

"There are two men to be watched," he whispered to the boatswain.

"Yes," answered Johnson.

"Hatteras never says a word to the American, and the American seems to
show very little gratitude. Fortunately I am here."

"Dr. Clawbonny," answered Johnson, "since this Yankee has returned to
life, I don't like his face much."

"Either I'm mistaken," answered the doctor, "or he suspects Hatteras's
plans."

"Do you think that the stranger has the same plans?"

"Who can tell? The Americans are bold; an American may well try what
an Englishman tries!"

"You think that Altamont--"

"I don't think anything about it," answered the doctor; "but the
situation of this ship on the way to the Pole gives one material for
thought."

"But Altamont said he had drifted there."

"He said so! Yes, but he was smiling in a very strange way."

"The devil, Dr. Clawbonny; it would be unfortunate if there should be
any rivalry between two such men."

"Heaven grant that I may be mistaken, Johnson, for this misfortune
might produce serious complications, if not some catastrophe."

"I hope Altamont will not forget that we saved his life."

"But isn't he going to save us? I confess that without us he would not
be alive; but what would become of us without him, without his ship,
without its resources?"

"Well, Doctor, you are here, and I hope with your aid all will go
well."

"I hope so, Johnson."

The voyage went on without incident; there was no lack of bear's
flesh, and they made copious meals of it; there was a certain
good-humor in the little band, thanks to the jests of the doctor and
his pleasant philosophy; this worthy man always had some scrap of
information to give to his companions. His health continued good; he
had not grown very thin, in spite of his fatigues and privations; his
friends at Liverpool would have recognized him without difficulty;
especially would they have recognized his unaltered good-humor.

[Illustration]

During the morning of Saturday the appearance of the plain of ice
changed materially; the perturbed fragments, the frequent packs, the
hummocks, showed that the ice-field was enduring some severe pressure;
evidently some unknown continent, some new island, might have caused
this by narrowing the passes. Blocks of fresh water, more frequent and
larger, indicated the coast to be near. Hence, there was near them a
new land, and the doctor yearned with a desire to add to the charts of
the northern regions. Great is the pleasure of ascertaining the line
of these unknown coasts, and of tracing it with a pencil; that was the
doctor's aim, while that of Hatteras was merely to place his foot upon
the Pole, and he took pleasure in advance in thinking of the names he
was going to give to the seas, straits, bays, and slightest
promontories in these new continents; certainly he would not forget
the names of his companions, his friends, nor her Gracious Majesty,
nor the royal family; and he foresaw a certain "Cape Clawbonny" with
great satisfaction.

These thoughts kept him busy all day; that evening they encamped as
usual, and each one took his turn at watching near these unknown
lands. The next day, Sunday, after a heavy breakfast of bear's paws,
which were very good, the travellers pushed on to the north, inclining
a little to the west; the road grew difficult, but yet they advanced
rapidly. Altamont, from the top of the sledge, scanned the horizon
with feverish attention; his companions were the victims of
involuntary uneasiness. The last solar observations gave them latitude
83° 35', and longitude 120° 15'; that was the place where the American
ship was said to be lying; the question of life and death was to be
solved that day. At last, at about half past two in the afternoon,
Altamont stood straight, stopped the little band by a loud cry, and,
pointing with his hand to a white mass, which all the rest had taken
for an iceberg, he cried with a loud voice,--

"The _Porpoise_!"




CHAPTER VI.
THE PORPOISE.


March 24th was Palm Sunday,--that day when the streets of the towns
and villages of Europe are filled with flowers and leaves; bells are
ringing, and the air is filled with rich perfumes. But here, in this
desolate country, what sadness and silence! The wind was keen and
bitter; not a leaf of foliage was to be seen! But still, this Sunday
was a day of rejoicing for our travellers, for at last they were about
to find supplies which would save them from certain death. They
hastened their steps; the dogs drew the sledge briskly, Duke barked
joyously, and they all soon reached the American ship. The _Porpoise_
was wholly buried beneath the snow; there was no sign of mast, yard,
or rigging; all had been lost at the time of the shipwreck; the ship
lay on a bed of rocks now completely hidden. The _Porpoise_ was
careened to one side by the violence of the shock, her bottom was torn
open, so that the ship seemed uninhabitable. This was soon seen by the
captain, the doctor, and Johnson, after they had entered the vessel;
they had to cut away fifteen feet of ice to get to the hatchway; but
to their great joy they saw that the animals, many traces of which
were to be seen, had spared the supplies.

"If we have here," said Johnson, "plenty of food and fuel, this hull
does not seem inhabitable."

"Well, we must build a snow-house," answered Hatteras, "and make
ourselves as comfortable as possible on the mainland."

"Without doubt," continued the doctor; "but don't let us hurry; let us
do things carefully; if need be we can fit out some quarters in the
ship; meanwhile we can build a strong house, capable of protecting us
against the cold and wild beasts. I am willing to be the architect,
and you'll see what I can do."

"I don't doubt your skill, Doctor," answered Johnson; "we'll make
ourselves as comfortable as possible here, and we'll make an inventory
of all that the ship contains; unfortunately, I don't see any launch,
or boat, and these ruins are in too bad a state to permit of our
making a small boat."

"Who can say?" answered the doctor. "With time and thought a great
deal can be done; now we have not to trouble ourselves about
navigation, but about a house to live in; I propose not to form any
other plans, and to let everything have its turn."

"That is wise," answered Hatteras; "let us begin with the beginning."

The three companions left the ship, returned to the sledge, and
announced their determination to Bell and the American; Bell said he
was ready to work; the American shook his head, on learning that
nothing could be done with his ship; but since all discussion would
have been idle, they determined at first to take refuge in the
_Porpoise_, and to build a large building on the shore.

At four o'clock in the afternoon the five travellers were installed as
comfortably as possible between decks; by means of spars and fragments
of masts, Bell had made a nearly level floor; there they placed
coverings stiffened by the frost, which the heat of the stove soon
brought back to their natural state; Altamont, leaning on the doctor,
was able to make his way to the corner which had been set aside for
him; on setting foot on his ship, he had sighed with a feeling of
relief, which did not encourage the boatswain.

"He feels at home," the old sailor thought, "and one would say that he
had invited us here."

The rest of the day was devoted to repose; the weather threatened to
change under the influence of the westerly winds; the thermometer
outside stood at -26°. In fact, the _Porpoise_ lay beyond the pole of
cold, at a latitude relatively less severe, though farther to the
north. On that day they finished the bear, with some biscuits they
found on the ship, and a few cups of tea; then fatigue overcame them,
and each one sank into a sound sleep.

The next morning they all awoke rather late; they soon recalled the
difference in their situation; they were no longer perplexed with
uncertainty about the morrow; they only thought of establishing
themselves comfortably. These castaways looked at themselves as
colonists who had reached their destination, and, forgetting the
sufferings of their long march, they had no other thought than that of
securing a comfortable future.

[Illustration: "These castaways looked at themselves as colonists who
had reached their destination."]

"Well," said the doctor, stretching his arms, "it's something not to
have to wonder where one will sleep to-night and what one will have to
eat to-morrow."

"Let us first make an inventory of the ship," answered Johnson.

The _Porpoise_ had been carefully equipped for a long voyage.

The inventory, when complete, indicated the following supplies:--

  6,150 lbs. of flour, fat and raisins for puddings;
  2,000  "   "  beef and salt pork;
  1,500  "   "  pemmican;
    700  "   "  sugar;
    700  "   "  chocolate;
    500  "   "  rice;
      1½ chests of tea, weighing 87 lbs;
many barrels of canned fruits and vegetables, lime-juice in abundance,
cochlearia, sorrel and water-cresses, and three hundred gallons of rum
and brandy; in the hold there was a large supply of ammunition; there
was plenty of coal and wood. The doctor collected carefully the
nautical instruments, and he also found a Bunsen's Pile, which had
been carried for electrical tests and experiments. In short, they had
supplies enough to keep five men on whole rations for two years; all
fear of starving or freezing to death was hence wholly removed.

"Our means of living are certain," said the doctor to the captain,
"and there is nothing to prevent our reaching the Pole."

"The Pole!" answered Hatteras, trembling with excitement.

"Certainly," continued the doctor; "what's to prevent our pushing on
during the summer across the land?"

"Across the land! true! But how about the sea?"

"Can't we build a small boat out of the timber of the _Porpoise_?"

"An American boat, you mean," answered Hatteras, scornfully, "and
commanded by this American!"

The doctor understood the captain's repugnance, and judged it best to
change the conversation.

"Now that we know what our supplies are," he went on, "we must build
some safe place for them, and a house for ourselves. We have plenty of
material, and we can settle ourselves very comfortably. I hope, Bell,"
he added, turning to the carpenter, "that you are going to distinguish
yourself; I may be able to help you too, I trust."

"I'm ready, Doctor," answered Bell; "if it were necessary I could
easily build a whole city with houses and streets out of these blocks
of ice--"

"We sha'n't need as much as that; let us follow the example of the
agents of the Hudson's Bay Company; they build forts which protect
them from the wild beasts and the Indians; that is all we need; let us
make it no larger than necessary; on one side the dwelling, on the
other the stores, with a sort of curtain, and two bastions. I'll try
to rub up what I know about fortification."

"Upon my word, Doctor," said Johnson, "I don't doubt that we shall
make something very fine under your direction."

"Well, my friends, we must first choose a site; a good engineer should
first study the lay of the land. Will you come with me, Hatteras?"

"I shall trust to you, Doctor," answered the captain. "You see about
that, while I explore the coast."

Altamont, who was still too feeble to get to work, was left on board
of his ship, and the two Englishmen set foot on the mainland. The
weather was thick and stormy; at noon the thermometer stood at -11°,
but, there being no wind, that temperature was comfortable. Judging
from the outline of the shore, a large sea, at that time wholly
frozen, stretched out farther than eye could reach in the west; on the
east it was limited by a rounded coast, cut into by numerous
estuaries, and rising suddenly about two hundred yards from the shore;
it formed a large bay, full of dangerous rocks, on which the
_Porpoise_ had been wrecked; far off on the land rose a mountain,
which the doctor conjectured to be about three thousand feet high.
Towards the north a promontory ran into the sea, after hiding a part
of the bay. An island of moderate size rose from the field of ice,
three miles from the mainland, so that it offered a safe anchorage to
any ship that could enter the bay. In a hollow cut of the shore was a
little inlet, easily reached by ships, if this part of the arctic seas
was ever open. Yet, according to the accounts of Beecher and Penny,
this whole sea was open in the summer months.

In the middle of the coast the doctor noticed a sort of plateau about
two hundred feet in diameter; on three sides it was open to the bay;
the fourth was enclosed by an elevation about a hundred and twenty
feet high; this could be ascended only by steps cut in the ice. This
seemed a proper place for a solid building, and it could be easily
fortified; nature had adapted it for the purpose; it was only
necessary to make use of the place. The doctor, Bell, and Johnson
reached this place by means of steps cut in the ice. As soon as the
doctor saw the excellence of the place, he determined to dig away the
ten feet of hardened snow which covered it; the buildings had to be
built on a solid foundation.

During Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, work went on without
relaxation; at last the ground appeared; it consisted of a hard, dense
granite, with the angles as sharp as glass; it contained, moreover,
garnets and large crystals of feldspar, against which the pickaxe
struck fire.

[Illustration]

The doctor then gave them the dimensions and plan of the snow-house;
it was to be forty feet long, twenty broad, and ten deep; it was
divided into three rooms, a sitting-room, a bedroom, and a kitchen;
more was not needed. To the left was the kitchen, to the right the
bedroom, in the middle the sitting-room. For five days they worked
busily. There was no lack of material; the ice walls were thick enough
to resist thawing, for they could not risk being wholly without
protection, even in summer. In proportion as the house rose, it became
agreeable to see; there were four front windows, two in the
sitting-room, one in the kitchen, another in the bedroom; for panes of
glass they substituted large sheets of ice, in the Esquimaux fashion,
which served as well as unpolished glass for the passage of light. In
front of the sitting-room, between two windows, there ran a long entry
like a tunnel, which gave admission to the house; a solid door,
brought from the _Porpoise_, closed it hermetically. When the house
was finished, the doctor was delighted with his handiwork; it would
have been impossible to say to what school of architecture the
building belonged, although the architect would have avowed his
preferences for the Saxon Gothic, so common in England; but the main
point was, that it should be solid; therefore the doctor placed on the
front short uprights; on top a sloping roof rested against the granite
wall. This served to support the stove-pipes, which carried the smoke
away. When the task was completed, they began to arrange the interior.
They carried into the bedroom the sleeping-accommodations from the
_Porpoise_; they were arranged in a circle about a large stove.
Benches, chairs, sofas, tables, wardrobes, were arranged in the
sitting-room, which was also used as a dining-room; the kitchen
received the cooking-stoves of the ship, and the various utensils.
Sails, stretched on the floor, formed the carpet, and also served as
hangings to the inner doors, which had no other way of closing. The
walls of the house averaged five feet in thickness, and the recesses
for the windows looked like embrasures in a fort. It was all built
with great solidity; what more was to be desired? Ah, if they had
listened to the doctor, there is no knowing what they would not have
made of this ice and snow, which can be so easily manipulated! He all
day long would ponder over plans which he never hoped to bring about,
but he thereby lightened the dull work of all by the ingenuity of his
suggestions. Besides, he had come across, in his wide reading, a
rather rare book by one Kraft, entitled "Detailed Description of the
Snow-Palace built at St. Petersburg, in January, 1740, and of all the
Objects it contained." The recollection of this book impressed him.
One evening he gave his companions a full account of the wonders of
that snow-palace.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

"Why couldn't we do here," he asked, "what they did at St. Petersburg?
What do we need? Nothing, not even imagination!"

"So it was very handsome?" said Johnson.

"It was fairy-like, my friend. The house, built by order of the
Empress Anna, and in which she had celebrated the marriage of one of
her buffoons in 1740, was nearly as large as ours; but in front stood
six cannons of ice; they were often fired without bursting; there were
also mortars to hold sixty-pound shells; so we could have some
formidable artillery; the bronze is handy, and falls even from heaven.
But the triumph of taste and art was on the front of the palace, which
was adorned with handsome statues; the steps were garnished with vases
of flowers of the same material; on the right stood an enormous
elephant, who played water through his trunk by day, and burning
naphtha by night. What a menagerie we might have if we only wanted
to!"

"As for animals," answered Johnson, "we sha'n't lack them, I fancy,
and they won't be any the less interesting for not being made of ice."

"Well," said the doctor, "we shall be able to defend ourselves against
their attacks; but to return to the palace, I should add that inside
there were mirrors, candelabra, beds, mattresses, pillows, curtains,
clocks, chairs, playing-cards, wardrobes well furnished, and all cut
out of ice; in fact, nothing was lacking."

"It was then a true palace?" said Bell.

"A splendid palace, worthy of a sovereign! Ice! It was kind of
Providence to invent it, since it lends itself to so many miracles and
accommodates so readily to the needs of castaways!"

It took them until March 31st to get the house ready; this was Easter
Sunday, and the day was set aside for rest; the whole day was spent in
the sitting-room, where divine service was read, and each was able to
judge of the excellent arrangements of the snow-house.

The next morning they set about building stores and a magazine; this
took them about a week, including the time employed for emptying the
_Porpoise_, which was not done without difficulty, for the low
temperature did not permit them to work very long. At last, April 8th,
provisions, food, and supplies were safely sheltered on land; the
stores were placed to the north, and the powder-house to the south,
about sixty feet from the end of the house; a sort of dog-kennel was
built near the stores; it was destined for the Greenland dogs, and the
doctor honored it with the title of "Dog-Palace." Duke partook of the
common quarters.

Then the doctor passed to the means of defence of the place. Under his
direction the plateau was surrounded by a real fortification of ice
which secured it against every invasion; its height made a natural
protection, and as there was no salient, it was equally strong on all
sides. The doctor's system of defence recalled strongly the method of
Sterne's Uncle Toby, whose gentleness and good-humor he also shared.
He was a pleasant sight when he was calculating the inclination of the
platform and the breadth of the causeway; but this task was so easy
with the snow, that he enjoyed it, and he was able to make the wall
seven feet thick; besides the plateau overlooking the bay, he had to
build neither counterscarp nor glacis; the parapet of snow, after
following the outlines of the plateau, joined the rock on the other
side. The work of fortification was finished April 15th. The fort was
completed, and the doctor seemed very proud of his work.

[Illustration: The fort was completed.]

In truth, this fortified enclosure could have withstood for a long
time against a tribe of Esquimaux, if such enemies were met under that
latitude; but there was no trace of human beings there; Hatteras, in
making out the outline of the bay, did not see any ruins of the huts
which are so commonly found in the places resorted to by Greenland
tribes; the castaways of the _Forward_ and the _Porpoise_ appeared to
be the first ever to set foot on this unknown shore. But if they need
not fear men, animals were to be dreaded, and the fort, thus defended,
would have to protect the little garrison against their attacks.




CHAPTER VII.
A DISCUSSION ABOUT CHARTS.


During these preparations for going into winter-quarters, Altamont had
entirely recovered his health and strength; he was even able to aid in
unloading the ship. His vigorous constitution at last carried the day,
and his pallor soon gave way before the vigor of his blood.

[Illustration]

They saw in him a sanguine, robust citizen of the United States, an
intelligent, energetic man with a resolute character, a bold, hardy
American ready for everything; he was originally from New York, and
had been a sailor from infancy, as he told his companions; his ship,
the _Porpoise_, had been equipped and sent out by a society of wealthy
American merchants, at the head of whom was the famous Mr. Grinnell.

There was a certain similarity between his disposition and that of
Hatteras, but their sympathies were different. This similarity did not
incline them to become friends; indeed, it had the opposite effect. A
close observer would have detected serious discordances between them;
and this, although they were very frank with one another. Altamont was
less so, however, than Hatteras; with greater ease of manner, he was
less loyal; his open character did not inspire as much confidence as
did the captain's gloomy temperament. Hatteras would say what he had
to say, and then he held his peace. The other would talk a great deal,
but say very little. Such was the doctor's reading of the American's
character, and he was right in his presentiment of a future
disagreement, if not hatred, between the captains of the _Porpoise_
and the _Forward_.

[Illustration]

And yet only one could command. To be sure, Hatteras had all the right
of commanding, by virtue of anterior right and superior force. But if
one was at the head of his own men, the other was on board of his own
ship. And that was generally felt. Either from policy or
instinctively, Altamont was at first attracted towards the doctor; it
was to him he owed his life, but it was sympathy rather than gratitude
which moved him. This was the invariable effect of Clawbonny's nature;
friends grew about him like wheat under the summer sun. Every one has
heard of people who rise at five o'clock in the morning to make
enemies; the doctor could have got up at four without doing it.
Nevertheless, he resolved to profit by Altamont's friendship to the
extent of learning the real reason of his presence in the polar seas.
But with all his wordiness the American answered without answering,
and kept repeating what he had to say about the Northwest Passage. The
doctor suspected that there was some other motive for the expedition,
the same, namely, that Hatteras suspected. Hence he resolved not to
let the two adversaries discuss the subject; but he did not always
succeed. The simplest conversations threatened to wander to that
point, and any word might kindle a blaze of controversy. It happened
soon. When the house was finished, the doctor resolved to celebrate
the fact by a splendid feast; this was a good idea of Clawbonny's, who
wanted to introduce in this continent the habits and pleasures of
European life. Bell had just shot some ptarmigans and a white rabbit,
the first harbinger of spring. This feast took place April 14, Low
Sunday, on a very pleasant day; the cold could not enter the house,
and if it had, the roaring stoves would have soon conquered it. The
dinner was good; the fresh meat made an agreeable variety after the
pemmican and salt meat; a wonderful pudding, made by the doctor's own
hand, was much admired; every one asked for another supply; the head
cook himself, with an apron about his waist and a knife hanging by his
side, would not have disgraced the kitchen of the Lord High Chancellor
of England. At dessert, liquors appeared; the American was not a
teetotaler; hence there was no reason for his depriving himself of a
glass of gin or brandy; the other guests, who were never in any way
intemperate, could permit themselves this infraction of their rule;
so, by the doctor's command, each one was able to drain a glass at the
end of the merry meal. When a toast was drunk to the United States,
Hatteras was simply silent. It was then that the doctor brought
forward an interesting subject.

"My friends," he said, "it is not enough that we have crossed the
waters and ice and have come so far; there is one thing left for us to
do. Hence I propose that we should give names to this hospitable land
where we have found safety and rest; that is the course pursued by all
navigators, and there is not one who has neglected it; therefore we
ought to carry back with us not only a map of the shores, but also the
names of the capes, bays, points, and promontories which we find. That
is absolutely necessary."

"Good!" cried Johnson; "besides, when one can give all these lands
their own names, it looks like genuine work, and we can't consider
ourselves as cast away on an unknown shore."

"Besides," added Bell, "that simplifies instructions and facilitates
the execution of orders; we may be compelled to separate during some
expedition or in hunting, and the best way for finding our way back is
to know the names of the places."

"Well," said the doctor, "since we are all agreed, let us try to
settle on some names without forgetting our country and friends."

"You are right, Doctor," answered the American, "and you give what you
say additional value by your warmth."

"Well," continued the doctor, "let us go on in order."

Hatteras had not taken part in the conversation; he was thinking.
Still the eyes of his companions were fastened on him; he rose and
said,--

"If you are all willing, and I don't think any one will dissent,"--at
those words Hatteras looked at Altamont,--"it seems to me proper to
name this house after its skilful architect, and to call it 'Doctor's
House.'"

"That's true," said Bell.

"Good!" shouted Johnson; "Doctor's House!"

"Couldn't be better," added Altamont. "Hurrah for Dr. Clawbonny!"

Three cheers were then given, to which Duke added an approving bark.

"So," resumed Hatteras, "let this house bear that name until some new
land is discovered to bear the name of our friend."

"Ah!" said Johnson, "if the earthly Paradise were to be named over
again, the name of Clawbonny would suit it to a miracle!"

The doctor, much moved, wanted to defend himself by modesty, but he
was unable. It was then formally agreed that the feast had been eaten
in the grand dining-hall of Doctor's House, after being cooked in the
kitchen of Doctor's House, and that they would go comfortably to bed
in the chamber of Doctor's House.

"Now," said the doctor, "let us take the more important points of our
discoveries."

"There is," said Hatteras, "this immense sea which surrounds us, and
in which no ship has ever floated."

"No ship!" interrupted Altamont; "it seems to me the _Porpoise_ should
not be forgotten, unless indeed it came by land," he added jestingly.

"One might think it had," retorted Hatteras, "to see the rocks on
which it is now resting."

"Indeed, Hatteras," answered Altamont with some vexation; "but, on the
whole, isn't even that better than blowing up as the _Forward_ did!"

Hatteras was about to make some angry reply, when the doctor
interrupted him.

"My friends," he said, "we are not talking about ships, but about the
new sea--"

"It is not new," interrupted Altamont. "It already bears a name on all
the charts of the Pole. It is the Arctic Ocean, and I don't see any
reason for changing its name; if we should find out in the future that
it is only a sound or gulf, we can see what is to be done."

"Very well," said Hatteras.

"Agreed," said the doctor, regretting that he had aroused a discussion
between rival nationalities.

"Let us come to the land which we are now in," resumed Hatteras. "I am
not aware that it bears any name on the most recent maps."

[Illustration: "I am not aware that it bears any name on the most
recent maps."]

At these words he turned to Altamont, who did not lower his eyes, but
answered,--

"You may be mistaken again, Hatteras."

"Mistaken! this unknown land, this new country--"

"Has a name already," answered the American, quietly.

Hatteras was silent. His lips trembled.

"And what is its name?" asked the doctor, a little surprised at the
American's statement.

"My dear Clawbonny," answered Altamont, "it is the custom, not to say
the habit, of every explorer to give a name to the continent which he
has discovered. It seems to me that on this occasion it was in my
power and that it was my duty to use this indisputable right--"

"Still--" said Johnson, whom Altamont's coolness annoyed.

"It seems to me hard to pretend," the American resumed, "that the
_Porpoise_ did not discover this coast, and even on the supposition
that it came by land," he added, glancing at Hatteras, "there can't be
any question."

"That is a claim I can't admit," answered Hatteras, gravely, forcibly
restraining himself. "To give a name, one should be the discoverer,
and that I fancy you were not. Without us, besides, where would you
be, sir, you who presume to impose conditions upon us? Twenty feet
under the snow!"

"And without me, sir," replied the American, "without my ship, where
would you be at this moment? Dead of cold and hunger?"

"My friends," said the doctor, intervening for the best, "come, a
little calm, it can all settle itself. Listen to me!"

"That gentleman," continued Altamont, pointing to the captain, "can
give a name to all the lands he discovers, if he discovers any; but
this continent belongs to me! I cannot admit of its bearing two names,
like Grinnell Land and Prince Albert's Land, because an Englishman and
American happened to find it at the same time. Here it's different. My
rights of precedence are beyond dispute! No ship has ever touched this
shore before mine. No human being before me has ever set foot upon it;
now, I have given it its name, and it shall keep it."

"And what is its name?" asked the doctor.

"New America," answered Altamont.

Hatteras clinched his fists on the table. But with a violent effort he
controlled himself.

"Can you prove to me," Altamont went on, "that any Englishman has ever
set foot on this soil before me?"

Johnson and Bell were silent, although they were no less angry than
the captain at the haughty coolness of their opponent. But there was
nothing to be said. The doctor began again after a few moments of
painful silence.

"My friends," he said, "the first law of humanity is justice; it
embraces all the rest. Let us then be just, and not give way to evil
feelings. Altamont's priority appears to me incontestable. There is no
question about it; we shall have our revenge later, and England will
have a good share in future discoveries. Let us leave to this land,
then, the name of New America. But Altamont, in giving it this name,
has not, I imagine, disposed of the bays, capes, points, and
promontories which it encloses, and I don't see anything to prevent
our calling it Victoria Bay."

"None at all," answered Altamont, "provided that the cape jutting into
the sea over there is named Cape Washington."

"You might have chosen, sir," cried Hatteras, beside himself, "a name
less offensive to an English ear."

"But none dearer to an American ear," answered Altamont, with much
pride.

"Come, come," continued the doctor, who found it hard to keep the
peace in this little world, "no discussion about that! Let an American
be proud of his great men! Let us honor genius wherever it is found,
and since Altamont has made his choice, let us now speak for ourselves
and our friends. Let our captain--"

"Doctor," answered Hatteras, "since this is an American land, I don't
care to have my name figure here."

"Is that opinion unchangeable?" asked the doctor.

"It is," answered Hatteras.

The doctor did not insist any further.

"Well, then, it's our turn," he said, addressing the old sailor and
the carpenter; "let us leave a trace of our passage here. I propose
that we call that island about three miles from here Johnson Island,
in honor of our boatswain."

"O," said the latter, a little embarrassed, "O doctor!"

"As to the mountain which we have seen in the west, we shall call it
Bell Mountain, if our carpenter is willing."

"It's too much honor for me," answered Bell.

"It's only fair," said the doctor.

"Nothing better," said Altamont.

"Then we have only to name our fort," resumed the doctor; "there need
be no discussion about that; it's neither to Her Royal Highness Queen
Victoria nor to Washington that we owe our protection in it at this
moment, but to God, who brought us together and saved us all. Let it
be called Fort Providence!"

"A capital plan!" answered Altamont.

"Fort Providence," added Johnson, "that sounds well! So, then, in
returning from our excursions in the north, we shall start from Cape
Washington to reach Victoria Bay, and from there to Fort Providence,
where we shall find rest and plenty in Doctor's House."

"Then that's settled," answered the doctor; "later, as we make
discoveries, we shall have other names to give, which I hope will not
give rise to discussion; for, my friends, we ought to stand by one
another and love one another; we represent humanity on this distant
shore; let us not give ourselves up to the detestable passions which
infest society; let us rather remain unattackable by adversity. Who
can say what dangers Heaven has in store for us, what sufferings we
may not have to support before we return to our own country? Let us
five be like one man, and leave on one side the rivalry which is wrong
anywhere, and especially here. You understand me, Altamont? And you,
Hatteras?"

The two men made no reply, but the doctor did not seem to notice their
silence. Then they talked about other things; about hunting, so as to
get a supply of fresh meat; with the spring, hares, partridges, even
foxes, would return, as well as bears; they resolved accordingly not
to let a favorable day pass without exploring the land of New America.




CHAPTER VIII.
EXCURSION TO THE NORTH OF VICTORIA BAY.


The next morning, as soon as the sun appeared, Clawbonny ascended the
wall of rock which rose above Doctor's House; it terminated suddenly
in a sort of truncated cone; the doctor reached the summit with some
little difficulty, and from there his eye beheld a vast expanse of
territory which looked as if it were the result of some volcanic
convulsion; a huge white canopy covered land and sea, rendering them
undistinguishable the one from the other. The doctor, when he saw that
this rock overlooked all the surrounding plain, had an idea,--a fact
which will not astonish those who are acquainted with him. This idea
he turned over, pondered, and made himself master of by the time he
returned to the house, and then he communicated it to his companions.

[Illustration: "The doctor reached the summit with some little
difficulty."]

"It has occurred to me," he said to them, "to build a lighthouse at
the top of the cone up there."

"A lighthouse?" they cried.

"Yes, a lighthouse; it will be of use to show us our way back at night
when we are returning from distant excursions, and to light up the
neighborhood in the eight months of winter."

"Certainly," answered Altamont, "such an apparatus would be useful;
but how will you build it?"

"With one of the _Porpoise's_ lanterns."

"Very good; but with what will you feed the lamp? With seal-oil?"

"No; it doesn't give a bright enough light; it could hardly pierce the
fog."

"Do you think you can get hydrogen from our coal and make illuminating
gas?"

"Well, that light would not be bright enough, and it would be wrong to
use up any of our fuel."

"Then," said Altamont, "I don't see--"

"As for me," answered Johnson, "since the bullet of mercury, the ice
lens, the building of Fort Providence, I believe Dr. Clawbonny is
capable of anything."

"Well," resumed Altamont, "will you tell us what sort of a light you
are going to have?"

"It's very simple," answered the doctor; "an electric light."

"An electric light!"

"Certainly; didn't you have on board of the _Porpoise_ a Bunsen's pile
in an uninjured state?"

"Yes," answered the American.

"Evidently, when you took it, you intended to make some experiments,
for it is complete. You have the necessary acid, and the wires
isolated, hence it would be easy for us to get an electric light. It
will be more brilliant, and will cost nothing."

"That is perfect," answered the boatswain, "and the less time we
lose--"

"Well, the materials are there," answered the doctor, "and in an hour
we shall have a column ten feet high, which will be enough."

[Illustration]

The doctor went out; his companions followed him to the top of the
cone; the column was promptly built and was soon surmounted by one of
the _Porpoise's_ lanterns. Then the doctor arranged the conducting
wires which were connected with the pile; this was placed in the
parlor of the ice-house, and was preserved from the frost by the heat
of the stoves. From there the wires ran to the lantern. All this was
quickly done, and they waited till sunset to judge of the effect. At
night the two charcoal points, kept at a proper distance apart in the
lantern, were brought together, and flashes of brilliant light, which
the wind could neither make flicker nor extinguish, issued from the
lighthouse. It was a noteworthy sight, these sparkling rays, rivalling
the brilliancy of the plains, and defining sharply the outlines of the
surrounding objects. Johnson could not help clapping his hands.

"Dr. Clawbonny," he said, "has made another sun!"

"One ought to do a little of everything," answered the doctor,
modestly.

The cold put an end to the general admiration, and each man hastened
back to his coverings.

After this time life was regularly organized. During the following
days, from the 15th to the 20th of April, the weather was very
uncertain; the temperature fell suddenly twenty degrees, and the
atmosphere experienced severe changes, at times being full of snow and
squally, at other times cold and dry, so that no one could set foot
outside without precautions. However, on Saturday, the wind began to
fall; this circumstance made an expedition possible; they resolved
accordingly to devote a day to hunting, in order to renew their
provisions. In the morning, Altamont, the doctor, Bell, each one
taking a double-barrelled gun, a proper amount of food, a hatchet, a
snow-knife in case they should have to dig a shelter, set out under a
cloudy sky. During their absence Hatteras was to explore the coast and
take their bearings. The doctor took care to start the light; its rays
were very bright; in fact, the electric light, being equal to that of
three thousand candles or three hundred gas-jets, is the only one
which at all approximates to the solar light.

The cold was sharp, dry, and still. The hunters set out towards Cape
Washington, finding their way made easier over the hardened snow. In
about half an hour they had made the three miles which separated the
cape from Fort Providence. Duke was springing about them. The coast
inclined to the east, and the lofty summits of Victoria Bay tended to
grow lower toward the north. This made them believe that New America
was perhaps only an island; but they did not have then to concern
themselves with its shape. The hunters took the route by the sea and
went forward rapidly. There was no sign of life, no trace of any
building; they were walking over a virgin soil. They thus made about
fifteen miles in the first three hours, eating without stopping to
rest; but they seemed likely to find no sport. They saw very few
traces of hare, fox, or wolf. Still, a few snow-birds flew here and
there, announcing the return of spring and the arctic animals. The
three companions had been compelled to go inland to get around some
deep ravines and some pointed rocks which ran down from Bell Mountain;
but after a few delays they succeeded in regaining the shore; the ice
had not yet separated. Far from it. The sea remained fast; still a few
traces of seals announced the beginning of their visit, and that they
were already come to breathe at the surface of the ice-field. It was
evident from the large marks, the fresh breaking of the ice, that many
had very recently been on the land. These animals are very anxious for
the rays of the sun, and they like to bask on the shore in the sun's
heat. The doctor called his companions' attention to these facts.

[Illustration]

"Let us notice this place," he said. "It is very possible that in
summer we shall find hundreds of seals here; they can be approached
and caught without difficulty, if they are unfamiliar with men. But we
must take care not to frighten them, or they will disappear as if by
magic and never return; in that way, careless hunters, instead of
killing them one by one, have often attacked them in a crowd, with
noisy cries, and have thereby driven them away."

"Are they only killed for their skin and oil?" asked Bell.

"By Europeans, yes, but the Esquimaux eat them; they live on them, and
pieces of seal's flesh, which they mix with blood and fat, are not at
all unappetizing. After all, it depends on the way it's treated, and I
shall give you some delicate cutlets if you don't mind their dark
color."

"We shall see you at work," answered Bell; "I'll gladly eat it,
Doctor."

"My good Bell, as much as you please. But, however much you eat, you
will never equal a Greenlander, who eats ten or fifteen pounds of it a
day."

"Fifteen pounds!" said Bell. "What stomachs!"

"Real polar stomachs," answered the doctor; "prodigious stomachs which
can be dilated at will, and, I ought to add, can be contracted in the
same way, so that they support starving as well as gorging. At the
beginning of his dinner, the Esquimaux is thin; at the end, he is fat,
and not to be recognized! It is true that his dinner often lasts a
whole day."

"Evidently," said Altamont, "this voracity is peculiar to the
inhabitants of cold countries!"

"I think so," answered the doctor; "in the arctic regions one has to
eat a great deal; it is a condition not only of strength, but of
existence. Hence the Hudson's Bay Company gives each man eight pounds
of meat a day, or twelve pounds of fish, or two pounds of pemmican."

"That's a generous supply," said the carpenter.

"But not so much as you imagine, my friend; and an Indian crammed in
that way does no better work than an Englishman with his pound of beef
and his pint of beer a day."

"Then, Doctor, all is for the best."

"True, but still an Esquimaux meal may well astonish us. While
wintering at Boothia Land, Sir John Ross was always surprised at the
voracity of his guides; he says somewhere that two men--two, you
understand--ate in one morning a whole quarter of a musk-ox; they tear
the meat into long shreds, which they place in their mouths; then each
one, cutting off at his lips what his mouth cannot hold, passes it
over to his companion; or else the gluttons, letting the shreds hang
down to the ground, swallow them gradually, as a boa-constrictor
swallows an animal, and like it stretched out at full length on the
ground."

"Ugh!" said Bell, "the disgusting brutes!"

"Every one eats in his own way," answered the American,
philosophically.

"Fortunately!" replied the doctor.

"Well," said Altamont, "since the need of food is so great in these
latitudes, I'm no longer surprised that in accounts of arctic voyages
there is always so much space given to describing the meals."

"You are right," answered the doctor; "and it is a remark which I have
often made myself; it is not only that plenty of food is needed, but
also because it is often hard to get it. So one is always thinking of
it and consequently always talking of it!"

"Still," said Altamont, "if my memory serves me right, in Norway, in
the coldest countries, the peasants need no such enormous supply: a
little milk, eggs, birch-bark bread, sometimes salmon, never any meat;
and yet they are hardy men."

"It's a matter of organization," answered the doctor, "and one which I
can't explain. Still, I fancy that the second or third generation of
Norwegians, carried to Greenland, would end by feeding themselves in
the Greenland way. And we too, my friends, if we were to remain in
this lovely country, would get to live like the Esquimaux, not to say
like gluttons."

"Dr. Clawbonny," said Bell, "it makes me hungry to talk in this way."

"It doesn't make me," answered Altamont; "it disgusts me rather, and
makes me dislike seal's flesh. But I fancy we shall have an
opportunity to try the experiment. If I'm not mistaken, I see some
living body down there on the ice."

"It's a walrus," shouted the doctor; "forward silently!"

[Illustration]

Indeed, the animal was within two hundred feet of the hunters; he was
stretching and rolling at his ease in the pale rays of the sun. The
three men separated so as to surround him and cut off his retreat; and
they approached within a few fathoms' lengths of him, hiding behind
the hummocks, and then fired. The walrus rolled over, still full of
strength; he crushed the ice in his attempts to get away; but Altamont
attacked him with his hatchet, and succeeded in cutting his dorsal
fins. The walrus made a desperate resistance; new shots finished him,
and he remained stretched lifeless on the ice-field stained with his
blood. He was a good-sized animal, being nearly fifteen feet long from
his muzzle to the end of his tail, and he would certainly furnish many
barrels of oil. The doctor cut out the most savory parts of the flesh,
and he left the corpse to the mercies of a few crows, which, at this
season of the year, were floating through the air. The night began to
fall. They thought of returning to Fort Providence; the sky had become
perfectly clear, and while waiting for the moon to rise, the splendor
of the stars was magnificent.

"Come, push on," said the doctor, "it's growing late; to be sure,
we've had poor luck; but as long as we have enough for supper, there's
no need of complaining. Only let's take the shortest way and try not
to get lost; the stars will help us."

But yet in countries where the North Star shines directly above the
traveller's head, it is hard to walk by it; in fact, when the north is
directly in the zenith, it is hard to determine the other cardinal
points; fortunately the moon and great constellations aided the doctor
in determining the route. In order to shorten their way, he resolved
to avoid the sinuosities of the coast, and to go directly across the
land; it was more direct, but less certain; so, after walking for a
few hours, the little band had completely lost its way. They thought
of spending the night in an ice-house and waiting till the next day to
find out where they were, even if they should have to return along the
shore; but the doctor, fearing that Hatteras and Johnson might be
anxious, insisted on their going on.

"Duke is showing us the way," he said, "and he can't be wrong; he has
an instinct which is surer than needle or star. Let us follow him."

Duke went forward, and they all followed confidently. And they were
justified in so doing. Soon a distant light appeared on the horizon;
it was not to be confounded with a star in the low clouds.

"There's our light!" cried the doctor.

"Do you think so, Doctor!" asked the carpenter.

"I'm sure of it. Let us push on."

As they approached the light grew brighter, and soon they enjoyed its
full brilliancy; they advanced in full illumination, and their sharply
cut shadows ran out behind them over the snow. They hastened their
gait, and in about half an hour they were climbing up the steps of
Fort Providence.

[Illustration: "They advanced in full illumination, and their sharply
cut shadows ran out behind them over the snow."]




CHAPTER IX.
COLD AND HEAT.


Hatteras and Johnson had waited for the three hunters with some
uneasiness. When they returned they were delighted to find a warm and
comfortable shelter. That evening the temperature had decidedly
fallen, and the thermometer outside stood at -31°. The three were very
much fatigued and almost frozen, so that they could hardly drag one
foot after the other; fortunately the stoves were drawing well; the
doctor became cook, and roasted a few walrus cutlets. At nine o'clock
they all five sat down before a nourishing supper.

"On my word," said Bell, "at the risk of passing for an Esquimaux, I
will say that food is an important thing in wintering; one ought to
take what one can get."

Each of them having his mouth full, it was impossible for any one to
answer the carpenter at once; but the doctor made a sign that he was
right. The walrus cutlets were declared excellent; or, if they made no
declarations about it, they ate it all up, which is much more to the
purpose. At dessert the doctor made the coffee, as was his custom; he
intrusted this task to no one else; he made it at the table, in an
alcohol machine, and served it boiling hot. He wanted it hot enough to
scald his throat, or else he did not think it worth drinking. That
evening he drank it so hot that his companions could not imitate him.

[Illustration]

"But you'll burn yourself, Doctor," said Altamont.

"O no!" was the answer.

"Is your throat lined with copper?" asked Johnson.

"No, my friends; I advise you to take counsel from me. There are some
persons, and I am of the number, who drink coffee at a temperature of
131°."

"One hundred and thirty-one degrees!" cried Altamont; "but the hand
can't support that heat!"

"Evidently, Altamont, since the hand can't endure more than 122° in
the water; but the palate and tongue are not so tender as the hand;
they can endure much more."

"You surprise me," said Altamont.

"Well, I'm going to convince you."

And the doctor, bringing the thermometer from the parlor, plunged the
bulb into his cup of boiling coffee; he waited until it stood at a
131°, and then he drank it with evident joy. Bell tried to do the same
thing, but he burned himself and shouted aloud.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

"You are not used to it," said the doctor.

"Clawbonny," asked Altamont, "can you tell me the highest temperature
the human body can support?"

"Easily," answered the doctor; "various experiments have been made and
curious facts have been found out. I remember one or two, and they
serve to show that one can get accustomed to anything, even to not
cooking where a beefsteak would cook. So, the story goes that some
girls employed at the public bakery of the city of La Rochefoucauld,
in France, could remain ten minutes in the oven in a temperature of
300°, that is to say, 89° hotter than boiling water, while potatoes
and meat were cooking around them."

"What girls!" said Altamont.

"Here is another indisputable example. Nine of our fellow-countrymen
in 1778, Fordyce, Banks, Solander, Blagden, Home, North, Lord
Seaforth, and Captain Phillips, endured a temperature of 295°, while
eggs and roast beef were cooking near them."

"And they were Englishmen!" said Bell, with an accent of pride.

"Yes, Bell," answered the doctor.

"O, Americans could have done better!" said Altamont.

"They would have roasted," said the doctor, laughing.

"And why not?" answered the American.

"At any rate, they have not tried; still, I stand up for my
countrymen. There's one thing I must not forget; it is incredible if
one can doubt of the accuracy of the witnesses. The Duke of Ragusa and
Dr. Jung, a Frenchman and an Austrian, saw a Turk dive into a bath
which stood at 170°."

"But it seems to me," said Johnson, that that is not equal to other
people you mentioned."

"I beg your pardon," answered the doctor; there is a great difference
between entering warm air and entering warm water; warm air induces
perspiration, and that protects the skin, while in such hot water
there is no perspiration and the skin is burned. Hence a bath is
seldom hotter than 107°. This Turk must have been an extraordinary man
to have been able to endure so great heat."

"Dr. Clawbonny," asked Johnson, "what is the usual temperature of
living beings?"

"It varies very much," answered the doctor; "birds are the warmest
blooded, and of these the duck and hen are the most remarkable; their
temperature is above 110°, while that of the owl is not more than
104°; then come the mammalia, men; the temperature of Englishmen is
generally 101°."

"I'm sure Mr. Altamont is going to claim something more for the
Americans," said Johnson.

"Well," said Altamont, "there are some very warm; but as I've never
placed a thermometer into their thorax or under their tongue, I can't
be sure about it."

"The difference of temperature," resumed the doctor, "between men of
different races is quite imperceptible when they are placed in the
same circumstances, whatever be the nature of their bringing-up; I
should add, that the temperature varies but little between men at the
equator and at the pole."

"So," said Altamont, "our temperature is about the same here as in
England?"

"About the same," answered the doctor; "as to the other mammalia,
their temperature is a trifle higher than that of man. The horse is
about the same, as well as the hare, the elephant, the porpoise, the
tiger; but the cat, the squirrel, the rat, panther, sheep, ox, dog,
monkey, goat, reach 103°; and the warmest of all, the pig, goes above
104°."

"That is humiliating for us," said Altamont.

"Then come amphibious animals and fish, whose temperature varies very
much according to that of the water. The serpent does not go above
86°, the frog 70°, and the shark the same in a medium a degree and a
half cooler; insects appear to have the temperature of the water and
the air."

"That is all very well," said Hatteras, who had not yet spoken, "and
I'm much obliged to the doctor for his information; but we are talking
as if we had to endure torrid heats. Would it not be wiser to talk
about the cold, to know to what we are exposed, and what is the lowest
temperature that has ever been observed?"

"True," added Johnson.

"There's nothing easier," continued the doctor, "and I may be able to
give you some information."

"I dare say," said Johnson; "you know everything."

"My friends, I only know what others have taught me, and when I've
finished you'll know exactly as much. This is what I know about cold
and the lowest temperatures observed in Europe. A great many
noteworthy winters have been known, and it seems as if the severest
has a periodic return about every forty-one years,--a period which
nearly corresponds with the greater appearance of spots on the sun. I
can mention the winter of 1364, when the Rhone was frozen as far as
Arles; that of 1408, when the Danube was frozen its whole length, and
when wolves ran over to Jutland without wetting their feet; that of
1509, during which the Mediterranean at Cette and Marseilles and the
Adriatic at Venice were frozen, and the Baltic as late as April 10;
that of 1608, which killed all the cattle in England; that of 1789,
when the Thames was frozen--as far as Gravesend, six leagues--below
London; that of 1813, of which the French retain such a terrible
memory; and that of 1829, the earliest and longest winter of this
century. So much for Europe."

"But what temperature has been reached above the Arctic Circle?" asked
Altamont.

"Really," said the doctor, "I believe we have experienced the greatest
cold that has ever been observed, since our spirit thermometer
indicated one day -72°; and if I remember aright, the lowest
temperatures ever observed before were only -61° at Melville Island,
-65° at Port Felix, and -70° at Fort Reliance."

"Yes," said Hatteras; "we were delayed, and unfortunately too, by a
very severe winter!"

"You were delayed?" exclaimed Altamont, staring at the captain.

"In our journey westward," interposed the doctor, hastily.

"So," said Altamont, continuing the conversation, "the maximum and
minimum temperatures endured by men vary about two hundred degrees?"

"Yes," answered the doctor; "a thermometer exposed to the open air and
sheltered from reflection has never risen above 135°, and in the
greatest colds it never falls below -72°. So, my friends, you see we
can take our ease."

"But still," said Johnson, "if the sun were to be extinguished
suddenly, would not the earth endure greater cold?"

"The sun won't be extinguished," answered the doctor; "but even if it
should be, the temperature would not fall any lower, probably, than
what I have mentioned."

"That's strange."

"O, I know it used to be said that in the space outside of the
atmosphere the temperature was thousands of degrees below zero! but
since the experiments of the Frenchman Fourrier, this has been
disproved; he has shown that if the earth were placed in a medium void
of all heat, that the temperature at the pole would be much greater,
and that there would be very great differences between night and day;
so, my friends, it is no colder a few millions of miles from the earth
than it is here."

"Tell me, Doctor," said Altamont, "is not the temperature of America
lower than that of other countries of the world?"

"Without doubt; but don't be proud of it," answered the doctor with a
laugh.

"And what is the reason?"

"No very satisfactory explanation has ever been given; so it occurred
to Hadley that a comet had come into collision with the earth and had
altered the position of its axis of rotation, that is to say, of its
poles; according to him, the North Pole, which used to be situated at
Hudson's Bay, found itself carried farther east, and the land at the
old Pole preserved a greater cold, which long centuries of the sun
have not yet heated."

"And you do not admit this hypothesis?"

"Not for a moment; for what is true of the eastern coast of America is
not true of the western coast, which has a higher temperature. No! we
can prove that the isothermal lines differ from the terrestrial
parallels, and that is all."

"Do you know, Doctor," said Johnson, "that it is pleasant to talk
about cold in our present circumstances?"

"Exactly, Johnson; we can call practice to the aid of theory. These
countries are a vast laboratory where curious experiments on low
temperatures can be made. Only, be always careful; if any part of your
body is frozen, rub it at once with snow to restore the circulation of
the blood; and if you come near the fire, be careful, for you may burn
your hands or feet without noticing it; then amputation would be
necessary, and we should try to leave nothing of ourselves in these
lands. And now I think it would be well for us to seek a few hours of
sleep."

"Willingly," answered the doctor's companions.

"Who keeps watch over the stove?"

"I do," answered Bell.

"Well, my friend, take care the fire does not fall out, for it's most
abominably cold this evening."

"Don't be uneasy, Doctor; it's very sharp, but see, the sky is all
ablaze!"

"Yes," answered the doctor, going up to the window, "it's a
magnificent aurora. What a glorious sight! I should never get tired of
looking at it!"

[Illustration]

In fact, the doctor admired all these cosmic phenomena, to which his
companions paid but little attention; he had noticed, besides, that
their appearance always preceded disturbances of the magnetic needle,
and he was preparing some observations on the subject which he
intended for Admiral Fitz-Roy's "Weather Book."

Soon, while Bell was on watch near the stove, all the rest, stretched
on their beds, slept quietly.




CHAPTER X.
THE PLEASURES OF WINTER-QUARTERS.


There is a gloomy monotony about life at the Pole. Man is wholly the
sport of the changes of the weather, which alternates between intense
cold and severe storms with savage relentlessness. The greater part of
the time it is impossible to set foot out of doors; one is imprisoned
in the hut of ice. Long months pass in this way, so that men lead the
life of moles.

The next day the thermometer was several degrees lower, and the air
was full of clouds of snow, which absorbed all the light of day. The
doctor saw himself kept within doors, and he folded his arms; there
was nothing to be done, except every hour to clear away the
entrance-hall and to repolish the ice-walls which the heat within made
damp; but the snow-house was very finely built, and the snow added to
its resistance by augmenting the thickness of its walls.

The stores were equally secure. All the objects taken from the ship
had been arranged in order in these "Docks of Merchandise," as the
doctor called them. Now, although these stores were at a distance of
only sixty feet from the house, it was yet on some days almost
impossible to get to them; hence a certain quantity of provisions had
always to be kept in the kitchen for daily needs.

They had been wise in unloading the _Porpoise_. The ship was exposed
to a gentle, but persistent pressure, which was gradually crushing it;
it was evident that nothing could be done with its fragments; still
the doctor kept hoping to be able to build a launch out of them to
return to England in, but the time for building it had not yet come.

So for the most part the five men remained in complete idleness.
Hatteras was pensive and always lying on the bed; Altamont was
drinking or sleeping, and the doctor took good care not to rouse him
from his slumbers, for he was always afraid of some distressing
quarrel. These two men seldom spoke to one another.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

So during meal-time the prudent Clawbonny always took care to guide
the conversation and to direct it in such a way as not to offend the
susceptibilities of either; but he had a great deal to do. He did his
best to instruct, distract, and interest his companions; when he was
not arranging his notes about the expedition, he read aloud some
history, geography, or work on meteorology, which had reference to
their condition; he presented things pleasantly and philosophically,
deriving wholesome instruction from the slightest incidents; his
inexhaustible memory never played him false; he applied his doctrines
to the persons who were with him, reminding them of such or such a
thing which happened under such or such circumstances; and he filled
out his theories by the force of personal arguments.

[Illustration: "He did his best to instruct and interest his
companions."]

This worthy man may be called the soul of this little world, a soul
glowing with frankness and justice. His companions had perfect
confidence in him; he even improved Captain Hatteras, who, besides,
was very fond of him; he made his words, manners, and custom so
agreeable, that the life of these five men within six degrees of the
Pole seemed perfectly natural; when he was speaking, any one would
have imagined he was in his office in Liverpool. And yet this
situation was unlike that of castaways on the islands of the Pacific
Ocean, those Robinsons whose touching history always aroused the envy
of their readers. There, the natural richness offers a thousand
different resources; a little imagination and effort suffice to secure
material happiness; nature aids man; hunting and fishing supply all
his wants; the trees grow to aid him, caverns shelter him, brooks
slake his thirst, dense thickets hide him from the sun, and severe
cold never comes upon him in the winter; a grain tossed into the earth
brings forth a bounteous return a few months later. There, outside of
society, everything is found to make man happy. And then these happy
isles lie in the path of ships; the castaway can hope to be picked up,
and he can wait in patience.

But here on the coast of New America how great is the difference! This
comparison would continually occur to the doctor, but he never
mentioned it to the others, and he struggled against the enforced
idleness.

He yearned ardently for the spring, in order to resume his excursions;
and yet he was anxious about it, for he foresaw difficulties between
Hatteras and Altamont. If they pushed on to the Pole, there would
necessarily be rivalry between the two men. Hence he had to prepare
for the worst, and still, as far as he could, to try to pacify these
rivals; but to reconcile an American and an Englishman, two men
hostile to one another from their birth, one endowed with real insular
prejudice, the other with the adventurous, irreverent spirit of his
country, was no easy task. When the doctor thought of their eager
rivalry, which in fact was one of nationalities, he could not help,
not shrugging his shoulders, but lamenting human weakness. He would
often talk to Johnson on this subject; he and the old sailor agreed in
the matter; they were uncertain what view to take, and they foresaw
complications in the future.

Still, the bad weather continued; they could not leave Fort Providence
even for an hour. Night and day they had to remain in the snow-house.
They all found it tedious, except the doctor, who found diversion for
himself.

"Isn't there any way we can amuse ourselves?" said Altamont one
evening. "This isn't really living, lying here like sluggish reptiles
all winter."

"It's a pity," said the doctor, "that we are too few to organize any
system of distractions."

"Do you mean it would be easier for us to combat idleness if there
were more of us?" asked the American.

"Yes; when whole crews have wintered in boreal regions, they have
found out the way to avoid idleness."

"To tell the truth," said Altamont, "I should like to know how they
did; they must have been very ingenious to get any fun out of these
surroundings. They didn't ask one another riddles, I suppose?"

"No," answered the doctor, "but they introduced into these lands two
great means of amusement, the press and the theatre."

"What! did they have a newspaper?" asked the American.

"Did they act plays?" asked Bell.

"Yes, and with much amusement. While he was wintering at Melville
Island, Captain Parry offered his crews these two entertainments, and
they enjoyed them very much."

"Well," said Johnson, "I should have liked to be there; it must have
been funny enough."

"Funny indeed; Lieutenant Beecher was manager of the theatre, and
Captain Sabine editor of the 'Winter Chronicle, or Gazette of North
Georgia.'"

"Good names," said Altamont.

"The paper appeared every Monday morning, from November 1, 1819, to
March 20, 1820. It contained an account of everything that happened,
the hunts, accidents, incidents, and of the weather; there were
stories written for it; to be sure, it lacked the humor of Sterne, and
the delightful articles of the 'Daily Telegraph'; but they got
amusement from it; its readers were not over-critical, and I fancy no
journalists ever enjoyed their occupation more."

"Well," said Altamont, "I should like to hear some extracts from this
paper, my dear Doctor; its articles must all have been frozen solid."

"No, no," answered the doctor; "at any rate, what would have seemed
simple enough to the Liverpool Philosophical Society, or the London
Literary Institution, was perfectly satisfactory to the crews beneath
the snow. Do you want a sample?"

"What! Do you remember--"

"No, but you had 'Parry's Voyages' on board the _Porpoise_, and I can
read you his own account."

"Do!" shouted the doctor's companions.

"There's nothing easier."

The doctor got the book from the shelves, and soon found the passage.

[Illustration]

"See here," he said, "here are some extracts from the newspaper. It is
a letter addressed to the editor:--

"'It is with genuine satisfaction that your plan for the establishment
of a newspaper has been received. I am convinced that under your
charge it will furnish us with a great deal of amusement, and will
serve to lighten materially the gloom of our hundred days of darkness.

"'The interest which I, for my part, take in it has caused me to
examine the effect of your announcement upon the members of our
society, and I can assure you, to use the consecrated phrase of the
London press, that it has produced a profound impression upon the
public.

"'The day after the appearance of your prospectus, there was on board
an unusual and unprecedented demand for ink. The green cloth of our
tables was suddenly covered with a deluge of quill-pens, to the great
injury of one of our servants, who, in trying to remove them, got one
under his nail.

"'Finally, I know that Sergeant Martin has had no less than nine
pocket-knives to sharpen.

"'Our tables are groaning beneath the unaccustomed weight of
inkstands, which had not seen the light for two months; and it is even
whispered that the depths of the hold have been often opened to secure
many reams of paper, which did not expect to issue so soon from their
place of repose.

"'I shall not forget to say to you that I have some suspicions that an
effort will be made to slip into your box some articles, which,
lacking complete originality, and not being wholly unpublished, may
not suit your plan. I can affirm that no later than last evening an
author was seen bending over his desk, holding in one hand an open
volume of the "Spectator," while with the other he was thawing his ink
by the flame of the lamp. It is useless to recommend you to keep a
lookout against such devices; we must not see reappearing in the
"Winter Chronicle" what our ancestors used to read at breakfast more
than a century ago.'"

"Well, well," said Altamont, when the doctor had finished reading,
"there is really good humor in that, and the writer must have been a
bright fellow."

"Bright is the word," answered the doctor. "Stop a moment, here is an
amusing advertisement:--

"'Wanted. A middle-aged, respectable woman to help dress the ladies of
the troupe of the "Theatre Royal of North Georgia." Suitable salary
given, tea and beer free. Address the Committee of the theatre.--N. B.
A widow preferred.'"

"They were not disgusted, at any rate," said Johnson.

"And did they get the widow?" asked Bell.

"Probably," answered the doctor, "for here is an answer addressed to
the committee:--


"'Gentlemen: I am a widow, twenty-six years old, and I can produce
warm testimonials as to my morals and talents. But before taking
charge of the dresses of the actresses of your theatre, I am anxious
to know if they intend to keep their trousers on, and whether I can
have the aid of some strong sailors to lace their corsets properly.
This being arranged, gentlemen, you may count upon your servant.

"'A. B.

"'P. S. Can you not substitute brandy for beer?'"


"Bravo!" shouted Altamont. "I suppose they had ladies'-maids to lace
you by the capstan. Well, they were jolly fellows!"

"Like all who do what they set out to do," remarked Hatteras.

Hatteras uttered these words, and then he relapsed into his usual
silence. The doctor, unwilling to dwell on that subject, hastened to
resume his reading.

"See here," he said, "here is a picture of arctic sufferings; it may
be varied infinitely; but a few of the observations are wise enough;
for instance:--

"'To go out in the morning to take the air, and on setting foot off
the ship, to take a cold bath in the cook's trough.

"'To go on a hunting-party, get near a fine reindeer, take aim, try to
fire, and miss the shot on account of a damp cap.

"'To start out with a piece of fresh bread in the pocket, and when one
gets hungry to find it frozen hard enough to break one's teeth.

"'To leave the table suddenly on hearing a wolf is in sight of the
ship, and to come back and find one's dinner eaten by the cat.

"'To return from a walk rapt in thought, and to be awakened suddenly
by the embrace of a bear.'

"You see, my friends," said the doctor, "we should not find it hard to
imagine other polar troubles; but from the moment it becomes necessary
to endure these miseries, it would be a pleasure to narrate them."

"Upon my word," said Altamont, "that's an amusing paper, and it's a
pity we can't subscribe to it."

"Suppose we should start one," suggested Johnson.

"We five!" answered Clawbonny; "we should all be editors, and there
would be no readers."

"Nor audience either, if we should act a play," said Altamont.

"Tell us, Doctor," said Johnson, "something about Captain Parry's
theatre; did they act new plays there?"

"Of course; at first they made use of two volumes which were put on
board of the _Hector_, and they had plays every fortnight; but soon
they had acted all; then they resorted to original authors, and Parry
himself wrote a suitable play for the Christmas holidays; it was very
successful, and was called 'The Northwest Passage, or the End of the
Voyage.'"

"A capital title," answered Altamont; "but I confess, if I had to
write on that subject, I should be puzzled about the end."

"You are right," said Bell; "who can say how it will end?"

"True," answered the doctor; "but why bother about the end, since the
beginning is so favorable? Let us trust in Providence, my friends; let
us act our part well, and since the end depends on the Author of all
things, let us have confidence in him; he will know what to do with
us."

"Let us sleep on it," answered Johnson; "it is late, and since bedtime
has come, let us turn in."

"You are in a great hurry, my old friend," said the doctor.

"Naturally enough, Doctor, I am so comfortable in bed! And then my
dreams are pleasant. I dream of warm countries; or that, to tell the
truth, half of my life is spent at the equator and half at the Pole!"

"The deuce," said Altamont, "you have a happy temperament."

"True," answered the boatswain.

"Well, it would be cruel to detain Johnson any longer. His tropical
sun is waiting for him. Let us go to bed."




CHAPTER XI.
DISQUIETING TRACES.


In the night of April 26-27, the weather changed; the thermometer fell
many degrees, and the inhabitants of Doctor's House perceived it from
the cold which made its way beneath their coverings; Altamont, who was
watching the stove, took care not to let the fire get low, and he was
kept busy putting on enough coal to keep the temperature at 50°. This
cold weather announced the end of the storm, and the doctor was glad
of it, for now they could resume their usual occupations, their
hunting, excursions, and explorations; this would put an end to the
apathy of their loneliness, which in time sours even the finest
characters.

[Illustration]

The next morning the doctor rose early, and made his way over the
drifts to the lighthouse. The wind was from the north; the air was
clear, the snow was hard under his feet. Soon his five companions had
left Doctor's House; their first care was to dig away the drifted
snow, which now disguised the plateau; it would have been impossible
to discover any traces of life upon it, for the tempest had buried all
inequalities beneath fifteen feet of snow.

After the snow was cleared away from the house, it was necessary to
restore its architectural outline. This was very easy, and after the
ice was removed a few blows with the snow-knife gave it its normal
thickness. After two hours' work the granite appeared, and access to
the stores and the powder-house was free. But since, in these
uncertain climates, such things can happen every day, a new supply of
food was carried to the kitchen. They were all wearied of salt food
and yearned for fresh meat, and so the hunters were charged with
changing the bill of fare, and they prepared to set out.

[Illustration]

Still the end of April did not bring with it the polar spring, which
was yet six weeks off; the sun's rays were still too feeble to melt
the snow or to nourish the few plants of these regions. They feared
lest animals should be scarce, both birds and quadrupeds. But a hare,
a few ptarmigans, even a young fox, would have been welcome to the
table of Doctor's House, and the hunters resolved to shoot whatever
should come within range.

The doctor, Altamont, and Bell determined to explore the country.
Altamont, they felt sure from his habits, was a bold and skilful
hunter, and, with all his bragging, a capital shot. So he went with
the hunters, as did Duke, who was equally skilful and less prone to
boasting.

The three companions ascended the east cone and set out towards the
large white plains; but they had gone no farther than two or three
miles before they saw numerous tracks; from that point, they ran down
to the shore of Victoria Bay, and appeared to surround Fort Providence
with a series of concentric circles.

[Illustration]

After they had followed these footprints for a short time, the doctor
said,--

"Well, that is clear enough."

"Too clear," said Bell; "they are bear tracks."

"Good game," continued Altamont, "and there is only one fault in it
to-day."

"What's that?" asked the doctor.

"The abundance," answered the American.

"What do you mean?" asked Bell.

"I mean that there are distinct tracks of five bears; and five bears
are a good many for five men."

"Are you sure of what you say?" asked the doctor.

"Judge for yourself; this mark is different from any other; the claws
on this one are farther apart than those. Here is the print of a
smaller bear. If you compare them together, you'll find traces of five
animals."

"You are right," said Bell, after a careful examination.

"Then," said the doctor, "there is no need of useless bravado, but
rather of caution; these animals are famished at the end of a severe
winter, and they may be very dangerous; and since there is no doubt of
their number--"

"Nor of their intentions," interrupted the American.

"Do you suppose," he asked, "that they have discovered our presence
here?"

"Without a doubt, unless we've fallen on a whole band of bears; but in
that case, why do their prints go about in a circle, instead of
running out of sight? See, they came from the southwest and stopped
here, and began to explore the country."

"You are right," said the doctor, "and it's certain they came last
night."

"And the other nights too," answered Altamont; "only the snow has
covered their tracks."

"No," said the doctor; "it's more likely that they waited for the end
of the storm; they went to the bay to catch some seals, and then they
scented us."

"True," said Altamont; "so it is easy to know whether they will return
to-night."

"How so?" asked Bell.

"By rubbing out some of their tracks; and if we find new ones
to-morrow, we can be sure that they are trying to get into Fort
Providence."

"Well," said the doctor, "we shall at least know what to expect."

The three then set to work, and soon effaced all the tracks over a
space of about six hundred feet.

"It's strange, however," said Bell, "that they could scent us at so
great a distance; we didn't burn anything greasy which could attract
them."

"O," answered the doctor, "they have very fine sight, and delicate
sense of smell! Besides, they are very intelligent, perhaps the most
intelligent of animals, and they have found out something strange
here."

"Perhaps," continued Bell, "during the storm, they came up as far as
the plateau."

"Then," said the American, "why should they have stopped there?"

"True, there is no answer to that," answered the doctor; "and we ought
to believe that they are shortening the circle about Fort Providence."

"We shall see," answered Altamont.

"Now, let us go on," said the doctor; "but we'll keep our eyes open."

They kept careful watch, through fear lest some bear should be hidden
behind the masses of ice; often they took the blocks for animals, from
their shape and whiteness, but soon they discovered their mistake.

They returned at last to the shore beneath the cone, and from there
their eyes swept in vain from Cape Washington to Johnson Island. They
saw nothing; everything was white and motionless; not a sound was to
be heard. They entered the snow-house.

Hatteras and Johnson were informed of the condition of affairs, and
they resolved to keep a strict watch. Night came; nothing occurred to
alarm them, or to mar its beauty. At dawn the next morning, Hatteras
and his companions, fully armed, went out to examine the condition of
the snow; they found the same tracks as on the previous day, only
nearer. Evidently the enemy was preparing to lay siege to Fort
Providence.

"They have opened their second parallel," said the doctor.

"They have made a point in advance," answered Altamont; "see those
footprints coming nearer the plateau; they are those of some strong
animal."

"Yes, they are gaining ground gradually," said Johnson; "it is evident
that they are going to attack us."

"There's no doubt of that," said the doctor; "let us avoid showing
ourselves. We are not strong enough to fight successfully."

"But where do these devilish bears come from?" asked Bell.

"From behind those pieces of ice to the east, where they are spying
us; don't let us get too near them."

"And our hunt?" asked Altamont.

"Let us put it off for a few days," answered the doctor; "let us again
rub out these nearest marks, and to-morrow we shall see if they are
renewed. In this way we can see the manoeuvres of our enemies."

The doctor's advice was taken, and they returned to the fort; the
presence of these terrible beasts forbade any excursion. Strict watch
was kept over the neighborhood of Victoria Bay. The lighthouse was
dismantled; it was of no real use, and might attract the attention of
the animals; the lantern and the electric threads were carried to the
house; then they took turns in watching the upper plateau.

Again they had to endure the monotony of loneliness, but what else was
to be done? They dared not risk a contest at so fearful odds; no one's
life could be risked imprudently. Perhaps the bears, if they caught
sight of nothing, might be thrown off the track; or, if they were met
singly, they might be attacked successfully. However, this inaction
was relieved by a new interest; they had to keep watch, and no one
regretted it.

April 28th passed by without any sign of the existence of the enemy.
The next morning their curiosity as to the existence of new tracks was
succeeded by astonishment. Not a trace was to be seen; the snow was
intact.

"Good," shouted Altamont, "the bears are thrown off the track! They
have no perseverance! They are tired of waiting, and have gone! Good
by, and now off to the hunt!"

"Eh!" answered the doctor, "who can say? For greater safety, my
friends, I beg one more day of watching; it is certain the enemy did
not approach last night, at least from this side--"

"Let us make a circuit of the plateau," said Altamont, "and then we
shall make sure."

"Willingly," said the doctor.

But with all their care in exploration, not the slightest trace could
be found.

"Well, shall we start on our hunt?" asked Altamont, impatiently.

"Let us wait till to-morrow," urged the doctor.

"All right," answered Altamont, who had some reluctance, however,
about conceding.

[Illustration]

They returned to the fort. Each one had to watch for an hour, as on
the previous evening. When Altamont's turn came, he went to relieve
Bell. As soon as he was gone, Hatteras called his companions together.
The doctor left his notes, and Johnson his furnaces. It might have
been supposed that Hatteras was going to discuss the dangers of the
situation; he did not even think of them.

"My friends," he said, "let us take advantage of the absence of this
American, to talk over our affairs; some things don't concern him at
all, and I don't care to have him meddling with them."

The others looked at one another, uncertain of his meaning.

"I want to speak with you," he said, "about our future plans."

"Well," answered the doctor, "let us talk now we are alone."

"In a month, or six weeks at the latest," Hatteras began, "we shall be
able to make distant excursions. Had you thought of what might be done
in the summer?"

"Had you, Captain?" asked Johnson.

"I? I can say that not an hour passes without my mind's recurring to
my plan. I suppose no one of you has any thought of returning--"

There was no immediate answer to this insinuation.

"As for me," continued Hatteras, "if I have to go alone, I shall go to
the North Pole; we are only three hundred and sixty miles from it at
the outside. No men have ever been so near it, and I shall not let
such a chance go by without the attempt, even if it be impossible.
What are your views in the matter?"

"Your own," answered the doctor.

"And yours, Johnson?"

"The same as the doctor's," answered the boatswain.

"It is your turn to speak, Bell," said Hatteras.

"Captain," answered the carpenter, "it is true we have no family
awaiting us in England, but our country is our country: don't you
think of going back?"

"We shall go back easily as soon as we shall have discovered the Pole.
In fact, more easily. The difficulties will not increase, for, on our
way thither, we leave behind us the coldest spots on the globe. We
have supplies of all sorts for a long time. There is nothing to hinder
us, and we should be to blame if we did not push on to the end."

"Well," answered Bell, "we are all of your opinion, Captain."

"Good!" replied Hatteras. "I have never doubted of you. We shall
succeed, my friends, and England shall have all the glory of our
success."

"But there is an American with us," said Johnson.

Hatteras could not restrain a wrathful gesture at this remark.

"I know it," he said in a deep voice.

"We can't leave him here," continued the doctor.

"No, we cannot," answered Hatteras, coldly.

"And he will certainly come."

"Yes, he will come, but who will command?"

"You, Captain."

"And if you obey me, will this Yankee refuse to obey?"

"I don't think so," answered Johnson; "but if he is unwilling to obey
your orders--"

"It would have to be settled between him and me."

The three Englishmen looked at Hatteras without a word. The doctor
broke the silence.

"How shall we travel?" he asked.

"By keeping along the coast as much as possible," answered Hatteras.

"But if we find the sea open, as is likely?"

"Well, we shall cross it."

"How? We have no boat."

Hatteras did not answer; he was evidently embarrassed.

"Perhaps," suggested Bell, "we might build a launch out of the timbers
of the _Porpoise_."

"Never!" shouted Hatteras, warmly.

"Never?" exclaimed Johnson.

The doctor shook his head; he understood the captain's unwillingness.

"Never!" the latter answered. "A launch made out of the wood of an
American ship would be an American launch--"

"But, Captain--" interposed Johnson.

The doctor made a sign to the old boatswain to keep silent. A more
suitable time was required for that question. The doctor, although he
understood Hatteras's repugnance, did not sympathize with it, and he
determined to make his friend abandon this hasty decision. Hence he
spoke of something else, of the possibility of going along the coast
to the north, and that unknown point, the North Pole. In a word, he
avoided all dangerous subjects of conversation up to the moment when
it was suddenly ended by the entrance of Altamont. He had nothing new
to report. The day ended in this way, and the night was quiet. The
bears had evidently disappeared.




CHAPTER XII.
THE ICE PRISON.


The next day they determined to arrange the hunt, in which Hatteras,
Altamont, and the carpenter were to take part; no more tracks were to
be seen; the bears had decidedly given up their plan of attack, either
from fear of their unknown enemies, or because there had been no sign
of living beings beneath the mass of snow. During the absence of the
three hunters, the doctor was to push on to Johnson Island to examine
the condition of the ice, and to make some hydrographic
investigations. The cold was sharp, but they supported it well, having
become accustomed to it by this time. The boatswain was to remain at
Doctor's House; in a word, to guard the house.

The three hunters made their preparations; each one took a
double-barrelled rifled gun, with conical balls; they carried a small
quantity of pemmican, in case night should fall before their return;
they also were provided with the snow-knife, which is so indispensable
in these regions, and a hatchet which they wore in their belts. Thus
armed and equipped they could go far; and since they were both skilled
and bold, they could count on bringing back a good supply.

At eight in the morning they set out. Duke sprang about ahead of them;
they ascended the hill to the east, went about the lighthouse, and
disappeared in the plains to the south, which were bounded by Mount
Bell. The doctor, having agreed on a danger-signal with Johnson,
descended towards the shore so as to reach the ice in Victoria Bay.

[Illustration]

The boatswain remained at Fort Providence alone, but not idle. He
first set free the Greenland dogs, which were playing about the Dog
Palace; they in their joy rolled about in the snow. Johnson then gave
his attentions to the cares of housekeeping. He had to renew the fuel
and provisions, to set the stores in order, to mend many broken
utensils, to patch the coverings, to work over the shoes for the long
excursions of the summer. There was no lack of things to do, but the
boatswain worked with the ease of a sailor, who has generally a
smattering of all trades. While thus employed he began to think of the
talk of the evening before; he thought of the captain, and especially
of his obstinacy, which, after all, had something very heroic and very
honorable about it, in his unwillingness that any American man or boat
should reach the Pole before him, or even with him.

"Still, it seems to me," he said to himself, "no easy task to cross
the ocean without a boat; and if we have the open sea before us, we
should need one. The strongest Englishman in the world couldn't swim
three hundred miles. Patriotism has its limits. Well, we shall see. We
have still time before us; Dr. Clawbonny has not yet said his last
word in the matter; he is wise, and he may persuade the captain to
change his mind. I'll bet that in going towards the island he'll
glance at the fragments of the _Porpoise_, and will know exactly what
can be made out of them."

Johnson had reached this point in his reflections, and the hunters had
been gone an hour, when a loud report was heard two or three miles to
windward.

"Good!" said the sailor; "they have come across something, and without
going very far, for I heard them distinctly. After all, the air is so
clear."

A second and then a third report was heard.

"Hulloa!" continued Johnson, "they've got into a good place."

Three other reports, in quicker succession, were heard.

"Six shots!" said Johnson; "now they've fired off everything. It was a
hot time! Is it possible--"

At the thought, Johnson grew pale; he quickly left the snow-house, and
in a few moments he had run up to the top of the cone. He saw a sight
that made him tremble.

"The bears!" he shouted.

The three hunters, followed by Duke, were running rapidly, followed by
five enormous animals; their six bullets had not disabled them; the
bears were gaining on them; Hatteras, behind the others, could only
keep his distance from the animals by throwing away his cap, hatchet,
and even his gun. The bears stopped, according to their habit, to
sniff at the different objects, and lost a little on this ground on
which they would have outstripped the swiftest horse. It was thus that
Hatteras, Altamont, and Bell, all out of breath, came up to Johnson,
and they all slid down the slope to the snow-house. The five bears
were close behind, and the captain was obliged to ward off the blow of
a paw with his knife. In a moment Hatteras and his companions were
locked in the house. The animals stopped on the upper plateau of the
truncated cone.

[Illustration: "Hatteras could only keep his distance from the animals
by throwing away his cap, hatchet, and even his gun."]

"Well," said Hatteras, "we can now defend ourselves better, five to
five!"

"Four to five!" shouted Johnson in a terrified voice.

"What?" asked Hatteras.

"The doctor!" answered Johnson, pointing to the empty room.

"Well?"

"He is on the shore of the island!"

"Poor man!" cried Bell.

"We can't abandon him in this way," said Altamont.

"Let us run!" said Hatteras.

He opened the door quickly, but he had hardly time to shut it; a bear
nearly crushed his skull with his claw.

"They are there," he cried.

"All?" asked Bell.

"All!" answered Hatteras.

Altamont hastened to the windows, heaping up the bays with pieces of
ice torn from the walls of the house. His companions did the same
without speaking. Duke's dull snarls alone broke the silence.

[Illustration]

But it must be said these men had only a single thought; they forgot
their own danger, and only considered the doctor. Poor Clawbonny! so
kind, so devoted! the soul of the little colony! for the first time he
was missing; extreme peril, a terrible death, awaited him; for when
his excursion was over he would return quietly to Fort Providence, and
would find these ferocious animals. And there was no way of warning
him.

"If I'm not mistaken, he will be on his guard; your shots must have
warned him, and he must know something has happened."

"But if he were far off," answered Altamont, "and did not understand?
There are eight chances out of ten that he'll come back without
suspicion of danger! The bears are hiding behind the scarp of the
fort, and he can't see them."

"We shall have to get rid of these dangerous beasts before his
return," answered Hatteras.

"But how?" asked Bell.

To answer this question was not easy. A sortie seemed impossible. They
took the precaution to barricade the entrance, but the bears could
easily have overcome the obstacles if the idea had occurred to them;
they knew the number and strength of their adversaries, and they could
easily have reached them. The prisoners were posted in each one of the
chambers of Doctor's House to watch for every attempt at entrance;
when they listened, they heard the bears coming and going, growling,
and tearing at the walls with their huge paws. But some action was
necessary; time was pressing. Altamont resolved to make a loop-hole to
shoot the assailants; in a few minutes he had made a little hole in
the ice-wall; he pushed his gun through it; but it had scarcely
reached the other side before it was torn from his hands with
irresistible force before he could fire.

[Illustration]

"The devil!" he cried, "we are too weak."

And he hastened to close the loop-hole. Thus matters went for an hour,
without any end appearing probable. The chances of a sortie were
discussed; they seemed slight, for the bears could not be fought
singly. Nevertheless, Hatteras and his companions, being anxious to
finish it, and, it must be said, very much confused at being thus
imprisoned by the beasts, were about to try a direct attack, when the
captain thought of a new means of defence.

He took the poker and plunged it into the stove; then he made an
opening in the wall, but so as to keep a thin coating of ice outside.
His companions watched him. When the poker was white hot, Hatteras
said,--

"This bar will drive away the bears, for they won't be able to seize
it, and through the loop-hole we will be able to fire at them, without
their taking our guns away from us."

"A good idea!" cried Bell, going towards Altamont.

Then Hatteras, withdrawing the poker from the stove, pushed it through
the wall. The snow, steaming at its touch, hissed sharply. Two bears
ran to seize the bar, but they roared fearfully when four shots were
fired at once.

"Hit!" shouted the American.

"Hit!" repeated Bell.

"Let us try again," said Hatteras, closing the opening for a moment.

The poker was put again into the fire; in a few minutes it was red
hot.

Altamont and Bell returned to their place after loading their guns;
Hatteras again pushed the poker through the loop-hole. But this time
an impenetrable substance stopped it.

[Illustration]

"Curse it!" cried the American.

"What's the matter?" asked Johnson.

"The matter! These cursed animals are heaping up the ice and snow so
as to bury us alive!"

"Impossible!"

"See, the poker can't go through! Really, this is absurd!"

It was more than absurd, it was alarming. Matters looked worse. The
bears, which are very intelligent beasts, employed this method of
suffocating their prey. They heaped the ice in such a way as to render
flight impossible.

[Illustration: "The bears heaped the ice in such a way as to render
flight impossible."]

"This is hard," said Johnson, with a very mortified air. "It's well
enough to have men treat you in this way, but bears!"

After this reflection two hours passed by without any material change
in their situation; a sortie became impossible; the thickened walls
deadened all sound without. Altamont walked to and fro like a bold man
in face of a danger greater than his courage. Hatteras thought
anxiously of the doctor, and of the great danger awaiting him when he
should return.

"Ah," shouted Johnson, "if Dr. Clawbonny were only here!"

"Well, what would he do?" asked Altamont.

"O, he would be able to help us!"

"How?" asked the American, with some asperity.

"If I knew," answered Johnson, "I shouldn't want him here. Still, I
can think of a piece of advice he would give us at this moment."

"What is that?"

"To take some food. It can't hurt us. What do you think, Mr.
Altamont?"

"Let us eat if you care to," was the answer; "although our condition
is stupid, not to say disgraceful."

"I'll bet," said Johnson, "that we'll find some way of driving them
off after dinner."

[Illustration]

They made no reply, but sat down to dinner. Johnson, as a pupil of the
doctor, tried to be a philosopher in the face of danger, but he
succeeded ill; his jokes stuck in his throat. Besides, they began to
feel uncomfortable; the air was growing bad in this hermetically
sealed prison; the stove-pipe drew insufficiently, and it was easy to
see that in a short time the fire would go out; the oxygen, consumed
by their lungs and the fire, would be replaced by carbonic acid, which
would be fatal to them, as they all knew. Hatteras was the first to
detect this new danger; he was unwilling to hide it from the others.

"So, at any risk we must get out!" said Altamont.

"Yes," answered Hatteras; "but let us wait till night; we will make a
hole in the snow that we may get fresh air; then one shall take his
place here and fire at the bears."

"It's the only thing we can do," said the American.

[Illustration]

Having agreed on this, they waited for the time of action; and during
the following hours, Altamont did not spare imprecations against a
state of things in which, as he put it, "there being men and bears
concerned, the men were getting the worst of it."




CHAPTER XIII.
THE MINE.


Night came, and the lamp began to burn dimly in the close air of the
room. At eight o'clock they made their final preparations. The guns
were carefully loaded, and an opening was begun in the roof of the
snow-house. Bell worked cleverly at this for a few minutes, when
Johnson, who had left the bedroom, where he was on guard, for a few
minutes, returned rapidly to his companions. He seemed disturbed.

"What is the matter?" the captain asked.

"The matter? nothing!" answered the old sailor, hesitatingly, "yet--"

"What is it?" asked Altamont.

"Hush! Don't you hear a strange sound?"

"On which side?"

"There! There is something happening to the wall of that room."

Bell stopped his work; each one listened. A distant noise could be
heard, apparently in the side wall; some one was evidently making a
passage-way through the ice.

"It's a tearing sound!" said Johnson.

"Without a doubt," answered Altamont.

"The bears?" asked Bell.

"Yes, the bears," said Altamont.

"They have changed their plan," continued the sailor; "they've given
up trying to suffocate us."

"Or else they think they've done it," added the American, who was
getting very angry.

"We shall be attacked," said Bell.

"Well," remarked Hatteras, "we shall fight against them."

"Confound it!" shouted Altamont; "I prefer that decidedly! I've had
enough working in the dark! Now we shall see one another and fight!"

"Yes," answered Johnson; "but with our guns it is impossible in so
small a space."

"Well, with a hatchet or a knife!"

The noise increased; the scratching of claws could be heard; the bears
had attacked the wall at the angle where it joined the snow fastened
to the rock."

"Evidently," said Johnson, "the animal is within six feet of us."

"You are right, Johnson," answered the American, "but we have time to
prepare ourselves to receive it!"

The American took the axe in one hand, his knife in the other; resting
on his right foot, his body thrown back, he stood ready to attack.
Hatteras and Bell did the same. Johnson prepared his gun in case
fire-arms should be necessary. The noise grew louder and louder; the
ice kept cracking beneath the repeated blows. At last only a thin
crust separated the adversaries; suddenly this crust tore asunder like
paper through which a clown leaps, and an enormous black body appeared
in the gloom of the room. Altamont raised his hand to strike it.

[Illustration: "An enormous black body appeared in the gloom of the
room. Altamont raised his hand to strike it."]

"Stop! for heaven's sake, stop!" said a well-known voice.

"The doctor, the doctor!" shouted Johnson.

It was indeed the doctor, who, carried by the impetus, rolled into the
room.

"Good evening, my friends," he said, springing to his feet.

His companions remained stupefied; but joy succeeded their
stupefaction; each one wished to embrace the worthy man; Hatteras, who
was much moved, clasped him for a long time to his breast. The doctor
answered by a warm clasp of the hand.

"What! you, Dr. Clawbonny!" said the boatswain.

"Why, Johnson, I was much more anxious about your fate than you about
mine."

"But how did you know that we were attacked by bears?" asked Altamont;
"our greatest fear was to see you returning quietly to Fort Providence
without thought of danger."

"O, I saw everything!" answered the doctor; "your shots warned me; I
happened to be near the fragments of the _Porpoise_; I climbed up a
hummock; I saw five bears chasing you; ah, I feared the worst for you!
But the way you slid down the hill, and the hesitation of the animals,
reassured me for a time; I knew you'd had time to lock yourselves in.
Then I approached gradually, climbing and creeping between cakes of
ice; I arrived near the fort, and I saw the huge beasts working like
beavers; they were tossing the snow about, heaping up the ice so as to
bury you alive. Fortunately, they did not think of hurling the blocks
down from the top of the cone, for you would have been crushed without
mercy."

"But," said Bell, "you were not safe, Doctor; couldn't they leave
their place and attack you?"

"They didn't think of it; the Greenland dogs which Johnson let loose
would sniff around at a little distance, but they didn't think of
attacking them; no, they were sure of better game."

"Thanks for the compliment," said Altamont, smiling.

"O, you needn't be vain of it! When I saw the tactics of the bears, I
resolved to join you; to be prudent, I waited till night; so at
twilight I slipped noiselessly towards the slope, on the side of the
magazine; I had my own idea in choosing this point; I wanted to make a
gallery; so I set to work; I began with my snow-knife, and a capital
tool it is! For three hours I dug and dug, and here I am, hungry and
tired, but here at last--"

"To share our fate?" asked Altamont.

"To save all of us; but give me a piece of biscuit and some meat; I'm
half starved."

Soon the doctor was burying his white teeth in a large slice of salt
beef. Although he was eating, he appeared willing to answer the
questions they put to him.

"To save us?" Bell began.

"Certainly," answered the doctor, "and to rid us of the malicious
pests who will end by finding our stores and devouring them."

"We must stay here," said Hatteras.

"Certainly," answered the doctor, "and yet rid ourselves of these
animals."

"There is then a means?" asked Bell.

"A sure means," answered the doctor.

"I said so," cried Johnson, rubbing his hands; "with Dr. Clawbonny, we
need not despair; he always has some invention handy."

"Not always handy; but after thinking for a while--"

"Doctor," interrupted Altamont, "can't the bears get through the
passage-way you cut?"

"No, I took the precaution of closing it behind me; and now we can go
from here to the powder-magazine without their suspecting it."

"Good! Will you tell us what means you intend to employ to rid us of
these unpleasant visitors?"

"Something very simple, and which is already half done."

"How so?"

"You'll see. But I forgot I didn't come alone."

"What do you mean?" asked Johnson.

"I have a companion to introduce to you."

And with these words he pulled in from the gallery the newly killed
body of a fox.

[Illustration]

"A fox!" cried Bell.

"My morning's game," answered the doctor, modestly, "and you'll see no
fox was ever wanted more than this one."

"But what is your plan, after all?" asked Altamont.

"I intend to blow the bears up with a hundred pounds of powder."

They all gazed at the doctor with amazement.

"But the powder?" they asked.

"It is in the magazine."

"And the magazine?"

"This passage-way leads to it. I had my own reason for digging this
passage sixty feet long; I might have attacked the parapet nearer to
the house, but I had my own idea."

"Well, where are you going to put the mine?" asked the American.

"On the slope, as far as possible from the house, the magazine, and
the stores."

"But how shall you get all the bears together?"

"I'll take charge of that," answered the doctor; "but we've talked
enough, now to work; we have a hundred feet to dig out to-night; it's
tiresome work, but we five can do it in relays. Bell shall begin, and
meanwhile we can take some rest."

"Really," said Johnson, "the more I think of it, the more I admire Dr.
Clawbonny's plan."

"It's sure," answered the doctor.

"O, from the moment you opened your mouth they are dead bears, and I
already feel their fur about my shoulders!"

"To work, then!"

The doctor entered the dark gallery, followed by Bell; where the
doctor had gone through, his companions were sure to find no
difficulty; two reached the magazine and entered among the barrels,
which were all arranged in good order. The doctor gave Bell the
necessary instructions; the carpenter began work on the wall towards
the slope, and his companion returned to the house.

[Illustration]

Bell worked for an hour, and dug a passage about ten feet long,
through which one might crawl. Then Altamont took his place, and did
about as much; the snow which was taken from the gallery was carried
into the kitchen, where the doctor melted it at the fire, that it
might take up less room. The captain followed the American; then came
Johnson. In ten hours, that is to say, at about eight o'clock in the
morning, the gallery was finished. At daybreak the doctor peeped at
the bears through a loop-hole in the wall of the powder-magazine.

The patient animals had not left their place; there they were, coming
and going, growling, but in general patrolling patiently; they kept
going around the house, which was gradually disappearing beneath the
snow. But at length they seemed to lose patience, for the doctor saw
them begin to tear away the ice and snow they had heaped up.

"Good!" he said to the captain, who was standing near him.

"What are they doing?" he asked.

"They seem to be trying to destroy what they have done and to get to
us! But they'll be destroyed first! At any rate, there is no time to
lose."

The doctor made his way to the place where the mine was to be laid;
then he enlarged the chamber all the height and breadth of the slope;
a layer of ice, only a foot thick at the outside, remained; it had to
be supported lest it should fall in. A stake resting on the granite
soil served as a post; the fox's body was fastened to the top, and a
long knotted cord ran the whole length of the gallery to the magazine.
The doctor's companions followed his orders without clearly
understanding his intention.

"This is the bait," he said, pointing to the fox.

At the foot of the post he placed a cask holding about a hundred
pounds of powder.

[Illustration]

"And here is the charge," he added.

"But," asked Hatteras, "sha'n't we blow ourselves up at the same
time?"

"No, we are far enough off from the explosion; besides, our house is
solid; and if it is hurt a little we can easily repair it."

"Well," continued Altamont; "but how are you going to set it off?"

"This way. By pulling this cord we pull over the post which holds up
the ice above the powder; the fox's body will suddenly be seen on the
slope, and you must confess that the starving animals will rush upon
this unexpected prey."

"Certainly."

"Well, at that moment I shall explode the mine, and blow up guest and
dinner."

"Well, well!" exclaimed Johnson, who was listening eagerly.

Hatteras had perfect confidence in his friend, and asked no question.
He waited. But Altamont wanted it made perfectly clear.

"Doctor," he began, "how can you calculate the length of the fuse so
exactly that the explosion will take place at the right moment?"

"It's very simple," answered the doctor; "I don't make any
calculation."

"But you have a fuse a hundred feet long?"

"No."

"Shall you set a train of powder simply?"

"No! that might fail."

"Will some one have to volunteer and light the powder?"

"If you want any one," said Johnson, eagerly, "I'm your man."

"It's not necessary, my friend," answered the doctor, grasping the
boatswain's hand; "our five lives are precious, and they will be
spared, thank God!"

"Then," said the American, "I can't guess."

"Well," answered the doctor, smiling, "if we couldn't get out of this
little affair, what would be the use of physics?"

"Ah!" said Johnson, brightening up, "physics!"

"Yes! Haven't we here an electric pile and wires long enough,--those,
you know, which connected with the lighthouse?"

"Well?"

"Well, we shall explode the powder when we please, instantly, and
without danger."

"Hurrah!" shouted Johnson.

"Hurrah!" repeated his companions, not caring whether the enemy heard
them or not. Soon the electric wires were run through the gallery from
the house to the chamber of the mine. One of the extremities remained
at the pile, the other was plunged into the centre of the cask, the
two ends being placed at but a little distance from one another. At
nine of the morning all was finished, and it was time; the bears were
tearing the snow away furiously. The doctor thought the proper time
had come. Johnson was sent to the magazine and charged with pulling
the cord fastened to the post. He took his place.

"Now," said the doctor to his companions, "load your guns in case they
should not be all killed at once, and take your place near Johnson; as
soon as you hear the explosion, run out."

"All right!" said the American.

"And now we have done all that men can do! We have helped ourselves;
may God help us!"

Hatteras, Altamont, and Bell went to the magazine. The doctor remained
alone at the pile. Soon he heard Johnson's voice crying,--

"Ready?"

"All right!" he answered.

Johnson gave a strong pull at the rope; it pulled over the stake; then
he ran to the loop-hole and looked out. The surface of the slope had
sunk in. The fox's body was visible upon the shattered ice. The bears,
at first surprised, crowded about this new prey.

[Illustration]

"Fire!" shouted Johnson.

The doctor at once established the electric current between the
threads; a loud explosion followed; the house shook as if in an
earthquake; the walls fell in. Hatteras, Altamont, and Bell hastened
out of the magazine, ready to fire. But their guns were not needed;
four of the five bears fell about them in fragments, while the fifth,
badly burned, ran away as fast as he could.

[Illustration: "A loud explosion followed."]

"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!" shouted the doctor's companions, while they
crowded about him and embraced him.




CHAPTER XIV.
THE POLAR SPRING.


The prisoners were set free; they expressed their joy by the warmth of
their thanks to the doctor. Johnson regretted somewhat the skins,
which were burned and useless; but his regret did not sour his temper.
They spent the day in repairing the house, which was somewhat injured
by the explosion. They took away the blocks heaped up by the animals,
and the walls were made secure. They worked briskly, encouraged by the
cheery songs of the boatswain.

The next day the weather was much milder; the wind changed suddenly,
and the thermometer rose to +15°. So great a difference was soon felt
by both man and nature. The southerly wind brought with it the first
signs of the polar spring. This comparative warmth lasted for many
days; the thermometer, sheltered from the wind, even rose as high as
+31°, and there were signs of a thaw. The ice began to crack; a few
spirts of salt-water arose here and there, like jets in an English
park; a few days later it rained hard.

[Illustration]

A dense vapor arose from the snow; this was a good sign, and the
melting of the immense masses appeared to be near at hand. The pale
disk of the sun grew brighter and drew longer spirals above the
horizon; the night lasted scarcely three hours. Another similar
symptom was the reappearance of some ptarmigans, arctic geese, plover,
and flocks of quail; the air was soon filled with the deafening cries
which they remembered from the previous summer. A few hares, which
they were able to shoot, appeared on the shores of the bay, as well as
the arctic mice, the burrows of which were like a honeycomb. The
doctor called the attention of his friends to the fact that these
animals began to lose their white winter plumage, or hair, to put on
their summer dress; they were evidently getting ready for summer,
while their sustenance appeared in the form of moss, poppy, saxifrage,
and thin grass. A new life was peering through the melting snows. But
with the harmless animals returned the famished foes; foxes and wolves
arrived in search of their prey; mournful howling sounded during the
brief darkness of the nights.

[Illustration]

The wolf of these countries is near of kin to the dog; like him, it
barks, and often in such a way as to deceive the sharpest ears, those
of the dogs themselves, for instance; it is even said that they employ
this device to attract dogs, and then eat them. This has been observed
on the shores of Hudson's Bay, and the doctor could confirm it at New
America; Johnson took care not to let loose the dogs of the sledge,
who might have been destroyed in that way. As for Duke, he had seen
too many of them, and he was too wise to be caught in any such way.

During a fortnight they hunted a great deal; fresh food was abundant;
they shot partridges, ptarmigans, and snow-birds, which were delicious
eating. The hunters did not go far from Fort Providence. In fact,
small game could almost be killed with a stick; and it gave much
animation to the silent shores of Victoria Bay,--an unaccustomed sight
which delighted their eyes.

The fortnight succeeding the great defeat of the bears was taken up
with different occupations. The thaw advanced steadily; the
thermometer rose to 32°, and torrents began to roar in the ravines,
and thousands of cataracts fell down the declivities. The doctor
cleared an acre of ground and sowed in it cresses, sorrel, and
cochlearia, which are excellent remedies for the scurvy; the little
greenish leaves were peeping above the ground when, with incredible
rapidity, the cold again seized everything.

In a single night, with a violent north-wind, the thermometer fell
forty degrees, to -8°. Everything was frozen; birds, quadrupeds, and
seals disappeared as if by magic; the holes for the seals were closed,
the crevasses disappeared, the ice became as hard as granite, and the
waterfalls hung like long crystal pendants.

It was a total change to the eye; it took place in the night of May
11-12. And when Bell the next morning put his nose out of doors into
this sharp frost, he nearly left it there.

"O, this polar climate!" cried the doctor, a little disappointed;
"that's the way it goes! Well, I shall have to begin sowing again."

[Illustration]

Hatteras took things less philosophically, so eager was he to renew
his explorations. But he had to resign himself.

"Will this cold weather last long?" asked Johnson.

"No, my friend, no," answered Clawbonny; "it's the last touch of
winter we shall have! You know it's at home here, and we can't drive
it away against its will."

"It defends itself well," said Bell, rubbing his face.

"Yes, but I ought to have expected it," said the doctor; "and I should
not have thrown the seed away so stupidly, especially since I might
have started them near the kitchen stove."

"What!" asked Altamont, "could you have foreseen this change of
weather?"

"Certainly, and without resorting to magic. I ought to have put the
seed under the protection of Saints Mamert, Panera, and Servais, whose
days are the 11th, 12th, and 13th of this month."

"Well, Doctor," said Altamont, "will you tell me what influence these
three saints have on the weather?"

"A very great influence, to believe gardeners, who call them the three
saints of ice."

"And why so, pray?"

"Because generally there is a periodic frost in the month of May, and
the greatest fall of temperature takes place from the 11th to the 13th
of this month. It is a fact, that is all."

"It is curious, but what is the explanation?" asked the American.

"There are two: either by the interposition of a greater number of
asteroids between the earth and the sun at this season, or simply by
the melting of the snow, which thereby absorbs a great quantity of
heat. Both explanations are plausible; must they be received? I don't
know; but if I'm uncertain of the truth of the explanation, I ought
not to have been of the fact, and so lose my crop."

The doctor was right; for one reason or another the cold was very
intense during the rest of the month of May; their hunting was
interrupted, not so much by the severity of the weather as by the
absence of game; fortunately, the supply of fresh meat was not yet
quite exhausted. They found themselves accordingly condemned to new
inactivity; for a fortnight, from the 11th to the 25th of May, only
one incident broke the monotony of their lives; a serious illness,
diphtheria, suddenly seized the carpenter; from the swollen tonsils
and the false membrane in the throat, the doctor could not be ignorant
of the nature of the disease; but he was in his element, and he soon
drove it away, for evidently it had not counted on meeting him; his
treatment was very simple, and the medicines were not hard to get; the
doctor simply prescribed pieces of ice to be held in the mouth; in a
few hours the swelling went down and the false membrane disappeared;
twenty-four hours later Bell was up again.

When the others wondered at the doctor's prescriptions: "This is the
land of these complaints," he answered; "the cure must be near the
disease."

"The cure, and especially the doctor," added Johnson, in whose mind
the doctor was assuming colossal proportions.

During this new leisure the latter resolved to have a serious talk
with the captain; he wanted to induce Hatteras to give up his
intention of going northward without carrying some sort of a boat; a
piece of wood, something with which he could cross an arm of the sea,
if they should meet one. The captain, who was fixed in his views, had
formally vowed not to use a boat made of the fragments of the American
ship. The doctor was uncertain how to broach the subject, and yet a
speedy decision was important, for the month of June would be the time
for distant excursions. At last, after long reflection, he took
Hatteras aside one day, and with his usual air of kindness said to
him,--

"Hatteras, you know I am your friend?"

"Certainly," answered the captain, warmly, "my best friend; indeed, my
only one."

"If I give you a piece of advice," resumed the doctor, "advice which
you don't ask for, would you consider it disinterested?"

"Yes, for I know that selfish interest has never been your guide; but
what do you want to say?"

"One moment, Hatteras; I have something else to ask of you: Do you
consider me a true Englishman like yourself, and eager for the glory
of my country?"

Hatteras looked at the doctor with surprise.

"Yes," he answered, with his face expressing surprise at the question.

"You want to reach the North Pole," resumed the doctor; "I understand
your ambition, I share it, but to reach this end we need the means."

"Well, haven't I so far sacrificed everything in order to succeed?"

"No, Hatteras, you have not sacrificed your personal prejudices, and
at this moment I see that you are ready to refuse the indispensable
means of reaching the Pole."

"Ah!" answered Hatteras, "you mean the launch; this man--"

"Come, Hatteras, let us argue coolly, without passion, and look at all
sides of the question. The line of the coast on which we have wintered
may be broken; there is no proof that it runs six degrees to the
north; if the information which has brought you so far is right, we
ought to find a vast extent of open sea during the summer months. Now,
with the Arctic Ocean before us, free of ice and favorable for
navigation, what shall we do if we lack the means of crossing it?"

Hatteras made no answer.

"Do you want to be within a few miles of the Pole without being able
to reach it?"

Hatteras's head sank into his hands.

"And now," continued the doctor, "let us look at the question from a
moral point of view. I can understand that an Englishman should give
up his life and his fortune for the honor of his country. But because
a boat made of a few planks torn from a wrecked American ship first
touches the coast or crosses the unknown ocean, can that diminish the
honor of the discovery? If you found on this shore the hull of an
abandoned ship, should you hesitate to make use of it? Doesn't the
glory of success belong to the head of the expedition? And I ask you
if this launch built by four Englishmen, manned by four Englishmen,
would not be English from keel to gunwale?"

Hatteras was still silent.

"No," said Clawbonny, "let us talk frankly; it's not the boat you
mind, it's the man."

"Yes, Doctor, yes," answered the captain, "that American; I hate him
with real English hate, that man thrown in my way by chance--"

"To save you!"

"To ruin me! He seems to defy me, to act as master, to imagine he
holds my fate in his hands, and to have guessed my plans. Didn't he
show his character when we were giving names to the new lands? Has he
ever said what he was doing here? You can't free me of the idea which
is killing me, that this man is the head of an expedition sent out by
the government of the United States."

"And if he is, Hatteras, what is there to show that he is in search of
the Pole? Can't America try to discover the Northwest Passage as well
as England? At any rate, Altamont is perfectly ignorant of your plans;
for neither Johnson nor Bell nor you nor I has said a single word
about them in his presence."

"Well, I hope he'll never know them!"

"He will know them finally, of course, for we can't leave him alone
here."

"Why not?" asked the captain, with some violence; "can't he remain at
Fort Providence?"

"He would never give his consent, Hatteras; and then to leave him
here, uncertain of finding him again, would be more than imprudent, it
would be inhuman. Altamont will come with us; he must come! But since
there is no need of suggesting new ideas to him, let us say nothing,
and build a launch apparently for reconnoitring these new shores."

Hatteras could not make up his mind to accede to the demands of his
friend, who waited for an answer which did not come.

"And if he refused to let us tear his ship to pieces!" said the
captain, finally.

"In that case, you would have the right on your side; you could build
the boat in spite of him, and he could do nothing about it."

"I hope he will refuse," exclaimed Hatteras.

"Before he refuses," answered the doctor, "he must be asked. I will
undertake to do it."

In fact, that evening, before supper, Clawbonny turned the
conversation to certain proposed expeditions in the summer months for
hydrographic observations.

"I suppose, Altamont," he said, "that you will join us?"

"Certainly," was the reply; "we must know how large New America is."

Hatteras gazed earnestly at his rival while he made his answer.

"And for that," continued Altamont, "we must make the best use we can
of the fragments of the _Porpoise_; let us make a strong boat which
can carry us far."

"You hear, Bell," said the doctor, quickly; "to-morrow we shall set to
work."




CHAPTER XV.
THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE.


The next day Bell, Altamont, and the doctor went to the _Porpoise_;
they found no lack of wood; the old three-masted launch, though
injured by being wrecked, could still supply abundant material for the
new one. The carpenter set to work at once; they needed a seaworthy
boat, which should yet be light enough to carry on a sledge. Towards
the end of May the weather grew warmer; the thermometer rose above the
freezing-point; the spring came in earnest this time, and the men were
able to lay aside their winter clothing. Much rain fell, and soon the
snow began to slide and melt away. Hatteras could not hide his joy at
seeing the first signs of thaw in the ice-fields. The open sea meant
liberty for him.

[Illustration: "The carpenter set to work at once."]

[Illustration]

Whether or not his predecessors had been wrong on this great question
of an open polar sea, he hoped soon to know. All chance of success in
his undertaking depended on this. One evening, after a warm day in
which the ice had given unmistakable signs of breaking up, he turned
the conversation to the question of an open sea. He took up the
familiar arguments, and found the doctor, as ever, a warm advocate of
his doctrine. Besides, his conclusions were evidently accurate.

"It is plain," he said, "that if the ocean before Victoria Bay gets
clear of ice, its southern part will also be clear as far as New
Cornwall and Queen's Channel. Penny and Belcher saw it in that state,
and they certainly saw clearly."

"I agree with you, Hatteras," answered the doctor, "and I have no
reason for doubting the word of these sailors; a vain attempt has been
made to explain their discovery as an effect of mirage; but they were
so certain, it was impossible that they could have made such a
mistake."

"I always thought so," said Altamont; "the polar basin extends to the
east as well as to the west."

"We can suppose so, at any rate," answered Hatteras.

"We ought to suppose so," continued the American, "for this open sea
which Captains Penny and Belcher saw near the coast of Grinnell Land
was seen by Morton, Kane's lieutenant, in the straits which are named
after that bold explorer."

"We are not in Kane's sea," answered Hatteras, coldly, "and
consequently we cannot verify the fact."

"It is supposable, at least," said Altamont.

"Certainly," replied the doctor, who wished to avoid useless
discussion. "What Altamont thinks ought to be the truth; unless there
is a peculiar disposition of the surrounding land, the same effects
appear at the same latitudes. Hence I believe the sea is open in the
east as well as in the west."

"At any rate, it makes very little difference to us," said Hatteras.

"I don't agree with you, Hatteras," resumed the American, who was
beginning to be annoyed by the affected unconcern of the captain; "it
may make considerable difference to us."

"And when, if I may ask?"

"When we think of returning."

"Returning!" cried Hatteras, "and who's thinking of that?"

"No one," answered Altamont; "but we shall stop somewhere, I suppose."

"And where?" asked Hatteras.

For the first time the question was fairly put to Altamont. The doctor
would have given one of his arms to have put a stop to the discussion.
Since Altamont made no answer, the captain repeated his question.

"And where?"

"Where we are going," answered the American, quietly.

"And who knows where that is?" said the peace-loving doctor.

"I say, then," Altamont went on, "that if we want to make use of the
polar basin in returning, we can try to gain Kane's sea; it will lead
us more directly to Baffin's Bay."

"So that is your idea?" asked the captain, ironically.

"Yes, that is my idea, as it is that if these seas ever become
practicable, they will be reached by the straightest way. O, that was
a great discovery of Captain Kane's!"

"Indeed!" said Hatteras, biting his lips till they bled.

"Yes," said the doctor, "that cannot be denied; every one should have
the praise he deserves."

"Without considering," went on the obstinate American, "that no one
had ever before gone so far to the north."

"I like to think," said Hatteras, "that now the English have got ahead
of him."

"And the Americans!" said Altamont.

"Americans!" repeated Hatteras.

"What am I, then?" asked Altamont, proudly.

"You are," answered Hatteras, who could hardly control his
voice,--"you are a man who presumes to accord equal glory to science
and to chance! Your American captain went far to the north, but as
chance alone--"

"Chance!" shouted Altamont; "do you dare to say that this great
discovery is not due to Kane's energy and knowledge?"

"I say," answered Hatteras, "that Kane's name is not fit to be
pronounced in a country made famous by Parry, Franklin, Ross, Belcher,
and Penny in these seas which opened the Northwest Passage to
MacClure--"

"MacClure!" interrupted the American; "you mention that man, and yet
you complain of the work of chance? Wasn't it chance alone that
favored him?"

"No," answered Hatteras, warmly,--"no! It was his courage, his
perseverance in spending four winters in the ice--"

"I should think so!" retorted the American; "he got caught in the ice
and couldn't get out, and he had to abandon the _Investigator_ at last
to go back to England."

"My friends--" said the doctor.

"Besides," Altamont went on, "let us consider the result. You speak of
the Northwest Passage; well, it has yet to be discovered!"

Hatteras started at these words; no more vexatious question could have
arisen between two rival nationalities. The doctor again tried to
intervene.

"You are mistaken, Altamont," he said.

"No, I persist in my opinions," he said obstinately; "the Northwest
Passage is yet to be found, to be sailed through, if you like that any
better! MacClure never penetrated it, and to this day no ship that has
sailed from Behring Strait has reached Baffin's Bay!"

That was true, speaking exactly. What answer could be made?

Nevertheless, Hatteras rose to his feet and said,--

"I shall not permit the good name of an English captain to be attacked
any further in my presence."

"You will not permit it?" answered the American, who also rose to his
feet; "but these are the facts, and it is beyond your power to destroy
them."

"Sir!" said Hatteras, pale with anger.

"My friends," said the doctor, "don't get excited! We are discussing a
scientific subject."

Clawbonny looked with horror at a scientific discussion into which the
hate of an American and an Englishman could enter.

"I am going to give you the facts," began Hatteras, threateningly.

"But I'm speaking now!" retorted the American.

Johnson and Bell became very uneasy.

"Gentlemen," said the doctor, severely, "let me say a word! I insist
upon it, I know the facts as well, better than you do, and I can speak
of them impartially."

"Yes, yes," said Bell and Johnson, who were distressed at the turn the
discussion had taken, and who formed a majority favorable to the
doctor.

"Go on, Doctor," said Johnson, "these gentlemen will listen, and you
cannot fail to give us some information."

"Go on, Doctor," said the American.

Hatteras resumed his place with a sign of acquiescence, and folded his
arms.

"I will tell the simple truth about the facts," said the doctor, "and
you must correct me if I omit or alter any detail."

"We know you, Doctor," said Bell, "and you can speak without fear of
interruption."

"Here is the chart of the Polar Seas," resumed the doctor, who had
brought it to the table; "it will be easy to trace MacClure's course,
and you will be able to make up your minds for yourselves."

Thereupon he unrolled one of the excellent maps published by order of
the Admiralty, containing the latest discoveries in arctic regions;
then he went on:--

"You know, in 1848, two ships, the _Herald_, Captain Kellet, and the
_Plover_, Commander Moore, were sent to Behring Strait in search of
traces of Franklin; their search was vain; in 1850 they were joined by
MacClure, who commanded the _Investigator_, a ship in which he had
sailed, in 1849, under James Ross's orders. He was followed by Captain
Collinson, his chief, who sailed in the _Enterprise_; but he arrived
before him. At Behring Strait he declared he would wait no longer, and
that he would go alone, on his own responsibility, and--you hear me,
Altamont--that he would find either Franklin or the passage."

Altamont showed neither approbation nor the contrary.

"August 5, 1850," continued the doctor, "after a final communication
with the _Plover_, MacClure sailed eastward by an almost unknown
route; see how little land is marked upon the chart. August 30th he
rounded Cape Bathurst; September 6th he discovered Baring Land, which
he afterwards discovered to form part of Banks Land, then Prince
Albert's Land. Then he resolved to enter the long straits between
these two large islands, and he called it Prince of Wales Strait. You
can follow his plan. He hoped to come out in Melville Sound, which we
have just crossed, and with reason; but the ice at the end of the
strait formed an impassable barrier. There MacClure wintered in
1850-51, and meanwhile he pushed on over the ice, to make sure that
the strait connected with the sound."

"Yes," said Altamont, "but he didn't succeed."

"One moment," said the doctor. "While wintering there, MacClure's
officers explored all the neighboring coasts: Creswell, Baring's Land;
Haswell, Prince Albert's Land, to the south; and Wynniat, Cape Walker,
to the north. In July, at the beginning of the thaw, MacClure tried a
second time to carry the _Investigator_ to Melville Sound; he got
within twenty miles of it, twenty miles only, but the winds carried
him with irresistible force to the south, before he could get through
the obstacle. Then he determined to go back through Prince of Wales
Strait, and go around Banks Land, to try at the west what he could not
do in the east; he put about; the 18th he rounded Cape Kellet; the
19th, Cape Prince Alfred, two degrees higher; then, after a hard
struggle with the icebergs, he was caught in Banks Strait, in the
series of straits leading to Baffin's Bay."

[Illustration: "A hard struggle with the icebergs."]

"But he couldn't get through them," said Altamont.

"Wait a moment, and be as patient as MacClure was. September 26th, he
took his station for the winter in Mercy Bay, and stayed there till
1852. April came; MacClure had supplies for only eighteen months.
Nevertheless, he was unwilling to return; he started, crossing Banks
Strait by sledge, and reached Melville Island. Let us follow him. He
hoped to find here Commander Austin's ships, which were sent to meet
him by Baffin's Bay and Lancaster Sound; April 28th he arrived at
Winter Harbor, at the place where Parry had wintered thirty-three
years previously, but no trace of the ships; only he found in a cairn
a paper, telling him that MacClintock, Austin's lieutenant, had been
there the year before, and gone away. Any one else would have been in
despair, but MacClure was not. He put in the cairn another paper, in
which he announced his intention of returning to England by the
Northwest Passage, which he had discovered by reaching Baffin's Bay
and Lancaster Sound. If he is not heard from again, it will be because
he will have been to the north or west of Melville Island; then he
returned, not discouraged, to Mercy Bay for the third winter,
1852-53."

"I have never doubted his courage," said Altamont, "but his success."

"Let us follow him again," resumed the doctor. "In the month of March,
being on two-thirds rations, at the end of a very severe winter, when
no game was to be had, MacClure determined to send back half of his
crew to England, either by Baffin's Bay, or by Mackenzie River and
Hudson's Bay; the other half was to bring the _Investigator_ back. He
chose the weakest men, who could not stand a fourth winter; everything
was ready, and their departure settled for April 15th, when on the
6th, MacClure, who was walking on the ice with his lieutenant,
Creswell, saw a man running northward and gesticulating; it was
Lieutenant Pim of the _Herald_, lieutenant of the same Captain Kellet
whom two years before he had left at Behring Strait, as I said when I
began. Kellet, having reached Winter Harbor, found the paper left
there by MacClure; having heard in that way of his position in Mercy
Bay, he sent Lieutenant Pim to meet the captain. He was followed by a
detachment of the men of the _Herald_, among whom was a midshipman of
a French ship, M. de Bray, who was a volunteer aid of Captain Kellet.
You don't doubt this meeting?"

[Illustration: MacClure saw a man running and gesticulating.]

"Not at all," answered Altamont.

"Well, see what followed, and whether the Northwest Passage was really
made. If you join Parry's discoveries to those of MacClure, you will
see the northern coast of America was rounded."

"But not by a single ship," said Altamont.

"No, but by a single man. Let us go on. MacClure went to see Captain
Kellet at Melville Island; in twelve days he made the one hundred and
seventy miles between Winter Harbor and the island; he agreed with the
commander of the _Herald_ to send him his sick, and returned; many
others would have thought, had they been in MacClure's place, that
they had done enough, but this bold young man determined to try his
fortune again. Then, and please observe this, Lieutenant Creswell,
with the sick and disabled men of the _Investigator_, left Mercy Bay,
reached Winter Harbor, and from there, after a journey of four hundred
and seventy miles on the ice, reached Beechey Island, June 2d, and a
few days later, with twelve of his men, he took passage on board of
the _Phoenix_."

"In which I was at the time," said Johnson, "with Captain Inglefield,
and we returned to England."

"And October 7, 1853," continued the doctor, "Creswell arrived at
London, after having crossed over the whole distance between Behring
Strait and Cape Farewell."

"Well," said Hatteras, "to enter at one end and go out by the other,
isn't that going through?"

"Yes," answered Altamont, "but by going four hundred and seventy miles
over the ice."

"Well, what difference does that make?"

"The whole," answered the American. "Did MacClure's ship make the
passage?"

"No," answered the doctor, "for after a fourth winter, MacClure was
obliged to leave it in the ice."

"Well, in a sea-voyage it's important to have the ship reach her
destination. If the Northwest Passage ever becomes practicable, it
must be for ships and not for sledges. The ship must accomplish the
voyage, or if not the ship, the launch."

"The launch!" shouted Hatteras, who detected the hidden meaning in the
American's words.

"Altamont," said the doctor, hurriedly, "you make a puerile
distinction, and we all consider you wrong."

"That is easy, gentlemen," answered the American; "you are four to
one. But that won't keep me from holding my own opinion."

"Keep it," said Hatteras, "and so closely that we need hear nothing
about it."

"And what right have you to speak to me in that way?" asked the
American in a rage.

"My right as captain," answered Hatteras.

"Am I under your commands?" retorted Altamont.

"Without doubt, and look out for yourself, if--"

The doctor, Johnson, and Bell intervened. It was time; the two enemies
were gazing at one another. The doctor was very anxious. Still, after
a few gentler words, Altamont went off to bed whistling "Yankee
Doodle," and, whether he slept or not, he did not speak. Hatteras went
out and paced up and down for an hour, and then he turned in without
saying a word.

[Illustration: "The doctor, Johnson, and Bell intervened. It was time;
the two enemies were gazing at one another."]




CHAPTER XVI.
NORTHERN ARCADIA.


On May 29th, for the first time, the sun did not set; it merely
touched the horizon and then rose at once; the day was twenty-four
hours long. The next day it was surrounded by a magnificent halo, a
bright circle with all the colors of the prism; this apparition, which
was by no means rare, always attracted the doctor's attention; he
never failed to note the date and appearance of the phenomenon; the
one he saw on that day was of an elliptic shape, which he had seldom
seen before.

Soon the noisy flocks of birds appeared; bustards and wild geese came
from Florida or Arkansas, flying northward with inconceivable rapidity
and bringing the spring with them. The doctor shot a few, as well as
three or four cranes and a single stork. However, the snow was melting
everywhere beneath the sun; the salt-water, which overran the
ice-field through the crevasses and the seal-holes, hastened the
melting; the ice which was mingled with salt-water formed a soft
slush. Large pools appeared on the land near the bay, and the exposed
soil seemed to be a production of the arctic spring.

[Illustration]

The doctor then resumed his planting; he had plenty of seed; besides,
he was surprised to see a sort of sorrel growing naturally between the
dried rocks, and he wondered at the force of nature which demanded so
little in order to manifest itself. He sowed some cresses, of which
the young sprouts, three weeks later, were already an inch long.

The heath began to show timidly its little pale, rosy flowers. In
fact, the flora of New America is very defective; still, this rare
vegetation was agreeable to their eyes; it was all the feeble rays of
the sun could nourish, a trace of the Providence which had not
completely forgotten these distant countries. At last it became really
warm; June 15th the thermometer stood at 57°; the doctor could hardly
believe his eyes; the country changed its appearance; numerous noisy
cascades fell from the sunny summits of the hills; the ice loosened,
and the great question of an open sea would soon be decided. The air
was full of the noise of avalanches falling from the hills to the
bottom of the ravines, and the cracking of the ice-field produced a
deafening sound.

A trip was made to Johnson Island; it was merely an unimportant, arid,
barren island; but the old boatswain was no less proud of giving his
name to a few desolate rocks. He even wanted to carve it on a high
peak. During this excursion, Hatteras had carefully explored these
lands, even beyond Cape Washington; the melting of the snow sensibly
changed the country; ravines and hillocks appeared here and there,
where the snow indicated nothing but monotonous stretches. The house
and magazines threatened to melt away, and they had frequently to be
repaired; fortunately, a temperature of 57° is rare in these
latitudes, and the mean is hardly above the freezing-point.

By the middle of June the launch was far advanced and getting into
shape. While Bell and Johnson were working at it, the others had a few
successful hunts. Reindeer were shot, although they are hard to
approach; but Altamont put in practice a device employed by the
Indians of his own country; he crept over the ground with his gun and
arms outstretched like the horns of one of these shy animals, and
having thus come within easy gunshot, he could not fail.

But the best game, the musk-ox, of which Parry found plenty at
Melville Island, appeared not to frequent the shores of Victoria Bay.
A distant hunt was determined on, as much to get these valuable
animals as to reconnoitre the eastern lands. Hatteras did not propose
to reach the Pole by this part of the continent, but the doctor was
not sorry to get a general idea of the country. Hence they decided to
start to the east of Fort Providence. Altamont intended to hunt; Duke
naturally was of the party.

[Illustration]

So, Monday, June 17th, a pleasant day, with the thermometer at 41°,
and the air quiet and clear, the three hunters, each carrying a
double-barrelled gun, a hatchet, a snow-knife, and followed by Duke,
left Doctor's House at six o'clock in the morning. They were fitted
out for a trip of two or three days, with the requisite amount of
provisions. By eight o'clock Hatteras and his two companions had gone
eight miles. Not a living thing had tempted a shot, and their hunt
threatened to be merely a trip.

This new country exhibited vast plains running out of sight; new
streams divided them everywhere, and large, unruffled pools reflected
the sun. The layers of melting ice bared the ground to their feet; it
belonged to the great division of sedimentary earth, and the result of
the action of the water, which is so common on the surface of the
globe. Still a few erratic blocks were seen of a singular nature,
foreign to the soil where they were found, and whose presence it was
hard to explain. Schists and different productions of limestone were
found in abundance, as was also a sort of strange, transparent,
colorless crystal, which has a refraction peculiar to Iceland spar.

[Illustration]

But, although he was not hunting, the doctor had not time to
geologize; he had to walk too quickly, in order to keep up with his
friends. Still, he observed the land and talked as much as possible,
for had he not there would have been total silence in the little band;
neither Altamont nor the captain had any desire to talk to one
another.

By ten o'clock the hunters had got a dozen miles to the east; the sea
was hidden beneath the horizon; the doctor proposed a halt for
breakfast. They swallowed it rapidly, and in half an hour they were
off again. The ground was sloping gently; a few patches of snow,
preserved either by their position or the slope of the rocks, gave it
a woolly appearance, like waves in a high wind. The country was still
barren, and looking as if no living being had ever set foot in it.

"We have no luck," said Altamont to the doctor; "to be sure, the
country doesn't offer much food to animals, but the game here ought
not to be over-particular, and ought to show itself."

"Don't let us despair," said the doctor; "the summer has hardly begun;
and if Parry met so many animals at Melville Island, we may be as
lucky here."

[Illustration]

"Still, we are farther north," said Hatteras.

"Certainly, but that is unimportant; it is the pole of cold we ought
to consider; that is to say, that icy wilderness in the middle of
which we wintered with the _Forward_; now the farther north we go, the
farther we are from the coldest part of the globe; we ought to find,
beyond, what Parry, Ross, and others found on the other side."

"Well," said Altamont, with a regretful sigh, "so far we've been
travellers rather than hunters."

"Be patient," answered the doctor; "the country is changing gradually,
and I should be astonished if we don't find game enough in the ravines
where vegetation has had a chance to sprout."

"It must be said," continued Altamont, "that we are going through an
uninhabited and uninhabitable country."

"O, uninhabitable is a strong word!" answered the doctor; "I can't
believe any land uninhabitable; man, by many sacrifices, and for
generations using all the resources of science, might finally
fertilize such a country."

[Illustration]

"Do you think so?" asked Altamont.

"Without doubt! If you were to go to the celebrated countries of the
world, to Thebes, Nineveh, or Babylon, in the fertile valleys of our
ancestors, it would seem impossible that men should ever have lived
there; the air itself has grown bad since the disappearance of human
beings. It is the general law of nature which makes those countries in
which we do not live unhealthy and sterile, like those out of which
life has died. In fact, man himself makes his own country by his
presence, his habits, his industry, and, I might add, by his breath;
he gradually modifies the exhalations of the soil and the atmospheric
conditions, and he makes the air he breathes wholesome. So there are
uninhabited lands, I grant, but none uninhabitable."

Talking in this way, the hunters, who had become naturalists, pushed
on and reached a sort of valley, fully exposed, at the bottom of which
a river, nearly free of ice, was flowing; its southern exposure had
brought forth a certain amount of vegetation. The earth showed a
strong desire to grow fertile; with a few inches of rich soil it would
have produced a good deal. The doctor called their attention to these
indications.

"See," he said, "a few hardy colonists might settle in this ravine.
With industry and perseverance they could do a great deal; not as much
as is seen in the temperate zones, but a respectable show. If I am not
mistaken, there are some four-footed animals! They know the good
spots."

"They are Arctic hares," shouted Altamont, cocking his gun.

"Wait a moment," cried the doctor,--"wait a moment, you hasty fellow.
They don't think of running away! See, they'll come to us!"

[Illustration]

And, in fact, three or four young hares, springing about in the heath
and young moss, ran boldly towards the three men; they were so cunning
that even Altamont was softened.

Soon they were between the doctor's legs; he caressed them with his
hand, saying,--

"Why shoot these little animals which come to be petted? We need not
kill them."

"You are right, Doctor," answered Hatteras; "we'll let them live."

"And these ptarmigan, too, which are flying towards us!" cried
Altamont; "and these long-legged water-fowl!"

A whole flock of birds passed over the hunters, not suspecting the
peril from which the doctor's presence saved them. Even Duke was
compelled to admire them.

They were a curious and touching sight, flying about without fear,
resting on Clawbonny's shoulders, lying at his feet, offering
themselves to his caresses, seeming to do their best to welcome their
new guests; they called one another joyously, flying from the most
distant points; the doctor seemed to be a real bird-charmer. The
hunters continued their march up the moist banks of the brook,
followed by the familiar band, and turning from the valley they
perceived a troop of eight or ten reindeer browsing on a few lichens
half buried beneath the snow; they were graceful, quiet animals, with
their branching antlers, which the female carried as well as the male;
their wool-like fur was already losing its winter whiteness in favor
of the summer brown and gray; they seemed no more timid than the hares
and birds of the country. Such were the relations of the first men to
the first animals in the early ages of the world.

[Illustration: "They were a curious and touching sight, flying about
without fear, resting on Clawbonny's shoulders," etc.]

The hunters reached the middle of the band without any one flying;
this time the doctor found it hard to restrain the instincts of
Altamont, who could not calmly look on this game without a thirst for
blood rising in his brain. Hatteras looked mildly at these gentle
beasts, who rubbed their noses against the doctor's clothes; he was
the friend of all the animals.

"But," said Altamont, "didn't we come here to shoot?"

"To shoot musk-ox," answered Clawbonny, "and nothing else! We should
have no need of this game; we have food enough, so let us enjoy the
sight of man walking thus among these animals, without alarming them."

"That proves they have never seen one before," said Hatteras.

"Evidently," answered the doctor; "and so we can be sure that these
animals are not of American origin."

"And why so?" said Altamont.

"If they were born on the continent of North America, they would know
what to think of men, and they would have fled at the sight of us. No;
they probably came from the north, from those unknown lands where our
kind has never set foot, and they have crossed the continents near the
Pole. So, Altamont, you can't claim them as your fellow-countrymen."

"O," answered Altamont, "a hunter does not scrutinize so closely, and
the game belongs to the land where it was shot!"

"Well, calm yourself, my Nimrod! As for me, I would rather never fire
a gun in my life than alarm this timid population. See, even Duke
fraternizes with the charming beasts! Come, we'll be kind when we can!
Kindness is a force!"

"Well, well," answered Altamont, who sympathized but slightly with
this sensitiveness; "but I should be amused to see you armed with this
kindness alone among a flock of bears or wolves!"

[Illustration]

"O, I don't pretend to charm wild beasts!" answered the doctor; "I
have little faith in the enchantment of Orpheus; besides, bears and
wolves wouldn't come up to us like the hares, partridges, and
reindeer."

"Why not," answered Altamont, "if they have never seen men?"

"Because they are naturally ferocious, and ferocity, like
maliciousness, begets suspicion; a remark which is true of man as well
as of animals. A wicked man is distrustful, and fear is commonly found
in those who are able to inspire it."

This little lesson in natural philosophy ended the conversation.

The whole day was passed in this Northern Arcadia, as the doctor named
the valley, with the consent of his companions; and that evening,
after a supper which had not cost the life of a single inhabitant of
the country, the three hunters went to sleep in a cleft of a rock
which was admirably adapted for a shelter.




CHAPTER XVII.
ALTAMONT'S REVENGE.


The next day the doctor and his two companions woke up after a
perfectly quiet night. The cold, although not keen, increased towards
daybreak, but they were well covered, and slept soundly under the
watch of the peaceful animals.

The weather being pleasant, they resolved to consecrate the day to a
reconnaissance of the country, and the search of musk-oxen. Altamont
insisted on shooting something, and they decided that, even if these
oxen should be the gentlest animals in the world, they should be shot.
Besides, their flesh, although strongly flavored with musk, was
pleasant eating, and they all hoped to carry back to Fort Providence a
good supply of it.

During the early morning hours nothing noteworthy took place; the land
grew different in the northeast; a few elevations, the beginning of a
mountainous district, indicated a change. If this New America were not
a continent, it was at any rate an important island; but then they did
not have to trouble themselves about its geography.

Duke ran ahead, and soon came across some traces of a herd of
musk-oxen; he then advanced rapidly, and soon disappeared from the
eyes of the hunters. They followed his clear barking, which soon grew
so hasty that they knew he had discovered the object of their search.
They pushed on, and in an hour and a half they came up to two of these
animals; they were large, and formidable in appearance. They appeared
much surprised at Duke's attacks, but not alarmed; they were feeding
off a sort of reddish moss which grew on the thin soil. The doctor
recognized them at once from their moderate height, their horns, which
were broad at the base, the absence of muzzle, their sheep-like
forehead, and short tail; their shape has earned for them from
naturalists the name of "ovibos," a compound, and which expresses the
two sorts of animals whose characteristics they share. Thick, long
hair and a sort of delicate brown silk formed their fur.

[Illustration]

They ran away when they saw the two hunters, who came running up after
them. It was hard to reach them for men who were out of breath after
running half an hour. Hatteras and his companions stopped.

"The Devil!" said Altamont.

"That's just the word," said the doctor, as soon as he could take
breath. "I'll grant they are Americans, and they can't have a very
good idea of your countrymen."

"That proves we are good hunters," answered Altamont.

Still, the musk-oxen, seeing they were not pursued, stopped in a
posture of surprise. It became evident that they could never be run
down; they would have to be surrounded; the plateau on which they were
aided this manoeuvre. The hunters, leaving Duke to harass them,
descended through the neighboring ravines, so as to get around the
plateau. Altamont and the doctor hid behind a rock at one end, while
Hatteras, suddenly advancing from the other end, should drive the oxen
towards them. In half an hour each had gained his post.

"You don't object any longer to our shooting?" asked Altamont.

"No, it's fair fighting," answered the doctor, who, in spite of
gentleness, was a real sportsman.

They were talking in this way, when they saw the oxen running, and
Duke at their heels; farther on Hatteras was driving them, with loud
cries, towards the American and the doctor, who ran to meet this
magnificent prey.

[Illustration]

At once the oxen stopped, and, less fearful of a single enemy, they
turned upon Hatteras. He awaited them calmly, aimed at the nearest,
and fired; but the bullet struck the animal in the middle of his
forehead, without penetrating the skull. Hatteras's second shot
produced no other effect than to make the beasts furious; they ran to
the disarmed hunter, and threw him down at once.

"He is lost," cried the doctor.

At the moment Clawbonny pronounced these words with an accent of
despair, Altamont made a step forward to run to Hatteras's aid; then
he stopped, struggling against himself and his prejudices.

"No," he cried, "that would be cowardice."

He hastened with Clawbonny to the scene of combat. His hesitation had
not lasted half a second. But if the doctor saw what was taking place
in the American's heart, Hatteras understood it, who would rather have
died than have implored his rival's interference. Still, he had hardly
time to perceive it, for Altamont appeared before him. Hatteras, lying
on the ground, was trying to ward off the horns and hoofs of the two
animals. But he could not long continue so unequal a struggle. He was
about to be torn in pieces, when two shots were heard. Hatteras heard
the bullets whistling by his head.

"Don't be frightened!" shouted Altamont, hurling his gun to one side,
and rushing upon the angry animals.

One of the oxen fell, shot through the heart; the other, wild with
rage, was just going to gore the captain, when Altamont faced him, and
plunged into his mouth his hand, armed with a snow-knife; with the
other he gave him a terrible blow with a hatchet on the head. This was
done with marvellous rapidity, and a flash of lightning would have lit
up the whole scene.

[Illustration: "Gave him a terrible blow with a hatchet on the head."]

The second ox fell back dead.

"Hurrah! hurrah!" cried Clawbonny.

Hatteras was saved. He owed his life to the man whom he detested most
in the world. What was going on in his mind at this time? What emotion
was there which he could not master? That is one of the secrets of the
heart which defy all analysis.

However that may be, Hatteras advanced to his rival without
hesitation, and said to him seriously,--

"You have saved my life, Altamont."

"You saved mine," answered the American. There was a moment's silence.
Then Altamont added, "We are now quits, Hatteras!"

"No, Altamont," answered the captain; "when the doctor took you from
your icy tomb, I did not know who you were, and you have saved me at
the risk of your own life, knowing who I was."

"You are a fellow-being," answered Altamont; "and whatever else he may
be, an American is not a coward."

"No, he is not," said the doctor; "he is a man! a man like you,
Hatteras!"

"And like me he shall share the glory which is awaiting us!"

"The glory of going to the North Pole?" said Altamont.

"Yes," said the captain, haughtily.

"I had guessed it!" exclaimed the American. "So you dared conceive of
this bold design! You dared try to reach that inaccessible point! Ah,
that is great! It is sublime!"

"But you," asked Hatteras, hurriedly, "were you not on your way to the
Pole?"

Altamont seemed to hesitate about replying.

"Well?" said the doctor.

"Well, no," answered the American,--"no; tell the truth, and shame the
Devil! No, I did not have this great idea, which has brought you here.
I was trying simply to sail through the Northwest Passage, that is
all."

"Altamont," said Hatteras, holding out his hand to the American,
"share our glory, and go with us to the North Pole!"

The two men then shook hands warmly.

When they turned towards the doctor, they saw his eyes full of tears.

"Ah, my friends," he murmured, as he dried his eyes, "how can my heart
hold the joy with which you fill it? My dear companions, you have
sacrificed a miserable question of nationality in order to unite in
your common success! You know that England and America have nothing to
do with all this; that mutual sympathy ought to bind you together
against the dangers of the journey! If the North Pole is discovered,
what difference does it make who does it? Why stand bickering about
English or American, when we can be proud of being men?"

The doctor embraced the reconciled foes; he could not restrain his
joy. The two new friends felt themselves drawn closer together by the
friendship this worthy man had for them both. Clawbonny spoke freely
of the vanity of competition, of the madness of rivalry, and of the
need of agreement between men so far from home. His words, his tears
and caresses, came from the bottom of his heart.

Still, he grew calm after embracing Hatteras and Altamont for the
twentieth time.

"And now," he said, "to work, to work! Since I was no use as a hunter,
let me try in another capacity!"

Thereupon he started to cut up the ox, which he called the "ox of
reconciliation," but he did it as skilfully as if he were a surgeon
conducting a delicate autopsy. His two companions gazed at him in
amusement. In a few minutes he had cut from the body a hundred pounds
of flesh; he gave each one a third of it, and they again took up their
march to Fort Providence. At ten o'clock in the evening, after walking
in the oblique rays of the sun, they reached Doctor's House, where
Johnson and Bell had a good supper awaiting them.

But before they sat down to table, the doctor said in a voice of
triumph, as he pointed to his two companions,--

"Johnson, I carried away with me an Englishman and an American, did I
not?"

"Yes, Dr. Clawbonny," answered the boatswain.

"Well, I've brought back two brothers."

[Illustration: "'Well, I've brought back two brothers.'"]

The two sailors gladly shook Altamont's hand; the doctor told them
what the American captain had done for the English captain, and that
night the snow-house held five perfectly happy men.




CHAPTER XVIII.
THE LAST PREPARATIONS.


The next day the weather changed; there was a return of cold; the snow
and rain gust raged for many days.

Bell had finished the launch; it was perfectly satisfactory for the
purpose it was intended for; partly decked, and partly open, it could
sail in heavy weather under mainsail and jib, while it was so light as
not to be too heavy a load on the sledge for the dogs.

[Illustration]

Then, too, a change of great importance was taking place in the state
of the polar basin. The ice in the middle of the bay was beginning to
give way; the tallest pieces, forever weakened by the collision of the
rest, only needed a sufficiently heavy tempest to be torn away and to
become icebergs. Still, Hatteras was unwilling to wait so long before
starting. Since it was to be a land journey, he cared very little
whether the sea was open or not. He determined to start June 25th;
meanwhile all the preparations could be completed. Johnson and Bell
put the sledge into perfect repair; the frame was strengthened and the
runners renewed. The travellers intended to devote to their journey
the few weeks of good weather which nature allows to these northern
regions. Their sufferings would be less severe, the obstacles easier
to overcome.

[Illustration]

A few days before their departure, June 20th, the ice had so many free
passages, that they were able to make a trial trip on board of the new
launch as far as Cape Washington. The sea was not perfectly free, far
from it; but its surface was not solid, and it would have been
impossible to make a trip on foot over the ice-fields. This half-day's
sail showed the good sailing qualities of the launch. During the
return they beheld a curious incident. It was a monstrous bear chasing
a seal. Fortunately the former was so busily occupied, that he did not
see the launch, otherwise he would certainly have pursued it; he kept
on watch near a crevasse in the ice-field, into which the seal had
evidently plunged. He was awaiting his reappearance with all the
patience of a hunter, or rather of a fisherman, for he was really
fishing. He was silent, motionless, without any sign of life. Suddenly
the surface of the water was agitated; the seal had come up to
breathe. The bear crouched low upon the ice, and rounded his two paws
about the crevasse. The next moment the seal appeared, with his head
above water; but he had not time to withdraw it. The bear's paws, as
if driven by a spring, were clashed together, strangling the animal
with irresistible force and dragging it out of the water.

It was but a brief struggle; the seal struggled for a few seconds, and
was then suffocated on the breast of his adversary, who, dragging him
away easily, in spite of his size, and springing lightly from one
piece of ice to another, reached land and disappeared with his prey.

[Illustration: "The seal struggled for a few seconds, and was then
suffocated on the breast of his adversary."]

"A pleasant journey!" shouted Johnson; "that bear has got rather too
many paws!"

The launch soon reached the little anchorage Bell had made for her in
the ice.

Only four days were there before the time fixed for their departure.
Hatteras hurried on the last preparations; he was in a hurry to leave
New America, a land which was not his, and which he had not named; he
did not feel at home.

[Illustration]

June 22d they began to carry to the sledge their camp-material, tent,
and food. They carried only two hundred pounds of salt meat, three
chests of preserved meat and vegetables, fifty pounds of pickles and
lime-juice, five quarters of flour, packets of cresses and cochlearia
from the doctor's garden; with the addition of two hundred pounds of
powder, the instruments, arms, and personal baggage, the launch,
Halkett-boat, and the weight of the sledge itself, the whole weighed
fifteen hundred pounds,--a heavy load for four dogs, especially since,
unlike the Esquimaux, who never travel more than four days in
succession, they had none to replace them, and would have to work them
every day. But the travellers determined to aid them when it was
necessary, and they intended to proceed by easy stages; the distance
from Victoria Bay to the Pole was three hundred and fifty-five miles
at the outside, and going twelve miles a day they could make the
journey in a month. Besides, when the land came to an end, the launch
would enable them to finish the journey without fatigue for dogs or
men.

The latter were well, and in excellent condition. The winter, although
severe, ended favorably enough. Each one had followed the doctor's
advice, and escaped from the diseases common in these severe climates.
In fact, they had grown a trifle thinner, which gave a great deal of
pleasure to Clawbonny; but their bodies were inured to the rigors of
that life, and these men were able to face the severest attacks of
cold and hunger without succumbing. And then, too, they were going to
the end of their journey, to the inaccessible Pole, after which their
only thought would be of returning. The sympathy which bound together
the five members of the expedition would aid their success in this
bold trip, and no one doubted of their success.

As a precaution, the doctor had urged his companions to prepare
themselves for some time beforehand, and to "train" with much care.

"My friends," he used to say, "I don't ask you to imitate the English
racers, who lose eighteen pounds after two days' training, and
twenty-five after five days, but we ought to do something to get into
the best possible condition for a long journey. Now the first
principle of training is to get rid of the fat on both horse and
jockey, and this is done by means of purging, sweating, and violent
exercise. These gentlemen know they will lose so much by medicine, and
they arrive at their results with incredible accuracy; such a one who
before training could not run a mile without being winded, can run
twenty-five easily after it. There was a certain Townsend who ran a
hundred miles in twelve hours without stopping."

"A good result," answered Johnson; "and although we are not very fat,
if we must get thinner yet--"

"There is no need of it, Johnson; but without exaggerating, it can't
be denied that training produces good effects; it strengthens the
bones, makes the muscles more elastic, improves the hearing and the
sight; so let us not forget it."

In short, whether in training or not, the travellers were ready June
23d; it was Sunday, and the day was devoted to absolute rest.

The time for departure drew near, and the inhabitants of Fort
Providence could not see it approach without a certain emotion. It
grieved them to leave this snow-hut which had served so well to
protect them; Victoria Bay, this hospitable shore where they had spent
the last days of the winter. Would they find these buildings standing
when they returned? Would not the rays of the sun melt away its
fragile walls?

In a word, they had passed pleasant hours there. The doctor, at the
evening meal, called up to his companions' memory touching
reminiscences, and he did not forget to thank Heaven for its evident
protection.

At last the hour of sleeping came. Each one went to bed early, so as
to be up betimes. Thus passed their last night at Fort Providence.

[Illustration]




CHAPTER XIX.
THE JOURNEY NORTHWARD.


At dawn the next day Hatteras gave the signal for departure. The dogs
were harnessed to the sledge; since they were well fed and had
thoroughly rested, after a comfortable winter there was no reason for
their not being of great service during the summer. Hence they were
not averse to being put into harness.

After all, these Greenland dogs are kind beasts. Their wildness was
partly gone; they had lost their likeness to the wolf, and had become
more like Duke, the finished model of the canine race,--in a word,
they were becoming civilized. Duke could certainly claim a share in
their education; he had given them lessons and an example in good
manners. In his quality of Englishman, and so punctilious in the
matter of cant, he was a long time in making the acquaintance of the
other dogs, who had not been introduced to him, and in fact he never
used to speak to them; but after sharing the same dangers and
privations, they gradually grew used to one another. Duke, who had a
kind heart, made the first advances, and soon all the dogs were
friends. The doctor used to pet the Greenland dogs, and Duke saw him
do it without jealousy. The men were in equally good condition; if the
dogs could draw well, the men could walk well.

They left at six o'clock in the morning; it was a very pleasant day.
After they had followed the line of the bay and passed Cape
Washington, Hatteras gave the order to turn northward; by seven the
travellers lost sight of the lighthouse and of Fort Providence in the
south.

[Illustration: "They left at six o'clock in the morning."]

The journey promised well, much better than the expedition begun in
the dead of winter in search of coal. Hatteras then left behind him,
on board of the ship, mutiny and despair, without being certain of the
object of his journey; he left a crew half dead with cold, he started
with companions who were weakened by the miseries of an arctic winter;
he, too, eager for the north, had to return to the south! Now, on the
other hand, surrounded by vigorous, healthy friends, encouraged and
aided in many ways, he was starting for the Pole, the object of his
whole life! No man had ever been nearer acquiring this glory for
himself and his country.

Was he thinking of all this, which was so naturally inspired by his
present position? The doctor liked to think so, and could hardly doubt
it when he saw him so eager. Clawbonny rejoiced in what so pleased his
friend; and since the reconciliation of the two captains, the two
friends, he was the happiest of men; for hatred, envy, and rivalry
were passions he had never felt. What would be the issue of this
voyage he did not know; but, at any rate, it began well, and that was
a good deal.

The western shore of New America stretched out in a series of bays
beyond Cape Washington; the travellers, to avoid this long curve,
after crossing the first spurs of Mount Bell, turned northward over
the upper plateaus. This was a great saving of time; Hatteras was
anxious, unless prevented by seas or mountains, to make a straight
line of three hundred and fifty miles to the Pole from Fort
Providence.

Their journey was easy; these lofty plains were covered with deep
snow, over which the sledge passed easily, and the men in their
snow-shoes walked easily and rapidly.

[Illustration]

The thermometer stood at 37°. The weather was not absolutely settled;
at one moment it was clear, the next cloudy: but neither cold nor
showers could have stopped the eager party. They could be followed
easily by the compass; the needle was more active as they receded from
the magnetic pole; it is true that it turned to the opposite direction
and pointed to the south, while they were walking northward; but this
did not in any way embarrass them. Besides, the doctor devised a
simple method of staking out the way and thereby avoiding perpetual
reference to the compass; when once they had got their bearings by
some object two or three miles to the north, they walked till they
reached it, when they chose another, and so on. In this way they had a
straight road.

In the first two days they made twenty miles in twelve hours; the rest
of the time was devoted to meals and rest. The tent was ample
protection against the cold when they were sleeping. The temperature
gradually rose. The snow melted away in some places, according to the
shape of the ground, while in others it lay in large patches. Broad
pools appeared here and there, often almost as large as lakes. They
would walk in up to their waists very often; but they only laughed at
it, and the doctor more than any.

"Water has no right to wet us in this country," he used to say; "it
ought to appear only as a solid, or a gas; as to its being liquid,
it's absurd! Ice or vapor will do, but water won't!"

[Illustration]

They did not forget their shooting, for thereby they got fresh meat.
So Altamont and Bell, without going very far away, scoured the
neighboring ravines; they brought back ptarmigan, geese, and a few
gray rabbits. Gradually these animals became very shy and hard to
approach. Without Duke they would often have found it hard to get any
game. Hatteras advised them not to go off farther than a mile, for not
a day nor an hour was to be lost, and he could not count on more than
three months of good weather.

Besides, each one had to be at his post by the sledge whenever a hard
spot, a narrow gorge, or steep inclines lay in the path; then each one
helped pull or push. More than once everything had to be taken off;
and this even did not fully protect against shocks and damage, which
Bell repaired as well as he could.

The third day, Wednesday, June 26th, they came across a vast lake,
still frozen by reason of its being sheltered from the sun; the ice
was even strong enough to bear both men and sledge. It was a solid
mirror which no arctic summers had melted, as was shown by the fact
that its borders were surrounded by a dry snow, of which the lower
layers evidently belonged to previous years.

[Illustration]

From this moment the land grew lower, whence the doctor concluded that
it did not extend very far to the north. Besides, it was very likely
that New America was merely an island, and did not extend to the Pole.
The ground grew more level; in the west a few low hills could be seen
in the distance, covered with a bluish mist.

So far they had experienced no hardships; they had suffered from
nothing except the reflection of the sun's rays upon the snow, which
could easily give them snow-blindness. At any other time they would
have travelled by night to avoid this inconvenience, but then there
was no night. The snow was fortunately melting away, and it was much
less brilliant when it was about turning into water.

June 28th the temperature arose to 45°; this was accompanied with
heavy rain, which the travellers endured stoically, even with
pleasure, for it hastened the disappearance of the snow. They had to
put on their deer-skin moccasins, and change the runners of the
sledge. Their journey was delayed, but still they were advancing
without any serious obstacles. At times the doctor would pick up
rounded or flat stones like pebbles worn smooth by the waves, and then
he thought he was near the Polar Sea; but yet the plain stretched on
out of sight. There was no trace of man, no hut, no cairn nor
Esquimaux snow-house; they were evidently the first to set foot in
this new land. The Greenlanders never had gone so far, and yet this
country offered plenty of game for the support of that half-starved
people. Sometimes bears appeared in the distance, but they showed no
signs of attacking; afar off were herds of musk-oxen and reindeer. The
doctor would have liked to catch some of the latter to harness to the
sledge; but they were timid, and not to be caught alive.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

The 29th, Bell shot a fox, and Altamont was lucky enough to bring down
a medium-sized musk-ox, after giving his companions a high idea of his
bravery and skill; he was indeed a remarkable hunter, and so much
admired by the doctor. The ox was cut out, and gave plenty of
excellent meat. These lucky supplies were always well received; the
least greedy could not restrain their joy at the sight of the meat.
The doctor laughed at himself when he caught himself admiring these
huge joints.

[Illustration: "On the 29th Bell shot a fox, and Altamont a
medium-sized musk-ox."]

"Let us not be afraid to eat it," he used to say; "a good dinner is a
good thing in these expeditions."

"Especially," said Johnson, "when it depends on a better or worse
shot."

"You are right, Johnson," replied the doctor; "one thinks less of
one's food when one gets a regular supply from the kitchen."

[Illustration]

The 30th, the country became unexpectedly rugged, as if it had been
upheaved by some volcanic commotion; the cones and peaks increased
indefinitely in number, and were very high. A southeast breeze began
to blow with violence, and soon became a real hurricane. It rushed
across the snow-covered rocks, among the ice-mountains, which,
although on the firm land, took the form of hummocks and icebergs;
their presence on these lofty plateaus could not be explained even by
the doctor, who had an explanation for almost everything. Warm, damp
weather succeeded the tempest; it was a genuine thaw; on all sides
resounded the cracking of the ice amid the roar of the avalanches.

[Illustration: "The masses of ice took the forms of hummocks and
icebergs."]

[Illustration: "On all sides resounded the cracking of the ice amid
the roar of the avalanches."]

The travellers carefully avoided the base of these hills; they even
took care not to talk aloud, for the sound of the voice could shake
the air and cause accident. They were witnesses of frequent and
terrible avalanches which they could not have foreseen. In fact, the
main peculiarity of polar avalanches is their terrible swiftness;
therein they differ from those of Switzerland and Norway, where they
form a ball, of small size at first, and then, by adding to themselves
the snow and rocks in its passage, it falls with increasing swiftness,
destroys forests and villages, but taking an appreciable time in its
course. Now, it is otherwise in the countries where arctic cold rages;
the fall of the block of ice is unexpected and startling; its fall is
almost instantaneous, and any one who saw it from beneath would be
certainly crushed by it; the cannon-ball is not swifter, nor lightning
quicker; it starts, falls, and crashes down in a single moment with
the dreadful roar of thunder, and with dull echoes.

So the amazed spectators see wonderful changes in the appearance of
the country; the mountain becomes a plain under the action of a sudden
thaw; when the rain has filtered into the fissures of the great blocks
and freezes in a single night, it breaks everything by its
irresistible expansion, which is more powerful in forming ice than in
forming vapor: the phenomenon takes place with terrible swiftness.

No catastrophe, fortunately, threatened the sledge and its drivers;
the proper precautions were taken, and every danger avoided. Besides,
this rugged, icy country was not of great extent, and three days
later, July 3d, the travellers were on smoother ground. But their eyes
were surprised by a new phenomenon, which has for a long time claimed
the attention of the scientific men of the two worlds. It was this:
the party followed a line of hills not more than fifty feet high,
which appeared to run on several miles, and their eastern side was
covered with red snow.

The surprise and even the sort of alarm which the sight of this
crimson curtain gave them may be easily imagined. The doctor hastened,
if not to reassure, at least to instruct, his companions; he was
familiar with this red snow and the chemical analysis made of it by
Wollaston, Candolle, Bäuer. He told them this red snow was not found
in the arctic regions alone, but in Switzerland in the middle of the
Alps; De Saussure collected a large quantity on the Breven in 1760;
and since then Captains Ross, Sabine, and others had brought some back
from their arctic journeys.

[Illustration]

Altamont asked the doctor about the nature of this extraordinary
substance. He was told that its color came simply from the presence of
organic corpuscles. For a long time it was a question whether these
corpuscles were animal or vegetable; but it was soon ascertained that
they belonged to the family of microscopic mushrooms, of the genus
_Uredo_, which Bäuer proposed naming _Uredo vivalis_.

Then the doctor, prying into the snow with his cane, showed his
companions that the scarlet layer was only nine feet deep, and he bade
them calculate how many of these mushrooms there might be on a space
of many miles, when scientific men estimated forty-three thousand in a
square centimetre.

This coloring probably ran back to a remote period, for the mushrooms
were not decomposed by either evaporation or the melting of the snow,
nor was their color altered.

The phenomenon, although explained, was no less strange. Red is a rare
color in nature; the reflection of the sun's rays on this crimson
surface produced strange effects; it gave the surrounding objects, men
and animals, a brilliant appearance, as if they were lighted by an
inward flame; and when the snow was melting, streams of blood seemed
to be flowing beneath the travellers' feet.

The doctor, who had not been able to examine this substance when he
saw it on crimson cliffs from Baffin's Bay, here examined it at his
ease, and gathered several bottlefuls of it.

This red ground, the "Field of Blood," as he called it, took three
hours' walk to pass over, and then the country resumed its habitual
appearance.




CHAPTER XX.
FOOTPRINTS ON THE SNOW.


July 4th a dense fog prevailed. They were only able with the greatest
difficulty to keep a straight path; they had to consult the compass
every moment. Fortunately there was no accident in the darkness,
except that Bell lost his snow-shoes, which were broken against a
projecting rock.

"Well, really," said Johnson, "I thought, after seeing the Mersey and
the Thames, that I knew all about fogs, but I see I was mistaken."

"We ought," answered Bell, "to light torches as is done at London and
Liverpool."

[Illustration: "'We ought,' answered Bell, 'to light torches, as is
done at London and Liverpool.'"]

"Why not?" asked the doctor; "that's a good idea; it wouldn't light up
the road much, but we could see the guide, and follow him more
easily."

"But what shall we do for torches?"

"By lighting tow dipped in alcohol, and fastening to the end of
walking-sticks."

"Good!" said Johnson; "and we shall soon have it ready."

A quarter of an hour later the little band was walking along with
torches faintly lighting up the general gloom.

But if they went straighter, they did not go quicker, and the fog
lasted till July 6th; the earth being cold then, a blast of north-wind
carried away all the mist as if it had been rags. Soon the doctor took
an observation, and ascertained that meanwhile they had not made eight
miles a day.

[Illustration]

The 6th, they made an effort to make up for lost time, and they set
out early. Altamont and Bell were ahead, choosing the way and looking
out for game. Duke was with them. The weather, with its surprising
fickleness, had become very clear and dry; and although the guides
were two miles from the sledge, the doctor did not miss one of their
movements. He was consequently very much startled to see them stop
suddenly, and remain in a position of surprise; they seemed to be
gazing into the distance, as if scanning the horizon. Then they bent
down to the ground and seemed to be examining it closely, and they
arose in evident amazement. Bell seemed to wish to push on, but
Altamont held him back.

"What can they be doing?" asked the doctor of Johnson.

"I know no more than you, Doctor; I don't understand their gestures."

"They have found the track of some animals," answered Hatteras.

"That's not it," said the doctor.

"Why not?"

"Because Duke would bark."

"Still, they've seen marks of some sort."

"Let us go on," said Hatteras; "we shall soon know."

Johnson urged on the dogs, who quickened their pace.

In twenty minutes the five were together, and Hatteras, the doctor,
and Johnson were as much surprised as Bell and Altamont.

There were in the snow indubitable traces of men, as fresh as if they
had just been made.

[Illustration]

"They are Esquimaux," said Hatteras.

"Yes," said the doctor, "there is no doubt of that!"

"You think so?" said Altamont.

"Without any doubt."

"Well, and this mark?" continued Altamont, pointing to another print,
which was often repeated.

"That one?"

"Do you think it was made by an Esquimau?"

The doctor examined it carefully, and was stupefied. The print of a
European shoe, with nails, sole, and heel, was clearly stamped in the
snow. There could be no further doubt; a man, a stranger, had been
there.

"Europeans here!" cried Hatteras.

"Evidently," said Johnson.

"And still," said the doctor, "it is so unlikely, that we ought to
look twice before being sure."

Thereupon he looked twice, three times, at the print, and he was
obliged to acknowledge its extraordinary origin.

De Foe's hero was not more amazed when he saw the footprint on the
sand of his island; but if he was afraid, Hatteras was simply angry. A
European so near the Pole!

They pushed on to examine the footprints; for a quarter of a mile they
were continually repeated, mingled with marks of moccasins; then they
turned to the west. When they had reached this point they consulted as
to whether they should follow them any farther.

"No," said Hatteras. "Let us go on--"

He was interrupted by an exclamation of the doctor, who had just
picked up on the snow an object even more convincing, and of the
origin of which there could be no doubt. It was the object-glass of a
pocket telescope.

"Now," he said, "we can't doubt that there is a stranger here--"

"Forward!" cried Hatteras.

He uttered this word so sharply that each one obeyed, and the sledge
resumed its monotonous progress.

They all scanned the horizon attentively, except Hatteras, who was
filled with wrath and did not care to see anything. Still, since they
ran the risk of coming across a band of travellers, they had to take
precautions; it was very disappointing to see any one ahead of them on
the route. The doctor, although not as angry as Hatteras, was somewhat
vexed, in spite of his usual philosophy. Altamont seemed equally
annoyed; Johnson and Bell muttered threatening words between their
teeth.

"Come," said the doctor, "let us take heart against our bad fortune."

"We must confess," said Johnson, without being heard by Altamont,
"that if we find the place taken, it would disgust us with journeying
to the Pole."

"And yet," answered Bell, "there is no possibility of doubting--"

"No," retorted the doctor; "I turn it all over in vain, and say it is
improbable, impossible; I have to give it up. This shoe was not
pressed into the snow without being at the end of a leg, and without
the leg being attached to a human body. I could forgive Esquimaux, but
a European!"

"The fact is," answered Johnson, "that if we are going to find all the
rooms taken in the hotel of the end of the world, it would be
annoying."

"Very annoying," said Altamont.

"Well, we shall see," said the doctor.

And they pushed on. The day ended without any new fact to indicate the
presence of strangers in this part of New America, and they at last
encamped for the evening.

A rather strong wind from the south had sprung up, and obliged them to
seek a secure shelter for their tent in the bottom of a ravine. The
sky was threatening; long clouds passed rapidly through the air; they
passed near the ground, and so quickly that the eye could hardly
follow them. At times some of the mist touched the ground, and the
tent resisted with difficulty the violence of the hurricane.

[Illustration: The hut was pitched in a ravine for shelter.]

"It's going to be a nasty night," said Johnson, after supper.

"It won't be cold, but stormy," answered the doctor; "let us take
precautions, and make the tent firm with large stones."

"You are right, Doctor; if the wind should carry away the canvas,
Heaven alone knows where we should find it again."

Hence they took every precaution against such a danger, and the
wearied travellers lay down to sleep. But they found it impossible.
The tempest was loose, and hastened northward with incomparable
violence; the clouds were whirling about like steam which has just
escaped from a boiler; the last avalanches, under the force of the
hurricane, fell into the ravines, and their dull echoes were
distinctly heard; the air seemed to be struggling with the water, and
fire alone was absent from this contest of the elements.

Amid the general tumult their ears distinguished separate sounds, not
the crash of heavy falling bodies, but the distinct cracking of bodies
breaking; a clear snap was frequently heard, like breaking steel, amid
the roar of the tempest. These last sounds were evidently avalanches
torn off by the gusts, but the doctor could not explain the others. In
the few moments of anxious silence, when the hurricane seemed to be
taking breath in order to blow with greater violence, the travellers
exchanged their suppositions.

"There is a sound of crashing," said the doctor, "as if icebergs and
ice-fields were being blown against one another."

"Yes," answered Altamont; "one would say the whole crust of the globe
was falling in. Say, did you hear that?"

"If we were near the sea," the doctor went on, "I should think it was
ice breaking."

"In fact," said Johnson, "there is no other explanation possible."

"Can we have reached the coast?" asked Hatteras.

"It's not impossible," answered the doctor. "Hold on," he said, after
a very distinct sound; "shouldn't you say that was the crashing of
ice? We may be very near the ocean."

"If it is," continued Hatteras, "I should not be afraid to go across
the ice-fields."

"O," said the doctor, "they must be broken by such a tempest! We shall
see to-morrow. However that may be, if any men have to travel in such
a night as this, I pity them."

The hurricane raged ten hours without cessation, and no one of those
in the tent had a moment's sleep; the night passed in profound
uneasiness. In fact, under such circumstances, every new incident, a
tempest, an avalanche, might bring serious consequences. The doctor
would gladly have gone out to reconnoitre, but how could he with such
a wind raging?

Fortunately the hurricane grew less violent early the next day; they
could leave the tent which had resisted so sturdily. The doctor,
Hatteras, and Johnson went to a hill about three hundred feet high,
which they ascended without difficulty. Their eyes beheld an entirely
altered country, composed of bare rocks, sharp ridges entirely clear
of ice. It was summer succeeding winter, which had been driven away by
the tempest; the snow had been blown away by the wind before it could
melt, and the barren soil reappeared.

[Illustration: "They climbed a hill which commanded a wide view."]

But Hatteras's glances were all turned towards the north, where the
horizon appeared to be hidden by dark mist.

"That may be the effect of the ocean," said the doctor.

"You are right," said Hatteras; "the sea must be there."

"That's what we call the blink of the water," said Johnson.

"Exactly," said the doctor.

"Well, let us start," said Hatteras, "and push on to this new ocean."

"That rejoices my heart," said Clawbonny to the captain.

"Certainly," was the enthusiastic answer. "Soon we shall have reached
the Pole! and doesn't the prospect delight you, too, Doctor?"

"It does. I am always happy, and especially about the happiness of
others!"

The three Englishmen returned to the ravine; the sledge was made
ready, and they left the camp and resumed their march. Each one
dreaded finding new tracks, but all the rest of the way they saw no
trace of any human being. Three hours later they reached the coast.

"The sea! the sea!" they all shouted.

"And the open sea!" cried the captain.

[Illustration: "Three hours later they reached the coast. 'The sea!
the sea!' they all shouted."]

It was ten o'clock in the morning.

In fact, the hurricane had cleared up the polar basin; the shattered
ice was floating away in every direction; the largest pieces, forming
icebergs, had just weighed anchor and were sailing on the open sea.
The wind had made a harsh attack upon the field. Fragments of ice
covered the surrounding rocks. The little which was left of the
ice-field seemed very soft; on the rocks were large pieces of
sea-weed. The ocean stretched beyond the line of vision, with no
island or new land peering above the horizon.

In the east and west were two capes gently sloping to the water; at
their end the sea was breaking, and the wind was carrying a slight
foam. The land of New America thus died away in the Polar Ocean,
quietly and gently. It rounded into an open bay, with roadstead
enclosed by the two promontories. In the middle a rock made a little
natural harbor, sheltered against three points of the compass; it ran
back into the land in the broad bed of a stream, through which ran
down the melted snows of winter, now forming a perfect torrent.

Hatteras, after noticing the outline of the coast, resolved to make
the preparations for departure that very day, to launch the boat, to
put the unloaded sledge on board for future excursions. That took all
day; then the tent was raised, and after a comfortable meal work
began. Meanwhile the doctor took out his instruments to take an
observation and determine the position of a part of the bay. Hatteras
hurried on the work; he was anxious to start; he wanted to leave the
land, and to be in advance in case any others should reach the sea.

At five o'clock in the evening Johnson and Bell had nothing to do but
to fold their arms. The launch was rocking gently in her little
harbor, with her mast set, her jib lowered, and her foresail in the
brails; the provisions and most of the things on the sledge had been
put on board; only the tent and a little of the camping material
remained to be put on board the next day. The doctor found all these
preparations complete on his return. When he saw the launch quietly
sheltered from the wind, it occurred to him to give a name to the
little harbor, and he proposed that of Altamont. This proposition was
unanimously agreed to. So it was named Altamont Harbor.

[Illustration: "The launch was rocking gently in her little harbor."]

According to the doctor's calculations, it lay in latitude 87° 5', and
longitude 118° 35' E. of Greenwich; that is to say, less than three
degrees from the Pole. The band had gone more than two hundred miles
from Victoria Bay to Altamont Harbor.




CHAPTER XXI.
THE OPEN SEA.


The next morning Johnson and Bell set about carrying on board the
camping material. At eight o'clock all the preparations for departure
were complete. At the moment of starting the doctor's thoughts
returned to the footprints they had seen. Were these men trying to
gain the North? Had they any means of crossing the Polar Sea! Should
they meet them again? For three days they had come across no trace of
the travellers, and certainly, whoever they were, they could not have
reached Altamont Harbor. That was a place which they were the first to
set foot in. But the doctor, who was harassed by his thoughts, wanted
to take a last view of the country, and he ascended a little hill
about a hundred feet high, whence he had a distant view to the south.

When he had reached the top, he put his glass to his eyes. Great was
his surprise when he found he could not see anything, either at a
distance on the plains, or within a few feet of him. This seemed very
odd; he made another examination, and at last he looked at the
glass,--the object-glass was missing.

[Illustration]

"The object-glass!" he cried.

The sudden revelation may be imagined; he uttered a cry so loud as to
be heard by his companions, and they were much astonished at seeing
him running down the hill.

"Well, what's the matter now?" asked Johnson.

The doctor was out of breath, and unable to speak. At length he
managed to bring out,--

"The footprints!--the expedition!--"

"Well, what?" said Hatteras; "are they here?"

"No, no!" resumed the doctor,--"the object-glass, mine!"

And he showed his own glass.

"O, ho!" cried the American, "so you lost--"

"Yes!"

"But then the footprints--"

"Our own!" cried the doctor. "We lost our way in the fog! We went
around in a circle, and came across our own footprints!"

"But the print of the shoes?" asked Hatteras.

"Bell's, you know, who walked all day in the snow after breaking his
snow-shoes."

"That's true," said Bell.

Their mistake was so clear, that they all, except Hatteras, burst out
laughing, and he was none the less pleased at the discovery.

"We were stupid enough," said the doctor, when they had stopped
laughing. What good guesses we made! Strangers up here! Really, we
ought to think before speaking. Well, since we are easy on this point,
we can't do better than start."

"Forward!" said Hatteras.

A quarter of an hour later each one had taken his place on board of
the launch, which sailed out of Altamont Harbor under mainsail and
jib. This voyage began Wednesday, July 10th; they were then very near
the Pole, exactly one hundred and seventy-five miles from it. However
small the land might be at that point of the globe, the voyage would
certainly be a short one. The wind was light, but fair. The
thermometer stood at 50°; it was really warm.

The launch had not been injured by the journey on the sledge; it was
in perfect order, and sailed easily. Johnson was at the helm; the
doctor, Bell, and Altamont were lying as best they might among the
load, partly on deck, partly below.

Hatteras stood forward, with his eyes turned to the mysterious point,
which attracted him with an irresistible power, as the magnetic pole
attracts the needle. If there should be any land, he wanted to be the
first to see it. This honor really belonged to him. He noticed,
besides, that the surface of the Polar Sea was covered with short
waves, like those of land locked seas. This he considered a proof of
the nearness of the opposite shore, and the doctor shared his opinion.

Hatteras's desire to find land at the North Pole is perfectly
comprehensible. His disappointment would have been great if the
uncertain sea covered the place where he wanted to find a piece of
land, no matter how small! In fact, how could he give a special name
to an uncertain portion of the sea? How plant the flag of his country
among the waves? How take possession, in the name of her Gracious
Majesty, of the liquid element?

So Hatteras, compass in hand, gazed steadily at the north. There was
nothing that he could see between him and the horizon, where the line
of the blue water met the blue sky. A few floating icebergs seemed to
be leaving the way free for these bold sailors. The appearance of this
region was singularly strange. Was this impression simply the result
of the nervous excitement of the travellers? It is hard to say. Still,
the doctor in his journal has described the singular appearance of the
ocean; he spoke of it as Penny did, according to whom these countries
present an appearance "offering the most striking contrast of a sea
filled with millions of living creatures."

The sea, with its various colors, appeared strangely transparent, and
endowed with a wonderful dispersive quality, as if it had been made
with carburet of sulphur. This clearness let them see down into
immeasurable depths; it seemed as if the sea were lit up like a large
aquarium; probably some electric phenomenon at the bottom of the sea
lit it up. So the launch seemed hung in a bottomless abyss.

[Illustration]

On the surface of the water the birds were flying in large flocks,
like thick clouds big with a storm. Aquatic birds of all sorts were
there, from the albatross which is common to the south, to the penguin
of the arctic seas, but of enormous size. Their cries were deafening.
In considering them the doctor found his knowledge of natural history
too scanty; many of the names escaped him, and he found himself bowing
his head when their wings beat the air.

[Illustration: "Aquatic birds of all sorts were there."]

Some of these large birds measured twenty feet from tip to tip; they
covered the whole launch with their expanded wings; and there were
legions of these birds, of which the names had never appeared in the
London "Index Ornithologus." The doctor was dejected and stupefied at
finding his science so faulty. Then, when his glance fell from the
wonders of the air to the calm surface of the ocean, he saw no less
astonishing productions of the animal kingdom, among others, medusæ
thirty feet broad; they served as food for the other fish, and they
floated like islands amid the sea-weed. What a difference from the
microscopic medusæ observed in the seas of Greenland by Scoresby, and
of which that explorer estimated the number at twenty-three trillions
eight hundred and ninety-eight billions of millions in a space of two
square miles!

Then the eye glancing down into the transparent water, the sight was
equally strange, so full was it of fishes; sometimes the animals were
swimming about below, and the eye saw them gradually disappearing, and
fading away like spectres; then they would leave the lower layers and
rise to the surface. The monsters seemed in no way alarmed at the
presence of the launch; they even passed near it, rubbing their fins
against it; this, which would have alarmed whalers, did not disturb
these men, and yet the sea-monsters were very large.

[Illustration: "Then the eye glancing down into the transparent water,
the sight was equally strange."]

Young sea-calves played about them; the sword-fish, with its long,
narrow, conical sword, with which it cleaves the ice, was chasing the
more timid cetacea; numberless spouting whales were clearly to be
heard. The sword-caper, with its delicate tail and large caudal fins,
swam with incomprehensible quickness, feeding on smaller animals, such
as the cod, as swift as itself; while the white whale, which is more
inactive, swallowed peacefully the tranquil, lazy mollusks.

Farther down were Greenland anamaks, long and dark; huge sperm-whales,
swimming in the midst of ambergris, in which took place thomeric
battles that reddened the ocean for many miles around; the great
Labrador tegusik. Sharp-backed dolphins, the whole family of seals and
walruses, sea-dogs, horses and bears, lions and elephants, seemed to
be feeding on the rich pastures; and the doctor admired the numberless
animals, as he would have done the crustacea in the crystal basins of
the zoölogical garden.

What beauty, variety, and power in nature! How strange and wonderful
everything seemed in the polar regions!

The air acquired an unnatural purity; one would have said it was full
of oxygen; the explorers breathed with delight this air, which filled
them with fresher life; without taking account of the result, they
were, so to speak, exposed to a real consuming fire, of which one can
give no idea, not even a feeble one. Their emotions, their breathing
and digestion, were endowed with superhuman energy; their ideas became
more excited; they lived a whole day in an hour.

Through all these wonders the launch pushed on before a moderate
breeze, occasionally feeling the air moved by the albatrosses' wings.

Towards evening, the coast of New America disappeared beneath the
horizon. In the temperate zones, as well as at the equator, night
falls; but here the sun simply described a circle parallel to the line
of the horizon. The launch, bathed in its oblique rays, could not lose
sight of it.

The animate beings of these regions seemed to know the approach of
evening as truly as if the sun had set; birds, fish, cetacea, all
disappeared. Whither? To the depths of the ocean? Who could say? But
soon total silence succeeded to their cries, and the sound of their
passage through the water; the sea grew calmer and calmer, and night
retained its gentle peace even beneath the glowing sun.

Since leaving Altamont Harbor the launch had made one degree to the
north; the next day nothing appeared on the horizon, neither
projecting peaks nor those vague signs by which sailors detect their
nearness to land.

The wind was good, but not strong, the sea not high; the birds and
fish came as thick as the day before; the doctor, leaning over the
gunwale, could see the cetacea rising slowly to the surface; a few
icebergs and scattered pieces of ice alone broke the monotony of the
ocean.

But the ice grew rarer, and was not enough to interfere with the boat.
It is to be remembered that the launch was then ten degrees above the
pole of cold; and as to the parallels of temperature, they might as
well have been ten degrees to the other side. There was nothing
surprising in the sea being open at this epoch, as it must have been
at Disco Island in Baffin's Bay. So a sailing vessel would have plenty
of sailing room in the summer months.

This observation had a great practical importance; in fact, if whalers
can ever get to the polar basin, either by the seas of North America
or those of the north of Asia, they are sure of getting full cargoes,
for this part of the ocean seems to be the universal fishing-pond, the
general reservoir of whales, seals, and all marine animals. At noon
the line of the horizon was still unbroken; the doctor began to doubt
of the existence of a continent in so high latitudes.

Still, as he reflected, he was compelled to believe in the existence
of an arctic continent; in fact, at the creation of the world, after
the cooling of the terrestrial crust, the waters formed by the
condensation of the atmospheric vapor were compelled to obey the
centrifugal force, to fly to the equator and leave the motionless
extremities of the globe. Hence the necessary emersion of the
countries near the Pole. The doctor considered this reasoning very
just. And so it seemed to Hatteras.

[Illustration]

Hence the captain still tried to pierce the mists of the horizon. His
glass never left his eyes. In the color of the water, the shape of the
waves, the direction of the wind, he tried to find traces of
neighboring land. His head was bent forward, and even one who did not
know his thoughts would have admired, so full was his attitude of
energetic desire and anxious interrogation.




CHAPTER XXII.
THE APPROACH TO THE POLE.


The time flew by in this uncertainty. Nothing appeared on the sharply
defined circle of the sea; nothing was to be seen save sky and
sea,--not one of those floating land-plants which rejoiced the heart
of Christopher Columbus as he was about to discover America. Hatteras
was still gazing. At length, at about six o'clock in the evening, a
shapeless vapor appeared at a little height above the level of the
sea; it looked like a puff of smoke; the sky was perfectly cold, so
this vapor was no cloud; it would keep appearing and disappearing, as
if it were in commotion. Hatteras was the first to detect this
phenomenon; he examined it with his glass for a whole hour.

Suddenly, some sure sign apparently occurred to him, for he stretched
out his arms to the horizon and cried in a loud voice,--

"Land, ho!"

At these words each one sprang to his feet as if moved by electricity.
A sort of smoke was clearly rising above the sea.

[Illustration]

"I see it," cried the doctor.

"Yes! certainly!--yes!" said Johnson.

"It's a cloud," said Altamont.

"It's land!" answered Hatteras, as if perfectly convinced.

But, as often happens with objects that are indistinct in the
distance, the point they had been looking at seemed to have
disappeared. At length they found it again, and the doctor even
fancied that he could see a swift light twenty or twenty-five miles to
the north.

"It's a volcano!" he cried.

[Illustration: "'It's a volcano!' he cried."]

"A volcano?" said Altamont.

"Without doubt."

"At this high latitude?"

"And why not?" continued the doctor; "isn't Iceland a volcanic land,
so to speak, made of volcanoes?"

"Yes, Iceland," said the American, "but so near the Pole!"

"Well, didn't Commodore James Ross find in the Southern Continent two
active volcanoes, Erebus and Terror by name, in longitude 170° and
latitude 78°? Why then shouldn't there be volcanoes at the North
Pole?"

"It may be so, after all," answered Altamont.

"Ah," cried the doctor, "I see it clearly! It is a volcano."

"Well," said Hatteras, "let us sail straight towards it."

"The wind is changing," said Johnson.

"Haul on the fore-sheet, and bring her nearer the wind."

But this manoeuvre only turned the launch away from the point they had
been gazing at, and even with their closest examination they could not
find it again. Still, they could not doubt that they were nearing
land. They had seen, if they had not reached, the object of their
voyage, and within twenty-four hours they would set foot on this
unknown shore. Providence, after letting them get so near, would not
drive them back at the last moment.

Still, no one manifested the joy which might have been expected under
the circumstances; each one wondered in silence what this polar land
might be. The animals seemed to shun it; at evening the birds, instead
of seeking refuge there, flew with all speed to the south. Could not a
single gull or ptarmigan find a resting-place there? Even the fish,
the large cetacea, avoided that coast. Whence came this repugnance,
which was shared by all the animals they saw, unless from terror?

The sailors experienced the same feeling; they gave way to the
feelings inspired by the situation, and gradually each one felt his
eyelids grow heavy. It was Hatteras's watch. He took the tiller; the
doctor, Altamont, Johnson, and Bell fell asleep, stretched on the
benches, and soon were dreaming soundly. Hatteras struggled against
his sleepiness; he wished to lose not a moment; but the gentle motion
of the launch rocked him, in spite of himself, into a gentle sleep.

The boat made hardly any headway; the wind did not keep her sails
full. Far off in the west a few icebergs were reflecting the sun's
rays, and glowing brightly in the midst of the ocean.

Hatteras began to dream. He recalled his whole life, with the
incalculable speed of dreams; he went through the winter again, the
scenes at Victoria Bay, Fort Providence, Doctor's House, the finding
the American beneath the snow. Here remoter incidents came up before
him; he dreamed of the burning of the _Forward_, of his treacherous
companions who had abandoned him. What had become of them? He thought
of Shandon, Wall, and the brutal Pen. Where were they now? Had they
succeeded in reaching Baffin's Bay across the ice? Then he went
further back, to his departure from England, to his previous voyages,
his failures and misfortunes. Then he forgot his present situation,
his success so near at hand, his hopes half realized. His dreams
carried him from joy to agony. So it went on for two hours; then his
thoughts changed; he began to think of the Pole, and he saw himself at
last setting foot on this English continent, and unfolding the flag of
the United Kingdom. While he was dozing in this way a huge, dark cloud
was climbing across the sky, throwing a deep shadow over the sea.

[Illustration]

It is difficult to imagine the great speed with which hurricanes arise
in the arctic seas. The vapors which rise under the equator are
condensed above the great glaciers of the North, and large masses of
air are needed to take their place. This can explain the severity of
arctic storms.

At the first shock of the wind the captain and his friends awoke from
their sleep, ready to manage the launch. The waves were high and
steep. The launch tossed helplessly about, now plunged into deep
abysses, now oscillated on the pointed crest of a wave, inclining
often at an angle of more than forty-five degrees. Hatteras took firm
hold of the tiller, which was noisily sliding from one side to the
other. Every now and then some strong wave would strike it and nearly
throw him over. Johnson and Bell were busily occupied in bailing out
the water which the launch would occasionally ship.

[Illustration: "The launch tossed helplessly about."]

"This is a storm we hardly expected," said Altamont, holding fast to
his bench.

"We ought to expect anything here," answered the doctor.

These remarks were made amid the roar of the tempest and the hissing
of the waves, which the violence of the wind reduced to a fine spray.
It was nearly impossible for one to hear his neighbor. It was hard to
keep the boat's head to the north; the clouds hid everything a few
fathoms from the boat, and they had no mark to sail by. This sudden
tempest, just as they were about attaining their object, seemed full
of warning; to their excited minds it came like an order to go no
farther. Did Nature forbid approach to the Pole? Was this point of the
globe surrounded by hurricanes and tempests which rendered access
impossible? But any one who had caught sight of those men could have
seen that they did not flinch before wind or wave, and that they would
push on to the end. So they struggled on all day, braving death at
every instant, and making no progress northward, but also losing no
ground; they were wet through by the rain and waves; above the din of
the storm they could hear the hoarse cries of the birds.

But at six o'clock in the evening, while the waves were rising, there
came a sudden calm. The wind stopped as if by a miracle. The sea was
smooth, as if it had not felt a puff of wind for twelve hours. The
hurricane seemed to have respected this part of the Polar Ocean. What
was the reason? It was an extraordinary phenomenon, which Captain
Sabine had witnessed in his voyages in Greenland seas. The fog,
without lifting, was very bright. The launch drifted along in a zone
of electric light, an immense St. Elmo fire, brilliant but without
heat. The mast, sail, and rigging stood out black against the
phosphorescent air; the men seemed to have plunged into a bath of
transparent rays, and their faces were all lit up. The sudden calm of
this portion of the ocean came, without doubt, from the ascending
motion of the columns of air, while the tempest, which was a cyclone,
turned rapidly about this peaceful centre. But this atmosphere on fire
suggested a thought to Hatteras.

[Illustration: "The fog, without lifting, was very bright."]

"The volcano!" he cried.

"Is it possible?" asked Bell.

"No, no!" answered the doctor; "we should be smothered if the flames
were to reach us."

"Perhaps it is its reflection in the fog," said Altamont.

"No. We should have to admit that we were near land, and in that case
we should hear the eruption."

"But then?" asked the captain.

"It is a phenomenon," said the doctor, "which has been seldom observed
hitherto. If we go on we cannot help leaving this luminous sphere and
re-entering storm and darkness."

"Whatever it is, push on!" said Hatteras.

"Forward!" cried his companions, who did not wish to delay even for
breathing-time in this quiet spot. The bright sail hung down the
glistening mast; the oars dipped into the glowing waves, and appeared
to drip with sparks. Hatteras, compass in hand, turned the boat's head
to the north; gradually the mist lost its brightness and transparency;
the wind could be heard roaring a short distance off; and soon the
launch, lying over before a strong gust, re-entered the zone of
storms. Fortunately, the hurricane had shifted a point towards the
south, and the launch was able to run before the wind, straight for
the Pole, running the risk of foundering, but sailing very fast; a
rock, reef, or piece of ice might at any moment rise before them, and
crush them to atoms. Still, no one of these men raised a single
objection, nor suggested prudence. They were seized with the madness
of danger. Thirst for the unknown took possession of them. They were
going along, not blinded, but blindly, finding their speed only too
slow for their impatience. Hatteras held the tiller firm amid the
waves lashed into foam by the tempest. Still the proximity of land
became evident. Strange signs filled the air. Suddenly the mist parted
like a curtain torn by the wind, and for a moment, brief as a flash of
lightning, a great burst of flame could be seen rising towards the
sky.

"The volcano! the volcano!" was the cry which escaped from the lips of
all; but the strange vision disappeared at once; the wind shifted to
the southeast, took the launch on her quarter, and drove her from this
unapproachable land.

"Malediction!" said Hatteras, shifting her sail; "we were not three
miles from land!"

Hatteras could not resist the force of the tempest; but without
yielding to it, he brought the boat about in the wind, which was
blowing with fearful violence. Every now and then the launch leaned to
one side, so that almost her whole keel was exposed; still she obeyed
her rudder, and rose like a stumbling horse which his rider brings up
by spur and reins. Hatteras, with his hair flying and his hand on the
tiller, seemed to be part of the boat, like horse and man at the time
of the centaurs. Suddenly a terrible sight presented itself to their
eyes. Within less than ten fathoms a floe was balancing on the waves;
it fell and rose like the launch, threatening in its fall to crush it
to atoms. But to this danger of being plunged into the abyss was added
another no less terrible; for this drifting floe was covered with
white bears, crowded together and wild with terror.

[Illustration: "This drifting floe was covered with white bears,
crowded together."]

"Bears! bears!" cried Bell, in terror.

And each one gazed with terror. The floe pitched fearfully, sometimes
at such an angle that the bears were all rolled together. Then their
roars were almost as loud as the tempest; a formidable din arose from
the floating menagerie.

If the floe had upset, the bears would have swum to the boat and
clambered aboard.

For a quarter of an hour, which was as long as a century, the launch
and floe drifted along in consort, twenty fathoms from one another at
one moment and nearly running together the next, and at times they
were so near to one another, the bears need only have dropped to have
got on board. The Greenland dogs trembled from terror; Duke remained
motionless. Hatteras and his companions were silent; it did not occur
to them to put the helm down and sail away, and they went straight on.
A vague feeling, of astonishment rather than terror, took possession
of them; they admired this spectacle which completed the struggle of
the elements. Finally the floe drifted away, borne by the wind, which
the launch was able to withstand, as she lay with her head to the
wind, and it disappeared in the mist, its presence being known merely
by the distant roaring of the bears.

At that moment the fury of the tempest redoubled; there was an endless
unchaining of atmospheric waves; the boat, borne by the waves, was
tossed about giddily; her sail flew away like a huge white bird; a
whirlpool, a new Maelstrom, formed among the waves; the boat was
carried so fast that it seemed to the men as if the rapidly revolving
water were motionless. They were gradually sinking down. There was an
irresistible power dragging them down and ingulfing them alive. All
five arose. They looked at one another with terror. They grew dizzy.
They felt an undefinable dread of the abyss! But suddenly the launch
arose perpendicularly. Her prow was higher than the whirling waves;
the speed with which she was moving hurled her beyond the centre of
attraction, and escaping by the tangent of this circumference which
was making more than a thousand turns a second, she was hurled away
with the rapidity of a cannon-ball.

[Illustration: "Her sail flew away like a huge white bird; a
whirlpool, a new Maelstrom, formed among the waves."]

Altamont, the doctor, Johnson, and Bell were thrown down among the
seats. When they rose, Hatteras had disappeared. It was two o'clock in
the morning.




CHAPTER XXIII.
THE ENGLISH FLAG.


One cry, bursting from the lips of the other four, succeeded their
first stupefaction.

"Hatteras!" cried the doctor.

"Gone!" said Johnson and Bell.

"Lost!"

They looked about, but nothing was to be seen on the storm-tossed sea.
Duke barked despairingly; he tried to spring into the water, but Bell
managed to hold him.

"Take a place at the helm, Altamont," said the doctor; "let us try
everything to save the captain."

Johnson and Bell took their seats. Altamont took the helm, and the
launch came into wind again. Johnson and Bell began to row vigorously;
for an hour they remained at the scene of the accident. They sought
earnestly, but in vain. The unfortunate Hatteras was lost in the
storm! Lost, so near the Pole, so near the end, of which he had had
but a glimpse!

The doctor called aloud, and fired the guns; Duke added his howling,
but there was no answer. Then profound grief seized Clawbonny; his
head sank into his hands, and his companions saw that he was weeping.
In fact, at this distance from land, with a scrap of wood to hold him
up, Hatteras could not reach the shore alive; and if anything did come
ashore, it would be his disfigured corpse. After hunting for an hour,
they decided to turn to the north, and struggle against the last
furies of the tempest.

At five o'clock in the morning of July 11th the wind went down; the
sea grew quieter; the sky regained its polar clearness, and within
three miles of them appeared the land. This continent was but an
island, or rather a volcano, peering up like a lighthouse at the North
Pole. The mountain, in full eruption, was hurling forth a mass of
burning stones and melting rocks. It seemed to be rising and falling
beneath the successive blasts as if it were breathing; the things
which were cast out reached a great height in the air; amid the jets
of flame, torrents of lava were flowing down the side of the mountain;
here creeping between steaming rocks, there falling in cascades amid
the purple vapor: and lower down a thousand streams united in one
large river, which ran boiling into the sea.

[Illustration: "The mountain was in full eruption."]

The volcano seemed to have but a single crater, whence arose a column
of fire, lighted by transverse rays; one would have said that part of
the magnificence of the phenomenon was due to electricity. Above the
flames floated an immense cloud of smoke, red below, black above. It
rose with great majesty, and unrolled into huge layers.

The sky at a considerable height had an ashy hue; the darkness, which
was so marked during the tempest, and of which the doctor could give
no satisfactory explanation, evidently came from the ashes, which
completely hid the sun. He remembered a similar fact that took place
in 1812, at the Barbadoes, which at noon was plunged into total
darkness by the mass of cinders thrown from the crater of Isle St.
Vincent.

This enormous volcano, jutting up in mid-ocean, was about six thousand
feet high, very nearly the altitude of Hecla. A line from the summit
to the base would form with the horizon an angle of about eleven
degrees. It seemed to rise from the bosom of the waves as the launch
approached it. There was no trace of vegetation. There was no shore;
it ran down steep to the sea.

"Shall we be able to land?" said the doctor.

"The wind is carrying us there," answered Altamont.

"But I can't see any beach on which we could set foot."

"So it seems from here," answered Johnson; "but we shall find some
place for our boat; that is all we need."

"Let us go on, then!" answered Clawbonny, sadly.

The doctor had no eyes for the strange continent which was rising
before him. The land of the Pole was there, but not the man who had
discovered it. Five hundred feet from the rocks the sea was boiling
under the action of subterraneous fires. The island was from eight to
ten miles in circumference, no more; and, according to their
calculation, it was very near the Pole, if indeed the axis of the
world did not pass exactly through it. As they drew near they noticed
a little fiord large enough to shelter their boat; they sailed towards
it, filled with the fear of finding the captain's body cast ashore by
the tempest.

[Illustration: "They noticed a little fiord."]

Still, it seemed unlikely that any corpse should rest there; there was
no beach, and the sea beat against the steep rocks; thick ashes, on
which no human foot had ever stepped, covered the ground beyond the
reach of the waves. At last the launch slipped between the breakers,
and there she was perfectly sheltered against the surf. Then Duke's
lamentable howling redoubled; the poor animal called for the captain
with his sad wails among the rocks. His barking was vain; and the
doctor caressed him, without being able to calm him, when the faithful
dog, as if he wanted to replace his master, made a prodigious leap,
and was the first to get ashore amid the dust and ashes which flew
about him.

"Duke! Duke!" said the doctor.

Duke did not hear him, but disappeared. The men then went ashore, and
made the launch fast. Altamont was preparing to climb up a large pile
of rocks, when Duke's distant barking was heard; it expressed pain,
not wrath.

"Listen!" said the doctor.

"Has he got on the track of some animal?" asked the boatswain.

"No," answered the doctor, quivering with emotion; "he's mourning,
crying! Hatteras's body is there!"

At these words the four men started after Duke, in the midst of
blinding cinders; they reached the end of the fiord, a little place
ten feet broad, where the waves were gently breaking. There Duke was
barking near a body wrapped up in the English flag.

"Hatteras, Hatteras!" cried the doctor, rushing to the body of his
friend.

But at once he uttered an explanation which it is impossible to
render. This bleeding and apparently lifeless body had just given
signs of life.

"Alive, alive!" he cried.

"Yes," said a feeble voice, "living on the land of the Pole, where the
tempest cast me up! Living on Queen Island!"

"Hurrah for England!" cried the five together.

"And for America!" added the doctor, holding out one hand to Hatteras
and the other to Altamont. Duke, too, hurrahed in his own way, which
was as good as any other.

At first these kind-hearted men were wholly given up to the pleasure
of seeing their captain again; they felt the tears welling up into
their eyes. The doctor examined Hatteras's condition. He was not
seriously injured. The wind had carried him to the shore, where it was
hard to land; the bold sailor, often beaten back, at last succeeded in
clambering upon a rock above the reach of the waves. Then he lost
consciousness, after wrapping himself up in his flag, and he only came
to himself under Duke's caresses and barking. After receiving a few
attentions, Hatteras was able to rise, and, leaning on the doctor's
arm, to go to the launch.

"The Pole, the North Pole!" he repeated as he walked along.

"You are happy!" the doctor said to him.

"Yes, happy! And you, my friend, don't you feel happy at being here?
This land is the land of the Pole! This sea we have crossed is the sea
of the Pole! This air we breathe is the air of the Pole! O, the North
Pole, the North Pole!"

As he spoke, Hatteras was the victim of a violent excitement, a sort
of fever, and the doctor in vain tried to calm him. His eyes were
strangely bright, and his thoughts were boiling within him. Clawbonny
ascribed this condition to the terrible perils he had gone through.
Hatteras evidently needed rest, and they set about seeking a place to
camp. Altamont soon found a grotto in the rocks, which had fallen in
such a way as to form a cavern. Johnson and Bell brought provisions
there, and let loose the dogs. Towards eleven o'clock everything was
prepared for a meal; the canvas of the tent served as a cloth; the
breakfast, consisting of pemmican, salt meat, tea and coffee, was set
and soon devoured. But first, Hatteras demanded that an observation
should be made; he wanted to know its position exactly. The doctor and
Altamont then took their instruments, and after taking an observation
they found the precise position of the grotto to be latitude 89° 59'
15". The longitude at this height was of no importance, for all the
meridians run together within a few hundred feet higher. So in reality
the island was situated at the North Pole, and the ninetieth degree of
latitude was only forty-five seconds from there, exactly three
quarters of a mile, that is to say, towards the top of the volcano.
When Hatteras knew this result, he asked that it should be stated in
two documents, one to be placed in a cairn on the shore. So at once
the doctor took his pen and wrote the following document, one copy of
which is now in the archives of the Royal Geographical Society in
London:--


"July 11, 1861, in north latitude 89° 59' 15", 'Queen Island' was
discovered at the North Pole by Captain Hatteras, commanding the brig
_Forward_ of Liverpool, who has set his name hereto, with his
companions. Whoever shall find this document is entreated to forward
it to the Admiralty.

  (Signed)  JOHN HATTERAS, Captain of the _Forward_.
            DR. CLAWBONNY.
            ALTAMONT, Captain of the _Porpoise_.
            JOHNSON, Boatswain.
            BELL, Carpenter."


"And now, my friends, to table!" said the doctor, gayly.

[Illustration: "Altamont soon found a grotto in the rocks."]




CHAPTER XXIV.
POLAR COSMOGRAPHY.


Of course, to eat at table, they were obliged to sit on the ground.

"But," said Clawbonny, "who wouldn't give all the tables and
dining-rooms in the world, to dine in north latitude 89° 59' 15"?"

The thoughts of each one were about their situation. They had no other
idea than the North Pole. The dangers they had undergone to reach it,
those to overcome before returning, were forgotten in their
unprecedented success. What neither Europeans, Americans, nor Asiatics
had been able to do, they had accomplished. Hence they were all ready
to listen to the doctor when he told them all that his inexhaustible
memory could recall about their position. It was with real enthusiasm
that he first proposed their captain's health.

[Illustration: "They were all ready to listen to the doctor."]

"To John Hatteras!" he said.

"To John Hatteras!" repeated the others.

"To the North Pole!" answered the captain, with a warmth that was
unusual in this man who was usually so self-restrained, but who now
was in a state of great nervous excitement. They touched glasses, and
the toasts were followed by earnest hand-shakings.

"It is," said the doctor, "the most important geographical fact of our
day! Who would have thought that this discovery would precede that of
the centre of Africa or Australia? Really, Hatteras, you are greater
than Livingstone, Burton, and Barth! All honor to you!"

"You are right, Doctor," said Altamont; "it would seem, from the
difficulty of the undertaking, that the Pole would be the last place
discovered. Whenever the government was absolutely determined to know
the middle of Africa, it would have succeeded at the cost of so many
men and so much money; but here nothing is less certain than success,
and there might be obstacles really insuperable."

"Insuperable!" cried Hatteras with warmth; "there are no insuperable
obstacles; there are more or less determined minds, that is all!"

"Well," said Johnson, "we are here, and it is well. But, Doctor, will
you tell me, once for all, what there is so remarkable about the
Pole?"

"It is this, Johnson, that it is the only motionless part of the
globe, while all the rest is turning with extreme rapidity."

"But I don't see that we are more motionless here than at Liverpool."

"No more than you perceive the motion at Liverpool; and that is
because in both cases you participate in the movement or the repose.
But the fact is no less certain. The earth rotates in twenty-four
hours, and this motion is on an axis with its extremities at the two
poles. Well, we are at one of the extremities of the axis, which is
necessarily motionless."

"So," said Bell, "when our countrymen are turning rapidly, we are
perfectly still?"

"Very nearly, for we are not exactly at the Pole."

"You are right, Doctor," said Hatteras seriously, and shaking his
head; "we are still forty-five seconds from the precise spot."

"That is not far," answered Altamont, "and we can consider ourselves
motionless."

"Yes," continued the doctor, "while those living at the equator move
at the rate of three hundred and ninety-six leagues an hour."

"And without getting tired!" said Bell.

"Exactly!" answered the doctor.

"But," continued Johnson, "besides this movement of rotation, doesn't
the earth also move about the sun?"

"Yes, and this takes a year."

"Is it swifter than the other?"

"Infinitely so; and I ought to say that, although we are at the Pole,
it takes us with it as well as all the people in the world. So our
pretended immobility is a chimera: we are motionless with regard to
the other points of the globe, but not so with regard to the sun."

"Good!" said Bell, with an accent of comic regret; "so I, who thought
I was still, was mistaken! This illusion has to be given up! One can't
have a moment's peace in this world."

"You are right, Bell," answered Johnson; "and will you tell us,
Doctor, how fast this motion is?"

"It is very fast," answered the doctor; "the earth moves around the
sun seventy-six times faster than a twenty-four-pound cannon-ball
flies, which goes one hundred and ninety-five fathoms a second. It
moves, then, seven leagues and six tenths per second; you see it is
very different from the diurnal movement of the equator."

"The deuce!" said Bell; "that is incredible, Doctor! More than seven
leagues a second, and that when it would have been so easy to be
motionless, if God had wished it!"

"Good!" said Altamont; "do you think so, Bell? In that case no more
night, nor spring, nor autumn, nor winter!"

"Without considering a still more terrible result," continued the
doctor.

"What is that?" asked Johnson.

"We should all fall into the sun!"

"Fall into the sun!" repeated Bell with surprise.

"Yes. If this motion were to stop, the earth would fall into the sun
in sixty-four days and a half."

"A fall of sixty-four days!" said Johnson.

"No more nor less," answered the doctor; "for it would have to fall a
distance of thirty-eight millions of leagues."

"What is the weight of the earth?" asked Altamont.

"It is five thousand eight hundred and ninety-one quadrillions of
tons."

"Good!" said Johnson; "those numbers have no meaning."

"For that reason, Johnson, I was going to give you two comparisons
which you could remember. Don't forget that it would take seventy-five
moons to make the sun, and three hundred and fifty thousand earths to
make up the weight of the sun."

"That is tremendous!" said Altamont.

"Tremendous is the word," answered the doctor; "but, to return to the
Pole, no lesson on cosmography on this part of the globe could be more
opportune, if it doesn't weary you."

"Go on, Doctor, go on!"

"I told you," resumed the doctor, who took as much pleasure in giving
as the others did in receiving instruction,--"I told you that the Pole
was motionless in comparison with the rest of the globe. Well, that is
not quite true!"

"What!" said Bell, "has that got to be taken back?"

"Yes, Bell, the Pole is not always exactly in the same place; formerly
the North Star was farther from the celestial pole than it is now. So
our Pole has a certain motion; it describes a circle in about
twenty-six years. That comes from the precession of the equinoxes, of
which I shall speak soon."

"But," asked Altamont, "might it not happen that some day the Pole
should get farther from its place?"

"Ah, my dear Altamont," answered the doctor, "you bring up there a
great question, which scientific men investigated for a long time in
consequence of a singular discovery."

"What was that?"

"This is it. In 1771 the body of a rhinoceros was found on the shore
of the Arctic Sea, and in 1799 that of an elephant on the coast of
Siberia. How did the animals of warm countries happen to be found in
these latitudes? Thereupon there was much commotion among geologists,
who were not so wise as a Frenchman, M. Elie de Beaumont, has been
since. He showed that these animals used to live in rather high
latitudes, and that the streams and rivers simply carried their bodies
to the places where they were found. But do you know the explanation
which scientific men gave before this one?"

"Scientific men are capable of anything," said Altamont.

"Yes, in explanation of a fact; well, they imagined that the Pole used
to be at the equator and the equator at the Pole."

"Bah!"

"It was exactly what I tell you. Now, if it had been so, since the
earth is flattened more than five leagues at the pole, the seas,
carried to the equator by centrifugal force, would have covered
mountains twice as high as the Himalayas; all the countries near the
polar circle, Sweden, Norway, Russia, Siberia, Greenland, and New
Britain, would have been buried in five leagues of water, while the
regions at the equator, having become the pole, would have formed
plateaus fifteen leagues high!"

"What a change!" said Johnson.

"O, that made no difference to scientific men!"

"And how did they explain the alteration?" asked Altamont.

"They said it was due to the shock of collision with a comet. The
comet is the _deus ex machina_; whenever one comes to a difficult
question in cosmography, a comet is lugged in. It is the most obliging
of the heavenly bodies, and at the least sign from a scientific man it
disarranges itself to arrange everything."

"Then," said Johnson, "according to you, Doctor, this change is
impossible?"

"Impossible!"

"And if it should take place?"

"If it did, the equator would be frozen in twenty-four hours!"

"Good! if it were to take place now," said Bell, "people would as
likely as not say we had never gone to the Pole."

"Calm yourself, Bell. To return to the immobility of the terrestrial
axis, the following is the result: if we were to spend a winter here,
we should see the stars describing a circle about us. As for the sun,
the day of the vernal equinox, March 23d, it would appear to us (I
take no account of refraction) exactly cut in two by the horizon, and
would rise gradually in longer and longer curves; but here it is
remarkable that when it has once risen it sets no more; it is visible
for six months. Then its disk touches the horizon again at the
autumnal equinox, September 22d, and as soon as it is set, it is seen
no more again all winter."

"You were speaking just now of the flattening of the earth at the
poles," said Johnson; "be good enough to explain that, Doctor."

"I will. Since the earth was fluid when first created, you understand
that its rotary movement would try to drive part of the mobile mass to
the equator, where the centrifugal force was greater. If the earth had
been motionless, it would have remained a perfect sphere; but in
consequence of the phenomenon I have just described, it has an
ellipsoidal form, and points at the pole are nearer the centre of the
earth than points at the equator by about five leagues."

"So," said Johnson, "if our captain wanted to take us to the centre of
the earth, we should have five leagues less to go?"

"Exactly, my friend."

"Well, Captain, it's so much gained! We ought to avail ourselves of
it."

But Hatteras did not answer. Evidently he had lost all interest in the
conversation, or perhaps he was listening without hearing.

"Well," answered the doctor, "according to certain scientific men, it
would be worth while to try this expedition."

"What! really?" exclaimed Johnson.

"But let me finish," answered the doctor. "I will tell you. I must
first tell you this flattening of the poles is the cause of the
precession of the equinoxes; that is to say, why every year the vernal
equinox comes a day sooner than it would if the earth were perfectly
round. This comes from the attraction of the sun operating in a
different way on the heaped-up land of the equator, which then
experiences a retrograde movement. Subsequently it displaces this Pole
a little, as I just said. But, independently of this effect, this
flattening ought to have a more curious and more personal effect,
which we should perceive if we had mathematical sensibility."

"What do you mean?" asked Bell.

"I mean that we are heavier here than at Liverpool."

"Heavier?"

"Yes; ourselves, the dogs, our guns, and instruments!"

"Is it possible?"

"Certainly, and for two reasons: the first is, that we are nearer the
centre of the globe, which consequently attracts us more strongly, and
this force of gravitation is nothing but weight; the second is, the
rotary force, which is nothing at the pole, is very marked at the
equator, and objects there have a tendency to fly from the earth: they
are less heavy."

"What!" exclaimed Johnson, seriously; "have we not the same weight
everywhere?"

"No, Johnson; according to Newton's law, bodies attract one another
directly as their masses, and inversely to the square of their
distances. Here I weigh more, because I am nearer the centre of
attraction; and on another planet I should weigh more or less
according to the mass of the planet."

"What!" said Bell, "in the moon--"

"In the moon my weight, which is two hundred pounds at Liverpool,
would be only thirty-two pounds."

"And in the sun?"

"O, in the sun I should weigh more than five thousand pounds!"

"Heavens!" said Bell; "you'd need a derrick to move your legs."

"Probably," answered the doctor, laughing at Bell's amazement; "but
here the difference is imperceptible, and by an equal effort of the
muscles Bell would leap as high as on the docks at Liverpool."

"Yes, but in the sun?" urged Bell.

"My friend," answered the doctor, "the upshot of it all is that we are
well off where we are, and need not want to go elsewhere."

"You said just now," resumed Altamont, "that perhaps it would be worth
while to make a journey to the centre of the world; has such an
undertaking ever been thought of?"

"Yes, and this is all I'm going to say about the Pole. There is no
point in the world which has given rise to more chimeras and
hypotheses. The ancients, in their ignorance, placed the garden of the
Hesperides there. In the Middle Ages it was supposed that the earth
was upheld on axles placed at the poles, on which it revolved; but
when comets were seen moving freely, that idea had to be given up.
Later, there was a French astronomer, Bailly, who said that the lost
people mentioned by Plato, the Atlantides, lived here. Finally, it has
been asserted in our own time that there was an immense opening at the
poles, from which came the Northern Lights, and through which one
could reach the inside of the earth; since in the hollow sphere two
planets, Pluto and Proserpine, were said to move, and the air was
luminous in consequence of the strong pressure it felt."

"That has been maintained?" asked Altamont.

"Yes, it has been written about seriously. Captain Symmes, a
countryman of ours, proposed to Sir Humphry Davy, Humboldt, and Arago,
to undertake the voyage! But they declined."

"And they did well."

"I think so. Whatever it may be, you see, my friends, that the
imagination has busied itself about the Pole, and that sooner or later
we must come to the reality."

"At any rate, we shall see for ourselves," said Johnson, who clung to
his idea.

"Then, to-morrow we'll start," said the doctor, smiling at seeing the
old sailor but half convinced; "and if there is any opening to the
centre of the earth, we shall go there together."




CHAPTER XXV.
MOUNT HATTERAS.


After this solid conversation every one made himself as comfortable as
possible in the cavern, and soon fell asleep. Every one, that is,
except Hatteras. Why did not this strange man sleep?

Was not the object of his life attained? Had he not accomplished the
bold projects which lay so near his heart? Why did not calmness
succeed the agitation in his ardent mind? Would not one suppose that,
when he had accomplished this end, Hatteras would fall into a sort of
dejection, and that his over-stretched nerves would seek repose? After
succeeding, it would seem natural that he should be seized with the
feeling of sadness, which always follows satisfied desires.

But no. He was only more excited. It was not, however, the thought of
returning which agitated him so. Did he wish to go farther? Was there
no limit to his ambition, and did he find the world too small, because
he had been around it? However this may have been, he could not sleep.
And yet this first night spent at the pole of the world was pleasant
and quiet. The island was absolutely uninhabited. There was not a bird
in its fire-impregnated atmosphere, not an animal on the soil of
cinders, not a fish in its boiling waters. Only afar off the dull
murmur of the mountain, from the summit of which arose puffs of hot
smoke.

When Bell, Johnson, Altamont, and the doctor awoke, Hatteras was not
to be seen near them. Being anxious, they left the cave, and saw the
captain standing on a rock. His eyes were fixed on the top of the
volcano. He held his instruments in his hands, having evidently been
calculating the exact height of the mountain. The doctor went up to
him and spoke to him several times before he could rouse him from his
revery. At last the captain seemed to understand him.

[Illustration: "They saw the captain standing on a rock."]

"Forward!" said the doctor, who was examining him
attentively,--"forward! let us explore our island; we are all ready
for our last excursion."

"Our last," said Hatteras, with the intonation of people who are
dreaming aloud; "yes, the last, indeed. But also," he continued with
great animation, "the most wonderful!"

He spoke in this way, rubbing his hands over his brow as if to allay
its throbbing. At that moment, Altamont, Johnson, and Bell joined him;
Hatteras appeared to awaken from his revery.

[Illustration: "Hatteras appeared to wake from his revery."]

"My friends," he said with emotion, "thanks for your courage, thanks
for your perseverance, thanks for your superhuman efforts, which have
allowed us to set foot on this land!"

"Captain!" said Johnson, "we have only obeyed; all the honor is due to
you alone!"

"No, no!" resumed Hatteras with emotion; "to you as much as to me! to
Altamont as well as to all of us! as to the doctor himself-- O, let my
heart well over in your hands! It can no longer restrain its joy and
gratitude!"

Hatteras clasped the hands of his companions. He walked to and fro, no
longer master of himself.

"We have only done our duty as Englishmen," said Bell.

"Our duty as friends," continued the doctor.

"Yes," said Hatteras, "but all have not performed this duty. Some have
given way! Still, they must be pardoned, both who were treacherous,
and those who were led away to it! Poor men! I forgive them. You
understand me, Doctor?"

"Yes," answered the doctor, who was very uneasy at Hatteras's
excitement.

"So," went on the captain, "I don't want them to lose the money they
came so far to seek. No, I shall not alter my plan; they shall be
rich,--if they ever see England again!"

Few could have withstood the tenderness with which Hatteras spoke
these last words.

"But, Captain," said Johnson, with an effort at pleasantry, "one would
say you were making your will."

"Perhaps I am," answered Hatteras, seriously.

"Still you have before you a long and glorious life," continued the
old sailor.

"Who can say?" said Hatteras.

A long silence followed these words. The doctor did not dare to try to
interpret the last remark. But Hatteras soon expressed his meaning,
for in a hasty, hardly restrained voice, he went on:--

"My friends, listen to me. We have done a good deal so far, and yet
there is a good deal to do."

His companions gazed at him in astonishment.

"Yes, we are on the land of the Pole, but we are not on the Pole
itself!"

"How so?" asked Altamont.

"You don't mean it!" cried the doctor, anxiously.

"Yes!" resumed Hatteras, earnestly, "I said that an Englishman should
set foot on the Pole; I said it, and an Englishman shall do it."

"What!" ejaculated the doctor.

"We are now forty-five seconds from the unknown point," Hatteras went
on, with increasing animation; "where it is, I am going!"

"But that is the top of the volcano!" said the doctor.

"I'm going!"

"It's an inaccessible spot!"

"I'm going!"

"It's a fiery crater!"

"I'm going!"

The firmness with which Hatteras uttered these words cannot be given.
His friends were stupefied; they gazed with horror at the volcano
tipped with flame. Then the doctor began; he urged and besought
Hatteras to give up his design; he said everything he could imagine,
from entreaty to well-meant threats; but he obtained no concession
from the nervous captain, who was possessed with a sort of madness
which may be called polar madness. Only violent means could stop him,
rushing to his ruin. But seeing that thereby they would produce
serious results, the doctor wished to keep them for a last resource.
He hoped, too, that some physical impossibility, some unsurmountable
difficulty, would compel him to give up his plan.

"Since it is so," he said, "we shall follow you."

"Yes," answered the captain, "half-way up the mountain! No farther!
Haven't you got to carry back to England the copy of the document
which proves our discovery, in case--"

"Still--"

"It is settled," said Hatteras, in a tone of command; "and since my
entreaties as a friend are not enough, I order it as captain."

The doctor was unwilling to urge him any further, and a few moments
later the little band, equipped for a hard climb, and preceded by
Duke, set out. The sky was perfectly clear. The thermometer stood at
52°. The air had all the brilliancy which is so marked at this high
latitude. It was eight o'clock in the morning. Hatteras went ahead
with his dog, the others followed close behind.

"I'm anxious," said Johnson.

"No, no, there's nothing to fear," answered the doctor; "we are here."

It was a strange island, in appearance so new and singular! The
volcano did not seem old, and geologists would have ascribed a recent
date to its formation.

The rocks were heaped upon one another, and only kept in place by
almost miraculous balancing. The mountain, in fact, was composed of
nothing but stones that had fallen from above. There was no soil, no
moss, no lichen, no trace of vegetation. The carbonic acid from the
crater had not yet had time to unite with the hydrogen of the water;
nor the ammonia of the clouds, to form under the action of the light,
organized matter. This island had arisen from successive volcanic
eruptions, like many other mountains; what they have hurled forth has
built them up. For instance, Etna has poured forth a volume of lava
larger than itself; and the Monte Nuovo, near Naples, was formed by
ashes in the short space of forty-eight hours. The heap of rocks
composing Queen's Island had evidently come from the bowels of the
earth. Formerly the sea covered it all; it had been formed long since
by the condensation of the vapor on the cooling globe; but in
proportion as the volcanoes of the Old and New World disappeared, they
were replaced by new craters.

In fact, the earth can be compared to a vast spheroidal boiler. Under
the influence of the central fire an immense quantity of vapor is
generated, which is exposed to a pressure of thousands of atmospheres,
and which would blow up the globe, were it not for the safety-valves
opening on the outside.

These safety-valves are the volcanoes; when one closes, another opens;
and at the poles, where, doubtless in consequence of the flattening of
the earth's surface, the crust is thinner, it is not strange that a
volcano should be suddenly formed by the upheaval of the bottom of the
waves. The doctor noticed all this as he followed Hatteras; his foot
sank into a volcanic tufa, and the deposits of ashes, volcanic stones,
etc., like the syenite and granite of Iceland. But he attributed a
comparatively recent origin to the island, on account of the fact that
no sedimentary soil had yet formed upon it. Water, too, was lacking.
If Queen's Island had existed for several years, there would have been
springs upon it, as there are in the neighborhood of volcanoes. Now,
not only was there no drop of water there, but the vapors which arose
from the stream of lava seemed absolutely anhydrous.

This island, then, was of recent formation; and since it appeared in
one day, it might disappear in another and sink beneath the ocean.

The ascent grew more difficult the higher they went; the sides of the
mountain became nearly perpendicular, and they had to be very careful
to avoid accident. Often columns of cinders were blown about them and
threatened to choke them, or torrents of lava barred their path. On
some such places these streams were hard on top, but the molten stream
flowed beneath. Each one had to test it first to escape sinking into
the glowing mass. From time to time the crater vomited forth huge
red-hot rocks amid burning gases; some of these bodies burst in the
air like shells, and the fragments were hurled far off in all
directions. The innumerable dangers of this ascent may be readily
perceived, as well as the foolhardiness of the attempt.

Still, Hatteras climbed with wonderful agility, and while spurning the
use of his iron-tipped staff, he ascended the steepest slopes. He soon
reached a circular rock, which formed a sort of plateau about ten feet
broad; a glowing stream surrounded it, which was divided at the corner
by a higher rock, and left only a narrow passage through which
Hatteras slipped boldly. There he stopped, and his companions were
able to join him. Then he seemed to estimate the distance yet
remaining; horizontally there were only about six hundred feet of the
crater remaining, that is to say, from the mathematical point of the
Pole; but vertically they had fifteen hundred feet yet to climb. The
ascent had already taken three hours; Hatteras did not seem tired; his
companions were exhausted.

The top of the volcano seemed inaccessible. The doctor wished at any
risk to keep Hatteras from going higher. At first he tried gentle
means, but the captain's excitement amounted to delirium; on the way
he had exhibited all the signs of growing madness, and whoever has
known him in the different scenes of his life cannot be surprised. In
proportion as Hatteras rose above the ocean his excitement increased;
he lived no longer with men; he thought he was growing larger with the
mountain itself.

"Hatteras," said the doctor, "this is far enough! we can't go any
farther!"

"Stay where you are, then," answered the captain in a strange voice;
"I shall go higher!"

"No! that's useless! you are at the Pole here!"

"No, no, higher!"

"My friend, it's I who am speaking to you, Dr. Clawbonny! Don't you
know me?"

"Higher! higher!" repeated the madman.

"Well, no, we sha'n't let--"

The doctor had not finished the sentence before Hatteras, by a violent
effort, sprang over the stream of lava and was out of their reach.
They uttered a cry, thinking Hatteras was lost in the fiery abyss; but
he had reached the other side, followed by Duke, who was unwilling to
abandon him.

He disappeared behind a puff of smoke, and his voice was heard growing
fainter and fainter in the distance.

"To the north!" he was shouting, "to the top of Mount Hatteras! Do you
remember Mount Hatteras?"

They could not think of getting up to him; there were twenty chances
to one against their being able to cross the stream he had leaped over
with the skill and luck of madmen. Nor could they get around it.
Altamont in vain tried to pass; he was nearly lost in trying to cross
the stream of lava; his companions were obliged to hold him by force.

[Illustration]

"Hatteras, Hatteras!" shouted the doctor.

But the captain did not answer; Duke's barking alone was heard upon
the mountain.

Still, Hatteras could be seen at intervals through the column of smoke
and the showers of cinders. Sometimes his arm or head would emerge
from the whirlwind. Then he would disappear and be seen again higher
up in the rocks. His height diminished with the fantastic swiftness of
objects rising in the air. Half an hour later he seemed but a fraction
of his usual size.

The air was filled with the dull noises of the volcano; the mountain
was roaring like a boiler, its sides were quivering. Hatteras kept on,
and Duke followed. From time to time some enormous rock would give way
beneath them and go crashing down to the sea. But Hatteras did not
look back. He had made use of his staff as a pole on which to fasten
the English flag. His companions observed every one of his movements.
His dimensions became gradually smaller, and Duke seemed no larger
than a rat. One moment the wind seemed to drive down upon them a great
wave of flame. The doctor uttered a cry of anguish, but Hatteras
reappeared, standing and brandishing the flag.

[Illustration: "But Hatteras did not look back. He had made use of his
staff as a pole on which to fasten the English flag."]

This sight lasted for more than an hour,--an hour of struggle with the
trembling rocks, with the beds of ashes into which this madman would
sink up to the waist. Now he would be climbing on his knees and making
use of every inequality in the mountain, and now he would hang by his
hands at some sharp corner, swinging in the wind like a dry leaf.

At last he reached the top, the yawning mouth of the crater. The
doctor then hoped that the wretched man, having attained his object,
would perhaps return and have only those dangers before him.

He gave a last shout.

"Hatteras, Hatteras!"

The doctor's cry moved the American's heart so that he cried out,--

"I will save him!"

Then with one leap crossing the fiery torrent at the risk of falling
in, he disappeared among the rocks. Clawbonny did not have time to
stop him. Still, Hatteras, having reached the top, was climbing on top
of a rock which overhung the abyss. The stones were raining about him.
Duke was still following him. The poor beast seemed already dizzy at
the sight beneath him. Hatteras was whirling about his head the flag,
which was lighted with the brilliant reflection, and the red bunting
could be seen above the crater. With one hand Hatteras was holding it;
with the other he was pointing to the zenith, the celestial pole.
Still he seemed to hesitate. He was seeking the mathematical point
where all the meridians meet, and on which in his sublime obstinacy he
wanted to set his foot.

Suddenly the rock gave way beneath him. He disappeared. A terrible cry
from his companions rose even to the summit of the mountain. A
second--a century--passed! Clawbonny considered his friend lost and
buried forever in the depths of the volcano. But Altamont was there,
and Duke too. The man and the dog had seized him just when he was
disappearing in the abyss. Hatteras was saved, saved in spite of
himself, and half an hour later the captain of the _Forward_ lay
unconscious in the arms of his despairing friends.

When he came to himself, the doctor gave him a questioning glance in
mute agony. But his vague look, like that of a blind man, made no
reply.

"Heavens!" said Johnson, "he is blind!"

"No," answered Clawbonny,--"no! My poor friends, we have saved
Hatteras's body! His mind is at the top of the volcano! He has lost
his reason!"

"Mad?" cried Johnson and Altamont in deep distress.

"Mad!" answered the doctor.

And he wept bitterly.




CHAPTER XXVI.
RETURN TO THE SOUTH.


Three hours after this sad conclusion to the adventures of Captain
Hatteras, Clawbonny, Altamont, and the two sailors were assembled in
the cavern at the foot of the volcano. Then Clawbonny was asked to
give his opinion on what was to be done.

"My friends," he said, "we cannot prolong our stay at Queen's Island;
the sea is open before us; our provisions are sufficient; we must set
out and reach Fort Providence as soon as possible, and we can go into
winter-quarters till next summer."

"That is my opinion," said Altamont; "the wind is fair, and to-morrow
we shall set sail."

The day passed in great gloom. The captain's madness was a sad
foreboding, and when Johnson, Bell, and Altamont thought of their
return, they were afraid of their loneliness and remoteness. They felt
the need of Hatteras's bold soul. Still, like energetic men they made
ready for a new struggle with the elements, and with themselves, in
case they should feel themselves growing faint-hearted.

The next day, Saturday, July 13th, the camping materials were put on
the boat, and soon everything was ready for their departure. But
before leaving this rock forever, the doctor, following Hatteras's
intentions, put up a cairn at the place where the captain reached the
island; this cairn was built of large rocks laid on one another, so as
to form a perfectly visible landmark, if it were not destroyed by the
eruption.

[Illustration: "The doctor put up a cairn."]

On one of the lateral stones Bell carved with a chisel this simple
inscription:--

  JOHN HATTERAS
      1861.

A copy of the document was placed inside of the cairn in an
hermetically sealed tin cylinder, and the proof of this great
discovery was left here on these lonely rocks.

Then the four men and the captain,--a poor body without a mind,--and
his faithful Duke, sad and melancholy, got into the boat for the
return voyage. It was ten o'clock in the morning. A new sail was set
up with the canvas of the tent. The launch, sailing before the wind,
left Queen's Island, and that evening the doctor, standing on his
bench, waved a last farewell to Mount Hatteras, which was lighting up
the horizon.

Their voyage was very quick; the sea, which was always open, was easy
sailing, and it seemed really easier to go away from the Pole than to
approach it. But Hatteras was in no state to understand what was going
on about him; he lay at full length in the launch, his mouth closed,
his expression dull, and his arms folded. Duke lay at his feet. It was
in vain that the doctor questioned him. Hatteras did not hear him.

For forty-eight hours the breeze was fair and the sea smooth.
Clawbonny and his companions rejoiced in the north-wind. July 15th,
they made Altamont Harbor in the south; but since the Polar Ocean was
open all along the coast, instead of crossing New America by sledge,
they resolved to sail around it, and reach Victoria Bay by sea. This
voyage was quicker and easier. In fact, the space which had taken them
a fortnight on sledges took them hardly a week by sail; and after
following the rugged outline of the coast, which was fringed with
numerous fiords, and determining its shape, they reached Victoria Bay,
Monday evening, July 23d.

The launch was firmly anchored to the shore, and each one ran to Fort
Providence. The Doctor's House, the stores, the magazine, the
fortifications, all had melted in the sun, and the supplies had been
devoured by hungry beasts.

It was a sad sight.

They were nearly at the end of their supplies, and they had intended
to renew them at Fort Providence. The impossibility of passing the
winter there was evident. Like people accustomed to decide rapidly,
they determined to reach Baffin's Bay as soon as possible.

"We have nothing else to do," said the doctor; "Baffin's Bay is not
six hundred miles from here; we might sail as far as our launch would
carry us, reach Jones's Sound, and from there the Danish settlements."

"Yes," answered Altamont; "let us collect all the provisions we can,
and leave."

By strict search they found a few chests of pemmican here and there,
and two barrels of preserved meat, which had escaped destruction. In
short, they had a supply for six weeks, and powder enough. This was
promptly collected. The day was devoted to calking the launch,
repairing it, and the next day, July 24th, they put out to sea again.

The continent towards latitude 83° inclined towards the east. It was
possible that it joined the countries known under the name of Grinnell
Land, Ellesmere, and North Lincoln, which form the coast-line of
Baffin's Bay. They could then hold it for certain that Jones's Sound
opened in the inner seas, like Lancaster Sound. The launch then sailed
without much difficulty, easily avoiding the floating ice. The doctor,
by way of precaution against possible delay, put them all on
half-rations; but this did not trouble them much, and their health was
unimpaired.

Besides, they were able to shoot occasionally; they killed ducks,
geese, and other game, which gave them fresh and wholesome food. As
for their drink, they had a full supply from the floating ice, which
they met on the way, for they took care not to go far from the coast,
the launch being too small for the open sea.

At this period of the year the thermometer was already, for the
greater part of time, beneath the freezing-point; after a certain
amount of rainy weather snow began to fall, with other signs of the
end of summer; the sun sank nearer the horizon, and more and more of
its disk sank beneath it every day. July 30th they saw it disappear
for the first time, that is to say, they had a few minutes of night.

Still, the launch sailed well, sometimes making from sixty to
seventy-five miles a day; they did not stop a moment; they knew what
fatigues to endure, what obstacles to surmount; the way by land was
before them, if they had to take it, and these confined seas must soon
be closed; indeed, the young ice was already forming here and there.
Winter suddenly succeeds summer in these latitudes; there are no
intermediate seasons; no spring, no autumn. So they had to hurry. July
31st, the sky being clear at sunset, the first stars were seen in the
constellations overhead. From this day on there was perpetual mist,
which interfered very much with their sailing. The doctor, when he saw
all the signs of winter's approach, became very uneasy; he knew the
difficulties Sir John Ross had found in getting to Baffin's Bay, after
leaving his ship; and indeed, having once tried to pass the ice, he
was obliged to return to his ship, and go into winter-quarters for the
fourth year; but he had at least a shelter against the weather, food,
and fuel. If such a misfortune were to befall the survivors of the
_Forward_, if they had to stop or put back, they were lost; the doctor
did not express his uneasiness to his companions; but he urged them to
get as far eastward as possible.

[Illustration]

Finally, August 15th, after thirty days of rather good sailing, after
struggling for forty-eight hours against the ice, which was
accumulating, after having imperilled their little launch a hundred
times, they saw themselves absolutely stopped, unable to go farther;
the sea was all frozen, and the thermometer marked on an average +15°.
Moreover, in all the north and east it was easy to detect the nearness
of land, by the presence of pebbles; frozen fresh water was found more
frequently. Altamont made an observation with great exactness, and
found they were in latitude 77° 15', and longitude 85° 2'.

"So, then," said the doctor, "this is our exact position; we have
reached North Lincoln, exactly at Cape Eden; we are entering Jones's
Sound; if we had been a little luckier, we should have found the sea
open to Baffin's Bay. But we need not complain. If my poor Hatteras
had at first found so open a sea, he would have soon reached the Pole,
his companions would not have deserted him, and he would not have lost
his reason under his terrible sufferings!"

"Then," said Altamont, "we have only one course to follow; to abandon
the launch, and get to the east coast of Lincoln by sledge."

"Abandon the launch and take the sledge? Well," answered the doctor;
"but instead of crossing Lincoln, I propose going through Jones's
Sound on the ice, and reaching North Devon."

"And why?" asked Altamont.

"Because we should get nearer to Lancaster Sound, and have more chance
of meeting whalers."

"You are right, Doctor, but I am afraid the ice is not yet hard
enough."

"We can try," said Clawbonny.

The launch was unloaded; Bell and Johnson put the sledge together; all
its parts were in good condition. The next day the dogs were harnessed
in, and they went along the coast to reach the ice-field.

Then they began again the journey which has been so often described;
it was tiresome and slow; Altamont was right in doubting the strength
of the ice; they could not go through Jones's Sound, and they had to
follow the coast of Lincoln.

August 21st they turned to one side and reached the entrance of
Glacier Sound; then they ventured upon the ice-field, and the next day
they reached Cobourg Island, which they crossed in less than two days
amid snow-squalls. They could advance more easily on the ice-fields,
and at last, August 24th, they set foot on North Devon.

"Now," said the doctor, "we have only to cross this, and reach Cape
Warender, at the entrance of Lancaster Sound."

But the weather became very cold and unpleasant; the snow-squalls
became as violent as in winter; they all found themselves nearly
exhausted. Their provisions were giving out, and each man had but a
third of a ration, in order to allow to the dogs enough food in
proportion to their work.

The nature of the ground added much to the fatigue of the journey;
North Devon was far from level; they had to cross the Trauter
Mountains by almost impassable ravines, struggling against all the
fury of the elements. The sledge, men, and dogs had to rest, and more
than once despair seized the little band, hardened as it was to the
fatigues of a polar journey. But, without their noticing it, these
poor men were nearly worn out, physically and morally; they could not
support such incessant fatigue for eighteen months with impunity, nor
such a succession of hopes and despairs. Besides, it should be borne
in mind that they went forward with enthusiasm and conviction, which
they lacked when returning. So they with difficulty dragged on; they
walked almost from habit, with the animal energy left almost
independent of their will.

It was not until August 30th that they at last left the chaos of
mountains, of which one can form no idea from the mountains of lower
zones, but they left it half dead. The doctor could no longer cheer up
his companions, and he felt himself breaking down. The Trauter
Mountains ended in a sort of rugged plain, heaped up at the time of
the formation of the mountains. There they were compelled to take a
few days of rest; the men could not set one foot before another; two
of the dogs had died of exhaustion. They sheltered themselves behind a
piece of ice, at a temperature of -2°; no one dared put up the tent.
Their food had become very scanty, and, in spite of their extreme
economy with their rations, they had a supply for but a week more;
game became rarer, having left for a milder climate. Starvation
threatened these exhausted men.

[Illustration]

Altamont, who all along had shown great devotion and unselfishness,
took advantage of the strength he had left, and resolved to procure by
hunting some food for his companions. He took his gun, called Duke,
and strode off for the plains to the north; the doctor, Johnson, and
Bell saw him go away without much interest. For an hour they did not
once hear his gun, and they saw him returning without firing a single
shot; but he was running as if in great alarm.

"What is the matter?" asked the doctor.

"There! under the snow!" answered Altamont in great alarm, indicating
a point in the horizon.

"What?"

"A whole band of men--"

"Alive?"

"Dead,--frozen,--and even--"

[Illustration: "Dead--frozen."]

The American durst not finish his sentence, but his face expressed
clearly his horror. The doctor, Johnson, Bell, aroused by this
incident, were able to rise, and drag themselves along in Altamont's
footprints to the part of the plain to which he had pointed. They soon
reached a narrow space, at the bottom of a deep ravine, and there a
terrible sight met their eyes.

Bodies were lying half buried beneath the snow; here an arm, there a
leg, or clinched hands, and faces still preserving an expression of
despair.

The doctor drew near; then he stepped back, pale and agitated, while
Duke barked mournfully.

"Horror!" he said.

"Well?" asked the boatswain.

"Didn't you recognize them?" said the doctor in a strange voice.

"What do you mean?"

"Look!"

This ravine had been the scene of the last struggle between the men
and the climate, despair, and hunger, for from some horrible signs it
was easy to see that they had been obliged to eat human flesh. Among
them the doctor had recognized Shandon, Pen, and the wretched crew of
the _Forward_; their strength and food had failed them; their launch
had probably been crushed by an avalanche, or carried into some
ravine, and they could not take to the open sea; probably they were
lost among these unknown continents. Besides, men who had left in
mutiny could not long be united with the closeness which is necessary
for the accomplishment of great things. A ringleader of a revolt has
never more than a doubtful authority in his hands. And, without doubt,
Shandon was promptly deposed.

However that may have been, the crew had evidently undergone a
thousand tortures, a thousand despairs, to end with this terrible
catastrophe; but the secret of their sufferings is forever buried
beneath the arctic snows.

"Let us flee!" cried the doctor.

And he dragged his companions far from the scene of the disaster.
Horror lent them momentary strength. They set out again.




CHAPTER XXVII.
CONCLUSION.


Why linger over the perpetual sufferings of the survivors? They
themselves could never recall to their memory a clear vision of what
had happened in the week after their horrible discovery of the remains
of the crew. However, September 9th, by a miracle of energy, they
reached Cape Horsburgh, at the end of North Devon.

They were dying of hunger; they had not eaten for forty-eight hours,
and their last meal had been the flesh of their last Esquimaux dog.
Bell could go no farther, and old Johnson felt ready to die. They were
on the shore of Baffin's Bay, on the way to Europe. Three miles from
land the waves were breaking on the edges of the ice-field. They had
to await the uncertain passage of a whaler, and how many days yet?

But Heaven took pity on them, for the next day Altamont clearly saw a
sail. The anguish which follows such an appearance of a sail, the
tortures of disappointment, are well known. The ship seemed to
approach and then to recede. Terrible are the alternations of hope and
despair, and too often at the moment the castaways consider themselves
saved the sail sinks beneath the horizon.

[Illustration]

The doctor and his companions went through all these emotions; they
had reached the western limit of the ice-field, and yet they saw the
ship disappear, taking no note of their presence. They shouted, but in
vain.

Then the doctor had a last inspiration of that busy mind which had
served him in such good stead.

A floe had drifted against the ice-field.

"That floe!" he said, pointing to it.

They did not catch his meaning.

"Let us get on it!" he cried.

They saw his plan at once.

"Ah, Clawbonny, Dr. Clawbonny!" cried Johnson, kissing the doctor's
hands.

Bell, with Altamont's aid, ran to the sledge; he brought one of the
uprights, stood it up on the floe for a mast, making it fast with
ropes; the tent was torn up for a sail. The wind was fair; the poor
castaways put out to sea on this frail raft.

Two hours later, after unheard-of efforts, the last men of the
_Forward_ were taken aboard the Danish whaler _Hans Christian_, which
was sailing to Davis Strait. The captain received kindly these
spectres who had lost their semblance to human beings; when he saw
their sufferings he understood their history; he gave them every
attention, and managed to save their lives. Ten days later, Clawbonny,
Johnson, Bell, Altamont, and Captain Hatteras landed at Korsoeur, in
Zeeland, in Denmark; a steamboat carried them to Kiel; thence, _via_
Altona and Hamburg, they reached London the 13th of the same month,
hardly recovered from their long sufferings.

[Illustration: "Two hours later, after unheard-of efforts, the last
men of the _Forward_ were taken aboard the Danish whaler _Hans
Christian_."]

[Illustration: "A steamboat carried them to Kiel."]

The first thought of the doctor was to ask permission of the Royal
Geographical Society of London to lay a communication before it; he
was admitted to the meeting of July 15th. The astonishment of the
learned assembly, and its enthusiastic cheers after reading Hatteras's
document, may be imagined.

This journey, the only one of its kind, went over all the discoveries
that had been made in the regions about the Pole; it brought together
the expeditions of Parry, Ross, Franklin, MacClure; it completed the
chart between the one hundredth and one hundred and fifteenth
meridians; and, finally, it ended with the point of the globe hitherto
inaccessible, with the Pole itself.

Never had news so unexpected burst upon astonished England.

The English take great interest in geographical facts; they are proud
of them, lord and cockney, from the merchant prince to the workman in
the docks.

The news of this great discovery was telegraphed over the United
Kingdom with great rapidity; the papers printed the name of Hatteras
at the head of their columns as that of a martyr, and England glowed
with pride.

The doctor and his companions were feasted everywhere; they were
formally presented to her Majesty by the Lord High Chancellor.

The government confirmed the name of Queen's Island for the rock at
the North Pole, of Mount Hatteras for the mountain itself, and of
Altamont Harbor for the port in New America.

Altamont did not part from those whose misery and glory he had shared,
and who were now his friends. He followed the doctor, Johnson, and
Bell to Liverpool, where they were warmly received, after they had
been thought to be long dead, and buried in the eternal ice.

But Dr. Clawbonny always gave the glory to the man who most deserved
it. In his account of the journey entitled "The English at the North
Pole," published the next year by the Royal Geographical Society, he
made John Hatteras equal to the greatest explorers, the rival of those
bold men who sacrifice everything to science.

But the sad victim of a lofty passion lived peacefully at the asylum
of Starr Cottage near Liverpool, where the doctor had placed him. His
madness was of a gentle kind, but he never spoke, he understood
nothing, his power of speech seemed to have gone with his reason. A
single feeling seemed to unite him to the outer world, his love for
Duke, who was not separated from him.

This disease, this "polar madness," pursued its course quietly,
presenting no particular symptom, when Dr. Clawbonny, who often
visited his poor patient, was struck by his singular manner.

For some time Captain Hatteras, followed by his faithful dog, that
used to gaze at him sadly, would walk for hours every day; but he
always walked in one way, in the direction of a certain path. When he
had reached the end, he would return, walking backwards. If any one
stopped him, he would point his finger at a portion of the sky. If any
one tried to make him turn round, he grew angry, and Duke would show
his anger and bark furiously.

The doctor observed carefully this odd mania; he understood the motive
of this strange obstinacy; he guessed the reason of this walk always
in the same direction, and, so to speak, under the influence of a
magnetic force.

Captain John Hatteras was always walking towards the north.

Transcriber's notes on inconsistencies, errors and corrections.

Table of Contents: Part II., Chapter X., "The Pleasure of
Winter-Quarters" is corrected to "The Pleasures of Winter-Quarters" to
match the chapter title.

Part I.

Chapter 2: The letter says the large Danish dog will arrive on the
15th of February.  In chapter 3 the dog arrives on the 15th of March
"as the captain's letter had said." Other versions have the same
inconsistency.

Chapter 5: In the discussion of steamers, the doctor observes of the
_Fox_ that MacClintock "succeeded in making his way more easily and
more directly than all his successors." Other translations say
"predecessors" which makes more sense.

Chapter 5: On April 14 the longitude given is 22 degrees 37 minutes.
Other versions give 22 degrees 58 minutes. Other versions agree that
the latitude is 51 degrees--which hardly seems possible for a ship
leaving Ireland at nearly 56 degrees latitude and sailing northwest.
57 degrees seems more likely. A few days later the latitude is further
confused during the discussion of iceberg sightings. The doctor states
that they are two degrees further north than a sighting of icebergs
occurring at 42 degrees latitude, apparently confusing the _Forward's_
latitude with that of the _Ann Poole_.

Chapter 6: In the remembrance of Parry's expedition into Lancaster
Sound, mention is made of the prize for crossing a meridian at higher
than the seventy-seventh parallel. Here the specific meridian is left
out, which is not very informative. In the French version, it is the
170th meridian, which is clearly wrong. The Ward and Lock translation
changes it to the 117th meridian. Historically, the prize was for the
110th meridian.

Chapter 8: On Saturday, the temperature is stated to have fallen to 8
degrees above zero. The French and Routledge translation state 8
degrees below zero. This makes more sense since the previous
temperature cited, from which it had fallen, was 6 degrees above zero.

Chapter 8: The block of ice which turns upside down is stated to be
800 feet high. This appears to be a mistranslation of the French;
other translations have it as at least a hundred feet high.

Chapter 9: According to this translation, the _Forward_ crosses the
62nd parallel on May 5. This is clearly incorrect since the ship is
north of its May 1 latitude of 68 degrees. Other versions have this as
the 72nd parallel. This agrees with the accompanying map.

Chapter 10: Although "the Governor was born on the island of Disco,
and he has never left the place," the landing party meets him at
Upernavik which is well north of the island of Disco.

Chapter 12: The captain declares their latitude to be at 72 degrees
when they are actually at 74 degrees. The promise of 1000 pounds for
each degree beyond 72 is continued throughout the book.

Chapter 12: Names of several English explorers have been garbled in
this translation:

  "Stuart" = Charles Sturt
  "McDougall Stuart" = John McDouall Stuart
  "Wells" = William John Wills
  "Havnoan" = ??--Haouran (French version) is a place in Syria.

Chapter 15: "During the day two whalers were seen making toward the
south;" should be "During the day two whales were seen" etc. to agree
with other translations and the French version. Finding whalers in
this area would contradict the spirit of the adventure.

Chapter 16: "the barometer fell to 29°" should be "the barometer fell
to 29 inches" to agree with the French version and the measurement
scale of barometers.

Chapter 16: "Friday, June 7th" should be "Friday, June 8th" to agree
with the French version and the timing since the previous date of June
6.

Chapter 16: "found a declination of only 89 degrees 50 minutes,"
should be "89 degrees 59 minutes'" to agree with other translations
and the French version and to make sense of the following statement of
being within a minute of the magnetic pole.

Chapter 18: "'The way west is easier than the way north.'" agrees with
the French, but has been changed to "'The way east'" in other
translations. Baffin's Bay is, in fact, east of Melville Bay.

Chapter 18: Clifton's counting of the crew at sixteen is faulty since
Garry turned into Hatteras and would no longer be counted. The per
degree rate should be 62 pounds not 72 pounds to agree with all other
versions and actual calculation.

Chapter 18: On June 19th, Point Minto is said by all versions to be at
72 degrees latitude. It is actually at 73 degrees. The next paragraph
immediately proceeds to 74 degrees latitude at Melville Bay.

Chapter 20: Creswell's march to Beechey Island was 470 miles in the
French version and in later discussions in Part II, Chapter 15.

Chapter 21: The year of Lieutenant Bellot's first expedition in search
of Franklin is corrected from "18 0" to "1850."

Chapter 23: The large white masses gathering "indicated an approaching
thaw" is translated in another version as "an approaching frost" which
agrees with the French version and makes more sense.

Chapter 25: Clifton's anticipated fortune is said to be
"hardly-earned" when "hard-earned" would be more appropriate.

Chapter 29: The temperature on January 15 of -22 should be -32 degrees
to agree with the French version and the other translations.

Chapter 31: The doctor's ophthalmia should not lead to "deafness" but
to "blindness" as in other translations.

Chapter 33: In the final sentence of the chapter the latitude of the
_Forward_ should be "eightieth degree" not "eighty-fourth degree."
Eighty-fourth is clearly wrong since in chapter 2 of part II, their
latitude is stated as eighty degrees fifteen minutes.

Part II.

Chapter 1: The count of "eighteen men who had sailed in the brig"
continues to ignore that there were only seventeen men and that
Hatteras and Garry are one and the same person.

Chapter 2: Johnson's question, "how far are we from the nearest sea to
the west?" should be "how far are we from the nearest sea to the
east?" The disorientation continues with Bell's suggestion to travel
south or west. Baffin's Bay, the only place they can hope for rescue
is south and east of their current position.

Chapter 3: The date of the day the doctor killed the seal is stated as
the 18th and should be the 15th. The date mentioned two paragraphs
previously was the 14th, and the date mentioned as the next day in the
next paragraph is the 16th.

Chapter 5: "Hatteras loaded the gun with the last charge of powder"
should be "the doctor loaded the gun with the last charge of powder"
to agree with the French and the sense of the paragraph.

Chapter 5: Altamont comments that his ship is less than four degrees
from the Pole when it actually is not, but is within seven degrees.

Chapter 9: The author's intention for the outside temperature here is
uncertain. The -31 degrees of this translation does not agree with the
French in which it is -73 degrees (-31 degrees Centigrade). The latter
two are not equivalent temperatures. Later in this chapter it is
stated that the outside temperature can never exist lower than -72
degrees. If the author intended -31 degrees Centigrade, this would
convert to -24 degrees Fahrenheit.

Chapter 9: "The temperature of Englishmen is generally 101 degrees" is
a incorrect conversion of the more accurate 37 degrees Celsius in the
French version. The correct temperature should be 98.6 degrees.

Chapter 9: The mention of "Hadley" concerning a comet collision should
be "Halley" as in the French version.

Chapter 19: "_Uredo vivalis_" should be "_Uredo nivalis_" as in the
French version.

Chapter 20: In this translation as in the French version, Altamont
Harbor is said to be at longitude 118 degrees 35 minutes E. of
Greenwich, whereas it should be W. of Greenwich.

Chapter 22: The spelling of the name "Penn" is corrected to "Pen" as a
typographical error.

Chapter 23: "With a scrap of wood to hold him up," should be "without
a scrap of wood to hold him up," as found in the French version and
required by the sense of the sentence.

Chapter 23: The doctor "uttered an explanation which it is impossible
to render," should be "uttered an exclamation which it is impossible
to render," as found in the French version and required by the sense
of the sentence.

Chapter 24: The doctors comparison "it would take seventy-five moons
to make the sun," should be "it would take seventy-five moons to make
the earth," as in the French version.

Chapter 24: The motion of the Pole "describes a circle in about
twenty-six years" should be "describes a circle in about twenty-six
thousand years" as in the French version.

Chapter 26: "The American durst not not finish his sentence," is
corrected to "The American durst not finish his sentence," as a
typographical error.

Chapter 26: The spelling of the name "Penn" is corrected to "Pen" as a
typographical error.

Chapter 27: The timeline of the concluding chapter is odd. September
9, 1861 the party is at the end of North Devon. The next day
(September 10) they are picked up by the Danish whaler. Ten days later
(September 20) they arrive in Denmark. The 13th of the same month
(September 13? October 13?) they reach London. July 15 (1862?)
Clawbonny attends the Royal Geographical Society of London meeting.
For this to astonish the learned assembly it would need to be two days
after their arrival in London rather than 9 months.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
