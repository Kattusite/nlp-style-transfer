Is your ladyship at home this afternoon?
Show him up—and I’m at home to any one who calls.
It’s best for me to see him before to-night.
How do you do, Lady Windermere?
How do you do, Lord Darlington?
No, I can’t shake hands with you.
My hands are all wet with these roses.
They came up from Selby this morning.
[_Sees a fan lying on the table_.]
And what a wonderful fan!
May I look at it?
It’s got my name on it, and everything.
I have only just seen it myself.
It’s my husband’s birthday present to me.
You know to-day is my birthday?
Yes, I’m of age to-day.
Quite an important day in my life, isn’t it?
That is why I am giving this party to-night.
I wish I had known it was your birthday, Lady Windermere.
I would have covered the whole street in front of your house with flowers for you to walk on.
They are made for you.
Lord Darlington, you annoyed me last night at the Foreign Office.
I am afraid you are going to annoy me again.
[_Enter_ PARKER _and_ FOOTMAN _C._, _with tray and tea things_.]
[_Wipes her hands with her pocket-handkerchief_, _goes to tea-table_, _and sits down_.]
Won’t you come over, Lord Darlington?
[_Takes chair and goes across L.C._]  I am quite miserable, Lady Windermere.
You must tell me what I did.
[_Sits down at LADY WINDERMERE.
Well, you kept paying me elaborate compliments the whole evening.
Ah, nowadays we are all of us so hard up, that the only pleasant things to pay _are_ compliments.
They’re the only things we _can_ pay.
No, I am talking very seriously.
You mustn’t laugh, I am quite serious.
I don’t like compliments, and I don’t see why a man should think he is pleasing a woman enormously when he says to her a whole heap of things that he doesn’t mean.
Ah, but I did mean them.
[_Takes tea which she offers him_.]
I should be sorry to have to quarrel with you, Lord Darlington.
I like you very much, you know that.
But I shouldn’t like you at all if I thought you were what most other men are.
Believe me, you are better than most other men, and I sometimes think you pretend to be worse.
We all have our little vanities, Lady Windermere.
Why do you make that your special one?
[_Still seated at table L._] LORD DARLINGTON.
[_Still seated L.C._]  Oh, nowadays so many conceited people go about Society pretending to be good, that I think it shows rather a sweet and modest disposition to pretend to be bad.
Besides, there is this to be said.
If you pretend to be good, the world takes you very seriously.
If you pretend to be bad, it doesn’t.
Such is the astounding stupidity of optimism.
Don’t you _want_ the world to take you seriously then, Lord Darlington?
Who are the people the world takes seriously?
All the dull people one can think of, from the Bishops down to the bores.
I should like _you_ to take me very seriously, Lady Windermere, _you_ more than any one else in life.
Because I think we might be great friends.
Let us be great friends.
You may want a friend some day.
Why do you say that?
Oh!—we all want friends at times.
I think we’re very good friends already, Lord Darlington.
We can always remain so as long as you don’t— LADY WINDERMERE.
Don’t spoil it by saying extravagant silly things to me.
You think I am a Puritan, I suppose?
Well, I have something of the Puritan in me.
I was brought up like that.
I am glad of it.
My mother died when I was a mere child.
I lived always with Lady Julia, my father’s elder sister, you know.
She was stern to me, but she taught me what the world is forgetting, the difference that there is between what is right and what is wrong.
_She_ allowed of no compromise.
[_Leaning back on the sofa_.]
You look on me as being behind the age.—Well, I am!
I should be sorry to be on the same level as an age like this.
You think the age very bad?
Nowadays people seem to look on life as a speculation.
It is not a speculation.
Oh, anything is better than being sacrificed!
I feel it—I know it.
The men want to know if they are to put the carpets on the terrace for to-night, my lady?
You don’t think it will rain, Lord Darlington, do you?
I won’t hear of its raining on your birthday!
Tell them to do it at once, Parker.
Do you think then—of course I am only putting an imaginary instance—do you think that in the case of a young married couple, say about two years married, if the husband suddenly becomes the intimate friend of a woman of—well, more than doubtful character—is always calling upon her, lunching with her, and probably paying her bills—do you think that the wife should not console herself?
Yes, I think she should—I think she has the right.
Because the husband is vile—should the wife be vile also?
Vileness is a terrible word, Lady Windermere.
It is a terrible thing, Lord Darlington.
Do you know I am afraid that good people do a great deal of harm in this world.
Certainly the greatest harm they do is that they make badness of such extraordinary importance.
It is absurd to divide people into good and bad.
People are either charming or tedious.
I take the side of the charming, and you, Lady Windermere, can’t help belonging to them.
[_Rising and crossing R._, _front of him_.]
Don’t stir, I am merely going to finish my flowers.
[_Goes to table R.C._] LORD DARLINGTON.
And I must say I think you are very hard on modern life, Lady Windermere.
Of course there is much against it, I admit.
Most women, for instance, nowadays, are rather mercenary.
Don’t talk about such people.
Well then, setting aside mercenary people, who, of course, are dreadful, do you think seriously that women who have committed what the world calls a fault should never be forgiven?
I think they should never be forgiven.
Do you think that there should be the same laws for men as there are for women?
I think life too complex a thing to be settled by these hard and fast rules.
If we had ‘these hard and fast rules,’ we should find life much more simple.
You allow of no exceptions?
Ah, what a fascinating Puritan you are, Lady Windermere!
The adjective was unnecessary, Lord Darlington.
I can resist everything except temptation.
You have the modern affectation of weakness.
It’s only an affectation, Lady Windermere.
The Duchess of Berwick and Lady Agatha Carlisle.
[_Coming down C._, _and shaking hands_.]
Dear Margaret, I am so pleased to see you.
You remember Agatha, don’t you?
[_Crossing L.C._]  How do you do, Lord Darlington?
I won’t let you know my daughter, you are far too wicked.
As a wicked man I am a complete failure.
Why, there are lots of people who say I have never really done anything wrong in the whole course of my life.
Of course they only say it behind my back.
Agatha, this is Lord Darlington.
Mind you don’t believe a word he says.
[LORD DARLINGTON _crosses R.C._] No, no tea, thank you, dear.
[_Crosses and sits on sofa_.]
We have just had tea at Lady Markby’s.
I wasn’t at all surprised.
Her own son-in-law supplies it.
Agatha is looking forward so much to your ball to-night, dear Margaret.
[_Seated L.C._]  Oh, you mustn’t think it is going to be a ball, Duchess.
It is only a dance in honour of my birthday.
[_Standing L.C._]  Very small, very early, and very select, Duchess.
[_On sofa L._]  Of course it’s going to be select.
But we know _that_, dear Margaret, about _your_ house.
It is really one of the few houses in London where I can take Agatha, and where I feel perfectly secure about dear Berwick.
I don’t know what society is coming to.
The most dreadful people seem to go everywhere.
They certainly come to my parties—the men get quite furious if one doesn’t ask them.
Really, some one should make a stand against it.
I will have no one in my house about whom there is any scandal.
[_R.C._]  Oh, don’t say that, Lady Windermere.
I should never be admitted!
With women it is different.
Some of us are, at least.
But we are positively getting elbowed into the corner.
Our husbands would really forget our existence if we didn’t nag at them from time to time, just to remind them that we have a perfect legal right to do so.
It’s a curious thing, Duchess, about the game of marriage—a game, by the way, that is going out of fashion—the wives hold all the honours, and invariably lose the odd trick.
Is that the husband, Lord Darlington?
It would be rather a good name for the modern husband.
Dear Lord Darlington, how thoroughly depraved you are!
Ah, don’t say that, Lady Windermere.
Why do you _talk_ so trivially about life, then?
Because I think that life is far too important a thing ever to talk seriously about it.
[_Moves up C._] DUCHESS OF BERWICK.
Do, as a concession to my poor wits, Lord Darlington, just explain to me what you really mean.
[_Coming down back of table_.]
I think I had better not, Duchess.
Nowadays to be intelligible is to be found out.
And now—[_goes up stage_] Lady Windermere, good-bye.
I may come to-night, mayn’t I?
[_Standing up stage with_ LORD DARLINGTON.]
But you are not to say foolish, insincere things to people.
you are beginning to reform me.
It is a dangerous thing to reform any one, Lady Windermere.
[_Bows_, _and DUCHESS OF BERWICK.
[_Who has risen_, _goes C._]  What a charming, wicked creature!
I like him so much.
I’m quite delighted he’s gone!
Where _do_ you get your gowns?
And now I must tell you how sorry I am for you, dear Margaret.
[_Crosses to sofa and sits with_ LADY WINDERMERE.]
Will you go and look over the photograph album that I see there?
[_Goes to table up L._] DUCHESS OF BERWICK.
She is so fond of photographs of Switzerland.
Such a pure taste, I think.
But I really am so sorry for you, Margaret.
Oh, on account of that horrid woman.
She dresses so well, too, which makes it much worse, sets such a dreadful example.
Augustus—you know my disreputable brother—such a trial to us all—well, Augustus is completely infatuated about her.
It is quite scandalous, for she is absolutely inadmissible into society.
Many a woman has a past, but I am told that she has at least a dozen, and that they all fit.
Whom are you talking about, Duchess?
I never heard of her, Duchess.
And what _has_ she to do with me?
Will you go out on the terrace and look at the sunset?
[_Exit through window_, _L._] DUCHESS OF BERWICK.
Shows such refinement of feeling, does it not?
After all, there is nothing like Nature, is there?
But what is it, Duchess?
Why do you talk to me about this person?
I assure you we’re all so distressed about it.
Only last night at dear Lady Jansen’s every one was saying how extraordinary it was that, of all men in London, Windermere should behave in such a way.
My husband—what has _he_ got to do with any woman of that kind?
He goes to see her continually, and stops for hours at a time, and while he is there she is not at home to any one.
Not that many ladies call on her, dear, but she has a great many disreputable men friends—my own brother particularly, as I told you—and that is what makes it so dreadful about Windermere.
We looked upon _him_ as being such a model husband, but I am afraid there is no doubt about it.
My dear nieces—you know the Saville girls, don’t you?—such nice domestic creatures—plain, dreadfully plain, but so good—well, they’re always at the window doing fancy work, and making ugly things for the poor, which I think so useful of them in these dreadful socialistic days, and this terrible woman has taken a house in Curzon Street, right opposite them—such a respectable street, too!
I don’t know what we’re coming to!
And they tell me that Windermere goes there four and five times a week—they _see_ him.
They can’t help it—and although they never talk scandal, they—well, of course—they remark on it to every one.
And the worst of it all is that I have been told that this woman has got a great deal of money out of somebody, for it seems that she came to London six months ago without anything at all to speak of, and now she has this charming house in Mayfair, drives her ponies in the Park every afternoon and all—well, all—since she has known poor dear Windermere.
Oh, I can’t believe it!
But it’s quite true, my dear.
The whole of London knows it.
That is why I felt it was better to come and talk to you, and advise you to take Windermere away at once to Homburg or to Aix, where he’ll have something to amuse him, and where you can watch him all day long.
I assure you, my dear, that on several occasions after I was first married, I had to pretend to be very ill, and was obliged to drink the most unpleasant mineral waters, merely to get Berwick out of town.
He was so extremely susceptible.
Though I am bound to say he never gave away any large sums of money to anybody.
He is far too high-principled for that!
[_Rising and crossing stage to C._]  We are only married two years.
Our child is but six months old.
[_Sits in chair R. of L.
Ah, the dear pretty baby!
How is the little darling?
Is it a boy or a girl?
I hope a girl—Ah, no, I remember it’s a boy!
My boy is excessively immoral.
You wouldn’t believe at what hours he comes home.
And he’s only left Oxford a few months—I really don’t know what they teach them there.
Oh, all of them, my dear, all of them, without any exception.
And they never grow any better.
Men become old, but they never become good.
Windermere and I married for love.
Yes, we begin like that.
It was only Berwick’s brutal and incessant threats of suicide that made me accept him at all, and before the year was out, he was running after all kinds of petticoats, every colour, every shape, every material.
In fact, before the honeymoon was over, I caught him winking at my maid, a most pretty, respectable girl.
I dismissed her at once without a character.—No, I remember I passed her on to my sister; poor dear Sir George is so short-sighted, I thought it wouldn’t matter.
But it did, though—it was most unfortunate.
And now, my dear child, I must go, as we are dining out.
And mind you don’t take this little aberration of Windermere’s too much to heart.
Just take him abroad, and he’ll come back to you all right.
[_L.C._]  Yes, dear, these wicked women get our husbands away from us, but they always come back, slightly damaged, of course.
And don’t make scenes, men hate them!
It is very kind of you, Duchess, to come and tell me all this.
But I can’t believe that my husband is untrue to me.
I was like that once.
Now I know that all men are monsters.
The only thing to do is to feed the wretches well.
A good cook does wonders, and that I know you have.
My dear Margaret, you are not going to cry?
You needn’t be afraid, Duchess, I never cry.
Crying is the refuge of plain women but the ruin of pretty ones.
[_Stands back of table L.C._] DUCHESS OF BERWICK.
Come and bid good-bye to Lady Windermere, and thank her for your charming visit.
And by the way, I must thank you for sending a card to Mr. Hopper—he’s that rich young Australian people are taking such notice of just at present.
His father made a great fortune by selling some kind of food in circular tins—most palatable, I believe—I fancy it is the thing the servants always refuse to eat.
But the son is quite interesting.
I think he’s attracted by dear Agatha’s clever talk.
Of course, we should be very sorry to lose her, but I think that a mother who doesn’t part with a daughter every season has no real affection.
And remember my advice, take the poor fellow out of town at once, it is the only thing to do.
Good-bye, once more; come, Agatha.
I understand now what Lord Darlington meant by the imaginary instance of the couple not two years married.
it can’t be true—she spoke of enormous sums of money paid to this woman.
I know where Arthur keeps his bank book—in one of the drawers of that desk.
I might find out by that.
No, it is some hideous mistake.
[_Rises and goes C._]  Some silly scandal!
But why should I not look?
I am his wife, I have a right to look!
[_Returns to bureau_, _takes out book and examines it page by page_, _smiles and gives a sigh of relief_.]
there is not a word of truth in this stupid story.
[_Puts book back in dranver_.
_As the does so_, _starts and takes out another book_.]
[_Tries to open it_, _but fails_.
_Sees paper knife on bureau_, _and with it cuts cover from book_.
_Begins to start at the first page_.]
Well, dear, has the fan been sent home yet?
Margaret, you have cut open my bank book.
You have no right to do such a thing!
You think it wrong that you are found out, don’t you?
I think it wrong that a wife should spy on her husband.
I did not spy on you.
I never knew of this woman’s existence till half an hour ago.
Some one who pitied me was kind enough to tell me what every one in London knows already—your daily visits to Curzon Street, your mad infatuation, the monstrous sums of money you squander on this infamous woman!
don’t talk like that of Mrs. Erlynne, you don’t know how unjust it is!
You are very jealous of Mrs. Erlynne’s honour.
I wish you had been as jealous of mine.
Your honour is untouched, Margaret.
You don’t think for a moment that—[_Puts book back into desk_.]
I think that you spend your money strangely.
Oh, don’t imagine I mind about the money.
As far as I am concerned, you may squander everything we have.
But what I _do_ mind is that you who have loved me, you who have taught me to love you, should pass from the love that is given to the love that is bought.
And it is I who feel degraded!
I feel stained, utterly stained.
You can’t realise how hideous the last six months seems to me now—every kiss you have given me is tainted in my memory.
I never loved any one in the whole world but you.
Who is this woman, then?
Why do you take a house for her?
I did not take a house for her.
You gave her the money to do it, which is the same thing.
Margaret, as far as I have known Mrs. Erlynne— LADY WINDERMERE.
Is there a Mr. Erlynne—or is he a myth?
Her husband died many years ago.
She is alone in the world.
[_L.C._]  Margaret, I was saying to you—and I beg you to listen to me—that as far as I have known Mrs. Erlynne, she has conducted herself well.
If years ago— LADY WINDERMERE.
[_Crossing R.C._]  I don’t want details about her life!
[_C._]  I am not going to give you any details about her life.
I tell you simply this—Mrs.
Erlynne was once honoured, loved, respected.
She was well born, she had position—she lost everything—threw it away, if you like.
That makes it all the more bitter.
Misfortunes one can endure—they come from outside, they are accidents.
But to suffer for one’s own faults—ah!—there is the sting of life.
It was twenty years ago, too.
She was little more than a girl then.
She had been a wife for even less time than you have.
I am not interested in her—and—you should not mention this woman and me in the same breath.
It is an error of taste.
Margaret, you could save this woman.
She wants to get back into society, and she wants you to help her.
Margaret, I came to ask you a great favour, and I still ask it of you, though you have discovered what I had intended you should never have known that I have given Mrs. Erlynne a large sum of money.
I want you to send her an invitation for our party to-night.
People may chatter about her, do chatter about her, of course, but they don’t know anything definite against her.
She has been to several houses—not to houses where you would go, I admit, but still to houses where women who are in what is called Society nowadays do go.
That does not content her.
She wants you to receive her once.
As a triumph for her, I suppose?
No; but because she knows that you are a good woman—and that if she comes here once she will have a chance of a happier, a surer life than she has had.
She will make no further effort to know you.
Won’t you help a woman who is trying to get back?
If a woman really repents, she never wishes to return to the society that has made or seen her ruin.
[_Crossing to door R._]  I am going to dress for dinner, and don’t mention the subject again this evening.
Arthur [_going to him C._], you fancy because I have no father or mother that I am alone in the world, and that you can treat me as you choose.
You are wrong, I have friends, many friends.
[_L.C._]  Margaret, you are talking foolishly, recklessly.
I won’t argue with you, but I insist upon your asking Mrs. Erlynne to-night.
[_R.C._]  I shall do nothing of the kind.
Ah, Margaret, do this for my sake; it is her last chance.
What has that to do with me?
How hard good women are!
How weak bad men are!
Margaret, none of us men may be good enough for the women we marry—that is quite true—but you don’t imagine I would ever—oh, the suggestion is monstrous!
Why should _you_ be different from other men?
I am told that there is hardly a husband in London who does not waste his life over _some_ shameful passion.
I am not one of them.
I am not sure of that!
You are sure in your heart.
But don’t make chasm after chasm between us.
God knows the last few minutes have thrust us wide enough apart.
Sit down and write the card.
Nothing in the whole world would induce me.
[_Rings electric bell_, _sits and writes card_.]
You are going to invite this woman?
[_Comes down L.C._] LORD WINDERMERE.
Have this note sent to Mrs. Erlynne at No.
and giving note to_ PARKER.]
Arthur, if that woman comes here, I shall insult her.
Child, if you did such a thing, there’s not a woman in London who wouldn’t pity you.
There is not a _good_ woman in London who would not applaud me.
We have been too lax.
We must make an example.
I propose to begin to-night.
Yes, you gave me this fan to-day; it was your birthday present.
If that woman crosses my threshold, I shall strike her across the face with it.
Margaret, you couldn’t do such a thing.
I shall dine in my own room.
I don’t want dinner, in fact.
See that everything is ready by half-past ten.
And, Parker, be sure you pronounce the names of the guests very distinctly to-night.
Sometimes you speak so fast that I miss them.
I am particularly anxious to hear the names quite clearly, so as to make no mistake.
Arthur, if that woman comes here—I warn you— LORD WINDERMERE.
From this moment my life is separate from yours.
But if you wish to avoid a public scandal, write at once to this woman, and tell her that I forbid her to come here!
I will not—I cannot—she must come!
Then I shall do exactly as I have said.
[_Goes R._] You leave me no choice.
I dare not tell her who this woman really is.
The shame would kill her.

You have kept those five dances for him, Agatha?
Just let me see your card.
I’m so glad Lady Windermere has revived cards.—They’re a mother’s only safeguard.
You dear simple little thing!
No nice girl should ever waltz with such particularly younger sons!
The last two dances you might pass on the terrace with Mr. Hopper.
[_Enter_ MR. DUMBY _and_ LADY PLYMDALE _from the ball-room_.]
The air is so pleasant there.
[_These people enter as announced_.]
I suppose this will be the last ball of the season?
I suppose so, Mr. Dumby.
It’s been a delightful season, hasn’t it?
I suppose this will be the last ball of the season?
I suppose so, Mr. Dumby.
It has been a very dull season, hasn’t it?
I suppose this will be the last ball of the season?
There’ll probably be two more.
Lady Jedburgh and Miss Graham.
[_These people enter as announced_.]
How do you do, Lady Windermere?
How do you do, Duchess?
Dear Mr. Hopper, how nice of you to come so early.
We all know how you are run after in London.
They are not nearly so exclusive in London as they are in Sydney.
we know your value, Mr. Hopper.
We wish there were more like you.
It would make life so much easier.
Do you know, Mr. Hopper, dear Agatha and I are so much interested in Australia.
It must be so pretty with all the dear little kangaroos flying about.
Agatha has found it on the map.
What a curious shape it is!
Just like a large packing case.
However, it is a very young country, isn’t it?
Wasn’t it made at the same time as the others, Duchess?
How clever you are, Mr. Hopper.
You have a cleverness quite of your own.
Now I mustn’t keep you.
But I should like to dance with Lady Agatha, Duchess.
Well, I hope she has a dance left.
Have you a dance left, Agatha?
May I have the pleasure?
Mind you take great care of my little chatterbox, Mr. Hopper.
Margaret, I want to speak to you.
Sir James, will you take me into the ball-room?
Augustus has been dining with us to-night.
I really have had quite enough of dear Augustus for the moment.
[SIR JAMES ROYSTON _gives the_ DUCHESS _his aim and escorts her into the ball-room_.]
Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Bowden.
[_These people enter as announced_.]
[_Coming up to_ LORD WINDERMERE.]
Want to speak to you particularly, dear boy.
I’m worn to a shadow.
Know I don’t look it.
None of us men do look what we really are.
What I want to know is this.
Where does she come from?
Why hasn’t she got any demmed relations?
But they make one so demmed respectable.
You are talking of Mrs. Erlynne, I suppose?
I only met her six months ago.
Till then, I never knew of her existence.
You have seen a good deal of her since then.
Yes, I have seen a good deal of her since then.
I have just seen her.
the women are very down on her.
I have been dining with Arabella this evening!
you should have heard what she said about Mrs. Erlynne.
She didn’t leave a rag on her.
Berwick and I told her that didn’t matter much, as the lady in question must have an extremely fine figure.
You should have seen Arabella’s expression!
But, look here, dear boy.
I don’t know what to do about Mrs. Erlynne.
I might be married to her; she treats me with such demmed indifference.
She has got any amount of explanations for you—and all of them different.
No explanations are necessary about my friendship with Mrs. Erlynne.
Well, look here, dear old fellow.
Do you think she will ever get into this demmed thing called Society?
Would you introduce her to your wife?
No use beating about the confounded bush.
Mrs. Erlynne is coming here to-night.
Your wife has sent her a card?
Mrs. Erlynne has received a card.
Then she’s all right, dear boy.
But why didn’t you tell me that before?
It would have saved me a heap of worry and demmed misunderstandings!
[LADY AGATHA _and_ MR. HOPPER _cross and exit on terrace L.U.E._] PARKER.
[_Bows to_ LADY WINDERMERE, _passes over and shakes hands with_ LORD WINDERMERE.]
Why don’t you ask me how I am?
I like people to ask me how I am.
It shows a wide-spread interest in my health.
Now, to-night I am not at all well.
Been dining with my people.
Wonder why it is one’s people are always so tedious?
My father would talk morality after dinner.
I told him he was old enough to know better.
But my experience is that as soon as people are old enough to know better, they don’t know anything at all.
Hear you’re going to be married again; thought you were tired of that game.
You’re excessively trivial, my dear boy, excessively trivial!
By the way, Tuppy, which is it?
Have you been twice married and once divorced, or twice divorced and once married?
I say you’ve been twice divorced and once married.
It seems so much more probable.
I have a very bad memory.
I really don’t remember which.
[_Moves away R._] LADY PLYMDALE.
Lord Windermere, I’ve something most particular to ask you.
I am afraid—if you will excuse me—I must join my wife.
Oh, you mustn’t dream of such a thing.
It’s most dangerous nowadays for a husband to pay any attention to his wife in public.
It always makes people think that he beats her when they’re alone.
The world has grown so suspicious of anything that looks like a happy married life.
But I’ll tell you what it is at supper.
[_Moves towards door of ball-room_.]
I _must_ speak to you.
Will you hold my fan for me, Lord Darlington?
Margaret, what you said before dinner was, of course, impossible?
That woman is not coming here to-night!
[_R.C._]  Mrs. Erlynne is coming here, and if you in any way annoy or wound her, you will bring shame and sorrow on us both.
A wife should trust her husband!
[_C._]  London is full of women who trust their husbands.
One can always recognise them.
They look so thoroughly unhappy.
I am not going to be one of them.
Lord Darlington, will you give me back my fan, please?
A useful thing a fan, isn’t it?
I want a friend to-night, Lord Darlington: I didn’t know I would want one so soon.
I knew the time would come some day; but why to-night?
It would be terrible if there were any scene.
LADY WINDERMERE _clutches at her fan_, _then lets it drop on the door_.
_She bows coldly to_ MRS. ERLYNNE, _who bows to her sweetly in turn_, _and sails into the room_.]
You have dropped your fan, Lady Windermere.
[_Picks it up and hands it to her_.]
[_C._]  How do you do, again, Lord Windermere?
How charming your sweet wife looks!
It was terribly rash of you to come!
The wisest thing I ever did in my life.
And, by the way, you must pay me a good deal of attention this evening.
I am afraid of the women.
You must introduce me to some of them.
The men I can always manage.
How do you do, Lord Augustus?
You have quite neglected me lately.
I have not seen you since yesterday.
I am afraid you’re faithless.
Every one told me so.
[_R._]  Now really, Mrs. Erlynne, allow me to explain.
[_R.C._]  No, dear Lord Augustus, you can’t explain anything.
It is your chief charm.
if you find charms in me, Mrs. Erlynne— [_They converse together_.
LORD WINDERMERE _moves uneasily about the LORD DARLINGTON.
Come out on the terrace.
Parker, send my cloak out.
Lady Windermere, how beautifully your terrace is illuminated.
Reminds me of Prince Doria’s at Rome.
[LADY WINDERMERE _bows coldly_, _and goes off with_ LORD DARLINGTON.]
Oh, how do you do, Mr. Graham?
Isn’t that your aunt, Lady Jedburgh?
I should so much like to know her.
[_After a moment’s hesitation and embarrassment_.]
Oh, certainly, if you wish it.
Aunt Caroline, allow me to introduce Mrs. Erlynne.
So pleased to meet you, Lady Jedburgh.
[_Sits beside her on the sofa_.]
Your nephew and I are great friends.
I am so much interested in his political career.
I think he’s sure to be a wonderful success.
He thinks like a Tory, and talks like a Radical, and that’s so important nowadays.
He’s such a brilliant talker, too.
But we all know from whom he inherits that.
Lord Allandale was saying to me only yesterday, in the Park, that Mr. Graham talks almost as well as his aunt.
[_R._]  Most kind of you to say these charming things to me!
[MRS. ERLYNNE _smiles_, _and continues conversation_.]
Did you introduce Mrs. Erlynne to Lady Jedburgh?
Had to, my dear fellow.
That woman can make one do anything she wants.
Hope to goodness she won’t speak to me!
[_Rises_, _and speaks to_ LORD WINDERMERE, _laughing_.]
What a bore it is to have to be civil to these old dowagers!
But they always insist on it!
Who is that well-dressed woman talking to Windermere?
Haven’t got the slightest idea!
Looks like an _édition de luxe_ of a wicked French novel, meant specially for the English market.
So that is poor Dumby with Lady Plymdale?
I hear she is frightfully jealous of him.
He doesn’t seem anxious to speak to me to-night.
I suppose he is afraid of her.
Those straw-coloured women have dreadful tempers.
Do you know, I think I’ll dance with you first, Windermere.
[LORD WINDERMERE _bits his lip and frowns_.]
It will make Lord Augustus so jealous!
Lord Windermere insists on my dancing with him first, and, as it’s his own house, I can’t well refuse.
You know I would much sooner dance with you.
I wish I could think so, Mrs. Erlynne.
You know it far too well.
I can fancy a person dancing through life with you and finding it charming.
[_Placing his hand on his white waistcoat_.]
Oh, thank you, thank you.
You are the most adorable of all ladies!
So simple and so sincere!
Just the sort of speech I like.
Well, you shall hold my bouquet.
[_Goes towards ball-room on_ LORD WINDERMERE’S _arm_.]
Ah, Mr. Dumby, how are you?
I am so sorry I have been out the last three times you have called.
Come and lunch on Friday.
_follows_ MRS. ERLYNNE _and_ LORD WINDERMERE _into the ball-room holding bouquet_.]
What an absolute brute you are!
I never can believe a word you say!
Why did you tell me you didn’t know her?
What do you mean by calling on her three times running?
You are not to go to lunch there; of course you understand that?
My dear Laura, I wouldn’t dream of going!
You haven’t told me her name yet!
[_Coughs slightly and smooths his hair_.]
Yes; that is what every one calls her.
I really must have a good stare at her.
[_Goes to door of ball-room and looks in_.]
I have heard the most shocking things about her.
They say she is ruining poor Windermere.
And Lady Windermere, who goes in for being so proper, invites her!
It takes a thoroughly good woman to do a thoroughly stupid thing.
You are to lunch there on Friday!
Because I want you to take my husband with you.
He has been so attentive lately, that he has become a perfect nuisance.
Now, this woman is just the thing for him.
He’ll dance attendance upon her as long as she lets him, and won’t bother me.
I assure you, women of that kind are most useful.
They form the basis of other people’s marriages.
What a mystery you are!
I am the only person in the world I should like to know thoroughly; but I don’t see any chance of it just at present.
[_They pass into the ball-room_, _and_ LADY WINDERMERE _and_ LORD DARLINGTON _enter from the terrace_.]
Her coming here is monstrous, unbearable.
I know now what you meant to-day at tea-time.
Why didn’t you tell me right out?
A man can’t tell these things about another man!
But if I had known he was going to make you ask her here to-night, I think I would have told you.
That insult, at any rate, you would have been spared.
I did not ask her.
He insisted on her coming—against my entreaties—against my commands.
the house is tainted for me!
I feel that every woman here sneers at me as she dances by with my husband.
What have I done to deserve this?
I gave him all my life.
He took it—used it—spoiled it!
I am degraded in my own eyes; and I lack courage—I am a coward!
If I know you at all, I know that you can’t live with a man who treats you like this!
What sort of life would you have with him?
You would feel that he was lying to you every moment of the day.
You would feel that the look in his eyes was false, his voice false, his touch false, his passion false.
He would come to you when he was weary of others; you would have to comfort him.
He would come to you when he was devoted to others; you would have to charm him.
You would have to be to him the mask of his real life, the cloak to hide his secret.
You are right—you are terribly right.
But where am I to turn?
You said you would be my friend, Lord Darlington.—Tell me, what am I to do?
Between men and women there is no friendship possible.
There is passion, enmity, worship, love, but no friendship.
I love you— LADY WINDERMERE.
You are more to me than anything in the whole world.
What does your husband give you?
Whatever is in him he gives to this wretched woman, whom he has thrust into your society, into your home, to shame you before every one.
I offer you my life— LORD DARLINGTON.
Take it, and do with it what you will.
I love you—love you as I have never loved any living thing.
From the moment I met you I loved you, loved you blindly, adoringly, madly!
You did not know it then—you know it now!
I won’t tell you that the world matters nothing, or the world’s voice, or the voice of society.
They matter a great deal.
They matter far too much.
But there are moments when one has to choose between living one’s own life, fully, entirely, completely—or dragging out some false, shallow, degrading existence that the world in its hypocrisy demands.
You have that moment now.
[_Moving slowly away from him_, _and looking at him with startled eyes_.]
I have not the courage.
Yes; you have the courage.
There may be six months of pain, of disgrace even, but when you no longer bear his name, when you bear mine, all will be well.
Margaret, my love, my wife that shall be some day—yes, my wife!
This woman has the place that belongs by right to you.
go—go out of this house, with head erect, with a smile upon your lips, with courage in your eyes.
All London will know why you did it; and who will blame you?
If they do, what matter?
It’s wrong for a man to abandon his wife for a shameless woman.
It is wrong for a wife to remain with a man who so dishonours her.
You said once you would make no compromise with things.
I am afraid of being myself.
My husband may return to me.
And you would take him back!
You are not what I thought you were.
You are just the same as every other woman.
You would stand anything rather than face the censure of a world, whose praise you would despise.
In a week you will be driving with this woman in the Park.
She will be your constant guest—your dearest friend.
You would endure anything rather than break with one blow this monstrous tie.
You have no courage; none!
Ah, give me time to think.
I cannot answer you now.
[_Passes her hand nervously over her brow_.]
It must be now or not at all.
This is the last time I shall ever look on you.
You will never see me again.
For one moment our lives met—our souls touched.
They must never meet or touch again.
How alone I am in life!
_Enter the_ DUCHESS OF BERWICK _and_ LORD PAISLEY _laughing and talking_.
_Other guests come on from ball-room_.]
Dear Margaret, I’ve just been having such a delightful chat with Mrs. Erlynne.
I am so sorry for what I said to you this afternoon about her.
Of course, she must be all right if _you_ invite her.
A most attractive woman, and has such sensible views on life.
Told me she entirely disapproved of people marrying more than once, so I feel quite safe about poor Augustus.
Can’t imagine why people speak against her.
It’s those horrid nieces of mine—the Saville girls—they’re always talking scandal.
Still, I should go to Homburg, dear, I really should.
She is just a little too attractive.
Oh, there she is:  [LADY AGATHA _and_ MR. HOPPER _enter from terrace L.U.E._]  Mr. Hopper, I am very, very angry with you.
You have taken Agatha out on the terrace, and she is so delicate.
We went out for a moment and then got chatting together.
[_C._]  Ah, about dear Australia, I suppose?
Did Mr. Hopper definitely— DUCHESS OF BERWICK.
And what answer did you give him, dear child?
You always say the right thing.
Agatha has told me everything.
How cleverly you have both kept your secret.
You don’t mind my taking Agatha off to Australia, then, Duchess?
Oh, don’t mention that dreadful vulgar place.
But she said she’d like to come with me.
Did you say that, Agatha?
Agatha, you say the most silly things possible.
I think on the whole that Grosvenor Square would be a more healthy place to reside in.
There are lots of vulgar people live in Grosvenor Square, but at any rate there are no horrid kangaroos crawling about.
But we’ll talk about that to-morrow.
James, you can take Agatha down.
You’ll come to lunch, of course, James.
At half-past one, instead of two.
The Duke will wish to say a few words to you, I am sure.
I should like to have a chat with the Duke, Duchess.
He has not said a single word to me yet.
I think you’ll find he will have a great deal to say to you to-morrow.
[_Exit_ LADY AGATHA _with_ MR.
I’m afraid it’s the old, old story, dear.
Love—well, not love at first sight, but love at the end of the season, which is so much more satisfactory.
My dear Margaret, what a handsome woman your husband has been dancing with!
I should be quite jealous if I were you!
Is she a great friend of yours?
[_Looks at_ MR. DUMBY _and exit_.]
Awful manners young Hopper has!
Hopper is one of Nature’s gentlemen, the worst type of gentleman I know.
Lots of wives would have objected to Mrs. Erlynne coming.
But Lady Windermere has that uncommon thing called common sense.
And Windermere knows that nothing looks so like innocence as an indiscretion.
Yes; dear Windermere is becoming almost modern.
[_Bows to_ LADY WINDERMERE _and exit_.]
What a fascinating woman Mrs. Erlynne is!
She is coming to lunch on Thursday, won’t you come too?
I expect the Bishop and dear Lady Merton.
I am afraid I am engaged, Lady Jedburgh.
[_Exeunt_ LADY JEDBURGH _and_ MRS. ERLYNNE.
Charming ball it has been!
Quite reminds me of old days.
And I see that there are just as many fools in society as there used to be.
So pleased to find that nothing has altered!
The last time I saw her—twenty years ago, she was a fright in flannel.
Positive fright, I assure you.
and that sweet Lady Agatha!
Just the type of girl I like!
Well, really, Windermere, if I am to be the Duchess’s sister-in-law— LORD WINDERMERE.
_watches_, _with a look of scorn and pain_, MRS. ERLYNNE _and her husband_.
_They are unconscious of her presence_.]
He’s to call to-morrow at twelve o’clock!
He wanted to propose to-night.
Poor Augustus, you know how he repeats himself.
But I told him I wouldn’t give him an answer till to-morrow.
Of course I am going to take him.
And I dare say I’ll make him an admirable wife, as wives go.
And there is a great deal of good in Lord Augustus.
Fortunately it is all on the surface.
Just where good qualities should be.
Of course you must help me in this matter.
I am not called on to encourage Lord Augustus, I suppose?
But you will make me a handsome settlement, Windermere, won’t you?
Is that what you want to talk to me about to-night?
[_With a gesture of impatience_.]
I will not talk of it here.
Then we will talk of it on the terrace.
Even business should have a picturesque background.
With a proper background women can do anything.
Won’t to-morrow do as well?
No; you see, to-morrow I am going to accept him.
And I think it would be a good thing if I was able to tell him that I had—well, what shall I say?—£2000 a year left to me by a third cousin—or a second husband—or some distant relative of that kind.
It would be an additional attraction, wouldn’t it?
You have a delightful opportunity now of paying me a compliment, Windermere.
But you are not very clever at paying compliments.
I am afraid Margaret doesn’t encourage you in that excellent habit.
It’s a great mistake on her part.
When men give up saying what is charming, they give up thinking what is charming.
But seriously, what do you say to £2000?
In modern life margin is everything.
Windermere, don’t you think the world an intensely amusing place?
[_Exit on terrace with_ LORD WINDERMERE.
Music strikes up in ball-room.]
To stay in this house any longer is impossible.
To-night a man who loves me offered me his whole life.
It was foolish of me.
I will offer him mine now.
I will give him mine.
I will go to him!
[_Puts on cloak and goes to the door_, _then turns back_.
_Sits down at table and writes a letter_, _puts it into an envelope_, _and leaves it on table_.]
Arthur has never understood me.
When he reads this, he will.
He may do as he chooses now with his life.
I have done with mine as I think best, as I think right.
It is he who has broken the bond of marriage—not I.  I only break its bondage.
[_PARKER enters L. and crosses towards the ball-room R._  _Enter_ MRS. MRS. ERLYNNE.
Is Lady Windermere in the ball-room?
Her ladyship has just gone out.
She’s not on the terrace?
Her ladyship has just gone out of the house.
[_Starts_, _and looks at the servant with a puzzled expression in her face_.]
Yes, madam—her ladyship told me she had left a letter for his lordship on the table.
A letter for Lord Windermere?
_The music in the ball-room stops_.]
Gone out of her house!
A letter addressed to her husband!
[_Goes over to bureau and looks at letter_.
_Takes it up and lays it down again with a shudder of fear_.]
Life doesn’t repeat its tragedies like that!
Oh, why does this horrible fancy come across me?
Why do I remember now the one moment of my life I most wish to forget?
Does life repeat its tragedies?
[_Tears letter open and reads it_, _then sinks down into a chair with a gesture of anguish_.]
The same words that twenty years ago I wrote to her father!
and how bitterly I have been punished for it!
No; my punishment, my real punishment is to-night, is now!
[_Still seated R._] LORD WINDERMERE.
Have you said good-night to my wife?
[_Crushing letter in her hand_.]
She has gone to bed.
She said she had a headache.
I must go to her.
She’s only very tired, that is all.
Besides, there are people still in the supper-room.
She wants you to make her apologies to them.
She said she didn’t wish to be disturbed.
She asked me to tell you!
Oh yes, thank you, that is mine.
[_Puts out her hand to take it_.]
But it’s my wife’s handwriting, isn’t it?
Will you ask them to call my carriage, please?
I feel a passion awakening within me that I never felt before.
The daughter must not be like the mother—that would be terrible.
How can I save her?
How can I save my child?
A moment may ruin a life.
Who knows that better than I?
Windermere must be got out of the house; that is absolutely necessary.
[_Goes L._]  But how shall I do it?
It must be done somehow.
Dear lady, I am in such suspense!
May I not have an answer to my request?
Lord Augustus, listen to me.
You are to take Lord Windermere down to your club at once, and keep him there as long as possible.
But you said you wished me to keep early hours!
Do what I tell you.
Do what I tell you.
But don’t let Windermere out of your sight to-night.
If you do I will never forgive you.
I will never speak to you again.
I’ll have nothing to do with you.
Remember you are to keep Windermere at your club, and don’t let him come back to-night.
Well, really, I might be her husband already.
[_Follows her in a bewildered manner_.]
* * * * * _Lord Darlington’s Rooms_.
_A large sofa is in front of fireplace R._ _At the back of the stage a curtain is drawn across the window_.
_Doors L. and R._  _Table R. with writing materials.
Table C. with syphons, glasses, and Tantalus frame_.
_Table L. with cigar and cigarette box.
Why is he not here, to wake by passionate words some fire within me?
I am cold—cold as a loveless thing.
Arthur must have read my letter by this time.
If he cared for me, he would have come after me, would have taken me back by force.
He’s entrammelled by this woman—fascinated by her—dominated by her.
If a woman wants to hold a man, she has merely to appeal to what is worst in him.
We make gods of men and they leave us.
Others make brutes of them and they fawn and are faithful.
it was mad of me to come here, horribly mad.
And yet, which is the worst, I wonder, to be at the mercy of a man who loves one, or the wife of a man who in one’s own house dishonours one?
What woman in the whole world?
But will he love me always, this man to whom I am giving my life?
What do I bring him?
Lips that have lost the note of joy, eyes that are blinded by tears, chill hands and icy heart.
I must go back—no; I can’t go back, my letter has put me in their power—Arthur would not take me back!
Lord Darlington leaves England to-morrow.
I will go with him—I have no choice.
[_Sits down for a few moments_.
_Then starts up and puts on her cloak_.]
I will go back, let Arthur do with me what he pleases.
It has been madness my coming.
I must go at once.
What can I say to him?
Will he let me go away at all?
I have heard that men are brutal, horrible .
[_Hides her face in her hands_.]
[LADY WINDERMERE _starts and looks up_.
Thank Heaven I am in time.
You must go back to your husband’s house immediately.
There is not a second to be lost.
Lord Darlington may return at any moment.
You are on the brink of ruin, you are on the brink of a hideous precipice.
You must leave this place at once, my carriage is waiting at the corner of the street.
You must come with me and drive straight home.
[LADY WINDERMERE _throws off her cloak and flings it on the sofa_.]
Mrs. Erlynne—if you had not come here, I would have gone back.
But now that I see you, I feel that nothing in the whole world would induce me to live under the same roof as Lord Windermere.
You fill me with horror.
There is something about you that stirs the wildest—rage within me.
And I know why you are here.
My husband sent you to lure me back that I might serve as a blind to whatever relations exist between you and him.
You don’t think that—you can’t.
Go back to my husband, Mrs. Erlynne.
He belongs to you and not to me.
I suppose he is afraid of a scandal.
They outrage every law of the world, and are afraid of the world’s tongue.
But he had better prepare himself.
He shall have a scandal.
He shall have the worst scandal there has been in London for years.
He shall see his name in every vile paper, mine on every hideous placard.
Had he come himself, I admit I would have gone back to the life of degradation you and he had prepared for me—I was going back—but to stay himself at home, and to send you as his messenger—oh!
[_C._]  Lady Windermere, you wrong me horribly—you wrong your husband horribly.
He doesn’t know you are here—he thinks you are safe in your own house.
He thinks you are asleep in your own room.
He never read the mad letter you wrote to him!
No—he knows nothing about it.
How simple you think me!
You are lying to me!
I am telling you the truth.
If my husband didn’t read my letter, how is it that you are here?
Who told you I had left the house you were shameless enough to enter?
Who told you where I had gone to?
My husband told you, and sent you to decoy me back.
[_R.C._]  Your husband has never seen the letter.
I—saw it, I opened it.
You opened a letter of mine to my husband?
to save you from the abyss into which you are falling, there is nothing in the world I would not dare, nothing in the whole world.
Your husband has never read it.
He never shall read it.
It should never have been written.
[_Tears it and throws it into the fire_.]
[_With infinite contempt in her voice and look_.]
How do I know that that was my letter after all?
You seem to think the commonest device can take me in!
why do you disbelieve everything I tell you?
What object do you think I have in coming here, except to save you from utter ruin, to save you from the consequence of a hideous mistake?
That letter that is burnt now _was_ your letter.
I swear it to you!
You took good care to burn it before I had examined it.
You, whose whole life is a lie, could you speak the truth about anything?
Think as you like about me—say what you choose against me, but go back, go back to the husband you love.
I do _not_ love him!
You do, and you know that he loves you.
He does not understand what love is.
He understands it as little as you do—but I see what you want.
It would be a great advantage for you to get me back.
what a life I would have then!
Living at the mercy of a woman who has neither mercy nor pity in her, a woman whom it is an infamy to meet, a degradation to know, a vile woman, a woman who comes between husband and wife!
[_With a gesture of despair_.]
Lady Windermere, Lady Windermere, don’t say such terrible things.
You don’t know how terrible they are, how terrible and how unjust.
Only go back to your husband, and I promise you never to communicate with him again on any pretext—never to see him—never to have anything to do with his life or yours.
The money that he gave me, he gave me not through love, but through hatred, not in worship, but in contempt.
The hold I have over him— LADY WINDERMERE.
you admit you have a hold!
Yes, and I will tell you what it is.
It is his love for you, Lady Windermere.
You expect me to believe that?
It is his love for you that has made him submit to—oh!
call it what you like, tyranny, threats, anything you choose.
But it is his love for you.
His desire to spare you—shame, yes, shame and disgrace.
What have I to do with you?
I know it—but I tell you that your husband loves you—that you may never meet with such love again in your whole life—that such love you will never meet—and that if you throw it away, the day may come when you will starve for love and it will not be given to you, beg for love and it will be denied you—Oh!
And you tell me there is nothing between you?
Lady Windermere, before Heaven your husband is guiltless of all offence towards you!
And I—I tell you that had it ever occurred to me that such a monstrous suspicion would have entered your mind, I would have died rather than have crossed your life or his—oh!
[_Moves away to sofa R._] LADY WINDERMERE.
You talk as if you had a heart.
Women like you have no hearts.
Heart is not in you.
You are bought and sold.
[_Starts_, _with a gesture of pain_.
_Then restrains herself_, _and comes over to where_ LADY WINDERMERE _is sitting_.
_As she speaks_, _she stretches out her hands towards her_, _but does not dare to touch her_.]
Believe what you choose about me.
I am not worth a moment’s sorrow.
But don’t spoil your beautiful young life on my account!
You don’t know what may be in store for you, unless you leave this house at once.
You don’t know what it is to fall into the pit, to be despised, mocked, abandoned, sneered at—to be an outcast!
to find the door shut against one, to have to creep in by hideous byways, afraid every moment lest the mask should be stripped from one’s face, and all the while to hear the laughter, the horrible laughter of the world, a thing more tragic than all the tears the world has ever shed.
You don’t know what it is.
One pays for one’s sin, and then one pays again, and all one’s life one pays.
You must never know that.—As for me, if suffering be an expiation, then at this moment I have expiated all my faults, whatever they have been; for to-night you have made a heart in one who had it not, made it and broken it.—But let that pass.
I may have wrecked my own life, but I will not let you wreck yours.
You—why, you are a mere girl, you would be lost.
You haven’t got the kind of brains that enables a woman to get back.
You have neither the wit nor the courage.
Go back, Lady Windermere, to the husband who loves you, whom you love.
You have a child, Lady Windermere.
Go back to that child who even now, in pain or in joy, may be calling to you.
God gave you that child.
He will require from you that you make his life fine, that you watch over him.
What answer will you make to God if his life is ruined through you?
Back to your house, Lady Windermere—your husband loves you!
He has never swerved for a moment from the love he bears you.
But even if he had a thousand loves, you must stay with your child.
If he was harsh to you, you must stay with your child.
If he ill-treated you, you must stay with your child.
If he abandoned you, your place is with your child.
[LADY WINDERMERE _bursts into tears and buries her face in her hands_.]
[_Holding out her hands to her_, _helplessly_, _as a child might do_.]
[_Is about to embrace her_.
_There is a look of wonderful joy in her face_.]
[_They go to the door_.]
that is my husband’s voice!
You have sent for him.
I’m here to save you, if I can.
But I fear it is too late!
[_Points to the curtain across the window_.]
The first chance you have, slip out, if you ever get a chance!
[LADY WINDERMERE _hides herself behind the curtain_.]
Nonsense, dear Windermere, you must not leave me!
Then it is I who am lost!
[_Hesitates for a moment_, then _looks round and sees door R._, _and exits through it_.]
What a nuisance their turning us out of the club at this hour!
The lively part of the evening is only just beginning.
[_Yawns and closes his eyes_.]
It is very good of you, Lord Darlington, allowing Augustus to force our company on you, but I’m afraid I can’t stay long.
You’ll take a cigar, won’t you?
My dear boy, you must not dream of going.
I have a great deal to talk to you about, of demmed importance, too.
[_Sits down with him at L.
We all know what that is!
Tuppy can’t talk about anything but Mrs. Erlynne.
Well, that is no business of yours, is it, Cecil?
That is why it interests me.
My own business always bores me to death.
Have something to drink, you fellows.
Cecil, you’ll have a whisky and soda?
[_Goes to table with_ LORD DARLINGTON.]
Mrs. Erlynne looked very handsome to-night, didn’t she?
I am not one of her admirers.
I usen’t to be, but I am now.
she actually made me introduce her to poor dear Aunt Caroline.
I believe she is going to lunch there.
And I have to write a few letters.
[_Goes to writing table and sits down_.]
I thought you were asleep.
I am, I usually am!
Knows perfectly well what a demmed fool I am—knows it as well as I do myself.
[CECIL GRAHAM _comes towards him laughing_.]
Ah, you may laugh, my boy, but it is a great thing to come across a woman who thoroughly understands one.
It is an awfully dangerous thing.
They always end by marrying one.
But I thought, Tuppy, you were never going to see her again!
you told me so yesterday evening at the club.
You said you’d heard— [_Whispering to him_.]
[_In a very serious voice_.]
She’s going to explain that to-morrow.
[CECIL GRAHAM _goes back to C.
Our grandmothers threw their caps over the mills, of course, but, by Jove, their granddaughters only throw their caps over mills that can raise the wind for them.
You want to make her out a wicked woman.
That is the only difference between them.
Mrs. Erlynne has a future before her.
Mrs. Erlynne has a past before her.
I prefer women with a past.
They’re always so demmed amusing to talk to.
Well, you’ll have lots of topics of conversation with _her_, Tuppy.
[_Rising and going to him_.]
You’re getting annoying, dear-boy; you’re getting demmed annoying.
[_Puts his hands on his shoulders_.]
Now, Tuppy, you’ve lost your figure and you’ve lost your character.
Don’t lose your temper; you have only got one.
My dear boy, if I wasn’t the most good-natured man in London— CECIL GRAHAM.
We’d treat you with more respect, wouldn’t we, Tuppy?
The youth of the present day are quite monstrous.
They have absolutely no respect for dyed hair.
[LORD AUGUSTUS _looks round angrily_.]
Mrs. Erlynne has a very great respect for dear Tuppy.
Then Mrs. Erlynne sets an admirable example to the rest of her sex.
It is perfectly brutal the way most women nowadays behave to men who are not their husbands.
Dumby, you are ridiculous, and Cecil, you let your tongue run away with you.
You must leave Mrs. Erlynne alone.
You don’t really know anything about her, and you’re always talking scandal against her.
[_Coming towards him L.C._]  My dear Arthur, I never talk scandal.
What is the difference between scandal and gossip?
But scandal is gossip made tedious by morality.
A man who moralises is usually a hypocrite, and a woman who moralises is invariably plain.
There is nothing in the whole world so unbecoming to a woman as a Nonconformist conscience.
And most women know it, I’m glad to say.
Just my sentiments, dear boy, just my sentiments.
Sorry to hear it, Tuppy; whenever people agree with me, I always feel I must be wrong.
My dear boy, when I was your age— CECIL GRAHAM.
But you never were, Tuppy, and you never will be.
[_Goes up C._]  I say, Darlington, let us have some cards.
You’ll play, Arthur, won’t you?
how marriage ruins a man!
It’s as demoralising as cigarettes, and far more expensive.
You’ll play, of course, Tuppy?
[_Pouring himself out a brandy and soda at table_.]
Promised Mrs. Erlynne never to play or drink again.
Now, my dear Tuppy, don’t be led astray into the paths of virtue.
Reformed, you would be perfectly tedious.
That is the worst of women.
They always want one to be good.
And if we are good, when they meet us, they don’t love us at all.
They like to find us quite irretrievably bad, and to leave us quite unattractively good.
[_Rising from R. table_, _where he has been writing letters_.]
They always do find us bad!
I don’t think we are bad.
I think we are all good, except Tuppy.
No, we are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.
We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars?
Upon my word, you are very romantic to-night, Darlington.
You must be in love.
The woman I love is not free, or thinks she isn’t.
[_Glances instinctively at_ LORD WINDERMERE _while he speaks_.]
Well, there’s nothing in the world like the devotion of a married woman.
It’s a thing no married man knows anything about.
She is a good woman.
She is the only good woman I have ever met in my life.
The only good woman you have ever met in your life?
Well, you are a lucky fellow!
Why, I have met hundreds of good women.
I never seem to meet any but good women.
The world is perfectly packed with good women.
To know them is a middle-class education.
This woman has purity and innocence.
She has everything we men have lost.
My dear fellow, what on earth should we men do going about with purity and innocence?
A carefully thought-out buttonhole is much more effective.
She doesn’t really love you then?
I congratulate you, my dear fellow.
In this world there are only two tragedies.
One is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it.
The last is much the worst; the last is a real tragedy!
But I am interested to hear she does not love you.
How long could you love a woman who didn’t love you, Cecil?
A woman who didn’t love me?
But it’s so difficult to meet one.
How can you be so conceited, DUMBY?
I didn’t say it as a matter of conceit.
I said it as a matter of regret.
I have been wildly, madly adored.
I am sorry I have.
It has been an immense nuisance.
I should like to be allowed a little time to myself now and then.
Time to educate yourself, I suppose.
No, time to forget all I have learned.
That is much more important, dear Tuppy.
[LORD AUGUSTUS _moves uneasily in his chair_.]
What cynics you fellows are!
[_Sitting on the back of the sofa_.]
A man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.
And a sentimentalist, my dear Darlington, is a man who sees an absurd value in everything, and doesn’t know the market price of any single thing.
You always amuse me, Cecil.
You talk as if you were a man of experience.
[_Moves up to front off fireplace_.]
You are far too young!
That is a great error.
Experience is a question of instinct about life.
Experience is the name Tuppy gives to his mistakes.
[LORD AUGUSTUS _looks round indignantly_.]
Experience is the name every one gives to their mistakes.
[_Standing with his back to the fireplace_.]
[_Sees_ LADY WINDERMERE’S _fan on sofa_.]
Life would be very dull without them.
Of course you are quite faithful to this woman you are in love with, Darlington, to this good woman?
Cecil, if one really loves a woman, all other women in the world become absolutely meaningless to one.
Love changes one—_I_ am changed.
Tuppy, I want to talk to you.
[LORD AUGUSTUS _takes no notice_.]
It’s no use talking to Tuppy.
You might just as well talk to a brick wall.
But I like talking to a brick wall—it’s the only thing in the world that never contradicts me!
[_Rising and going over CECIL GRAHAM.
Darlington has been moralising and talking about the purity of love, and that sort of thing, and he has got some woman in his rooms all the time.
Yes, here is her fan.
I am really off now, Lord Darlington.
I am sorry you are leaving England so soon.
Pray call on us when you come back!
My wife and I will be charmed to see you!
I am afraid I shall be away for many years.
I want to speak to you for a moment.
It is something very particular.
It will interest you enormously.
It is some of your nonsense, Cecil.
My dear fellow, you mustn’t go yet.
I have a lot to talk to you about.
And Cecil has something to show you.
Darlington has got a woman here in his rooms.
What is my wife’s fan doing here in your rooms?
Don’t hold me, you fool.
She is here after all!
Why is my wife’s fan here?
I’ll search your rooms, and if my wife’s here, I’ll—  [_Moves_.]
You shall not search my rooms.
You have no right to do so.
I’ll not leave your room till I have searched every corner of it!
What moves behind that curtain?
[_Rushes towards the curtain C._] MRS. ERLYNNE.
[_Enters behind R._]  Lord Windermere!
[_Every one starts and turns round_.
LADY WINDERMERE _slips out from behind the curtain and glides from the room L._] MRS. ERLYNNE.
I am afraid I took your wife’s fan in mistake for my own, when I was leaving your house to-night.
LORD WINDERMERE _looks at her in contempt_.
LORD DARLINGTON _in mingled astonishment and anger_.
_The other men smile at each other_.]
SCENE—Same as in Act I.
How can I tell him?
I wonder what happened after I escaped from that horrible room.
Perhaps she told them the true reason of her being there, and the real meaning of that—fatal fan of mine.
Oh, if he knows—how can I look him in the face again?
He would never forgive me.
How securely one thinks one lives—out of reach of temptation, sin, folly.
It rules us, we do not rule it.
Did your ladyship ring for me?
Have you found out at what time Lord Windermere came in last night?
His lordship did not come in till five o’clock.
He knocked at my door this morning, didn’t he?
Yes, my lady—at half-past nine.
I told him your ladyship was not awake yet.
Something about your ladyship’s fan.
I didn’t quite catch what his lordship said.
Has the fan been lost, my lady?
I can’t find it, and Parker says it was not left in any of the rooms.
He has looked in all of them and on the terrace as well.
Tell Parker not to trouble.
She is sure to tell him.
I can fancy a person doing a wonderful act of self-sacrifice, doing it spontaneously, recklessly, nobly—and afterwards finding out that it costs too much.
Why should she hesitate between her ruin and mine?
I would have publicly disgraced her in my own house.
She accepts public disgrace in the house of another to save me.
There is a bitter irony in things, a bitter irony in the way we talk of good and bad women.
and what a pity that in life we only get our lessons when they are of no use to us!
For even if she doesn’t tell, I must.
the shame of it, the shame of it.
To tell it is to live through it all again.
Actions are the first tragedy in life, words are the second.
Words are perhaps the worst.
[_Starts as_ LORD WINDERMERE _enters_.]
[_Sitting on sofa with her_.]
I came in dreadfully late, and didn’t like to wake you.
Yes, I am crying, for I have something to tell you, Arthur.
My dear child, you are not well.
You’ve been doing too much.
Let us go away to the country.
You’ll be all right at Selby.
The season is almost over.
There is no use staying on.
We’ll go away to-day, if you like.
We can easily catch the 3.40.
I’ll send a wire to Fannen.
[_Crosses and sits down at table to write a telegram_.]
Yes; let us go away to-day.
No; I can’t go to-day, Arthur.
There is some one I must see before I leave town—some one who has been kind to me.
[_Rising and leaning over sofa_.]
[_Rises and goes to him_.]
I will tell you, Arthur, but only love me, love me as you used to love me.
You are not thinking of that wretched woman who came here last night?
[_Coming round and sitting R. of her_.]
You don’t still imagine—no, you couldn’t.
I know now I was wrong and foolish.
It was very good of you to receive her last night—but you are never to see her again.
Why do you say that?
Margaret, I thought Mrs. Erlynne was a woman more sinned against than sinning, as the phrase goes.
I thought she wanted to be good, to get back into a place that she had lost by a moment’s folly, to lead again a decent life.
I believed what she told me—I was mistaken in her.
She is bad—as bad as a woman can be.
Arthur, Arthur, don’t talk so bitterly about any woman.
I don’t think now that people can be divided into the good and the bad as though they were two separate races or creations.
What are called good women may have terrible things in them, mad moods of recklessness, assertion, jealousy, sin.
Bad women, as they are termed, may have in them sorrow, repentance, pity, sacrifice.
And I don’t think Mrs. Erlynne a bad woman—I know she’s not.
My dear child, the woman’s impossible.
No matter what harm she tries to do us, you must never see her again.
But I want to see her.
I want her to come here.
She came here once as _your_ guest.
She must come now as _mine_.
She should never have come here.
It is too late, Arthur, to say that now.
Margaret, if you knew where Mrs. Erlynne went last night, after she left this house, you would not sit in the same room with her.
It was absolutely shameless, the whole thing.
Arthur, I can’t bear it any longer.
Last night— [_Enter_ PARKER _with a tray on which lie_ LADY WINDERMERE’S _fan and a card_.]
Mrs. Erlynne has called to return your ladyship’s fan which she took away by mistake last night.
Mrs. Erlynne has written a message on the card.
Oh, ask Mrs. Erlynne to be kind enough to come up.
Say I shall be very glad to see her.
She wants to see me, Arthur.
[_Takes card and looks at it_.]
Margaret, I _beg_ you not to.
Let me see her first, at any rate.
She’s a very dangerous woman.
She is the most dangerous woman I know.
You don’t realise what you’re doing.
It is right that I should see her.
My child, you may be on the brink of a great sorrow.
Don’t go to meet it.
It is absolutely necessary that I should see her before you do.
Why should it be necessary?
How do you do, Lady Windermere?
Do you know, Lady Windermere, I am so sorry about your fan.
I can’t imagine how I made such a silly mistake.
And as I was driving in your direction, I thought I would take the opportunity of returning your property in person with many apologies for my carelessness, and of bidding you good-bye.
[_Moves towards sofa with_ MRS. ERLYNNE _and sits down beside her_.]
Are you going away, then, Mrs. Erlynne?
Yes; I am going to live abroad again.
The English climate doesn’t suit me.
My—heart is affected here, and that I don’t like.
I prefer living in the south.
London is too full of fogs and—and serious people, Lord Windermere.
Whether the fogs produce the serious people or whether the serious people produce the fogs, I don’t know, but the whole thing rather gets on my nerves, and so I’m leaving this afternoon by the Club Train.
But I wanted so much to come and see you.
But I am afraid I have to go.
Shall I never see you again, Mrs. Erlynne?
Our lives lie too far apart.
But there is a little thing I would like you to do for me.
I want a photograph of you, Lady Windermere—would you give me one?
You don’t know how gratified I should be.
There is one on that table.
I’ll show it to you.
[_Goes across to the table_.]
[_Coming up to_ MRS. ERLYNNE _and speaking in a low voice_.]
It is monstrous your intruding yourself here after your conduct last night.
My dear Windermere, manners before morals!
I’m afraid it is very flattering—I am not so pretty as that.
But haven’t you got one of yourself with your little boy?
Would you prefer one of those?
I’ll go and get it for you, if you’ll excuse me for a moment.
So sorry, Lady Windermere, to give you so much trouble.
[_Moves to door R._]  No trouble at all, Mrs. Erlynne.
[_Exit_ LADY WINDERMERE _R._]  You seem rather out of temper this morning, Windermere.
Margaret and I get on charmingly together.
I can’t bear to see you with her.
Besides, you have not told me the truth, Mrs. Erlynne.
I have not told _her_ the truth, you mean.
[_Standing C._]  I sometimes wish you had.
I should have been spared then the misery, the anxiety, the annoyance of the last six months.
But rather than my wife should know—that the mother whom she was taught to consider as dead, the mother whom she has mourned as dead, is living—a divorced woman, going about under an assumed name, a bad woman preying upon life, as I know you now to be—rather than that, I was ready to supply you with money to pay bill after bill, extravagance after extravagance, to risk what occurred yesterday, the first quarrel I have ever had with my wife.
You don’t understand what that means to me.
But I tell you that the only bitter words that ever came from those sweet lips of hers were on your account, and I hate to see you next her.
You sully the innocence that is in her.
[_Moves L.C._]  And then I used to think that with all your faults you were frank and honest.
Why do you say that?
You made me get you an invitation to my wife’s ball.
You came, and within an hour of your leaving the house you are found in a man’s rooms—you are disgraced before every one.
[_Goes up stage C._] LORD WINDERMERE.
Therefore I have a right to look upon you as what you are—a worthless, vicious woman.
I have the right to tell you never to enter this house, never to attempt to come near my wife— MRS. ERLYNNE.
You have no right to claim her as your daughter.
You left her, abandoned her when she was but a child in the cradle, abandoned her for your lover, who abandoned you in turn.
Do you count that to his credit, Lord Windermere—or to mine?
To his, now that I know you.
Take care—you had better be careful.
Oh, I am not going to mince words for you.
For twenty years of your life you lived without your child, without a thought of your child.
One day you read in the papers that she had married a rich man.
You saw your hideous chance.
You knew that to spare her the ignominy of learning that a woman like you was her mother, I would endure anything.
Don’t use ugly words, Windermere.
I saw my chance, it is true, and took it.
Yes, you took it—and spoiled it all last night by being found out.
You are quite right, I spoiled it all last night.
And as for your blunder in taking my wife’s fan from here and then leaving it about in Darlington’s rooms, it is unpardonable.
I can’t bear the sight of it now.
I shall never let my wife use it again.
The thing is soiled for me.
You should have kept it and not brought it back.
I think I shall keep it.
I shall ask Margaret to give it to me.
I hope my wife will give it you.
Oh, I’m sure she will have no objection.
I wish that at the same time she would give you a miniature she kisses every night before she prays—It’s the miniature of a young innocent-looking girl with beautiful _dark_ hair.
How long ago that seems!
[_Goes to sofa and sits down_.]
It was done before I was married.
Dark hair and an innocent expression were the fashion then, Windermere!
What do you mean by coming here this morning?
[_With a note of irony in her voice_.]
To bid good-bye to my dear daughter, of course.
[LORD WINDERMERE _bites his under lip in anger_.
MRS. ERLYNNE _looks at him_, _and her voice and manner become serious_.
_In her accents at she talks there is a note of deep tragedy_.
_For a moment she reveals herself_.]
Oh, don’t imagine I am going to have a pathetic scene with her, weep on her neck and tell her who I am, and all that kind of thing.
I have no ambition to play the part of a mother.
Only once in my life have I known a mother’s feelings.
They were terrible—they made me suffer—they made me suffer too much.
For twenty years, as you say, I have lived childless,—I want to live childless still.
[_Hiding her feelings with a trivial laugh_.]
Besides, my dear Windermere, how on earth could I pose as a mother with a grown-up daughter?
Margaret is twenty-one, and I have never admitted that I am more than twenty-nine, or thirty at the most.
Twenty-nine when there are pink shades, thirty when there are not.
So you see what difficulties it would involve.
No, as far as I am concerned, let your wife cherish the memory of this dead, stainless mother.
Why should I interfere with her illusions?
I find it hard enough to keep my own.
I lost one illusion last night.
I thought I had no heart.
I find I have, and a heart doesn’t suit me, Windermere.
Somehow it doesn’t go with modern dress.
It makes one look old.
[_Takes up hand-mirror from table and looks into it_.]
And it spoils one’s career at critical moments.
You fill me with horror—with absolute horror.
I suppose, Windermere, you would like me to retire into a convent, or become a hospital nurse, or something of that kind, as people do in silly modern novels.
That is stupid of you, Arthur; in real life we don’t do such things—not as long as we have any good looks left, at any rate.
No—what consoles one nowadays is not repentance, but pleasure.
Repentance is quite out of date.
And besides, if a woman really repents, she has to go to a bad dressmaker, otherwise no one believes in her.
And nothing in the world would induce me to do that.
No; I am going to pass entirely out of your two lives.
My coming into them has been a mistake—I discovered that last night.
I am sorry now I did not tell my wife the whole thing at once.
I regret my bad actions.
You regret your good ones—that is the difference between us.
I _will_ tell my wife.
It’s better for her to know, and from me.
It will cause her infinite pain—it will humiliate her terribly, but it’s right that she should know.
You propose to tell her?
I am going to tell her.
If you do, I will make my name so infamous that it will mar every moment of her life.
It will ruin her, and make her wretched.
If you dare to tell her, there is no depth of degradation I will not sink to, no pit of shame I will not enter.
You shall not tell her—I forbid you.
If I said to you that I cared for her, perhaps loved her even—you would sneer at me, wouldn’t you?
I should feel it was not true.
A mother’s love means devotion, unselfishness, sacrifice.
What could you know of such things?
What could I know of such things?
Don’t let us talk any more about it—as for telling my daughter who I am, that I do not allow.
It is my secret, it is not yours.
If I make up my mind to tell her, and I think I will, I shall tell her before I leave the house—if not, I shall never tell her.
Then let me beg of you to leave our house at once.
I will make your excuses to Margaret.
[_Enter_ LADY WINDERMERE _R._  _She goes over to_ MRS. ERLYNNE _with the photograph in her hand_.
LORD WINDERMERE _moves to back of sofa_, _and anxiously watches_ MRS. ERLYNNE _as the scene progresses_.]
I am so sorry, Mrs. Erlynne, to have kept you waiting.
I couldn’t find the photograph anywhere.
At last I discovered it in my husband’s dressing-room—he had stolen it.
[_Takes the photograph from her and looks at it_.]
I am not surprised—it is charming.
[_Goes over to sofa with_ LADY WINDERMERE, _and sits down beside her_.
_Looks again at the photograph_.]
And so that is your little boy!
Gerard, after my dear father.
If it had been a girl, I would have called it after my mother.
My mother had the same name as myself, Margaret.
My name is Margaret too.
You are devoted to your mother’s memory, Lady Windermere, your husband tells me.
We all have ideals in life.
At least we all should have.
They wound, but they’re better.
If I lost my ideals, I should lose everything.
Did your father often speak to you of your mother?
No, it gave him too much pain.
He told me how my mother had died a few months after I was born.
His eyes filled with tears as he spoke.
Then he begged me never to mention her name to him again.
It made him suffer even to hear it.
My father—my father really died of a broken heart.
His was the most ruined life know.
I am afraid I must go now, Lady Windermere.
I think I had better.
My carriage must have come back by this time.
I sent it to Lady Jedburgh’s with a note.
Arthur, would you mind seeing if Mrs. Erlynne’s carriage has come back?
Pray don’t trouble, Lord Windermere.
Yes, Arthur, do go, please.
[LORD WINDERMERE _hesitated for a moment and looks at_ MRS. ERLYNNE.
What am I to say to you?
You saved me last night?
I must speak of it.
I can’t let you think that I am going to accept this sacrifice.
I am going to tell my husband everything.
It is not your duty—at least you have duties to others besides him.
You say you owe me something?
Then pay your debt by silence.
That is the only way in which it can be paid.
Don’t spoil the one good thing I have done in my life by telling it to any one.
Promise me that what passed last night will remain a secret between us.
You must not bring misery into your husband’s life.
You must not spoil it.
how easily love is killed.
Pledge me your word, Lady Windermere, that you will never tell him.
It is your will, not mine.
Yes, it is my will.
And never forget your child—I like to think of you as a mother.
I like you to think of yourself as one.
Only once in my life I have forgotten my own mother—that was last night.
Oh, if I had remembered her I should not have been so foolish, so wicked.
Hush, last night is quite over.
Your carriage has not come back yet, Mrs. Erlynne.
There is nothing in the world so respectable as a good Shrewsbury and Talbot.
And now, dear Lady Windermere, I am afraid it is really good-bye.
[_Moves up C._] Oh, I remember.
You’ll think me absurd, but do you know I’ve taken a great fancy to this fan that I was silly enough to run away with last night from your ball.
Now, I wonder would you give it to me?
Lord Windermere says you may.
I know it is his present.
Oh, certainly, if it will give you any pleasure.
But it has my name on it.
It has ‘Margaret’ on it.
But we have the same Christian name.
Of course, do have it.
What a wonderful chance our names being the same!
Thanks—it will always remind me of you.
Mrs. Erlynne’s carriage has come.
How do you do, Lord Augustus?
Are you quite well this morning?
Quite well, thank you, Mrs. Erlynne.
You don’t look at all well, Lord Augustus.
You stop up too late—it is so bad for you.
You really should take more care of yourself.
[_Goes towards door with a bow to_ LORD AUGUSTUS.
_Suddenly smiles and looks back at him_.]
Won’t you see me to my carriage?
You might carry the fan.
No; I want Lord Augustus.
I have a special message for the dear Duchess.
Won’t you carry the fan, Lord Augustus?
If you really desire it, Mrs. Erlynne.
You’ll carry it so gracefully.
You would carry off anything gracefully, dear Lord Augustus.
[_When she reaches the door she looks back for a moment at_ LADY WINDERMERE.
_Then she turns_, _and exit C. followed LADY WINDERMERE.
You will never speak against Mrs. Erlynne again, Arthur, will you?
She is better than one thought her.
She is better than I am.
[_Smiling as he strokes her hair_.]
Child, you and she belong to different worlds.
Into your world evil has never entered.
There is the same world for all of us, and good and evil, sin and innocence, go through it hand in hand.
To shut one’s eyes to half of life that one may live securely is as though one blinded oneself that one might walk with more safety in a land of pit and precipice.
Darling, why do you say that?
Because I, who had shut my eyes to life, came to the brink.
And one who had separated us— LORD WINDERMERE.
We never must be again.
O Arthur, don’t love me less, and I will trust you more.
I will trust you absolutely.
Let us go to Selby.
In the Rose Garden at Selby the roses are white and red.
Arthur, she has explained everything!
[LADY WINDERMERE _looks horribly frightened at this_.
LORD AUGUSTUS _takes_ WINDERMERE _by the arm and brings him to front of stage_.
_He talks rapidly and in a low voice_.
LADY WINDERMERE _stands watching them in terror_.]
My dear fellow, she has explained every demmed thing.
We all wronged her immensely.
It was entirely for my sake she went to Darlington’s rooms.
Called first at the Club—fact is, wanted to put me out of suspense—and being told I had gone on—followed—naturally frightened when she heard a lot of us coming in—retired to another room—I assure you, most gratifying to me, the whole thing.
We all behaved brutally to her.
She is just the woman for me.
Suits me down to the ground.
All the conditions she makes are that we live entirely out of England.
A very good thing too.
Demmed clubs, demmed climate, demmed cooks, demmed everything.
[_Advancing towards her with a low bow_.]
Yes, Lady Windermere—  Mrs. Erlynne has done me the honour of accepting my hand.
Well, you are certainly marrying a very clever woman!
Ah, you’re marrying a very good woman!
