0	With such blood as he has in his veins, how could his record be clean?
0	I cannot at the present moment recall what the General's Christian name was.
0	And to spare you any possible disappointment, Mr. Worthing, I think it only fair to tell you quite frankly before-hand that I am fully determined to accept you.

0	The curved brow of Apollo was like the sun's disc crescent over a hill at dawn, and his feet were as the wings of the morning, but he himself had been cruel to Marsyas and had made Niobe childless.
0	Surely they are realists, both of them?
0	I think it is most ill-natured of her.
0	You remind me of a story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed, or some unjust law altered--I forget exactly what it was.
0	The flameless tapers stand where we had left them, and beside them lies the half-cut book that we had been studying, or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball, or the letter that we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often.

0	don’t talk like that of Mrs. Erlynne, you don’t know how unjust it is!
0	Her face is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she is a seamstress.
0	And when they had ended their task, the merchants set forth their strange wares, the waxed linen from Egypt and the painted linen from the country of the Ethiops, the purple sponges from Tyre and the blue hangings from Sidon, the cups of cold amber and the fine vessels of glass and the curious vessels of burnt clay.
0	They spoil every romance by trying to make it last for ever.
0	The first time I left the box to be arrested, the second time to be led back to the house of detention, the third time to pass into a prison for two years.
0	Nor did he give up his habit of poisoning, and there are two cases on record in which he tried to make away with people who had offended him.
0	Is that the husband, Lord Darlington?
0	His personality can be untroubled.
0	I would be happy at this moment.
0	She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and gentle.

0	"I don't feel up to the journey."
0	Indeed, it was of this that he was thinking to-night, as he lay back on his luxurious couch, watching the great pinewood log that was burning itself out on the open hearth.
0	Mr. Worthing, after careful consideration I have decided entirely to overlook my nephew's conduct to you.
0	[_Coming up to_ LORD WINDERMERE.]
0	Hush, last night is quite over.
0	said Dorian Gray languidly as he passed up the steps and opened the door with his latch-key.
0	The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life.
0	I love him because he is like what love himself should be.
0	"Why do you ask me?
0	[_Hands letter to_ LADY LADY CAROLINE.
0	Yes, Lady Hunstanton; a perfect martyr.
0	"But I seem to have lost the passion and forgotten the desire.
0	"Harry," cried Dorian Gray, coming over and sitting down beside him, "why is it that I cannot feel this tragedy as much as I want to?
0	Erlynne was once honoured, loved, respected.
0	Yes, but are you good enough for it?
0	I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful.
0	And how strange it was that, instead of having been forced to reveal his own secret, he had succeeded, almost by chance, in wresting a secret from his friend!
0	It is my secret, it is not yours.
0	I think they are dead.
0	But it is almost incredible to me how a man whose life is marred and made hideous by such laws can possibly acquiesce in their continuance.
0	A coarse candle, stuck in a bottle, sputtered beside it.
0	Why, the whole world is nothing to me compared with her."
0	Yes, perhaps Basil, too, had his secret.
0	[_When she reaches the door she looks back for a moment at_ LADY WINDERMERE.
0	It is natural that they should have different views.
0	He heard one of them whisper to the other, "That is Dorian Gray."
0	How curious it all seemed!
0	Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had killed your wife."
0	For, though they can hardly be called blemishes, they are certainly not the great beauties of his work; or, at least, if they are, their anachronistic charm cannot be emphasised unless the play is accurately mounted according to its proper date.
0	"My dear boy, no woman is a genius.
0	A fresh mode of Beauty is absolutely distasteful to them, and whenever it appears they get so angry, and bewildered that they always use two stupid expressions—one is that the work of art is grossly unintelligible; the other, that the work of art is grossly immoral.
0	I am so sorry, Basil, but there is only room for two in the brougham.
0	And are you going to any of our country houses before you leave England, Mrs. Cheveley?
0	In a few moments the cloth began to move, and as the pipe grew shriller and shriller two green and gold snakes put out their strange wedge-shaped heads and rose slowly up, swaying to and fro with the music as a plant sways in the water.
0	You mustn’t believe everything that was said, you know, dear.
0	The very sharpness of the contrast used to quicken his sense of pleasure.
0	If you had come in yesterday at a particular moment--about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to six--you would have found me in tears.
0	England is the home of lost ideas.
0	To stake all one’s life on a single moment, to risk everything on one throw, whether the stake be power or pleasure, I care not—there is no weakness in that.
0	But when they beheld him coming, they mocked him and said, ‘Why, thou art as foul as the toad, and as loathsome as the adder.
0	Margaret, if you knew where Mrs. Erlynne went last night, after she left this house, you would not sit in the same room with her.
0	What do you mean by coming here this morning?
0	Yes, that is my theory.
0	I remember talking once on this subject to one of the most beautiful personalities I have ever known: a woman, whose sympathy and noble kindness to me, both before and since the tragedy of my imprisonment, have been beyond power and description; one who has really assisted me, though she does not know it, to bear the burden of my troubles more than any one else in the whole world has, and all through the mere fact of her existence, through her being what she is--partly an ideal and partly an influence: a suggestion of what one might become as well as a real help towards becoming it; a soul that renders the common air sweet, and makes what is spiritual seem as simple and natural as sunlight or the sea: one for whom beauty and sorrow walk hand in hand, and have the same message.

0	“‘Little Hans, Doctor.’ “’What do you want, little Hans?’ “‘The Miller’s son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself, and the Miller wants you to come at once.’ “‘All right!’ said the Doctor; and he ordered his horse, and his big boots, and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in the direction of the Miller’s house, little Hans trudging behind him.

0	As a rule, the hero is smothered in _bric-à-brac_ and palm-trees, lost in the gilded abyss of Louis Quatorze furniture, or reduced to a mere midge in the midst of marqueterie; whereas the background should always be kept as a background, and colour subordinated to effect.
0	Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sure swift penalty along with it.
0	You can never tell, Princess.
0	It has nothing to do with me."
0	As for the particular locality in which the hand-bag was found, a cloak-room at a railway station might serve to conceal a social indiscretion--has probably, indeed, been used for that purpose before now--but it could hardly be regarded as an assured basis for a recognised position in good society.
0	They have moments of physical courage of which we women know absolutely nothing.
0	"Yes," answered Hallward gravely, and with deep-toned sorrow in his voice, "to see your soul.
0	You have got to leave .
0	How charming you are, dear Lord Illingworth.
0	He paused for a moment, and a wild feeling of pity came over him.
0	Just before you came I almost fainted with terror.
0	Am I to understand then that there are to be no christenings at all this afternoon?
0	That it was necessary, vitally necessary?
0	MRS. ARBUTHNOT _sees him in the glass and starts_, _but does not turn round_.
0	"If a man treats life artistically, his brain is his heart," he answered, sinking into an arm-chair.
0	He knew the precise psychological moment when to say nothing.
0	And, harsh though it may sound, I cannot help saying that such people deserve their doom.
0	She shook her head at him.
0	If they know nothing of death, it is because they know little of life, for the secrets of life and death belong to those, and those only, whom the sequence of time affects, and who possess not merely the present but the future, and can rise or fall from a past of glory or of shame.
0	I should fancy she came to grief if she tried to get Robert into her toils.
0	Who are Miss Worsley’s parents?
0	Some one has been listening to every secret of my life.
0	You are nothing of the kind, sir.
0	The fact is, that the public have an insatiable curiosity to know everything, except what is worth knowing.
0	They wrote so much about it that nobody believed them, and I am not surprised.
0	I am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now the spring has come, and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing well.’ “‘We often talked of you during the winter, Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘and wondered how you were getting on.’ “‘That was kind of you,’ said Hans; ‘I was half afraid you had forgotten me.’ “‘Hans, I am surprised at you,’ said the Miller; ‘friendship never forgets.
0	"I believe you would, Basil.
0	This evening she is merely a commonplace mediocre actress."
0	I am afraid of no man.
0	I feel a passion awakening within me that I never felt before.
0	If you dare to tell her, there is no depth of degradation I will not sink to, no pit of shame I will not enter.
0	It is rather heavy, so I thought I would ask you to lend me a couple of your men."
0	You may want a friend some day.

0	You have never been married, Lord Illingworth, have you?
0	I refuse to marry Lord Illingworth.
0	I prefer living in the south.
0	Back to your house, Lady Windermere—your husband loves you!
0	There is nothing more to be said on the subject.
0	The guards looked down from the battlements and asked us our business.
0	He hasn't changed much since then.
0	But he thought of the pretty Infanta, and took courage.
0	Mysticism, with its marvellous power of making common things strange to us, and the subtle antinomianism that always seems to accompany it, moved him for a season; and for a season he inclined to the materialistic doctrines of the _Darwinismus_ movement in Germany, and found a curious pleasure in tracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the brain, or some white nerve in the body, delighting in the conception of the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions, morbid or healthy, normal or diseased.
0	If you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my life.
0	Yes, he has a sombre look.
0	The house was absolutely quiet.
0	Last night— [_Enter_ PARKER _with a tray on which lie_ LADY WINDERMERE’S _fan and a card_.]
0	The report shall be withdrawn.
0	There is nothing sane about the worship of beauty.
0	For Art, as Plato saw, and not without regret, creates in listener and spectator a form of divine madness.
0	It is said to be completely efficacious upon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect on the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines.
0	But to be purified and made perfect, this sense requires some form of exquisite environment.
0	But I am bound to state, as you were remarking, Jane, that he is excellent company, and he has one of the best cooks in London, and after a good dinner one can forgive anybody, even one’s own relations.
0	Things of which he had never dreamed were gradually revealed.
0	One thinks of Dante at the bitter feast in Verona, of Tasso in Ferrara’s madman’s cell.
0	It has been John for years.
0	Like     grains of fine gold, his sentences would beat out into whole sheets.
0	The man with whom my wife ran away played Chopin exquisitely.
0	Furthermore, if he died some misfortune might happen to me.
0	He was merely a boy.
0	There are only two left.
0	Columbine and Ladysmock, Marjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil and the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the months went by, one flower taking another flower’s place, so that there were always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.
0	Pray don’t trouble, Lord Windermere.
0	The lyre had vanquished the reed.
0	Perhaps you’ll bring her up to Hunstanton this afternoon, if she is better, Gerald.
0	Dorian hesitated for a moment.
0	Mother, tell me what Lord Illingworth did?
0	I am a little too old now, myself, to trouble about setting a good example, but I always admire people who do.
0	Arthur, tell me what I should do.
0	But I allow no man to raise the dead.
0	He turned away as he spoke and stood looking out at the garden.
0	I am not sure, however, that Jane is right in taking him out of his position.
0	He made three-quarters of a million over the transaction.
0	I would rather be your mother—oh!
0	But surely you would admit that the great poems of the early world, the primitive, anonymous collective poems, were the result of the imagination of races, rather than of the imagination of individuals?
0	Sir John, Caroline has been looking everywhere for you.
0	The honest man is to sit quietly, and know the delightful emotions of wonder, curiosity, and suspense.
0	The ancient world wakes from its sleep, and history moves as a pageant before our eyes, without obliging us to have recourse to a dictionary or an encyclopædia for the perfection of our enjoyment.
0	They swarmed up the crag like ants.
0	You have spoiled the romance of my life.
0	It is only people who pay their bills who want that, Uncle George, and I never pay mine.
0	Ugliness has had its day.
0	Well, this is the last time I shall ever do it.
0	His judgment will surely be the most valuable?
0	He was really very devoted to me and seemed quite sorry when he went away.
0	"Basil, I am tired of standing," cried Dorian Gray suddenly.
0	I don't want you here.
0	I never liked the idea that we knew of Christ's own words only through a translation of a translation.
0	It follows, as a corollary from this, that external Nature also imitates Art.

0	As he turned over the pages, his eye fell on the poem about the hand of Lacenaire, the cold yellow hand "_du supplice encore mal lavee_," with its downy red hairs and its "_doigts de faune_."
0	I don’t think he has ever given me anything since, I am sorry to say.
0	Sometimes the poor are praised for being thrifty.

0	Mr. Worthing, there is some error.
0	Why do you try to persuade our nice Mr. Dorian Gray to give up the East End?
0	She put her hand upon his arm and looked into his eyes.
0	For even if she doesn’t tell, I must.
0	People used to say of me that I was too individualistic.
0	M. Zola, true to the lofty principle that he lays down in one of his pronunciamientos on literature, “L’homme de génie n’a jamais d’esprit,” is determined to show that, if he has not got genius, he can at least be dull.

0	[_C._]  How do you do, again, Lord Windermere?
0	These oval, heavy-lidded eyes seemed to look curiously at him.
0	You made your false idol of me, and I had not the courage to come down, show you my wounds, tell you my weaknesses.

0	And so, my dear Ernest, pictures of this kind will not really fascinate the critic.
0	When one is in love, one always begins by deceiving one's self, and one always ends by deceiving others.
0	And who the true man of culture, if not he who by fine scholarship and fastidious rejection has made instinct self-conscious and intelligent, and can separate the work that has distinction from the work that has it not, and so by contact and comparison makes himself master of the secrets of style and school, and understands their meanings, and listens to their voices, and develops that spirit of disinterested curiosity which is the real root, as it is the real flower, of the intellectual life, and thus attains to intellectual clarity, and, having learned ‘the best that is known and thought in the world,’ lives—it is not fanciful to say so—with those who are the Immortals.
0	But in the works of Herodotus, who, in spite of the shallow and ungenerous attempts of modern sciolists to verify his history, may justly be called the “Father of Lies”; in the published speeches of Cicero and the biographies of Suetonius; in Tacitus at his best; in Pliny’s _Natural History_; in Hanno’s _Periplus_; in all the early chronicles; in the Lives of the Saints; in Froissart and Sir Thomas Malory; in the travels of Marco Polo; in Olaus Magnus, and Aldrovandus, and Conrad Lycosthenes, with his magnificent _Prodigiorum et Ostentorum Chronicon_; in the autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini; in the memoirs of Casanova; in Defoe’s _History of the Plague_; in Boswell’s _Life of Johnson_; in Napoleon’s despatches, and in the works of our own Carlyle, whose _French Revolution_ is one of the most fascinating historical novels ever written, facts are either kept in their proper subordinate position, or else entirely excluded on the general ground of dulness.

0	The vineyard-dresser wreathed his hair with ivy that he might keep off the rays of the sun as he stooped over the young shoots, and for the artist and the athlete, the two types that Greece gave us, they plaited with garlands the leaves of the bitter laurel and of the wild parsley, which else had been of no service to men.

0	He wrote one beautiful book, _The Cloister and the Hearth_, a book as much above _Romola_ as _Romola_ is above _Daniel Deronda_, and wasted the rest of his life in a foolish attempt to be modern, to draw public attention to the state of our convict prisons, and the management of our private lunatic asylums.

0	And the old man touched the door with a ring of graved jasper and it opened, and they went down five steps of brass into a garden filled with black poppies and green jars of burnt clay.
0	Child, you know how anxious your guardian is that you should improve yourself in every way.

0	If property had simply pleasures, we could stand it; but its duties make it unbearable.

0	Both things are equally fatal to his imagination, as indeed they would be fatal to the imagination of anybody, and in a short time he develops a morbid and unhealthy faculty of truth-telling, begins to verify all statements made in his presence, has no hesitation in contradicting people who are much younger than himself, and often ends by writing novels which are so lifelike that no one can possibly believe in their probability.

0	You are not what I thought you were.

0	Yes; you have the courage.
0	Suddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by the fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said to Mrs. Umney, "I am afraid something has been spilt there."

0	Later on had followed the marriage, hastily performed at Burgos, a small town on the frontier between the two countries, and the grand public entry into Madrid with the customary celebration of high mass at the Church of La Atocha, and a more than usually solemn _auto-da-fé_, in which nearly three hundred heretics, amongst whom were many Englishmen, had been delivered over to the secular arm to be burned.

0	There is still something to me almost incredible in the idea of a young Galilean peasant imagining that he could bear on his own shoulders the burden of the entire world; all that had already been done and suffered, and all that was yet to be done and suffered: the sins of Nero, of Caesar Borgia, of Alexander VI., and of him who was Emperor of Rome and Priest of the Sun: the sufferings of those whose names are legion and whose dwelling is among the tombs: oppressed nationalities, factory children, thieves, people in prison, outcasts, those who are dumb under oppression and whose silence is heard only of God; and not merely imagining this but actually achieving it, so that at the present moment all who come in contact with his personality, even though they may neither bow to his altar nor kneel before his priest, in some way find that the ugliness of their sin is taken away and the beauty of their sorrow revealed to them.
0	He is an incomparable novelist.

0	And just as out of the sordid and sentimental amours of the silly wife of a small country doctor in the squalid village of Yonville-l’Abbaye, near Rouen, Gustave Flaubert was able to create a classic, and make a masterpiece of style, so, from subjects of little or of no importance, such as the pictures in this year’s Royal Academy, or in any year’s Royal Academy for that matter, Mr. Lewis Morris’s poems, M.

0	Play me a nocturne, Dorian, and, as you play, tell me, in a low voice, how you have kept your youth.
0	I lived always with Lady Julia, my father’s elder sister, you know.

0	V A few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out riding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting through a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go up by the back staircase so as not to be seen.

0	Upon the other hand, there are a great many people who, having no private property of their own, and being always on the brink of sheer starvation, are compelled to do the work of beasts of burden, to do work that is quite uncongenial to them, and to which they are forced by the peremptory, unreasonable, degrading Tyranny of want.
0	But a chance tone of colour in a room or a morning sky, a particular perfume that you had once loved and that brings subtle memories with it, a line from a forgotten poem that you had come across again, a cadence from a piece of music that you had ceased to play--I tell you, Dorian, that it is on things like these that our lives depend.

0	Travel improves the mind wonderfully, and does away with all one’s prejudices.” “The King’s garden is not the world, you foolish squib,” said a big Roman Candle; “the world is an enormous place, and it would take you three days to see it thoroughly.” “Any place you love is the world to you,” exclaimed a pensive Catherine Wheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life, and prided herself on her broken heart; “but love is not fashionable any more, the poets have killed it.

0	How little he had thought, in those dead days, of all that was in store for him!
0	For Virginia received the coronet, which is the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her boy-lover as soon as he came of age.
0	"Dorian," he said, "my letter--don't be frightened--was to tell you that Sibyl Vane is dead."

0	Of course, she must be all right if _you_ invite her.

0	And so, for a whole year, he sought to accumulate the most exquisite specimens that he could find of textile and embroidered work, getting the dainty Delhi muslins, finely wrought with gold-thread palmates and stitched over with iridescent beetles' wings; the Dacca gauzes, that from their transparency are known in the East as "woven air," and "running water," and "evening dew"; strange figured cloths from Java; elaborate yellow Chinese hangings; books bound in tawny satins or fair blue silks and wrought with _fleurs-de-lis_, birds and images; veils of _lacis_ worked in Hungary point; Sicilian brocades and stiff Spanish velvets; Georgian work, with its gilt coins, and Japanese _Foukousas_, with their green-toned golds and their marvellously plumaged birds.

0	He stands outside his subject, and through its medium produces incomparable and artistic effects.
0	On the contrary, you would probably feel that you were benefiting the human race, or increasing the sum of knowledge in the world, or gratifying intellectual curiosity, or something of that kind.

0	And he laughed, and said to himself, ‘Surely I have caught all the fish that swim, or snared some dull monster that will be a marvel to men, or some thing of horror that the great Queen will desire,’ and putting forth all his strength, he tugged at the coarse ropes till, like lines of blue enamel round a vase of bronze, the long veins rose up on his arms.

0	I see a far more intimate and immediate connection between the true life of Christ and the true life of the artist; and I take a keen pleasure in the reflection that long before sorrow had made my days her own and bound me to her wheel I had written in _The Soul of Man_ that he who would lead a Christ-like life must be entirely and absolutely himself, and had taken as my types not merely the shepherd on the hillside and the prisoner in his cell, but also the painter to whom the world is a pageant and the poet for whom the world is a song.

0	It was a monster, the most grotesque monster he had ever beheld.
0	The things are no longer made.

0	Æsthetics, in fact, are to Ethics in the sphere of conscious civilisation, what, in the sphere of the external world, sexual is to natural selection.

0	"I am very glad you didn't, Harry."
0	A crooked smile, like a Malay crease, writhed across the face of one of the women.
0	You can hardly imagine that I and Lord Bracknell would dream of allowing our only daughter--a girl brought up with the utmost care--to marry into a cloak- room, and form an alliance with a parcel?

0	And, this spirit, which they exercised on questions of religion and science, of ethics and metaphysics, of politics and education, they exercised on questions of art also, and, indeed, of the two supreme and highest arts, they have left us the most flawless system of criticism that the world has ever seen.
0	It has nothing to do with our own will.
0	I have carefully preserved the Court Guides of the period.
0	They have had a serious relapse, I am sorry to say.
0	How horrid of you to smile!
0	“What a lovely bit of glass,” cried the little girl; and she ran home, laughing.
0	The hot tears welled into his eyes; he tore his hand away and, flinging himself on the divan, he buried his face in the cushions, as though he was praying.
0	Even people who had not known me personally, hearing that a new sorrow had broken into my life, wrote to ask that some expression of their condolence should be conveyed to me.
0	Everybody was fascinated by the grave dignity with which they moved through the intricate figures of the dance, and by the elaborate grace of their slow gestures, and stately bows, and when they had finished their performance and doffed their great plumed hats to the Infanta, she acknowledged their reverence with much courtesy, and made a vow that she would send a large wax candle to the shrine of Our Lady of Pilar in return for the pleasure that she had given her.

0	When a great actor plays Shakespeare we have the same experience.
0	I don’t know how it is, dear Lord Illingworth, but everything you have said to-day seems to me excessively immoral.

0	It seemed to him that in exquisite raiment, and to the delicate sound of flutes, the sins of the world were passing in dumb show before him.
0	And it is for this very reason that the criticism which I have quoted is criticism of the highest kind.
0	What had this man's legacy been?
0	I don’t think I should be suitable for the post.

0	I tell you I longed for them, but did not dare to touch them, feeling I had no right.
0	It was the portrait that had done everything.
0	And now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to give me some flowers in return.

0	[_Moves up C._] Oh, I remember.
0	And now what is there before me but public disgrace, ruin, terrible shame, the mockery of the world, a lonely dishonoured life, a lonely dishonoured death, it may be, some day?
0	Sometimes it returns upon its footsteps, and revives some antique form, as happened in the archaistic movement of late Greek Art, and in the pre-Raphaelite movement of our own day.
0	Some day I will show the world what it is; and for that reason the world shall never see my portrait of Dorian Gray."
0	After some time he rose from his seat, and leaning against the carved penthouse of the chimney, looked round at the dimly-lit room.
0	I must analyse it some day.
0	"You know the picture is yours, Dorian.
0	it was really a masterpiece.
0	I thought your frock so charming last night, Miss Chiltern.
0	I have a little reed-pipe, and when I blow on it the mullet come sailing into the bay.
0	But I never really liked it.
0	She is quite right, too.
0	You a married man, Mr. Kettle?
0	What do you think she’d do if I kissed her?
0	"They mean," he said, sadly, "that you must weep with me for my sins, because I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no faith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle, the angel of death will have mercy on me.
0	The secret of remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming.
0	You began your life with fraud!
0	There was evidently no time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space as a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house became quite quiet.
0	Lord Darlington may return at any moment.
0	What wine is that, the wine of God?
0	I suppose so, Mr. Dumby.
0	But here was a visible symbol of the degradation of sin.
0	Humanity will always love Rousseau for having confessed his sins, not to a priest, but to the world, and the couchant nymphs that Cellini wrought in bronze for the castle of King Francis, the green and gold Perseus, even, that in the open Loggia at Florence shows the moon the dead terror that once turned life to stone, have not given it more pleasure than has that autobiography in which the supreme scoundrel of the Renaissance relates the story of his splendour and his shame.
0	Then he looked at Lord Henry.
0	We must return to the voice.
0	I'm in love with Cecily, and that is everything.
0	Look how you have brought him up.
0	He felt that his could not be the hand to take the handkerchief away, and called out to one of the farm-servants to come to him.
0	"Don't run down dyed hair and painted faces.

0	I am sorry to say they have not been on good terms for a long time.
0	Since he has been at the Foreign Office, he has been so much talked of in Vienna.
0	He had solemnly promised to marry her, and she had believed him.
0	"I would sooner come with you; yes, I feel I must come with you.
0	In fact it's perfectly ordinary.
0	London society is full of women of the very highest birth who have, of their own free choice, remained thirty- five for years.
0	How do you do, Lady Windermere?
0	There is some one there.
0	He remembered wandering through dimly lit streets, past gaunt, black-shadowed archways and evil-looking houses.
0	You are too much alone, dear Dr. Chasuble.
0	He felt that he had known them all, those strange terrible figures that had passed across the stage of the world and made sin so marvellous and evil so full of subtlety.
0	He looks as if he had been a sort of sailor; tattooed on both arms, and that kind of thing."
0	I didn’t go to taunt Gertrude at all.
0	Indeed, to put any play of Shakespeare’s on the stage, absolutely as he himself wished it to be done, requires the services of a good property-man, a clever wig-maker, a costumier with a sense of colour and a knowledge of textures, a master of the methods of making-up, a fencing-master, a dancing-master, and an artist to direct personally the whole production.
0	Got my second buttonhole for me, Phipps?
0	I have never read a Blue Book.
0	How alone I am in life!
0	How long do you give me?
0	; Gervase Park, Dorking, Surrey; and the Sporran, Fifeshire, N.B.
0	Why did you tell me there was no draught, sir?
0	But it is such a very difficult pose to keep up.
0	He winced at the mention of his grandfather.
0	Yes, you gave me this fan to-day; it was your birthday present.
0	A man who moralises is usually a hypocrite, and a woman who moralises is invariably plain.
0	You shall not search my rooms.
0	Wherefore should I not be happy?
0	Now I am advised by others to try on my release to forget that I have ever been in a prison at all.
0	_Takes it up and lays it down again with a shudder of fear_.]
0	“I am come to bid you good-bye,” he cried.
0	I am so sorry, mother.
0	In literature, again, like Lord Beaconsfield on a famous occasion, he was ‘on the side of the angels.’  He was one of the first to admire Keats and Shelley—‘the tremulously-sensitive and poetical Shelley,’ as he calls him.
0	Laelaps lies beneath, and shows by his panting the rapid pace of     death.
0	Even my father had a comparatively cold reception.
0	I ended in horrible disgrace.
0	"Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will.
0	Now I can finish my play,” and he looked quite happy.
0	To the agent of an insurance company who was visiting him one afternoon, and thought he would improve the occasion by pointing out that, after all, crime was a bad speculation, he replied: ‘Sir, you City men enter on your speculations, and take the chances of them.
0	It is the one thing that could make our own age great also; for the real weakness of England lies, not in incomplete armaments or unfortified coasts, not in the poverty that creeps through sunless lanes, or the drunkenness that brawls in loathsome courts, but simply in the fact that her ideals are emotional and not intellectual.
0	Well, I shall send a cipher telegram to the Embassy at Vienna, to inquire if there is anything known against her.
0	Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give!
0	I was too weak once.
0	Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask what lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful.
0	I assure you, my dear, that on several occasions after I was first married, I had to pretend to be very ill, and was obliged to drink the most unpleasant mineral waters, merely to get Berwick out of town.
0	I must not be alone."
0	So he hastened towards it, and stooping down placed his hands upon it, and it was a cloak of golden tissue, curiously wrought with stars, and wrapped in many folds.
0	Don’t use ugly words, Windermere.
0	what an antinomian you are!
0	The success of the Canal depends, of course, on the attitude of England, and I am going to lay the report of the Commissioners before the House to-morrow night.
0	He may be a great poet, or a great man of science; or a young student at a University, or one who watches sheep upon a moor; or a maker of dramas, like Shakespeare, or a thinker about God, like Spinoza; or a child who plays in a garden, or a fisherman who throws his net into the sea.
0	Who indeed but a Greek could have analysed art so well?
0	"And you know you have been a little silly, Mr. Gray, and that you don't really object to being reminded that you are extremely young."
0	And I don’t think they meet with adequate recognition.
