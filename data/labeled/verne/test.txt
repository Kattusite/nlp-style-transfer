0	In ten minutes we shall have her full of hot air. ” “ Here it is , doctor ! ” The <NAME> was now two-thirds inflated .
0	The next day they left <NAME> 's Bay on the starboard , and two days later , <NAME> and <NAME> ; finally , July 14th , they doubled <NAME> , and the 15th the brig anchored in <NAME> Bay at the end of the channel .
0	Finding <NAME> absorbed in a melancholy silence , <NAME> left her old wooden chair , fixed a taper on the end of a candlestick , lit it , and placed it near a small waxen <NAME> , sheltered in her niche of stone .
0	A fine white ash-dust began to fall , and this increased the terror of Nu-Nu , whose lips trembled over his two rows of black ivory .
0	`` Well , '' said <NAME> , `` we are here , and it is well .
0	“ If I wish it ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
0	Hatteras could not employ this device on an ice-field which perhaps was moving ; on firm land it would have been possible ; and the uncertainty of their route made it doubtful whether they would return by the same path .
0	<NAME> about the hut on wooden dryers , black and disgusting looking pieces of seal 's flesh are exposed to view . ''
0	This voluntary neglect of holy practices , added to the secret habits of his life , had in some sort confirmed the accusations levelled against his labours .
0	The orifice in the plates of the <NAME> was first closed , and fastened down by means of a false key , with which <NAME> had provided himself ; the opening in the boat was also closed .
0	`` When we arrived , it seemed to us to be very low , but on approaching within a quarter of a league we saw by the great fires which were lighted along the harbours and borders of the sea , that it was inhabited , and in taking trouble to find a harbour in which to land and make acquaintance with the country , we sailed more than 150 miles in vain , so that seeing the coast trended ever southwards , we decided to turn back again . ''
0	But there was no longer a _Halbrane_ !
0	And on her part , she seemed to watch over others , and was never easy unless all whom she loved were together in the cottage .
0	It is the coldest we have seen here yet ! ''
0	The conditions are not identical .
0	If I take your deposit it must be in gold -- all gold .
0	Rouse yourself , then , have courage and continue your route .
0	all was explained , everything -- except the presence of the torpedo in the waters of the channel !
0	If I had been sailing for the last two months with bandaged eyes , and without knowing whither the <NAME> was bound , and had been asked during the first few hours at our moorings , `` Are you in the <NAME> or in <NAME> ? ''
0	All climbed down through the rain to the level of the sea .
0	Never before had the <NAME> power in <NAME> been exposed to such danger , and if , as they had hoped , the sepoys had received assistance from without , the influence and supremacy in <NAME> of the <NAME> would have been a thing of the past .
0	It took <NAME> very little time to reach the point of observation , and we all waited below , how impatiently may be imagined .
0	He did not remain on board his boat for eight months , I suppose .
0	“ <NAME> pass <NAME> no longer , sire. ” “ A courier this moment ! ” The officer left the hall and entered a large antechamber adjoining .
0	Let her go ! ” said the young captain , working her to get away from the reefs .
0	<NAME> was the result of my strenuous effort to resist his iron will .
0	The season must have been abnormally advanced , for although we continued to see a vast number of testaceans , we did not catch sight of a single whaling-ship in all this fishing-ground .
0	The feathered tribes of the island were all represented -- tetras , jacamars , pheasants , lories , as well as the chattering cockatoos , parrots , and paroquets .
0	`` 'The interest which I , for my part , take in it has caused me to examine the effect of your announcement upon the members of our society , and I can assure you , to use the consecrated phrase of the <NAME> press , that it has produced a profound impression upon the public .
0	He was seen , several times , to throw himself upon the confectionery and devour the dishes , as if he had just broken a long fast .

0	In the meanwhile , the bad weather came with the month of May , the November of the northern zones .
0	When he snatches a moment of rest I really can not say .
0	He therefore counselled his companions to have their eyes wide open for every thing and at all hours .
0	With such a weapon a marksman would find no difficulty in lodging a bullet in the eye of a chamois at the distance of two thousand paces .
0	He was furnished with introductions to Dr. <NAME> , and a credit of two hundred pounds sterling .
0	The passage of the <NAME> in front of <NAME> having been regarded by <NAME> as impracticable , a strong body of troops crossed , several versts up the river , by means of bridges formed with boats .
0	Like them they are entirely naked , if we except some ornaments of shells which they attach to their arms and legs .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> had , at the entrance made in the hull , discovered tackle , which would serve to hoist up the barrels and chests .
0	And these four men were all that remained of the crew of the <NAME> .
0	He was to return to <NAME> as soon as the weather permitted , but he died in the island without having been able to convey to his land the useful implements , grains , and cattle , which had been given to him by the <NAME> Government .
0	Guided by his father , and impelled by his own inclinations , he had early begun his education , and at an age when most lads are little more than apprentices , he had managed to make himself of some importance , a leader , in fact , among his fellows , and few are very ignorant in a country which does all it can to remove ignorance .
0	We waited silent and motionless to learn the fate of <NAME> , although the evil spirit of the crew was but little worthy of our pity .
0	<NAME> , his two sailors , <NAME> , and <NAME> went off at once into the wood , where the animals had passed the night .

0	`` Your cool , clear head has not yet quite recovered from the shock , my dear <NAME> ; '' replied <NAME> , with a smile .
0	A quarter of an hour later Hans paused to enable us to look back .
0	Nothing could be more dejected than the aspect of that frozen sea ; not a single living creature relieved the solitude ; both the travelers , <NAME> from a scientific point of view , <NAME> from an aesthetic , were alike impressed by the solemnity of the scene , and where the lengthened shadow of the sail cast upon the ice by the oblique rays of the setting sun had disappeared , and day had given place to night , the two men , drawn together as by an involuntary impulse , mutually held each other ’ s hands in silence .

0	`` Perhaps no one looked after this timepiece .
0	The vast stretch of water broadened away from the spot , especially toward the east , and nothing could be seen on the horizon , neither mainland nor islands .
0	<NAME> hurriedly visited some of the islands of the <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
0	Through the panel of the saloon I saw the bottom of the rocks brilliantly lit up by our electric lamp .
0	`` Perhaps sooner than you think , <NAME> . ''
0	It has by some authors truly been called the whale of the saurian race , for it is as big and quick in its motions as our king of the seas .
0	These incidents are , so to speak , supernatural -- ” “ Supernatural ! ” exclaimed the sailor , emitting a volume of smoke from his mouth .
0	Afterwards he sailed along the coast of <NAME> , where he was able to obtain provisions in abundance in exchange for <NAME> knives , hatchets , shirts , hats , and other articles of no great value .
0	<NAME> gave it the name of the `` little sun , '' to show that he understood the explanation .
0	As may be imagined the captain tried to land , but a barrier of ice prevented his doing so .
0	The most obvious inference would therefore be that the earth ’ s distance from the sun had been diminished from 91,000,000 to 66,000,000 miles .
0	A thick dark bar of cloud was rising higher and higher , and by degrees extinguishing the stars .
0	She got farther than any ship had ever done before . ''
0	“ We must wait till to-morrow , ” he repeated ; adding , for he had become distrustful of the future , “ that is to say , if to-morrow ever comes. ” Although not very learned in astronomy , <NAME> was acquainted with the position of the principal constellations .
0	`` In the house in the corral ! ''
0	`` Without doubt , '' replied the little old man , laughing .
0	One fact is worthy of notice ; he was recommended to show the greatest respect towards <NAME> , at the very time when his brother <NAME> was arrested and thrown into a prison , where he was destined to remain forgotten for twenty years .
0	And then , what a view to reward us for our troubles and dangers !
0	They would shave off her hair , feed her on a scanty allowance of rice , treat her with contempt ; she would be looked upon as an unclean creature , and would die in some corner , like a scurvy dog .
0	The barking of a dog came across the steppe .
0	-- '' Insufficient , '' continued <NAME> , laying down the law , `` we shall rest forever motionless on the dead point of the mutually neutralizing attractions . ''
0	`` The point , '' says the traveller , `` from which the <NAME> issues , was now shown to me , and appeared to be at the same level on which I stood , viz. , 1600 feet above the level of the <NAME> ; the source of the <NAME> , which I had already measured , being 1470 feet .
0	The bears , which were extremely numerous at that period of the year , made frequent visits to the crew .
0	There was no reason for stopping for a whole hour ; <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> walked on , though there was nothing to show them what was the exact direction of this unknown tunnel .
0	Our globe , the only object which caught my view in immensity , seemed ready to be annihilated , and above us the depths of the starry skies were lost in thick darkness .
0	He again interrupted the clerk , who , quite unmoved , merely replied : “ It is his right , sir , it is his right -- at ten copecks a word. ” And he telegraphed the following news , just brought him by <NAME> : “ <NAME> fugitives are escaping from the town .
0	The doctor took a stellar observation , and discovered that he was in the latitude of <NAME> .
0	Then the <NAME> led the way into the <NAME> of a deserted <NAME> , where there was a good , blazing fire to warm them , and a substantial meal of fine , juicy slices of venison soon broiling , of which they did not leave a crumb .
0	`` On the contrary , '' said <NAME> , imitating the tone and gestures of the president , `` on the contrary , when the visible face of the moon is lit by the sun , it is because the moon is full , that is to say , opposite the sun with regard to the earth .

0	A wager of twenty thousand pounds lost , because he , like a precious fool , had gone into that abominable pagoda !
0	When he recovered his senses , he found himself in the cabin of a mujik , who had picked him up and cared for him .
0	The three settlers were talking in <NAME> 's room , when they heard <NAME> utter quick barks .
0	`` Very likely ; but as we advance to the bottom of the gulf , you will see this singular appearance .
0	The populace thronged day and night round the gaol of <NAME> .
0	The position of this island was most uncertain .
0	“ No paper , no paper ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
0	However , the leak increased rapidly , although the pumps were worked incessantly .
0	I often looked at the instruments hanging from the partition .
0	During the early morning hours nothing noteworthy took place ; the land grew different in the northeast ; a few elevations , the beginning of a mountainous district , indicated a change .
0	I am <NAME> , a merchant at <NAME> ” And suddenly he left the public room , whilst for the last time the words re-echoed , “ My son !
0	It will never be known what was the exact number of the slain , but it must have been considerable .
0	They were , however , disappointed in their expectations .
0	`` We have no luck , '' said <NAME> to the doctor ; `` to be sure , the country does n't offer much food to animals , but the game here ought not to be over-particular , and ought to show itself . ''
0	<NAME> <NAME> was ordered to keep him company , and made no remonstrance .
0	As to his sailor qualification , he was said to be skillful enough in navigating these seas , whose reefs make them very dangerous .
0	<NAME> , between two enemies , did not know what to advise , whither to fly !
0	The animal gave a terrible cry , but went on faster than ever .
0	The <NAME> was still walking up and down with an agitated step .
0	<NAME> had accepted and promised expressly to be there .
0	On the first morning of the cruise <NAME> , who , like most Russians , spoke <NAME> fluently , was explaining these peculiarities to <NAME> ; the count was present , and the conversation perpetually recurred , as naturally it would , to the phenomena which remained so inexplicable to them all .
0	I dwelt upon the fact that it was not necessary for all twenty-three to embark .
0	You , friend , have already had the honor of being wounded in the service of the <NAME> , whilst I -- I have as yet suffered nothing in my cousin ’ s service .
0	As to supposing she had not arrived at the appointed rendezvous , that was out of the question .
0	`` But , '' asked <NAME> , `` sha ' n't we lose them if we go back without the captain ? ''
0	229 The luxuriant vegetation of the <NAME> .
0	`` <NAME> is as much as to say -- ? ''
0	In fact , they had corn , but not flour , and the establishment of a mill was necessary .
0	The joists grated on all sides .
0	But no explosion properly so termed , could be heard .
0	“ Yes , my <NAME> ; <NAME> ’ s quartermaster. ” “ And saved with him after the shipwreck ? ” “ No , my Lord , no .
0	I know where you are , <NAME> , and I know where to find you .
0	“ That ’ s all very well for children ! ” “ <NAME> ’ t be proud , friend <NAME> , ” replied the reporter .
0	So it went on for two hours ; then his thoughts changed ; he began to think of the Pole , and he saw himself at last setting foot on this English continent , and unfolding the flag of the <NAME> .
0	He soon discovered that the width of the channel by which he entered increased rapidly , and that it ultimately formed a vast lake communicating with the sea to the north-west .
0	This diversion was to be effected both up and down the river , on the <NAME> bank .
0	`` O , you need n't be vain of it !
0	<NAME> ( translation from <NAME> ) .
0	<NAME> tremblings ran along the mountain caused by internal bubblings , deep noise , distinctly transmitted through the liquid medium were echoed with majestic grandeur .
0	<NAME> , the last <NAME> town situated on the shore of the <NAME> of <NAME> , had been honored by a visit from him .
0	However , the <NAME> , in the midst of the tempest , confirmed the words of a clever engineer , `` There is no well-constructed hull that can not defy the sea . ''
0	To them this courier from the <NAME> was a link which connected them with the empire .
0	I tried to make him rise from his seat .
0	The latter , however , was a very slow sailer , which unfortunately kept the two vessels apart for the greater part of the voyage .
0	They put him in irons .
0	None of the fugitives were visible .
0	“ We shall finish it , ” he said to the engineer , “ we shall finish it , captain , and it is time , for the season is advancing and the equinox will soon be here .
0	There was good need of this precaution , for so precipitous was the shore that a vessel driven upon it must inevitably have gone to pieces ; it did not offer a single harbor of refuge , but , smooth and perpendicular as the walls of a fortress , it rose to a height of two hundred , and occasionally of three hundred feet .
0	It is quite possible that one of these animals , surprised by the inundation , might have climbed up into this OMBU , and be hiding now among its thick foliage. ” “ You haven ’ t met any of them , at any rate , I suppose ? ” said the Major .
0	April 28th passed by without any sign of the existence of the enemy .
0	She will perceive that her silence is no longer reasonable .
0	They were aware , also , that the mate was a man whom it would not do to vex , for <NAME> had given them to understand that <NAME> would break any man 's head who did not go straight .
0	With the beginning of the year 1866 the heat was very great , but the hunting in the forests did not stand still .
0	<NAME> ’ s approval was most welcome to the young fellows ; they had great faith in the practical good sense of the pilot , and not without reason .
0	I said , no less amazed and stupefied than himself .
0	`` Yes , an eruption , '' replied <NAME> , who was carefully studying the phenomenon through his night glass .
0	But nothing showed that the banks of the stream had been recently frequented -- nothing announced either the presence or the proximity of the convicts .
0	A few of the aborigines , however , make themselves cloaks of opossum or kangaroo skin , stitching the pieces together with the nerve-fibres of the cassowary ; but this kind of garment is of rare occurrence .
0	<NAME> was chosen , and was much satisfied with the welcome that he received .
0	and 26 degrees and 27 degrees east of the meridian of <NAME> , or between 5 degrees 30 minutes and 6 degrees 3 minutes east of that of <NAME> . ''
0	That the head of <NAME> was a little too small for his body we admit , but that it was filled to the meninges will be believed .
0	He , no doubt , expected that his reply would close the examination , but <NAME> commenced again , and said : “ <NAME> , I am not a <NAME> prosecutor charged with your indictment .
0	Therefore <NAME> resolved to put the corral in instantaneous communication with <NAME> .
0	“ Courage , my brave horse ! ” cried <NAME> .
0	Up till then , no Tartar detachment had been seen , which showed that the raft was not abreast of the outposts .
0	They were puzzled by the reserve of a man generally so talkative ; on this occasion they had to drag the words out of his mouth ; usually he was a ready story-teller , now he gave only evasive answers to the questions of the rest .
0	`` And you shall hear it yourself , counsellor , '' returned <NAME> in a passion , `` for it will come better from my mouth than from yours !
0	The eastern coast of <NAME> advances perpendicularly northward .
0	Would the old hands side with the new-comers ?
0	<NAME> consoled himself by saying that with the help of a mine they could soon open out the cliff when that was necessary , and then , as there was evidently nothing to be done in the gulf , he steered his vessel towards the strait and passed out at about two o'clock in the afternoon .
0	Its nationality to you , at least , will be a secret .
0	At this cry the whole ship 's crew hurried towards the harpooner -- commander , officers , masters , sailors , cabin boys ; even the engineers left their engines , and the stokers their furnaces .
0	`` Indeed , master , '' replied <NAME> , scratching his sharp nose with the end of his forefinger , `` the experiment begins well , and if I had not prudently closed the supply-tap , I know not what would have happened . ''
0	Neither <NAME> nor the young <NAME> girl had any baggage .
0	At length the difficulty of obtaining provisions , the rain , and the continual alarm in which the firing of the <NAME> kept them , induced the islanders to offer terms of peace .
0	No matter what we have been accustomed to , it is sad to bid it farewell forever .
0	<NAME> and his companions , under the guidance of the <NAME> , had some difficulty in reaching the palace , where the king , who in the narrative is called the `` <NAME> , '' was awaiting them with extreme impatience .
0	“ It was still sucking its mother when I found it in the trap. ” “ Well , ” said the engineer , “ that proves that within three months a gun-shot was fired in <NAME> Island. ” “ And that a bullet , ” added <NAME> , “ wounded , though not mortally , this little animal. ” “ That is unquestionable , ” said <NAME> , “ and these are the deductions which must be drawn from this incident : that the island was inhabited before our arrival , or that men have landed here within three months .
0	She appeared ignorant of nearly everything relating to life , and , although evidently intelligent , was wanting in many elementary ideas , such as time , for instance .
0	After due reflection and discussion , <NAME> had nearly decided to follow the coast road to <NAME> , when <NAME> made an unexpected proposition .
0	The old man , wishing to redouble his politeness , tried to give him pieces already chewed , and one can easily imagine that the disgust of our captain increased . ''
0	He only thought of when the <NAME> , free at last , should resume her bold course .
0	When <NAME> 's turn came , he went to relieve <NAME> .
0	How they hurry on , as if they were racing ! ''
0	Notwithstanding his fatalism , and though resigned , he would not believe himself in safety until within the walls of <NAME> .
0	It was a sorrowful commencement for a campaign , a sad presage which was destined not to remain unfulfilled .
0	`` No , <NAME> , '' said the captain , `` no fear of that .
0	Here <NAME> fixed his residence , while <NAME> remained as Governor of <NAME> .
0	I was , I think , occupied in collecting my plants , when I heard a noise like an avalanche falling from a very tall tree .
0	It was the voice of <NAME> , and the person he addressed was <NAME> .
0	The object of their long labours was attained !
0	Obliquely to the oval of the island ran a stream through a wide meadow falling into the sea on the west by a narrow mouth .
0	After this solid conversation every one made himself as comfortable as possible in the cavern , and soon fell asleep .
0	The night was dark , and a fine , steady rain was falling .
0	He was deadly pale ; his eyes stared , and his lips were painfully contracted .
0	Having seen no sign of land in this direction , and a strong southerly wind blowing at the time , <NAME> retraced his course as far as S. lat .
0	I was stretched on the ground , just under the shelter of a bush of algae , when , raising my head , I saw some enormous mass , casting phosphorescent gleams , pass blusteringly by .
0	“ The exploration of the <NAME> and its tributaries was the object of several expeditions , the principal of which I shall mention : Between 1749 and 1758 , <NAME> made a reconnoissance of the river , and visited <NAME> ; from 1785 to 1788 , <NAME> and <NAME> travelled across the deserts of <NAME> , and ascended as far as the country of the <NAME> , who assassinated <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and so many other unfortunate men .
0	<NAME> <NAME> had therefore abandoned the mine with the absolute conviction that it did not contain another bit of coal .
0	Their feet still struck against the wooden sleepers which used to support the rails .
0	<NAME> albatrosses are also met with here , some of them measuring seventeen feet from tip to tip of their wings .
0	The <NAME> , trusting like the Czar in their patriotism , had armed them , and they had thoroughly proved their bravery .
0	Do you still doubt his honesty ? ''
0	He saw that his perplexity was increasing as the way became more difficult , but did not dare to interrogate him , rightly enough , perhaps , thinking that both mules and muleteers were very much governed by instinct , and it was best to trust to them .
0	As the gypsy took two or three steps forward , and was about to interrogate <NAME> more closely , the door of the cottage opened .
0	“ A <NAME> spy , ” answered <NAME> .
0	March 24th was <NAME> Sunday , -- that day when the streets of the towns and villages of <NAME> are filled with flowers and leaves ; bells are ringing , and the air is filled with rich perfumes .
0	One day in the island , three or four to return , they might hope therefore that on the 17th they would again reach <NAME> .
0	Now that the sailors were reduced to idleness , there was nothing to do except to ponder on our critical situation , and invent some means of getting out of it .
0	The rockets had primarily been placed to check the fall of the projectile upon the moon , and now they were going to employ them for a directly contrary purpose .
0	<NAME> bewailed himself , much disappointed at not being able to get into his kitchen , for the provisions which they had had on their expedition were exhausted , and they had no means of renewing them .
0	<NAME> movable desks , made to slide in and out at will , allowed one to rest one 's book while reading .
0	The little band left the cavern and began to ascend through the dark passage .
0	If <NAME> had not sent <NAME> to Lucknow what misfortunes would have been averted , not to speak of the assassination of the sailor !
0	( 1 ) The legendary etymology of this piscatorial designation is <NAME> , the `` door-keeper , '' in allusion to <NAME> , who brought a fish said to be of that species , to our Lord at His command .
0	Meantime , <NAME> reached the king 's residence , at some distance from the river .
0	Consequently , many millions of acres of the island had still escaped their investigations .
0	exclaimed <NAME> ; `` What is the meaning of it , <NAME> ? ''
0	Never had any man , since the first creation of the human race experienced a similar emotion to that now felt by the great navigator .
0	Of the sailors who manned it , three were killed without provocation by the natives , while the others escaped by swimming , and were picked up by the ships ' boats , but by the time they were in readiness to fire upon the assailants , these had disappeared .
0	<NAME> left fifty-six men to guard the <NAME> of <NAME> , under the command of <NAME> de <NAME> , while he returned to <NAME> , towards the beginning of April , being much hindered on the road by excessive rain .
0	“ You will now readily understand , gentlemen , the apparatus that I have described to you is really a gas cylinder and blow-pipe for oxygen and hydrogen , the heat of which exceeds that of a forge fire .
0	The traveller then gained an island at a little distance from the shore , from which he saw several whales gambolling in the water .
0	The lamps , fastened to long ropes , were lowered down the shaft , and it was thus ascertained that the four last ladders were wanting .
0	For a whole hour the two ladies were closeted with the quartermaster , but nothing transpired about their interview .
0	You know how eager is the curiosity of the public with regard to these astronomical questions .
0	That they had gone to the <NAME> or <NAME> regions was extremely unlikely , for those were the very regions they intended to displace .
0	<NAME> highly serious , long-continued discussions , in which no one would give in .
0	After the audience was over the travellers proceeded to look round the village , where they were astonished to find two immense walls made of coral , some blocks of which were of immense size and weight .
0	I am of <NAME> ’ s opinion , that the storm will be superb .
0	Nothing but vast beds of glistering lava , now rough like immense piles of scoriae and clinker , now smooth like crystal mirrors , and reflecting the <NAME> 's rays with the same intolerable glare .
0	Were these waters supplied with fish or not ?
0	<NAME> <NAME> was right ; we were close to a vessel of which the tattered shrouds still hung from their chains .
0	The governor was not well pleased at this news , for he thought that he ought to have had his share in the islands ; but he concealed his displeasure , and gave the new comers a hearty welcome .
0	All the province of Shan-si seemed rich in vines and mulberry-trees ; the principal industry in the towns was the making of armour for the emperor 's use .
0	<NAME> <NAME> went forward and took her hand .
0	When the disappearance of the five men had been ascertained , we fell into despair .
0	At all events , the poor creature was quite quiet and sad !
0	Two sails , a brigantine and a jib , were arranged to catch the wind to the greatest advantage , and the travelers estimated that their progress would be little under the rate of twelve leagues an hour .
0	And was all danger over ?
0	No museum in <NAME> possesses such a collection of the produce of the ocean .
0	A more splendid programme was impossible , and it was clearly traceable to the able mind which had laid down the route taken by <NAME> and D'Entrecasteaux .
0	It appears that he got as far as <NAME> , the capital , where , according to some accounts , he was made prisoner , and , according to others , was put to death for having attempted to ascend a sacred mountain in the environs .
0	But M. Jules Garnier states that a tradition exists of the appearance of two large ships , which had sent boats on shore , near the northern extremity of <NAME> .
0	However , <NAME> ’ s convalescence progressed rapidly .
0	The danger was not only from the wind which battered against the travelers , but from the avalanche of stones and broken trunks which were hurtling through the air .
0	The winter has been mild this year .
0	The Major never opened his mouth , nor <NAME> , whose _amour propre_ , as an <NAME> , seemed quite wounded by having allowed himself to go on a wrong scent .
0	“ No , my <NAME> ; but the passage does not seem dangerous .
0	Involuntarily , one and all , they plowed their heels into the ice and came to a halt .
0	We had hardly gone half a mile on the cliff 's edge when <NAME> again stopped , on perceiving some fragments of bones which were turning to dust , and did not seem to be those of a human being .
0	“ Then don ’ t say a word to anyone , but fasten it up tight in your knapsack. ” <NAME> found the flag , and folded it up as he was directed .
0	It afforded me great amusement to gaze on their variegated ribbon-like endless lengths .
0	<NAME> was therefore in a condition singularly favorable to resolve the great question concerning the <NAME> 's inhabitableness .
0	“ I think so , too , ” returned <NAME> , “ and these arms and tools will make up the stores of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> is my uncle 's determination .
0	His strength visibly returned , so vigorous was his constitution .
0	Notwithstanding the incessant demands on the energies of all made by the arduous and varied tasks involved in reconstruction and refitting of the new vessel , the usual astronomical and physical observations , the natural history researches and the hydrographical surveys , were not neglected .
0	“ No , ” replied <NAME> , without apparently noticing the <NAME> of the quartermaster -- an EMPRESSMENT which , moreover , was reasonable enough under the circumstances .
0	Beyond that the tints darkened into fine gradations of ultramarine , and faded into vague obscurity .
0	I would not have your ruins mingle with those of the Avenger ! ''
0	After the chief men of a warlike and fierce appearance , with faces tattooed all over , had been a few minutes on board , D'Urville was preparing to ask them some questions , with the aid of a vocabulary published by the missionaries , when all at once they turned away from him , leaped into their canoes and pushed out into the open sea .
0	`` The Government is very severe upon that kind of offence .
0	`` Can we see <NAME> ? ''
0	`` But the print of the shoes ? ''
0	The ceremony was over , and the torches alone lighted up the plateau , which a few instants before had been so brilliantly illuminated .
0	`` Is not this precisely the moment then , '' interposed <NAME> , quickly , `` for making an experiment which we could never have made as long as we were in the sunshine ? ''
0	He was a man of energy , till now happy and powerful , and deprived in a moment of power and happiness .
0	The girl was about to follow him , when a blow from a lance struck him , and he was thrown into the water .
0	After a stay in April at the mouth of the <NAME> , the explorers surveyed the Liu-Kiu archipelago , a chain of islands connecting <NAME> with <NAME> , and the Bonin-Sima group , districts in which no animals were seen but big green turtles .
0	In spite of this anti-climax , <NAME> 's companions could hardly consider his utterings either as ridiculous or over enthusiastic .
0	There they managed to arrange for him a couch of sea-weed which still remained almost dry .
0	For four days they advanced in that way , until July 23d , when they reached <NAME> , in <NAME> 's <NAME> .
0	The evil deeds of such men would certainly , in the course of three years have betrayed their existence and lurking-places .
0	They had now only to descend the mountain slopes again , and explore the soil , in the triple point of view , of its mineral , vegetable , and animal resources .
0	If we are really near land , I should be afraid to approach it in the dark. ” The count expressed his approval of the lieutenant ’ s caution , and thereupon all sail was shortened so as to keep the _Dobryna_ from making any considerable progress all through the hours of night .
0	<NAME> thou not but a tool in my hands ? ''
0	At last the brig found a passage and advanced through it slowly ; often a huge floe delayed her for hours ; the fog embarrassed the steersman ; at one moment he could see a mile ahead , and it was easy to avoid all obstacles ; but again the snow-squalls would hide everything from their sight at the distance of a cable 's length .
0	On the 29th October , the <NAME> reached the north-eastern portion of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> immediately took their places in the tarantass .
0	The port is frequented by a great many vessels from the neighboring countries .
0	<NAME> <NAME> declared himself quite equal to the undertaking .
0	This beneficent spring after having saved us from thirst during so many days would now enable me to regain the right road .
0	O Barbican , how you must blush for us !
0	“ I shall soon have the pleasure of presenting them with these bracelets as a <NAME> Year ’ s gift. ” “ Then you suspect -- ” “ Some folks who came out free in Her Majesty ’ s ships. ” “ What !
0	I should have liked to help you to escape , but it was so difficult to avoid the vigilance of my grandfather .
0	“ They are to cross at <NAME> , and so will we. ” “ But about <NAME> ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	At first the relations between the foreigners and the natives were excellent , but a change was suddenly perceived , the savages ceasing to barter , and making some hostile demonstrations , which left no doubt of the bad intentions entertained by them .
0	At this moment nothing is clear to me ; I catch but a glimpse of light amidst all the darkness , and I must confine myself to writing as events shall dictate .
0	I think , then , that we ought to adopt a material excellent in its way and of low price , such as cast iron .
0	He is a true man , worthy of your entire confidence. ” <NAME> was on the point of replying that he had never doubted his good faith , when the man came in and brought his engagement written out in due form .
0	Things were in this feverish state on the evening of the 14th , when , all at once , <NAME> 's dispatch arrived in <NAME> .
0	The front and hinder part were connected by means of a rude mechanical contrivance , which did not allow of the vehicle turning quickly .
0	Besides , the one killed by <NAME> , and whose body was found outside the enclosure , of course belonged to <NAME> 's crew .
0	These pirates are regular jaguars , and it seems to me we ought not to hesitate to treat them as such !
0	His friends at <NAME> had tried to dissuade him from the journey , by picturing the difficulties and danger of a route frequented by <NAME> ; but nothing could stay him .
0	The voice which had pronounced the words , “ Well repaid ! ” was that of no other than <NAME> .
0	Nearly all oblong or circular , and as if traced with the compass , they seem to form one vast archipelago , equal to that charming group lying between <NAME> and <NAME> , and which mythology in ancient times adorned with most graceful legends .
0	First of all he made a thorough survey of <NAME> , their present fortress ; not for the purpose of defence , but of escape .
0	Before daybreak the troops of Feofar-Khan had retreated into their camp , leaving a large number of dead on and below the ramparts .
0	In <NAME> , on the contrary , we find roughness , and a harsh , unsympathizing way of feeling , while his chivalrous qualities disappear entirely behind the rapacity and perfidy which are the salient features of his character .
0	“ A pound of coffee , old <NAME> ?
0	To effect that object it will be enough to establish a telescope on some elevated mountain .
0	`` Do you know <NAME> ? ''
0	He dared no longer think ; he would no longer reflect !
0	<NAME> o'clock was striking ; <NAME> was an hour in advance of time .
0	He seemed to be torn by a supreme convulsion .
0	The latter had recovered his presence of mind .
0	They found it still so swollen by the heavy rain that the water was a foot above the level .
0	It adjoined an old stone hostelry , previously occupied by a detachment of engineers , and which now afforded shelter for <NAME> and the two horses .
0	Scarcely was anchor cast in the <NAME> river before a great number of native vessels came to examine the frigate , offering for sale vegetables , fish , oranges , and a multitude of trifles , once so rare , now so common , but always costly .
0	His big , strong hand grasped the side , and at the risk of causing the boat to capsize , he hoisted himself up to the side , stepped over it , and sat down to draw his breath .
0	Still , no one of these men raised a single objection , nor suggested prudence .
0	The air grew colder , and , July 19th , fell as low as 26° ; the next day was warmer , but this harbinger of the arctic winter warned <NAME> not to linger longer .
0	They reached <NAME> , and then the <NAME> River where they embarked on the <NAME> , at which port <NAME> , then commanding the station , got them a passage on board a transport-ship .
0	These ladies , I suppose , have never seen it .
0	`` What are we looking at , at this moment ? ''
0	The ship sadly swayed into port , and an icy silence reigned on its deck .
0	<NAME> , doubtless by the advice of <NAME> , captured the town of <NAME> la Hacha ; after which he reached <NAME> d'Ulloa , having encountered a fearful storm .
0	`` Would you not , in that case , <NAME> , attempt the adventure ? ''
0	But was such an operation possible ?
0	Shall we try to catch it ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	As for the <NAME> , which are comprised in this number , they were inhabited by a warlike race , very superior in intelligence to those of the <NAME> .
0	<NAME> left the mountains inhabited by the Circassians to the south , and after a wearisome journey of two months arrived at the camp of <NAME> <NAME> on the banks of the <NAME> .
0	The time approached for the return of the monsoon , and its accompanying storms must be avoided on this coast ; above all , we must procure a boat to enable us to rejoin the _Naturaliste_ . ''
0	The <NAME> was newly built , and had been making a trial trip a few miles outside the <NAME> of <NAME> .
0	After a night 's rest , it was renewed the day following , the 31st , with some vigor , and a good part of the ocean lying between <NAME> and <NAME> islands was carefully investigated to a depth of seven or eight hundred feet .
0	said <NAME> , `` I am really sorry that we did not start when the earth was full , that is to say , when our globe was in opposition to the sun . ''
0	The sun 's bright rays glanced through the trees .
0	It was therefore probable that the cetacean would not be able to extricate itself easily ; at any rate it was best to hasten , so as to cut off its retreat if necessary .
0	<NAME> , placed in the apex of the pyramid , would remind you of those marvellous suspensions in the air performed by <NAME> , <NAME> , and a few other first class wizards .
0	For myself , I began to feel the most fearful and devouring hunger .
0	“ Well , his crime did not do him much good , for suspicion soon pointed toward him .
0	<NAME> <NAME> received them with many expressions of pleasure and kindness , showing special delight at seeing <NAME> again .
0	`` Any one else would have found it open , '' cried <NAME> ; `` that <NAME> , that -- '' `` Come , <NAME> , '' said the doctor , purposely interrupting him , `` it 's now only the 5th of <NAME> ; we should not despair ; a path may open before us suddenly ; you know the ice often breaks into separate pieces , even when the weather is calm , as if it were driven apart by some force of repulsion ; at any moment we may find the sea free . ''
0	And how many of those oysters for which he risked his life had no pearl in them !
0	The natives no sooner came on board than they began to pilfer , and it was necessary to fire a cannon to get rid of them ; a wound which one of the natives received in the fray soon changed their disposition , and a discharge of musketry was the reply to the shower of arrows which they let fly from their boats .
0	`` That is foreseen , '' replied <NAME> .
0	And indeed , the next day the extremity of the peninsula was reached , and the whole length of the forest had been traversed ; but there was nothing to indicate the retreat in which the convicts had taken refuge , nor that , no less secret , which sheltered the mysterious unknown .
0	The maneuver necessitated a good deal of care .
0	Partes a terre , deux matelots et le Capitaine Grant ont atteint l ’ ile <NAME> -- ” “ Oh ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
0	“ We have no time to lose .
0	The frigate approached the cetacean .
0	That is much deeper than where you have been yet ; it may be fifty or sixty feet , and you will have to support a pressure of quite two atmospheres .
0	which was echoed again and again from the cliff and rocks .
0	It might have been fancied that she had weighed anchor , thinking that she had to deal with her match , and had left the coast .
0	From these remarks we gather how invaluable the trustworthy narrative of this disinterested and well-informed traveller would have been .
0	In less than half an hour , by an easy winding path , <NAME> and his party reached the crest of the crouching lion , which , seen from the west , <NAME> ’ s Seat so much resembles .
0	When at last the kinship of all these forces was discovered , it is simply astounding that 500 years should still have to elapse before men could analyze and describe the several modes of vibration that constitute these differences .
0	“ The wire is no doubt still working between <NAME> and <NAME> , and there -- Shall we start , little father ? ” “ Let us wait till to-morrow , ” answered <NAME> .
0	For why should it interest him ?
0	Thoughts of this kind continued to occupy the minds of our travellers even for some time after the little spark of light had been extinguished in the black gloom .
0	My uncle thanked him warmly , in the <NAME> language , for his kind hospitality , speaking truly from the heart .
0	The post of the <NAME> became once more a sinecure , and if his salary was not reduced , it was because the burgomaster and the counsellor could not make up their minds to decide upon it .
0	He had before him a man convicted of the most heinous of crimes , and the man never flinched .
0	According to the narrative of <NAME> experienced serious difficulties , due to bad weather , from the 1st to the 4th of January , 1828 .
0	A minute afterwards they were in the presence of Mrs. Scorbitt and J. T. <NAME> .
0	`` Nevertheless , '' retorted one of the audience , `` there are many arguments against the habitability of the worlds .
0	`` When the cooling of its crust shall have made it uninhabitable . ''
0	At the same moment , all the articles on board the boat that were made of iron or steel -- cooking utensils , arms , <NAME> 's stove , our knives , which were torn from our pockets -- took flight after a similar fashion in the same direction , while the boat , quickening its course , brought up against the beach .
0	After two days ' row the canoes came in sight of <NAME> , at a spot where the stream divides into three `` rivers '' of great width , with marshy level banks covered with palm-trees .
0	When we entered the house we found my uncle surrounded by workmen and porters , who were packing up .
0	The pilot was silent for a few moments ; they felt that he was reflecting before he spoke .
0	`` What should I do there , <NAME> , and what could I ever have done there ?
0	! ” There was a general sigh of disappointment .
0	Upon reaching the Cape , <NAME> was obliged to put in for forty days .
0	cried M'Nicholl catching fire at the sight .
0	If so , <NAME> and his companions would escape scot free , except for a few vigorous douche baths .
0	At the moment the men who have been following the eagles ' movements see them alight to eat the meat , they raise fearful cries , the meat is dropped and the eagles take to flight , and thus the men have no difficulty in taking the diamonds that are attached to the meat .
0	He learned <NAME> ’ s adventures , and through what various trials the colonists had passed .
0	“ Well , ” replied the reporter , who had already hunted the tiger in <NAME> , and the lion in <NAME> , “ we shall soon learn how successfully to encounter them .
0	High pieces of furniture , of black violet ebony inlaid with brass , supported upon their wide shelves a great number of books uniformly bound .
0	J. T. <NAME> , bending over the mouthpiece of the instrument , received the hardest voltaic knock that had ever found the mouth of a philosopher .
0	The following year he returns to <NAME> , and applies himself to learn the language of the country , in order to be able to transact business directly and without any intermediary agent .
0	In vain Mrs. <NAME> paid ten dollars a line for serious articles , humorous articles , and smart , scathing paragraphs treating the dangers as chimerical .
0	“ <NAME> , ” said the engineer , “ you have always shown much deference to my advice ; will you , in this matter , yield to me ? ” “ I will do as you please , <NAME> , ” answered the sailor , who was not at all convinced .
0	It was but a gleam , but what an indescribable effect !
0	<NAME> , in his absorbing interest for the glowing glories of the planet , seemed to be beguiled into comparative forgetfulness of the charms of his comet ; but no astronomical enthusiasm of the professor could quite allay the general apprehension that some serious collision might be impending .
0	They were <NAME> and Herming , the only two sailors of the crew of the <NAME> schooner who were left .
0	To the north of this kingdom extended that country which the <NAME> traveller calls <NAME> , and which is situated to the north of <NAME> proper .
0	The chief of <NAME> , who had never before seen white men , received the explorers very kindly , held public rejoicings in their honour and detained them with constant fêtes until the 4th November .
0	His first discovery was of a land of which the fertile and verdant aspect seems to have charmed him .
0	The elegant penmanship all through might easily pass for copper plate engraving -- except on one page , dated `` <NAME> , after dinner_ , '' where , candor compels me to acknowledge , the `` Solid Men '' appear to have succeeded in rendering his iron nerves the least bit wabbly .
0	<NAME> at last resumed : “ Here is my plan : We have two hundred pounds of ballast left , since the bags we brought with us are still untouched .
0	<NAME> and phlegmatic , with a clear eye , <NAME> seemed a perfect type of that <NAME> composure which <NAME> has so skilfully represented on canvas .
0	Thus there were no costly materials , no platinum , no retorts , no combustibles , no delicate machinery to produce the two gases separately .
0	We have penetrated so far , thanks to the help of particular circumstances , the earliness of the summer season , an abnormal temperature and a rapid thaw .
0	“ Well , <NAME> ? ” was the captain ’ s invariable response to his servant ’ s formula .
0	The Tartars who now threatened the <NAME> , belonged to the <NAME> race , and occupied <NAME> .
0	“ This will never be finished ! ” said <NAME> , brandishing his dagger , red with blood .
0	In the meanwhile , the pirates who occupied the islet had gradually advanced to the opposite shore , and were now only separated from the mainland by the channel .
0	Ten minutes later , the flock had come within gunshot , and were making the air ring with their hoarse cries .
0	From the pendant lobe of his ears hung earrings of green jade , and round his neck a quivering necklace of “ pounamous , ” a kind of jade stone sacred among the <NAME> .
0	Doubtless it was right to retrace my steps in an upward direction .
0	“ Is it not impossible , ” he murmured aloud , “ that any city should disappear so completely ?
0	That night the temperature was the highest we had so far experienced .
0	“ You see , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ the convicts got as far as here !
0	“ No , ” answered <NAME> , without moving , but looking the other straight in the face .
0	`` <NAME> , by the help of <NAME> , I will bring your lover back to you ! ''
0	He pitched his camp on the banks of the <NAME> ( <NAME> ) river and made many very successful hunting excursions in a district rich in game , finally reaching <NAME> , where the howls of innumerable hyenas frightened the oxen .
0	But if the small towns of <NAME> and <NAME> , which he passed on the next day , were comparatively quiet , owing to their position in the <NAME> , was it not to be dreaded that , upon the right banks of the <NAME> , <NAME> would have much more to fear from man ?
0	Hans , the guide , occupied himself in preparing food .
0	He said to his nephew <NAME> , `` I give you full authority in everything to do whatever you think best , and I believe you will do all for my honour and to my advantage .
0	As they approached the spot where the natives were assembled , the latter fled ; this , however , did not prevent the <NAME> from landing , leaving four lads to guard one of the boats , whilst the other remained at sea .
0	For my own part , too many thoughts crowded my brain , too many insoluble questions pressed upon me , too many fancies kept my eyes half open .
0	Perhaps the two notables waited for the doctor at least an hour ; at least it is reasonable to suppose so , as the burgomaster -- a thing that had never before happened in his life -- betrayed a certain amount of impatience , from which his companion was not exempt .
0	<NAME> now believed himself to be arrived near the mouth of the <NAME> , and from the natives speaking of a certain province of <NAME> , which was surrounded by the sea , he felt himself confirmed in this opinion .
0	There existed no passage , no sign of any other tunnel .
0	<NAME> , impatient of delay , cut the rope , thus sacrificing his anchor , and also the possibility of anchoring again if this tide failed to carry them to land .
0	<NAME> , in 1616 , found in the bay of that name <NAME> ; he was followed in 1619 by <NAME> , and in 1719 by <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , who were never heard of again .
0	But the orang had not touched the ground , when the snowy sheet arose and dispersed in the air in such innumerable flakes that the light of the sun was obscured for some minutes .
0	And ever since that day she has seen in her dreams the fiery commissary , enfolding her in an impassioned embrace !
0	It is scarcely two o ’ clock. ” “ Two in the morning , or two in the afternoon ? ” asked <NAME> , again regarding the sun .
0	A religious family , like that of <NAME> ’ s , had availed themselves enthusiastically of this occasion of taking him with them .
0	The sailors were advised to wear only one woollen shirt over their cotton shirts , and to hermetically close their seal cloaks .
0	Waiting for a ship might be a tedious affair , for <NAME> is not much frequented .
0	The old trunks were divested of their clothing of creepers , cacti , ferns , mosses , and bromelias .
0	`` You saved mine , '' answered the <NAME> .
0	in 1668 , and elected by her a member of the <NAME> .
0	said <NAME> , who , more active than his companions , first reached the plateau .
0	<NAME> prepared himself most carefully for the journey , which was a great undertaking for him .
0	The vast plain on which it stands , although exceedingly fine , yields in verdure and fertility , and simple beauty of appearance , to the delightful country surrounding the less celebrated city of <NAME> .
0	The animals were in perfect health , and bravely bearing the fatigues of the voyage .
0	This continuous shower accounted for the swamps and marshes that formed the sole surface of the country .
0	`` The <NAME> , '' he says , `` have few slaves , go almost naked , and are always armed with bows and arrows .
0	This colossal boundary then stretched away for nearly 150 leagues over the <NAME> desert , and , extending to the south of <NAME> , occupied what , if <NAME> had still existed , would have been its natural frontier .
0	These ruffians , united by a secret bond , strangled victims of every age in honour of the goddess <NAME> , without ever shedding blood ; there was a period when this part of the country could scarcely be travelled over without corpses being found in every direction .
0	`` Well , if we give up the great theory of the central heat of the earth , I certainly can offer no reasons why anything should be looked upon as impossible . ''
0	<NAME> came ; nothing occurred to alarm them , or to mar its beauty .
0	Should we ever be in such extremity ?
0	<NAME> feathers were so much in vogue that they had to be imported from <NAME> and <NAME> .
0	He did not know what to do .
0	The horse prepared for <NAME> was brought out .
0	In fact , the longer the needle of a dial is , the more easily can the movement of its point be followed .
0	There commenced a series of misfortunes for <NAME> ; in a few months she lost some of her children .
0	Before bed-time every man , woman , and child in the country had heard it and gone into ecstasies over it .
0	The next day , the 22nd of March , at six in the morning , preparations for departure were begun .
0	“ Courage , my friends ! ” cried <NAME> ; “ courage !
0	“ Doctor Krapf proposes to push forward , in the west , by way of the <NAME> , a river lying under the equator .
0	<NAME> <NAME> at once lighted a fire , singing all the time , according to his wont , a snatch of an old military refrain .
0	There was a faint sigh , followed by a feeble voice , which uttered the one word , “ Gallia ? ” “ Yes , yes !
0	[ Illustration : <NAME> rose with cries of despair , and hurried to the bed of old <NAME> . ]
0	The first beat of the hammer on the bell awoke me from my dreams .
0	All was black , and such a dense black that , after some minutes , my eyes had not been able to discern even the faintest glimmer .
0	<NAME> having declined all participation in the matter , the only representatives of the <NAME> Empire were those from the <NAME> .
0	I was perfectly ignorant of the matter .
0	<NAME> perceived that he could no longer hope to carry out his project .
0	This expression rather disturbed Fix , without his knowing why .
0	They were then occupying the center of a rocky plain , which the sun scorched with its parching rays .
0	Speaking of the moon , she is nearest to the earth in her perigee , and farthest from it in her apogee .
0	_Engraved by E. Morieu._ ] At the same period a master in the <NAME> , <NAME> by name , was appointed by an Edinburgh firm to the command of an expedition , to obtain seal-skins in the southern seas , where two years were to be spent .
0	he exclaimed , `` and the earth ? ''
0	Who shakes the seam during tempestuous nights ?
0	He must have brought news from <NAME> ! ” “ Well , old Manasseh , what if he has ? ” “ I should like to see him. ” “ Can ’ t be. ” The Jew sidled close up to <NAME> , and laying his hand on his arm , said in a low and insinuating tone , “ I am poor , you know ; but I would give you a few reals if you would let me talk to this stranger. ” But as if he thought he was making too liberal an offer , he added , “ Only it must be at once. ” “ He is too tired ; he is worn out ; he is fast asleep , ” answered <NAME> .
0	They then directed their course to <NAME> 's <NAME> .
0	It was a fortune which had fallen from the sky .
0	`` Up with the helm , reverse the engines . ''
0	At any rate , for humanity 's sake alone , it would be right to wait .
0	Everything incited them to discover the answer to this enigma , an answer which could only be the name of a man endowed with a truly inexplicable , and in some degree superhuman power .
0	<NAME> , with the utmost coolness , <NAME> added : ‘ Even admitting , sir , that the thing were untrue , you will , at least , no longer maintain that it is impossible. ’ ” “ Well put in ! ” said <NAME> , “ and if the <NAME> found it lie heavy on his stomach , he got no more than he deserved .
0	“ If so , he must be well acquainted with the country , and it is possible that he has left the <NAME> road , depending on rejoining it later. ” “ But then we should be in advance of him , ” answered the pendja-baschi ; “ for we left <NAME> within an hour after his departure , and have since followed the shortest road with all the speed of our horses .
0	Many presents were distributed to those of his cortége who appeared the most influential .
0	But if <NAME> could so reproach himself , how about <NAME> ?
0	Our ears must have deceived us , and our eyes have cheated us !
0	Ah -- what a journey -- what a marvelous and extraordinary journey !
0	But from that day <NAME> appeared to be anxious .
0	The <NAME> has only just arrived , and -- '' `` Yes , yes , I know .
0	The northern hemisphere , towards which they were now rapidly approaching , presented a strong contrast with the southern , by its vast plains and great depressions , checkered here and there by very remarkable isolated mountains .
0	<NAME> decided to continue the exploration of the coast and the survey of <NAME> Francis Archipelago alone -- a most important undertaking , as no navigator had examined its islands separately since its first discovery by <NAME> in 1627 .
0	`` Yes , there is an almost all-powerful being , hidden in some part of the island , and whose influence has been singularly useful to our colony .
0	“ And what is her tonnage ? ” “ Two hundred and ten tons. ” “ I don ’ t think I am far out , ” continued <NAME> , “ in judging her speed at fifteen knots .
0	We will open one , and throw the body out into space . ''
0	During four successive journeys from 1638 to 1663 , he travelled over <NAME> , the <NAME> , the Indies as far as the frontier of <NAME> , and the <NAME> of <NAME> .
0	`` But there is a chance of success , '' answered the captain , `` and we must try it .
0	The sun was low on the horizon , but an hour had still to elapse before nightfall .
0	`` I will go and let him know . ''
0	Several unlucky ones had scarcely time to make way for their passage .
0	I do call that ingenious ! ''
0	<NAME> I say _vive la Science ! _ '' `` <NAME> , '' began the Captain with some asperity , `` the foundations on which <NAME> has raised -- '' `` I 'm half converted already , '' interrupted <NAME> in a cheery tone ; `` I do really believe that Science is not altogether unmitigated homebogue !
0	His father -- old <NAME> , dead ten years since -- inhabited the town of <NAME> , situated in the government of the same name ; and his mother , <NAME> , lived there still .

0	Now stony roads took the place of the old mining tramways .
0	`` As I did not wish to offend either them or their gods , '' says the captain , `` I dared not touch them , but I inquired of <NAME> if these were 'Eatuas , ' or gods .
0	Although <NAME> is the country of stagnation , and customs and fashion always remain much the same in it , the many events which had taken place made it desirable to obtain more exact particulars of a nation with whom Europeans might possibly enter into advantageous friendly relations .
0	After a short stay off the coast of <NAME> , <NAME> visited <NAME> , where the same incidents which had marked <NAME> 's visit were repeated .
0	M. Fridriksson was not present , and I was afterwards sorry to hear that he and the governor did not agree on some matters connected with the administration of the island .
0	The police had great difficulty in keeping back the crowd , and as the hour when <NAME> was due approached , the excitement rose to its highest pitch .
0	<NAME> had supposed <NAME> ’ s refusal of a horse was that he preferred walking , as some guides do , but he was mistaken , for just as they were ready , the <NAME> gave a peculiar whistle , and immediately a magnificent steed of the pure <NAME> breed came bounding out of a grove close by , at his master ’ s call .

0	“ As I have said already , ” resumed the learned geographer , “ after having crossed <NAME> , the 37th degree of latitude cuts the islands of <NAME> d ’ Acunha .
0	The four caravels were full of worm-holes , and one of them had to be left behind at <NAME> .
0	Fetiches and gri-gris were hung over his door , and in one of his huts there was a square stool , supported on two sides by four little wooden effigies of men .
0	158 Natives of <NAME> .
0	They had cold water , that is to say , the most powerful sedative that can be employed against inflammation of wounds , the most efficacious therapeutic agent in grave cases , and the one which is now adopted by all physicians .
0	As to the results of his expedition they were almost none as to discoveries , and the stones , which he had put on board in the midst of so many dangers , were valueless .
0	“ Meantime , ” continued <NAME> , “ either the river will get lower , and allow us to ford it , or we shall have time to make a canoe .
0	The influence to which the priests of <NAME> had subjected <NAME> began gradually to yield , and she became more herself , so that her fine eyes resumed all their soft <NAME> expression .
0	Then , a large spot seemingly nailed to the firmament , bordered by a silvery cord ; it was the earth !
0	But the captain was out of hearing .
0	Liberal as nature has been in the adornment of these parts , the industry of the <NAME> seems not a little to have contributed to their beauty ; for nothing indeed can equal the extraordinary degree of cultivation everywhere apparent .
0	<NAME> turned his stay at <NAME> to account by studying the light of the stars of the southern hemisphere , for he had noticed that several , notably the <NAME> , the <NAME> of the <NAME> , and others , seemed to have changed since the time of <NAME> .
0	For this reason he named the river which flowed into the sea at this place <NAME> dos <NAME> ( River of good tokens ) .
0	They had , however , the good sense to regain the continent , where in comparative ease , they could await the end of the winter .
0	He was looking at the ship , which was five or six miles to leeward .
0	In the afternoon of the same day our ears were assailed by a hideous braying from below .
0	“ A ship ! ” exclaimed <NAME> , starting to his feet .
0	<NAME> was far from being insensible to the sentiments of <NAME> , but yet he did not dare to speak .
0	<NAME> discovered in the dry bed of a creek , a plant whose excellent properties had been frequently described by one of his colleagues in the <NAME> .
0	Following <NAME> ’ s advice , it appeared best to take the road already traversed through the forest , and to return by another route .
0	Even if we do not find the castaway , at least our voyage will not have been useless , and <NAME> will have rewarded us . ''
0	The current was now carrying us in the direction of the pole !
0	`` Well , '' said <NAME> , `` I should have liked to be there ; it must have been funny enough . ''
0	Vasling looked forward , but did not see him .
0	The problem before us is how to communicate an initial force of 12,000 yards per second to a shell of 108 inches in diameter , weighing 20,000 pounds .
0	But here opinions began to diverge .
0	<NAME> <NAME> , then , loved <NAME> , but quietly , as a man would love when he has ten years before him in which to obtain the beloved object .
0	<NAME> <NAME> hurried to the window .
0	Besides , it was very likely that <NAME> was merely an island , and did not extend to the Pole .
0	They had to dispatch the fellow with rifles .
0	“ As you please , <NAME> Starr. ” “ Have you your lamp ? ” “ Yes , and I only wish it was still the safety lamp , which we formerly had to use ! ” “ Sure enough , ” returned <NAME> , “ there is no fear of fire-damp explosions now ! ” <NAME> was provided with a simple oil lamp , the wick of which he lighted .
0	She had two masts and all the sails and rigging of an ordinary clipper , which would enable her to take advantage of every favorable wind , though her chief reliance was on her mechanical power .
0	`` I have an idea , my dear boy ; it is none other than this simple fact ; we shall not come out by the same opening as that by which we entered . ''
0	Having made his calculations , <NAME> found that he would at most be able to keep them alive till the time for departure , by putting each and all on half rations .
0	But it attracted little notice , as by this time further , and more curious particulars had been obtained .
0	His eldest son <NAME> , whose mother was descended from the incas , had the remainder of his states .
0	This information could not but cause him great uneasiness , and increase his wish of being beyond the <NAME> , so as to judge for himself of the truth of these rumors , and enable him to guard against any possible contingency .
0	At last the long agony was over forever .
0	He was consulted as to the best spot for the observation of the transit of <NAME> , and he selected an island which he had discovered , and which was named by him after <NAME> .
0	I want to look upon the works of the Almighty. ’ ” “ I shall soon say so , <NAME> , I hope , ” replied the girl ; “ I shall soon go with you to the world above ; and yet -- ” “ What are you going to say , <NAME> ? ” hastily cried <NAME> ; “ can you possibly regret having quitted that gloomy abyss in which you spent your early years , and whence we drew you half dead ? ” “ No , <NAME> , ” answered <NAME> ; “ I was only thinking that darkness is beautiful as well as light .
0	<NAME> <NAME> remained but a few minutes alone with <NAME> , and soon recalled his companions ; but he said nothing to them of the private matters which the dying man had confided to him .
0	That was his first winter , 1852-53 , for the next he spent in <NAME> , where the <NAME> now lay at anchor .
0	But how was this information to be obtained ?
0	I was , therefore , in constant communication with , at all events the letters of , <NAME> , <NAME> , and other great men .
0	`` At any rate , '' remarked <NAME> , `` it is well understood that if we do leave <NAME> in some way or another , it will not be because we were uncomfortable there ! ''
0	`` At <NAME> the beef is excellent , but it is difficult to procure enough of it to feed a fleet .
0	But <NAME> was now in a profound stupor , from which it was no longer possible to rouse him .
0	<NAME> never questioned this ; indeed , had he done so , he would never have undertaken the journey .
0	Other astronomers have seen in these inexplicable rays a kind of moraines , rows of erratic blocks , which had been thrown up at the period of <NAME> 's formation .
0	Provisions failing , <NAME> was forced to return , and he went to the island of <NAME> between <NAME> and <NAME> ; but there his chief sailor mutinied and it was not without difficulty that <NAME> and <NAME> reached the fort on <NAME> .
0	`` Yes , if it were solid , not if it were hollow . ''
0	“ Our tinder is just like wet sponge. ” “ We can dispense with it , ” replied <NAME> .
0	`` Yes , he will come , but who will command ? ''
0	<NAME> eagerly agreed to this , and the captive inca despatched the necessary orders at once to all the provinces ; these were carried out promptly and unmurmuringly .
0	Exhausted by his long march , with nothing to eat but a few dates , obliged to depend on the charity of the <NAME> , who as often as not declined to give him anything , and finding at <NAME> no representative of <NAME> but an old Jew named <NAME> , who acted as <NAME> , and who , being afraid of compromising himself , would not let <NAME> embark on a <NAME> brig bound for <NAME> , -- the traveller eagerly availed himself of a fortunate chance for going to <NAME> .
0	As a last effort his hands convulsively clutched at a clump of reeds , but they could not stop him , and he disappeared beneath the waters of the river .
0	A boat would be seen where a man may glide between wind and water . ''
0	You go forward listlessly , often looking behind you !
0	He inhabited a town called <NAME> , which was two miles in extent , and situated upon the eastern shore of the lake called <NAME> .
0	As long as it went through more frequented waters , we often saw the hulls of shipwrecked vessels that were rotting in the depths , and deeper down cannons , bullets , anchors , chains , and a thousand other iron materials eaten up by rust .
0	The pupils seemed to be singularly enlarged .
0	The <NAME> still floated ; some streaks of light were filtering through the liquid beds .
0	Assuredly if the adventurer was taciturn he was not inquisitive .
0	They could not go on at all , and refused to eat the <NAME> , a poor , burnt-up sort of lucerne that grew there .
0	They had no doubt about it themselves !
0	But he was more disturbed at the prospect of her future fate .
0	I felt the cold mount from my feet to my chest .
0	`` Your dead sleep quietly , at least , <NAME> , out of the reach of sharks . ''
0	Their faces were peculiar , but pleasant ; they had small eyes and thick lips , the upper one being painted or tattooed . ''
0	They soon reached <NAME> , where the <NAME> enters the <NAME> of <NAME> .
0	`` Not at such a latitude .
0	They might even live long enough to catch a last glimpse of the distant Earth bathed in the glory of the solar rays .
0	<NAME> fell from <NAME> ’ s eyes .
0	“ See what that wretched promise costs me , ” sighed <NAME> , as , at a gesture from his sister , he replaced under his arm the gun which had instinctively gone up to his shoulder .
0	The <NAME> boat had arrived one moment before ours , and its crew were already clambering up the steep sides of the rock , flinging down the penguins as they went , the birds showing no small surprise at being thus summarily dispossessed of the island , of which they had been hitherto the only inhabitants .
0	When day breaks , however , <NAME> , this palace will not look so very gloomy .
0	The doctor then began to think of his ruined cabin , of his lost collections , of his precious instruments destroyed , his books torn , burned to ashes .
0	As for <NAME> , he seemed to have heard these particulars for the first time .
0	Their trunks at the base measured twenty feet in circumference , and their bark was covered by a network of furrows containing a red , sweet-smelling gum .
0	He had nothing better to do than , taking chance for his guide , to wander aimlessly through the streets of <NAME> .
0	Any one who saw him would have called him bold , and any one who heard him would have called him coldly passionate ; he was a man who would never retreat , and who would risk the lives of others as coldly as his own .
0	The Kai-Koumou drew near ; suddenly the wretched victim rose ; but a violent blow from a “ <NAME> , ” a kind of club brandished by the chief , struck her to the ground ; she fell senseless .
0	It explained the whole mystery .
0	substituted for the `` Cape of <NAME> , '' the name of the `` Cape of <NAME> , '' for he saw that now the route to <NAME> was open at last , and his vast plans for the extension of the commerce and influence of his country were about to be realized .
0	`` As for you , <NAME> , I know your worth -- '' `` Well , you know then a great deal more than I do , '' answered the doctor , quickly .
0	For two years he lived at <NAME> incognito .
0	Now that I think of the matter calmly , and that I reflect upon it dispassionately ; now that months , years , have passed since this strange and unnatural adventure befell us -- what am I to think , what am I to believe ?
0	And , without doubt , <NAME> was promptly deposed .
0	He took nothing away , wishing the guilty to inherit the riches of the innocent .
0	Let us be off ! ” And so all three of them landed on the bank of the <NAME> and started for the town .
0	Traps were again set , and the machines manufactured by Harding were tried .
0	Top , at the foot of the palisade , was jumping , barking , but it was with pleasure , not anger .
0	`` None , sir , '' answered the <NAME> .
0	It took six thousand years to invent propellers and screws ; so we have time enough yet. ” “ Confounded heat ! ” said <NAME> , wiping away the perspiration that was streaming from his forehead .
0	`` But as we manufacture air ourselves ! ''
0	“ Then , gentlemen , ” said the astronomer , “ with your leave we will for this purpose make an appointment a few weeks hence .
0	At intervals solid pedestals rise from this wall , bearing every token of having served to support colossal statues of <NAME> , the barking <NAME> , or the <NAME> star .
0	They looked at one another with terror .
0	<NAME> , to whom the captain left the business of refilling the water tanks and taking in supplies of fresh meat and vegetables , had every reason to be satisfied with <NAME> , who , no doubt , expected to be paid , and was paid , handsomely .
0	She had six feet of water in her hold , and was gradually sinking .
0	The part of the <NAME> where these people were employed , the very place where <NAME> had met Torres a few years before , was not very far from <NAME> .
0	`` We are floating on its surface , friend Ned . ''
0	It was within an hour of morning .
0	39 degrees N. ? ” “ Can ’ t say , sir .
0	-- '' The _eccentricity_ is _less_ than _unity_ ! ''
0	Their arms are bows and arrows or muskets .
0	It was a star without scintillating rays .
0	“ I mean this : the guanaco is only good for eating when it is killed in a state of rest .
0	`` Yes , they tried to reach <NAME> 's <NAME> , and separated into several parties .
0	<NAME> , ” answered <NAME> , with comic gravity , “ it appears that there is -- or rather formerly was -- a trunk of _ ‘ turuma , ’ _ which every year at the same time descended the <NAME> , stopping several days at <NAME> , and going on into <NAME> , halting at every port , where the natives ornamented it with little flags .
0	All proceeded towards <NAME> ’ s chapel , which had been handsomely decorated for the occasion .
0	The lungs are satisfied with a provision of vegetable and farinaceous food .
0	The greatest men have travelled as we are doing .
0	<NAME> , <NAME> for the King and Director-general of the <NAME> upon the <NAME> and in other parts of <NAME> -- so ran his official title -- although he may be little known , and the article which treats of him may be one of the most curtailed in the great collections of biography , deserves to occupy one of the most prominent positions among colonizers and explorers .
0	The inhabitants , gentle and hospitable , took great pains to furnish the navigators with the provisions they required .
0	Raised upon an artificial butt , sixteen or eighteen feet from the ground , the temple was in an oblong form , and was reached by two stone staircases .
0	What might it not do under the lead of <NAME> ?
0	<NAME> was left for him to do but to make an attack upon the sacred village of <NAME> , containing the tombs of several of the principal families .
0	The boat was lost to sight , and the coast was not neared again until night was approaching .
0	The travelers , at a distance of twenty-four miles ( reduced to four by their glasses ) could admire this vast crater in its entirety .
0	We may be sure that these new shoes were large enough and never pinched the feet of the wearers .
0	As they turn their backs to the north , the east is on their left , and the west to their right .
0	“ Yes , <NAME> , ” replied <NAME> , “ Kai-Koumou is left alone with the warriors of his canoe .
0	A few days later , King O-Too and several other chiefs visited the <NAME> , and brought them a present of ten or a dozen large pigs and some fruit .
0	“ But , ” as the sailor said , “ they quite took the wind out of the sails of the <NAME> , for whom everything was done by a miracle. ” In fact , they were energetic ; an energetic man will succeed where an indolent one would vegetate and inevitably perish .
0	A loud call from <NAME> brought us to a little strip of beach on the right of our stranded boat .
0	The most absolute silence reigned around him ; a light wind shook the tree-tops and gently rocked the car , inviting the hunter to taste the sleep that stole over him in spite of himself .
0	To right and left ran long , dark galleries , where sight was lost .
0	He glanced to the right and to the left , and rapidly swung his tail .
0	Since the September equinox it had emerged from the northern horizon , rising by lengthened spirals up to the 21st of December .
0	there is some mystery in that man ’ s life , ” said <NAME> , “ and it appears as if he had only re-entered society by the path of remorse. ” “ I don ’ t know what sort of a man we have brought here , ” said the sailor .
0	She related that a native who had agreed to exchange a wooden bolster for a knife , was shot by an officer because he wanted to take back his merchandise when he had been paid for it .
0	The season was too far advanced , and the distance between these latitudes and the pole too great to allow of anything being attempted in the southern hemisphere .
0	My uncle and the guide made no effort to save themselves .
0	The question now arose as to which it was wise to take ; and this of itself was no small difficulty .
0	In a moment the reporter and his two companions had crossed the corral and reached the gate of the palisade behind which <NAME> was heard growling sullenly .
0	Really , the whale itself ca n't be far off . ''
0	Soon <NAME> 's barks ceased , and the vessel continued her course at a few cable-lengths from the coast .
0	For four days , till the 3rd of February , the <NAME> scoured the <NAME> of <NAME> , at various speeds and at various depths .
0	Suddenly my clothes were seized by a strong hand , and I felt myself quickly drawn up to the surface of the sea ; and I heard , yes , I heard these words pronounced in my ear : `` If master would be so good as to lean on my shoulder , master would swim with much greater ease . ''
0	These unfortunate people , consisting of <NAME> , <NAME> , soldiers and civilians , numbered some thousands , and formed a column which extended over several versts .
0	“ Had we not taken the precaution to lighten the balloon yesterday evening , we should have been lost beyond redemption , ” said the doctor , after a long silence .
0	<NAME> <NAME> observed that his watch was two hours too fast .
0	<NAME> nuts are chewed , and sometimes even swallowed when mixed with _trona_ , a habit not peculiar to <NAME> , for it extends to <NAME> , where it is strictly forbidden to women .
0	Thirty-four of the crew of the <NAME> had died since leaving the southern regions , and if <NAME> had remained another week in these latitudes , he would have lost a hundred men !
0	But the accursed animal swam at the same speed .
0	There was the same grassy flat soil , the same sharply-defined horizon against the sky .
0	The prisoners had been trying to overthrow the palisade , but of course had not succeeded , and were not long in becoming more tranquil .
0	It was time ; the two enemies were gazing at one another .
0	In another twenty-four hours , or forty-eight at the most , if the land does not appear , <NAME> will steer to the north again ! ''
0	He made for the <NAME> , quickly gained his chamber , and slid under the bedclothes , while an army of a hundred thousand men kept watch under his windows .
0	It was the voice of <NAME> shouting : `` Look out there !
0	With the assurance that they would not fail to keep their appointment with military punctuality , the two officers cordially wrung their friend ’ s hand and retired to the <NAME> for a game at piquet .
0	In an instant the full horror of my situation seized me .
0	It was eleven o ’ clock when the banquet , which had begun at half-past seven , came to an end by a toast proposed by the <NAME> in honour of the engineers of the <NAME> Practical Association and the success of their undertaking .
0	Finally , they introduce a piece of wood , made for the purpose , of the size and shape of the bowl of an ordinary table-spoon .
0	The learned geographer was so lost in delight , that he seemed hardly to have started before they came in sight of the <NAME> camp , or <NAME> , situated in the heart of a valley .
0	They made a good start .
0	To complete our sketch , we must give an account of <NAME> 's expedition to the <NAME> , and <NAME> 's exploration to the source of the <NAME> , in 1817 .
0	Two men , besides , deserve to be mentioned for the encouragements and facilities which they afforded to the explorers , viz. , M. de Frontenac , Governor of <NAME> , and <NAME> , intendant of justice and police .
0	He tells us of the remarkable way in which the <NAME> kept any vow that they might have made ; that their two deities were <NAME> and <NAME> , and of the abundant growth of myrrh , cinnamon and other spices , and he gives a very interesting account of their culture and preparation .
0	I did not utter a word until the captain 's emotion had subsided .
0	An <NAME> can scarcely remain unmoved at the sight of sixty thousand dollars .
0	The doctor , much moved , wanted to defend himself by modesty , but he was unable .
0	That was the principal point .
0	This again suggested that the origin of both races was the same .
0	It seemed impossible that , before long , the projectile would not strike her , if only at the north pole , the brilliant arch of which was so distinctly visible on the black sky .
0	It is solid ground , not a liquid basin , that the <NAME> Practical Association has purchased .
0	The snow melted away in some places , according to the shape of the ground , while in others it lay in large patches .
0	A luminous ceiling , decorated with light arabesques , shed a soft clear light over all the marvels accumulated in this museum .
0	Hence there exists a formidable accumulation of electric fluid at the poles , and it flows towards the land in a permanent stream .
0	Do not make us lose it , my friend . ''
0	We first resorted to emetics , and afterwards we succeeded in inducing perspiration , which relieved us greatly .
0	But a few flashes backwards and forwards over the wires soon settled that point .
0	Yes ; four meals a day. ” “ Hurrah ! ” shouted the soldiers , unable this time to keep their delight within the bounds of military decorum ; and , turning to the right-about , they marched away , leaving the officers to renew the all-absorbing game .
0	D'Entrecasteaux then proceeded to reconnoitre the northern portion of the archipelago , and to trade with the natives .
0	There were still the same trees , belonging , for the most part , to the pine family .
0	The only representative of the <NAME> company was the <NAME> whose name figured in the advertisement of the 7th of November .
0	So the sailor actively pursued his researches , though he exclaimed , when some animal which he had not even time to recognize fled into the long grass , “ If only we had had the dog Top ! ” But <NAME> had disappeared at the same time as his master , and had probably perished with him .
0	After some time , <NAME> stopped us .
0	Even <NAME> may be said to have a representative in the person of this miserable Jew. ” “ And even in him , ” said <NAME> , “ perhaps we shall not find so indifferent a representative as we at present imagine. ” The Spaniards who had arrived on board the <NAME> consisted of nine men and a lad of twelve years of age , named <NAME> .
0	No part of the island could have been more suitable to conceal a dwelling whose occupant wished to remain unknown .
0	repeated <NAME> , who had seized <NAME> by the collar of his jersey .
0	We now correct this mistake , which has been repeated in all subsequent editions . ]
0	cried the colonel ; `` it 's you who are going to play a spade ! ''
0	The spot where the projectile sank under the waves was exactly known ; but the machinery to grasp it and bring it to the surface of the ocean was still wanting .
0	They uttered a cry like the braying of an ass , were about the size of a goose , slate-colour on the body , white beneath , with a yellow line round their throats ; they allowed themselves to be killed with a stone , never trying to escape .
0	“ The car ! ” was his reply ; “ we can cling to the network .
0	For many long hours these brave fellows continued their search without dreaming of taking rest .
0	<NAME> even swore that they were `` bleeding , '' and the others were too busy to contradict him .
0	But this is all over now ; the _prestige_ has gone , and we make our tour of the globe nowadays as we should then have made that of <NAME> . ''
0	his return to social life will have been but of short duration . ''
0	It was evidently a hard , impenetrable body , and not the soft substance that forms the bodies of the great marine mammalia .
0	The blazing head of the great bolt that rivets the lunar hemispheres in union inseverable ?
0	`` <NAME> , '' said the Professor , `` I do believe that the situation is to a certain extent desperate .
0	If the current was interrupted the magnet immediately became unmagnetised .
0	<NAME> guessed what <NAME> wished to attempt .
0	`` His food is sure , '' continued the poor man , who was beginning to be delirious ; `` he must be half famished , and I do n't see why we need keep him waiting any longer ! ''
0	Doubtless they explored the surrounding lands , made every effort to escape , for the admiral was an energetic man ; and if he did not succeed -- '' `` It 's because his men betrayed him , '' said <NAME> in a deep voice .
0	After seventeen days ' march they reached the <NAME> of <NAME> in <NAME> .
0	If he had escaped in a boat made by himself , he would still less have left these indispensable and necessary articles .
0	The most important places passed en route by <NAME> were <NAME> , a densely populated town , the inhabitants of which had been sold as slaves by the <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , the capital of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and the wells of <NAME> , where he met an escort sent by the sultan .
0	As it happened , the King of <NAME> , <NAME> , soon after marched against the town of <NAME> .
0	He is brave ; he is sober ; he is safe ; he never makes a false step ; never glides or slips from his path .
0	I must consider how to leave this country of the <NAME> , of which I shall not retain the most delightful of memories , as quickly as possible . ''
0	The sand of this desert is so fine that its particles are almost impalpable , and the action of the wind causes it to accumulate into heaps ten or twenty feet high , divided by deep valleys .
0	I will wait till you have done -- '' `` For what ? ''
0	This island produces arrack ( the alcohol of rice ) , camphor , cinnamon , ginger , oranges , citrons , sugar-canes , melons , radishes , onions , & c. The articles of exchange are copper , quicksilver , cinnabar , glass , woollen cloths , and canvas , and above all iron and spectacles , without mentioning porcelain , and diamonds , some of which were of extraordinary size and value .
0	I have already explained that I held Hans by the arm .
0	'With God 's protection , ' he said , 'not a hair of our heads shall be hurt . '
0	The captain must have thrown it into the sea when I was no longer on board. ” “ But the captain ?
0	“ What a brute , ” exclaimed <NAME> .
0	“ Let us go in and watch , ” answered the engineer .
0	They rose among the volumes of smoke to a height of five or six hundred feet .
0	The <NAME> chain does not attain any very great height , the highest summit not being more than five thousand feet .
0	He had in all his bearing that inexpressible something which tells you that the man is genuine and of frank and upright character .
0	<NAME> was aided by splendid weather , a fortunate circumstance , as scurvy had made such ravages among the sailors , that very few of them were in a condition to work .
0	`` A secret -- which , '' stammered my uncle .
0	This new expedition doubled the Cape of <NAME> without misadventure , discovered between <NAME> and <NAME> an unknown island , which was named after the commander of the fleet , and arrived at <NAME> , where <NAME> was informed of the events which had taken place at <NAME> .
0	<NAME> to-night , then , till to-night !
0	The house , built by order of the <NAME> , and in which she had celebrated the marriage of one of her buffoons in 1740 , was nearly as large as ours ; but in front stood six cannons of ice ; they were often fired without bursting ; there were also mortars to hold sixty-pound shells ; so we could have some formidable artillery ; the bronze is handy , and falls even from heaven .
0	The doctor saw himself kept within doors , and he folded his arms ; there was nothing to be done , except every hour to clear away the entrance-hall and to repolish the ice-walls which the heat within made damp ; but the snow-house was very finely built , and the snow added to its resistance by augmenting the thickness of its walls .
0	There was no wood to be found , however , but fortunately the rocks were covered with a poor , dry species of lichen .
0	But his vessel had no sooner been put to sea than he was again attacked by the bilious fever , from which he had suffered so severely .
0	The well-being of the colony was therefore complete .
0	The coxswain said some words in his outlandish tongue , doubtless warning the men to keep on their guard .
0	resumed my companion , whose face became more and more animated .
0	The <NAME> lay in a little harbor sheltered from the north , east , and south winds , about a cable-length from the shore .
0	He was then 150 miles from the <NAME> , and was told that it would take him no less than ten days to reach the great river , on account of the rapids and shallows .
0	The inhabitants have no food but batatas , and when they run short they are obliged to live upon a little tree called `` achupalla , '' for which they have to contend with the bear of the Andes .
0	Accordingly they went on without stopping , fording the <NAME> of <NAME> and also the <NAME> , a few miles further on .
0	Our looks expressed our feelings better than words .
0	<NAME> knew from experience the usefulness of this practice and its good influence on the men , so valuable that it is never neglected on board of ships which winter in the polar seas .
0	<NAME> and his companions , therefore , shut up in the Projectile , could readily imagine themselves to be completely motionless .
0	“ I have come down the <NAME> from <NAME> to <NAME> .
0	“ That indeed he is. ” “ Do you know something , my Lord ? ” “ What is it , and then I will tell you ? ” “ That all the people you have with you are brave .
0	We remained mute , not stirring , and not knowing what surprise awaited us , whether agreeable or disagreeable .
0	It is divided from the mainland of Te-Wahi-Punamub [ 1 ] by the <NAME> .
0	The bell-ringer has evidently lost his self-control .
0	<NAME> could scarcely contain his anger .
0	The very man whose office it had been contemplated to suppress for ten years .

0	The natives , called <NAME> , were so frightened at the sight of the vessels that they hastily took refuge in the interior of the country , carrying with them all their valuables , and it was impossible to overtake any of them .
0	He reflected an instant and replied , -- “ Two cables lengths at the most. ” “ But what is a cable ’ s length ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	`` Friends , '' he said , `` it is now twenty minutes past ten .
0	“ You were there ? ” at last she uttered .
0	Besides , it did not offer the same security , and its tenants , notwithstanding their watchfulness , were here always in fear of some shot from the convicts .
0	Had he fallen during the attack on his rider , or was he straying in the bush , or had the convicts carried him off ?
0	Before three in the morning they arrived at the corral .
0	It is useless to say with what enthusiasm all , especially <NAME> , received this project .
0	`` Well , my friends , '' said <NAME> , `` do you want to hear my opinion ? ''
0	270 Natives of <NAME> .
0	Just as she was about to retire she could not refrain from going up to <NAME> to say good-night .
0	In the last-named archipelago he became separated from his companions , and was discovered half dead upon the coast of <NAME> .
0	That point was reached on the 3rd of March , and thence the coast was continuously followed , as it led through what had been <NAME> , across the province of <NAME> , away to the oasis of <NAME> ; where , taking a sharp turn , it first reached a latitude of 32 degrees , and then returned again , thus forming a sort of irregular gulf , enclosed by the same unvarying border of mineral concrete .
0	The next day , at dawn , <NAME> and <NAME> , mounting the cart drawn by two onagers , took the road to the corral and set off at a round trot .
0	The narrative of the adventures of the great Genoese navigator had over-excited the minds of the hearers .
0	“ Nobody expects us , ” said <NAME> ; “ that is very certain. ” “ No , indeed , ” answered <NAME> , with a sigh ; he was manifestly disappointed that his return to <NAME> was not welcomed with a triumphal reception .
0	<NAME> kept looking at the great trees , whose branches , waving in the wind , made them seem to her like giants gesticulating wildly .
0	He was , in fact , the boatswain 's mate of the <NAME> , as his papers showed .
0	These `` Abrahamites '' are clever merchants , superstitious , however , but remarkably sincere , and never guilty of theft of any kind ; they never kill any living thing , and they worship the ox , which is a sacred animal among them .
0	Nothing could be more rudimentary .
0	“ No matter ? ” cried <NAME> , tearing his hair ; “ I ought not to have forgotten its double appellation .
0	Day and night he persevered in his astronomical pursuits , declared his intention of never abandoning his comet , and swore positively that nothing should induce him to set foot in the car of the balloon .
0	“ I declare my eyes are getting quite dull , my lips are drawn together , my laugh sticks in my throat ; I ’ m forgetting all my songs .
0	`` M. <NAME> and M. Auribeau , '' says the narrative , `` were encouraged to land by the sight of fires close to the shore .
0	“ And my mission to <NAME> .
0	Still farther away , a black spot almost invisible , already caught <NAME> ’ s eye .
0	Conscious of the superiority which his theoretical and practical knowledge and his services had earned for him above the herd of courtiers , <NAME> naturally felt more keenly than another would have done the unjust treatment he received from <NAME> with regard to certain complaints laid by the people of <NAME> against the <NAME> officers .
0	`` Let us be off , '' replied <NAME> .
0	The sailor also feared every instant that it would get loose and sink to the bottom of the sea .
0	But all depended on <NAME> ’ s success in his perilous enterprise .
0	Here our travellers passed the night , not perhaps quite so comfortably as they would have done in their berths , but without suffering too much from the feeling of suffocation experienced by other explorers .
0	“ At your service , sir , ” replied <NAME> with imperturbable gravity .
0	At this moment some of the crew told me that two or three of the Manevaï men on board had done the same thing during the last three or four days , and M. Gressien , who had been watching their movements since the morning , thought he had seen the warriors of the two tribes meet on the beach and have a long conference together .
0	<NAME> would not have mentioned it if he had not been sure , without having seen it with his own eyes . ''
0	But matters had not improved much when , towards four o'clock in the morning , the travellers found themselves on the 50th parallel , and at a distance of only about 375 miles from the lunar surface .
0	It seemed to be rising and falling beneath the successive blasts as if it were breathing ; the things which were cast out reached a great height in the air ; amid the jets of flame , torrents of lava were flowing down the side of the mountain ; here creeping between steaming rocks , there falling in cascades amid the purple vapor : and lower down a thousand streams united in one large river , which ran boiling into the sea .
0	Nevertheless , it seemed that <NAME> had foreseen everything needful for this undertaking , and that he had made the necessary studies .
0	“ Here , my child , ” he said to <NAME> , “ take this book and keep it .
0	Then <NAME> 's lamentable howling redoubled ; the poor animal called for the captain with his sad wails among the rocks .
0	The trees , belonging to the species already discovered , were magnificent .
0	It can , therefore , be well understood how injurious this seclusion in the corral must have been to the colonists .
0	exclaimed <NAME> ; `` a remarkably simple way for putting an end to the world ! ''
0	At the end of October the embassy arrived at <NAME> , a pretty town , the rajah of which was an inveterate opium-smoker .

0	One morning -- it was the 27th of August -- I was roused out of my bed by the rough voice of the innkeeper and the tremendous thumps he gave my door .
0	The vapor whirled in the air to an immeasurable height , as if the valves of an immense boiler had been suddenly opened .
0	After a moment or two of the most profound interest , it was a great gratification to all to learn that the <NAME> was on the right parallel , and only about 15 miles west of the precise spot where the Projectile had disappeared beneath the waves .
0	They offered him a room , which he accepted without ceremony , in his frank and hearty way .
0	[ Illustration : `` We made them sing . '' ]
0	I jumped into a cab at the <NAME> , and from the cab into the <NAME> , where I had booked my cabin before I left <NAME> .
0	The engineer seized the wire and found that it disappeared beneath the waves .
0	<NAME> next determined the position of the island of <NAME> ; sighted the islands of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and finally , entering the channel of <NAME> , surveyed a large number of points in the chain of islands stretching from <NAME> and <NAME> in the direction of <NAME> .
0	It is necessary , therefore , to seek for the cause of this phenomenon elsewhere .
0	We have now only to speak of <NAME> .
0	`` Such a journey , '' says Dumour in his funeral oration on D'Orbigny , `` in countries so different in their productions , climate , the character of their soil , and the manners and customs of their inhabitants , was necessarily full of ever fresh perils .
0	We must now leap over a period of forty years , to arrive at <NAME> de la Sale .

0	`` But probably <NAME> never knew the real dimensions of these craters .
0	`` You know all about it , I see . ''
0	Have you -- ” “ To whom have we the honor of speaking ? ” at last interposed <NAME> , in the coldest and most measured tone , and drawing himself up to his full height .
0	<NAME> nautical science was also necessary to achieve the discovery at the extremity of that long coast of the strait which so justly bears his name .
0	“ The captain , ” answered <NAME> .
0	“ So we shall not escape ! ” said <NAME> , between his teeth .
0	<NAME> also turned his stay at <NAME> to account by laying the foundation-stone of a monument to the memory of <NAME> .
0	The hissing of the water rent the air with a deafening sound , and the vapour , blown by the wind , fell in rain upon the sea .
0	About the 1st of November , ten days after they had set out , the caravan had gone fifty leagues to the northward .
0	Leave him to go off alone , after we ’ ve been all over the world together !
0	The Russians undertook the instruction of the <NAME> , and at the end of a few days , during which the temperature was only endurable through the absence of wind , there was not a Gallian who could not skate tolerably well , while many of them could describe figures involving the most complicated curves .
0	We now began to climb the blackish rocks , amid unforeseen stumbles , and over stones which the ice made slippery .
0	Four days afterward , on the fourth of September , the order of discharge arrived .
0	Then he set out again for <NAME> , and landed at <NAME> on the 5th of The following year , on the 19th of May , <NAME> left <NAME> at the head of a fleet composed of three vessels called the <NAME> and the <NAME> and the _Emerillon_ on board of which some gentlemen of high rank had taken passages , among whom may be named <NAME> de la <NAME> , and <NAME> de Pont-Briant , son of the <NAME> de <NAME> and cup-bearer to the <NAME> .

0	In this all <NAME> ’ s ability was shown , and he was admirably seconded by his crew .
0	I say that for _you_ , <NAME> , because <NAME> will probably not understand . ''
0	And there , in the bright moonlight , what did they see ?
0	The moon rose above the horizon .
0	If , however , the forests of <NAME> failed him with their wild beasts , agoutis , peccaries , and cabiais , the birds flew in flocks from the banks of the river and fearlessly perched on the jangada .
0	Harding also reminded his companions of the singular behaviour of <NAME> and Jup when they prowled round the mouth of the well , which placed <NAME> in communication with the sea , and he told them that he had explored the well , without discovering anything suspicious .
0	All hope would have to be given up of stopping the operation or arresting the operator .
0	There , however , lies the way to <NAME> , and it is in the midst of ponds , pools , lakes , and swamps , from which the sun draws poisonous exhalations , that the road winds , and entails upon the traveler the greatest fatigue and danger .
0	They were without news from the civilised world , lost on this island , as completely as if they had been on the most minute star of the celestial hemisphere !
0	In May , 1801 , <NAME> , still accompanied by the faithful <NAME> , embarked at <NAME> , whence he proposed going first to <NAME> de <NAME> , and then to the lofty plains of <NAME> .
0	They had not to wait long for the same night the hurricane had ceased entirely , and there was only a manageable breeze from the S. W. Preparations for sailing were instantly commenced , and at four o ’ clock in the morning the crew lifted the anchors , and got under way with fresh canvas outspread , and a wind blowing right for the <NAME> shores .
0	A fresh satellite , in the gloom of night , was shining conspicuously before them .
0	During the night of the 8th of December , <NAME> was seized by a more violent delirium .
0	He went on , though often almost despairingly , through bogs and rivers , and across mountains , till he had traversed the whole of the uninhabited part of the continent , where only a few bold travelers have ventured ; and at last , in an exhausted and all but dying condition , he reached the hospitable dwelling of <NAME> ’ Moore , where he said he had found a happy home in exchange for his labor .
0	“ Poor child ! ” he thought to himself .
0	But at last the time came when my limbs refused to carry me longer .
0	And while his fingers tattooed a slightly more audible march , he made a sign with his head to <NAME> , which signified as clearly as possible , “ Go on !
0	<NAME> , therefore , prepared a magnificent repast -- the two little peccaries , kangaroo soup , a smoked ham , stone-pine almonds , <NAME> tea ; in fact , all the best that they had , but among all the dishes figured in the first rank the savory peccaries .
0	In fact , as the fulling-mill was there , although not then in use , its beam moved with extreme power would serve to stretch out the wire by rolling it round itself .
0	`` You shall not eat it , then , '' cried <NAME> , rushing upon <NAME> , who seized his cutlass , crying , -- `` Help , <NAME> !
0	At first , it stirred up a storm of incredulity ; Dr. <NAME> passed for a purely chimerical personage of the <NAME> stamp , who , after having gone through the <NAME> , proposed to “ do ” the <NAME> .
0	`` No , '' replied the mate , `` and the proof is that the others , drifting on , are leaving it behind ! ''
0	The fragment of ice was already nearly crossed when the wind changed , and the motion of the waves in the offing began to be felt , causing the officers to agree in urging a retreat into the shelter of the ice-walls , for there was some danger if the wind freshened of the vessel being embayed against the ice and beaten to pieces by the waves and floating _débris_ .
0	A certain expression in <NAME> 's angry exclamation had struck the Captain like a shot , and set his temples throbbing violently .
0	How do we detect the existence of life ?
0	The engineer extended his hand to his companions , who pressed it warmly .

0	This king was then a child , and was called <NAME> , but he had changed his name at the death of his father <NAME> .
0	Their acquaintance with iron and its use , for which they were not indebted to <NAME> , is another proof that this people had known the <NAME> , to whom the discovery of the group is probably due .
0	The two vessels then made for <NAME> , on the coast of <NAME> , in order to allow the malady to run its course , before proceeding to the <NAME> , where they were to complete provisioning .
0	This was all his apparatus .

0	Their ears , frightfully distended , held dangling to them disks of wood and plates of gum copal .
0	“ There is some station in this desert , then , ” said <NAME> , “ and hunters too , for these are regular setters. ” Paganel was just about to recount his nocturnal experiences , when two young men appeared , mounted on horses of the most perfect breed , true “ hunters. ” The two gentlemen dressed in elegant hunting costume , stopped at the sight of the little group camping in gipsy fashion .

0	The object grew rapidly as it approached them , and by an optical illusion the projectile seemed to be throwing itself before it .
0	“ My means of ascent and descent consist simply in dilating or contracting the gas that is in the balloon by the application of different temperatures , and here is the method of obtaining that result .

0	Then he continued , — “ Now , fellow-shareholders , follow me , and let us start for the <NAME> Pole. ” And the audience rose as if to pack their baggage ready for shipboard .
0	“ What a frightful scene ! ” said <NAME> , with profound disgust .

0	How long was it ago ?
0	After an endless palaver , <NAME> declared that according to the laws and customs of the country he had a right to look upon the <NAME> and their people as his property , but that , not wishing to abuse his privileges , he would set them free in exchange for the value of twenty slaves in <NAME> merchandise .

0	These men , without exception , were all sons of the count ’ s tenants , and so tenaciously , even out at sea , did they cling to their old traditions , that it mattered little to them what physical disorganization ensued , so long as they felt they were sharing the experiences of their lord and master .
0	Upon the one side learned men , such as <NAME> , declared the discoveries made by <NAME> to be illusory , for the reason that <NAME> , and , as a matter of course , the Ten Years Siege , existed only in the imagination of the <NAME> poet ; whilst others , and principally the <NAME> portion of his critics , adopted his conclusions .

0	So saying , he extended his hand to the <NAME> , who kissed it ; for there is nothing servile in this act of respect , it being usual among the <NAME> races .
0	Mad with rage , he tore along over verst after verst with the speed of an express train , lashing his sides with his tail , seeking by the rapidity of his pace an alleviation of his torture .
0	The destruction of the brig had been a new source of riches .
0	The canoe was carried to the beach and laid on the sand before <NAME> , and the rising tide floated it .

0	The constancy of this refreshing breeze renders the climate of the river <NAME> agreeable , and even delightful. ” The <NAME> has likewise testified that if the temperature does not drop below 25 degrees <NAME> , it never rises above 33 degrees , and this gives for the year a mean temperature of from 28 degrees to 29 degrees , with a range of only 8 degrees .
0	While <NAME> , in a feverish , nervous state , repaired to the pilot-boat , the others directed their course to the police-station at <NAME> .
0	At a quarter to twelve the sun , then seen only by refraction , looked like a golden disc shedding its last rays upon this deserted continent and seas which never man had yet ploughed .
0	He accordingly began to make threatening gestures , when , to the unmitigated astonishment of himself and the captain , the animal darted forward , and in one single bound gained the summit of the rock .
0	<NAME> would not as yet accuse him of anything , unless it was that he kept near <NAME> too constantly , but he did not let him out of his sight .

0	The collation which had been taken at the commencement , called in the language of the country `` Refresco , '' had been intended only to whet the appetites of the guests for what was to follow .
0	At the moment <NAME> pronounced these words with an accent of despair , <NAME> made a step forward to run to <NAME> 's aid ; then he stopped , struggling against himself and his prejudices .
0	As to <NAME> , he retained his tarantass , which was not much the worse for its journey across the <NAME> ; and he had only to harness three good horses to it to take him swiftly over the road to <NAME> .

0	“ You see then , friend , ” he added , “ that it is a straight course .
0	If the pirates continued to attack them in this way , if they renewed their attempt to land by means of a boat , they could be destroyed one by one .
0	But before entering on the narrative of this memorable campaign , we must give a few particulars of the man who has left us the most complete account of it , <NAME> or <NAME> as he is often called in <NAME> .
0	He returned in the month of August to <NAME> ; from there he successively traversed the <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> countries , and reached his extreme limit in the east , the town of <NAME> , situated at seventeen degrees twenty minutes west longitude .
0	For a man who had never studied legislation , he had drawn up some very wise rules for the administration of justice , for the collection of taxes , the apportionment of the <NAME> , and the working of the mines .
0	It was then a quarter to four o ’ clock .
0	`` Yes , '' said <NAME> , `` there is still a great deal that <NAME> ca n't even attempt . ''
0	But a bad piece of news spread gloom on the faces of <NAME> and his comrades .
0	He accosted me as follows : `` Accept my sincere compliments , Mr .
0	Nevertheless , the calculations of J. T. <NAME> were correctly founded , and would have produced the desired results if by some inexplicable distraction they had not been nullified by an error at the outset .
0	She never hesitated for an instant as to the course she should adopt , but determined to go to <NAME> immediately , to learn the best and worst .
0	`` What we did not do , what we could not do on our first passage at the dead point , because the projectile was then endowed with too great a speed . ''
0	The captain spoke in a tone which did not admit of a reply .
0	According as we approached , the desolation of the land became more and more apparent , and the prospect of enduring six months ' wintering there would have appalled the stoutest hearts .
0	Therefore , if any representatives of animal life exist in the <NAME> , they must have taken refuge in those bottomless abysses where our eyes were unable to track them .
0	<NAME> <NAME> alone was kept awake by anxiety .
0	“ The truth , my Lord , is that we are at a standstill .
0	The course was then given north-northeast , and the corvette , wearing , steered at full steam direct for <NAME> .
0	I am talking of the <NAME> route as though it were a macadamized road , well kept , with mile-stones and `` This way to the <NAME> '' on a signpost !
0	Each utensil -- spoon , fork , knife , plate -- had a letter engraved on it , with a motto above it , of which this is an exact facsimile : The letter N was no doubt the initial of the name of the enigmatical person who commanded at the bottom of the seas .
0	The wind blowing out of <NAME> Bay she ran before it , and thus showed her owners , much to their satisfaction , that she possessed a remarkably fast pair of heels , according to <NAME> 's mode of speaking .
0	He has leopards , lynxes and fine lions trained to hunt for wild animals , eagles strong enough to chase wolves , foxes , fallow and roe-deer , and , as <NAME> says , `` often to take them too , '' and his dogs may be counted by thousands .
0	`` Do you intend , then , to increase the luminous power of the moon ? ''
0	<NAME> Nadia know who he was ?
0	Then <NAME> took his place , and did about as much ; the snow which was taken from the gallery was carried into the kitchen , where the doctor melted it at the fire , that it might take up less room .
0	They were separated one from the other , and disabled , but they succeeded in meeting together again , and by the 14th of July , the squall had carried them within sight of <NAME> .
0	The plain was furrowed in some places by fantastic winding creeks surrounded by box , and whose waters were rather temporary than permanent .
0	She received her guests none the less cordially however , and organized a little dance in spite of the remonstrances of the missionaries ; only the _fête_ had to be conducted so to speak in silence , that the noise might not reach the ears of the police on duty on the beach .
0	His gaze was fixed intently on a certain dark speck in the heavens .
0	It was on the 20th of December that all the arrangements at the corral were completed .
0	On the whole they appear to be a good sort of people , but so weak that one overlooks their faults .
0	A great fire had been lighted , and its lurid glow threw into strong relief the irregular outlines of the “ pah. ” Some of the savages were sitting round the brazier ; the others standing motionless , their black outlines relieved against the clear background of flame .
0	<NAME> , she was resigned to what <NAME> should decide .
0	`` Then , doubtless , the convicts installed themselves in the corral where they found plenty of everything , and only fled when they saw us coming .
0	They had just met for the first time at this fete in the <NAME> , of which they had been ordered to give an account in their papers .
0	On the 19th October the <NAME> passed the mouth of the <NAME> , which <NAME> had crossed near <NAME> on his first expedition , and a little later they came in sight of <NAME> .
0	They expected unforseen incidents , and new phenomena ; and nothing would have astonished them in the frame of mind they then were in .
0	<NAME> man that he was , he would not betray his captain , and perhaps he was massacred . ''
0	Independently of the increased and increasing heat , there was another very conclusive demonstration that the earth had thus suddenly approximated towards the sun .
0	wait , <NAME> ! ” exclaimed <NAME> ; “ I remember -- yes , I remember .
0	Then , what was their Projectile to become ?
0	It was indeed a position to drive the sanest man to madness !
0	`` It is an infamous shame , '' cried <NAME> , who broke out for the twentieth time .
0	This phenomenon was to be explained later , when more was known as to the direction taken by the polar current , which , issuing from <NAME> , washes the shores of <NAME> , the <NAME> , and <NAME> .
0	But <NAME> would not lose a day nor an hour in scouring the seas in which the animal had been sighted .
0	It was resolved to proceed upon the same plan as heretofore , following the boundary of the land at a safe distance .
0	am I on the <NAME> ? ''
0	I think some branches will be very useful in stopping up these openings , through which the wind shrieks like so many fiends. ” <NAME> and <NAME> left the <NAME> , and , turning the angle , they began to climb the left bank of the river .
0	A fine breeze and a fair sea , and our shirts for a sail . ''
0	If you have not earned them , that is not your fault. ” This redoubled <NAME> ’ s irritation .
0	`` Faith , '' muttered <NAME> , somewhat flurried , `` I 've seen people at <NAME> 's as lively as my new master ! ''
0	“ Who are you , my friend ? ” <NAME> asked him .
0	Nothing more until the moment when , like lightning , I saw the undaunted Captain hanging on to one of the creature 's fins , struggling , as it were , hand to hand with the monster , and dealing successive blows at his enemy , yet still unable to give a decisive one .
0	He had not let go his prey , but gently sank down with it on the ground , about ten paces from the stream .
0	But there is a wide difference between a wish and its fulfilment !
0	“ I will tell you why it seems so .
0	<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> embarked at <NAME> , on July 14th , 1678 , carrying with them about thirty men , workmen and soldiers , and a <NAME> ( monk ) , <NAME> , who accompanied them in all their voyages .
0	“ Here metals do not get rust on them by exposure to the air , nor men .
0	And if one of them -- <NAME> for example -- could have cast one glimpse into the projectile , what would he have seen ?
0	Towards evening it approached the <NAME> group , the rough summits of which I recognised the following day .
0	What became of the princess we do not hear , but on parting with <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , she bestowed on them great marks of favour .
0	Not one of the animals mentioned in the narrative was to be seen , and even the penguins which abound in the <NAME> regions had fled from this uninhabitable land .
0	“ Yes , captain , ” answered the sailor , “ the boat is empty , and all its seams are open .
0	With the first rays of the sun they saw a little island , six miles to windward of them .
0	From <NAME> to <NAME> is one hundred and fourteen degrees , or a difference in time of four hundred and fifty-six minutes .
0	If the observer had then specially directed his attention to one of the more humble and less brilliant of these stellar bodies , a star of the fourth class , that which is arrogantly called the <NAME> , all the phenomena to which the formation of the <NAME> is to be ascribed would have been successively fulfilled before his eyes .
0	Absorbed in these thoughts , it can be understood how <NAME> could remain insensible to the miseries even of her captivity .
0	“ I wonder whether these calculations were made before or after the 1st of <NAME> ; it makes all the difference , ” said <NAME> .
0	A little later , we see him exploring the river <NAME> , and advancing , in the north of the continent , to within 225 miles of <NAME> 's Bay .
0	The frightful heat caused the torture of thirst to reach the extreme limit of human endurance , and on the 1st of <NAME> , <NAME> died .
0	At this moment the reporter appeared round a rock , and <NAME> , thinking that he had not seen the jaguar , was about to rush towards him , when <NAME> signed to him to remain where he was .
0	About five o ’ clock in the evening <NAME> and his companions retraced their steps to their dwelling by traversing <NAME> ’ s <NAME> , and crossed the <NAME> on the ice-bridge .
0	About eight o'clock our mules were brought ; and we set out at last for the chalet of the Pierre-Pointue , situated at a height of six thousand five hundred feet , or three thousand above the valley of <NAME> , not far from eight thousand five hundred feet below the summit of <NAME> .
0	It is true his profession of the <NAME> faith had prevented him from taking astronomical observations , and from making sketches and notes freely , but only at the price of his seeming apostasy could he have passed through the region where the very name of a <NAME> is held in abhorrence .
0	These are problems which perhaps history may be for ever unable to solve .
0	The result , therefore , of this discovery ( a result long repudiated by the <NAME> , both father and son ) , was that the earth was considerably flattened at the poles .
0	To save trouble , we will establish our manufactory at the place of production .
0	It was to say the least very extraordinary , and they were compelled to believe that <NAME> was not or was no longer inhabited .
0	The liquefied substances soon after reached the bottom of the barrier .
0	Above them they could see the blue sky-roof , and from their position were enabled to survey the surrounding country .
0	`` Besides , '' as <NAME> observed , `` a plain is a more suitable landing place than a mountain .
0	In a moment the reporter and his two companions had crossed the corral and reached the gate of the palisade behind which <NAME> was heard growling sullenly .
0	“ You are very welcome , ” said <NAME> , bowing to the count with a smile of condescension .
0	Still , up to the 24th of January , 1779 , no important event occurred .
0	But a kind of lurid brilliancy spread over the island , against which stood out confusedly the wooded masses of the heights .
0	An hour later and the entire population of twenty-two had met in the chamber adjoining the gourbi .
0	But that will not be ! ''
0	Our aeronauts had scarcely gone a distance of fifteen miles , having expended , as on the preceding day , one hundred and thirty-five cubic feet of gas to feed the cylinder , and two pints of water out of the remaining eight had been sacrificed to the demands of intense thirst .
0	It is the very same , ” repeated the doctor , exultingly .
0	Some readers saw in it only one of those prodigious outbursts of <NAME> humbug , which would exceed the limits of puffism if the depths of human credulity were not unfathomable .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> started for <NAME> , a large Fellatah town on the west of <NAME> , on the 14th of December , 1823 , followed the <NAME> as far as <NAME> , and visited the ruins of <NAME> , and those of <NAME> , on the shores of a lake formed by the overflowing of the <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> , all towns of <NAME> .
0	`` <NAME> , you could not remain in <NAME> , and your safety could only be assured by bringing you to such a distance that your persecutors could not take you . ''
0	`` You 're as wrong now as you thought you were right yesterday . ''
0	After traveling fully half a <NAME> mile , we had met neither a farmer at the door of his hut , nor even a wandering shepherd with his wild and savage flock .
0	I should not feel safe with you , especially as I share your cabin .
0	We embraced each other heartily .
0	He took part in the expedition sent by <NAME> about 1510 , to seek for the famous Spice Islands , under the command of <NAME> de <NAME> and of <NAME> , which discovered <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
0	He would have been thrown to the beasts .
0	So it remained prudently below .
0	He met with no misadventure and found no suspicious traces .
0	Hearing that <NAME> was looking for a servant , and that his life was one of unbroken regularity , that he neither travelled nor stayed from home overnight , he felt sure that this would be the place he was after .
0	And to whom do you owe this , but to the good boatswain who did his best for you , and did not boast overmuch of his influence ? ''
0	However , before returning to the dockyard , <NAME> conceived the idea of fabricating certain machines , which greatly excited the curiosity of his companions .
0	They were mimosas , figs , hibisci , and palm trees , mingled together in profusion ; and under the shelter of their verdant vault grew orchids , leguminous plants , and ferns .
0	`` Because we make their skins into drum heads ! ''
0	To give body and existence to such new sensations would have required the coinage of new words -- and here my feeble brain found itself wholly at fault .
0	This would be a very serious charge .
0	This cry came from the summit of the moving mountain , and <NAME> was revealed to our sight , standing on the outermost block , his hand stretched towards the north .
0	<NAME> , compelled to wait till nightfall , in order to pass the fortifications , but not desiring to show himself , remained in the posting-house , and there partook of food .
0	he cried , as soon as he had recovered the use of his speech , `` after we had once passed <NAME> , the needle of this compass pointed to the southward instead of the northward . ''
0	<NAME> and <NAME> , during this time , had gone to fetch the boat , moored a few hundred feet higher up , on the bank of the <NAME> , and by the time they returned , <NAME> was ready to start .
0	The <NAME> , rightly enough , had continued to occupy the fragment of <NAME> , and their claim was indisputable .
0	We had already reached the 25th June .
0	We made a brief pause at the place where <NAME> and <NAME> seized upon the boat which bore them towards higher latitudes , even to that horizon of dark vapour whose rents permitted them to discern the huge human figure , the white giant .
0	Then <NAME> , having taken his measures with consummate prudence , and the surprise and terror of a nocturnal attack which he organized compensating for the inferiority of his troops , he made prisoners of his enemy and all his soldiers , his own loss amounting to but two men .
0	`` You must be right , <NAME> , '' was my reply , `` for I feel as if I could do justice to any meal you could put before me . ''
0	“ Yes , that the <NAME> should leave <NAME> , and go to the east coast. ” “ Oh , always the same story !
0	He was about to make an exclamation of surprise when he saw the young girl lay her finger on her lips .
0	They put him in irons .
0	That thick , dismal savage blackness , which <NAME> 's pen is so fond of occasionally revelling in , surrounded them on all sides and crushed them like an iron shroud .
0	It was the hand of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> hams , slices of salt beef , smoked salmon , oat cakes , and barley meal scones ; tea _ad libitum_ , and whisky in abundance , and several bottles of port , composed this astonishing meal .
0	Did the neighborhood of some mysterious body retain it firmly imbedded in ether ?
0	Her ebony brows have the form and charm of the bow of <NAME> , the god of love , and beneath her long silken lashes the purest reflections and a celestial light swim , as in the sacred lakes of <NAME> , in the black pupils of her great clear eyes .
0	`` Well , I hope he 'll never know them ! ''
0	When the folly as well as the uselessness of the adventure was pointed out to him , he contented himself with replying , `` If the thing is feasible , the first to do it ought to be an Englishman . ''
0	There was no land within 100 miles .
0	Apparently the natives thought the victim in the wrong , for they continued to frequent the market with their former confidence .
0	`` And when does the next train pass here ? ''
0	The journey was resumed at six in the morning ; the guide hoped to reach <NAME> by evening .
0	The <NAME> left in exchange hatchets and toys which were carried off to the forest with many delighted gestures .
0	`` Yes , <NAME> , and you know he is not given to vain imaginations . ''
0	It took a whole day to put all these matters in order .
0	One is involuntarily reminded of the famous inscription on the gate of the <NAME> of <NAME> -- `` 'Lasciate ogni speranza , voi ch ' entrate . ' ''
0	The heavens had remained wonderfully clear .
0	The hydrogen passed into a huge central cask , after having been washed on the way , and thence into each balloon by the conduit-pipes .
0	`` Not for a moment ; for what is true of the eastern coast of <NAME> is not true of the western coast , which has a higher temperature .
0	In fact , as regards practical effect , the transit described by the ball ought to be as extended as possible , and this tension could only be obtained under the condition that the projectile should be impelled with a very great initial velocity .
0	The gulf has become a lake , but it is also an abyss , and no lead-line has yet sounded its depths .
0	It had made itself master of <NAME> , and subjected that territory to the laws of the <NAME> , after imprisoning <NAME> on a charge of rebellion and polygamy .
0	“ We must get rid of the cylinder-chests , the spiral , and the <NAME> battery .
0	But , <NAME> , will you tell me , once for all , what there is so remarkable about the Pole ? ''
0	Were his two companions thinking of their trip through those unknown regions ?
0	Feofar-Khan , including his own soldiers , and those of the <NAME> of <NAME> and Koun-douze , had now under his command two hundred and fifty thousand men , to which the <NAME> government could not as yet oppose a sufficient force .
0	`` We must let him alone ! ''
0	`` But let them at least give me back my shoes ! ''
0	<NAME> <NAME> made his appearance ; anger shone in his eyes , and with him was <NAME> , quite unmoved .
0	Does not its parallelism with the mountain chain suggest a causative relation ?
0	<NAME> , an optimist by nature , found everything agreeable , and as by chance both lodging and food were to his taste , he jotted down in his book some memoranda particularly favorable to the town of Nijni-Novgorod .
0	Her smoke was lost in the morning mist .
0	<NAME> rushed towards the schooner , hoisted himself on board by means of a rope hanging over the bows , and gained the hatch which gives access to that part of the hold .
0	“ But he is not an ape , ” answered <NAME> .
0	“ What is there , <NAME> ? ” he asked .
0	It was simply two glasses which he had taken from his own and the reporter ’ s watches .
0	`` Nothing , except to note the progress of the phenomenon .
0	It might be , indeed , that their only intention was to obtain fresh water from the <NAME> , and it was not impossible that the bridge , thrown across a mile and a half from the mouth , and the manufactory at the <NAME> might escape their notice .
0	The admiral , accused of high treason , was placed with his two brothers on board a vessel bound for <NAME> , under the command of <NAME> de <NAME> .
0	This officer , after attaining the highest rank in the military marine service , had been entrusted with an important command in <NAME> , and had assisted in the capture of <NAME> .
0	The lieutenant urged that he was the most experienced seaman , and as such was best qualified to take command of the sledge and the management of the sails ; and as it was not to be expected that <NAME> would resign his intention of going in person to relieve his fellow-countryman , <NAME> submitted his own wishes to the count .
0	Who could have told that such a hurricane had been let loose on the surface of that ocean ?
0	Scarcely had the last vessels of the squadron filed through the strait , than a series of heavy gales , squalls , and storms , caused the oldest sailors to vow that all they had hitherto known of tempests were nothing in comparison .
0	`` Did you expect to get on a passing whale-ship ? ''
0	The sea became more and more boisterous .
0	The latter , all the while swearing that he would not go , went on board with a regular arsenal of hunting weapons , among which were two double-barrelled breech-loading fowling-pieces , and a rifle that had withstood every test , of the make of <NAME> , <NAME> & <NAME> , at <NAME> .
0	Its skin , chestnut-brown above and silvery underneath , would have made one of those beautiful furs so sought after in the <NAME> and <NAME> markets : the fineness and the lustre of its coat would certainly fetch <NAME> .
0	It seemed to be of a slimy consistency , as if it had been made of mineral oil .
0	`` Excellent , my dear <NAME> ; only permit me to offer one remark : My wish is to tell my story once for all , to everybody , and then have done with it ; then there will be no need for recapitulation .
0	There are no large caravans constantly arriving in it , as at <NAME> ; nor are there so many strangers there as in the latter town ; whilst the market , held at three o'clock in the morning on account of the heat , appears deserted .
0	It would be a terrible journey .
0	This elicited loud applause , in the midst of which the orchestra was just striking up a deafening air , when the pyramid tottered , the balance was lost , one of the lower noses vanished from the pyramid , and the human monument was shattered like a castle built of cards !
0	`` One to <NAME> , for instance . ''
0	The doctor called the attention of his friends to the fact that these animals began to lose their white winter plumage , or hair , to put on their summer dress ; they were evidently getting ready for summer , while their sustenance appeared in the form of moss , poppy , saxifrage , and thin grass .
0	In the midst of this sterility , the rudimental carcass of the <NAME> appeared in ridges of sharply-jutting rock .
0	The advertisement , it will have been noticed , assumed the principle that regions not known geographically and belonging to nobody in particular belonged to the world at large .
0	The drops of water , dried by evaporation , no longer sparkled on the walls .
0	`` Then it entirely depends on you to give me a passage ? ''
0	He is well known in all the <NAME> .
0	At the village of <NAME> , the poppy is largely cultivated for the preparation of opium ; here , owing probably , to the bad quality of the water , all the peasants suffer from wens .
0	The population of this group , if we accept D'Urville 's account , form a kind of transition between the copper-coloured , or the <NAME> , and the black or <NAME> races .
0	And the girdle of reeds which encircles them through which a pirogue can with difficulty make its way !
0	Words are impotent to relate such wonders !
0	“ What a magnificent beast ! ” cried <NAME> .
0	`` Let us try to clear this mass of snow away , '' replied the captain .
0	`` You must be mistaken , <NAME> . ''
0	A quantity of dry leaves , mixed with sulphur , he lit with a spark from his flint , and he began to smoke out the bees .
0	`` May God keep him safe from all harm , '' was the utterance of many that day .
0	Now , for the first time , <NAME> felt herself borne along with a gliding movement , like that of a balloon through the air .
0	His knowledge of history and literature , judging from his letters , appears to have been somewhat vague and ill-digested .
0	“ May I be allowed to ask , <NAME> , to what I am indebted for the honor of this visit ? ” asked <NAME> presently .
0	`` See the shadows of those peaks ! ''
0	The doctor knew that the word <NAME> meant `` eater of raw fish '' ; but he knew too that this name is considered an insult in this country , so he forbore giving it to the inhabitants of <NAME> .
0	But as they had not one he would have to supply the deficiency .
0	The large ones , which are a very great trouble to build , and which are kept in sheds constructed specially for them , are twenty-six feet long , two and a half wide , and four deep .
0	<NAME> tools and , above all , guns were eagerly sought for by the islanders in exchange for their provisions ; and the mercenery traders , regardless of consequences , readily gratified their desires .
0	There is a constant emission of light from the storm clouds ; the electric matter is incessantly released ; evidently the gaseous principles of the air are out of order ; innumerable columns of water rush up like waterspouts , and fall back upon the surface of the ocean in foam .
0	The <NAME> was once again in motion , and both the doctor and <NAME> awoke .
0	At daybreak the next morning the watch saw a sail ; it was the <NAME> , a <NAME> corvette , sailing towards the <NAME> , bound to <NAME> .
0	A difficulty about this , however , presented itself .
0	<NAME> followed the most minute details upon the chart traced by <NAME> himself , and was enabled to recognize its perfect accuracy .
0	Upon the 25th of <NAME> started for <NAME> , a very small town near the <NAME> frontier .
0	Supposing we had succeeded in reaching the southern and distant shores of this extraordinary sea , what would have become of us ?
0	<NAME> hastened the fitting out of the ship with all his energy , all the more because , according to his opinion , <NAME> had not perhaps made every effort possible to find the castaways , although he was excusable from the responsibility which weighed upon him as captain .
0	Suppose the brave fellow should take it into his head that we have abandoned him ? ” “ He !
0	All sails were now hoisted , and at noon the <NAME> was within forty-five miles of <NAME> .
0	Therefore , I must find her again at any cost .
0	After laying their eggs they cover them with a bed of sand , which they beat down with their carapaces as if they were rammers .
0	`` I would n't give up my four thousand of the bet , '' said <NAME> , as he took his seat , `` for three thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine . ''
0	While we were all giving way to the delights of new-found pleasures , a little child appeared between two tufted olive trees .
0	He had returned to <NAME> , and made a fortune , and was now planting cabbages in his retirement , if the best-informed reporters were to be believed .
0	`` He has been your son for thirty years , '' answered the young girl , laughing , `` and he has only been my betrothed for two ! ''
0	The meal over , she offered me tea so pleasantly that I was quite puzzled whether to admire the dinner or my charming hostess the most .
0	Some large stones , found at the north of the lake , could be easily transformed into millstones ; and as to the sails , the inexhaustible case of the balloon furnished the necessary material .
0	That coffer yonder contains diamonds of the value of many millions , most of them mementoes of the time when , husband and father , I thought happiness possible for me , and a collection of pearls gathered by my friends and myself in the depths of the ocean .
0	The professor kept muttering in incoherent phrases : “ Rascal !
0	to-morrow we will go and hunt the bear . ''
0	Our occupation continued on the 8th , 9th , and 10th February , and our task was finished in the afternoon of the 10th .
0	<NAME> dismounted , and his escort cleared a large circle round him .
0	“ Let us embark now , ” said <NAME> .
0	He first reached the small kingdom of <NAME> , the capital of which , <NAME> , comprises a thousand houses .
0	“ What do you ask ? ” replied <NAME> .
0	The engineer opened the gate , and seeing smoke a hundred feet off in the wood , he fired in that direction .
0	The crossing would have been made without great difficulty , even on this imperfect apparatus , had the current been regular ; but , unfortunately , there were whirlpools in numbers , and soon the kibitka , notwithstanding all <NAME> ’ s efforts , was irresistibly drawn into one of these .
0	You will see that the area is approximately four hundred and seven thousand square miles .
0	“ Ah , doctor ! ” said <NAME> again , with a deep sigh , “ I ’ ll think more than once of my lumps of solid gold-ore !
0	`` Why , Mr <NAME> , '' replied the sailor , `` they would only have to start in the night with a good breeze , and they would be out of sight of the island in two hours . ''
0	ten-millionths of an inch in width ! ''
0	But what sort of a sailor are you ? ” “ Everyone can be a sailor when he must , ” said <NAME> calmly .
0	The eighty miles between <NAME> and <NAME> were traversed in six days .
0	Whatever might be our ultimate decision , we could not do better than place our material and install ourselves in this opportune shelter .
0	`` A splendid fellow , '' said my uncle ; `` only he little suspects the marvelous part he is about to play in the history of the world . ''
0	They then presented the new comers with pieces of dried wood which they had lighted ; and appeared to invite them to set fire to the pile .
0	`` Let me tell you you are wrong , <NAME> ; for the well-being of all is at stake , and the captain 's imprudence may cost us all dear . ''
0	To the south -- if south , in this inverted order of things , it might still be called -- the face of the country also appeared unaltered , and some leagues away , the peaks of the <NAME> mountains still retained their accustomed outline .
0	The card-board thus prepared is cut into various thicknesses according to the value of the money it is supposed to represent .
0	He had taken thirty days to cross <NAME> , the <NAME> , the <NAME> , and the <NAME> plains , giving the <NAME> ample time to double <NAME> , and arrive on the opposite side .
0	He uttered this word so sharply that each one obeyed , and the sledge resumed its monotonous progress .
0	It ran far from smoothly on its worn runners ; it became harder and harder to drag it ; their path grew more difficult ; the land was of volcanic origin , and all cut up with craters ; the travellers had been compelled gradually to ascend fifteen hundred feet to reach the top of the mountains .
0	on the sum that might be recovered .
0	It presented a most animated appearance .
0	Naturally the doctor wanted to preserve a memorial of the famous mountain , and he made a very successful sketch of it .
0	`` Pen is right , '' said <NAME> ; `` it 's tempting Providence . ''
0	This done and a fresh stock of provisions having been laid in , he resumed his voyage .
0	The fifteen hundred miles was the extent of the frontier which separates colonized <NAME> from the various <NAME> tribes .
0	From time immemorial <NAME> had never come out except at meal times , and when he went to regulate the different clocks of the town .
0	During the day the different articles were carried to <NAME> , where they were methodically arranged in the great hall .
0	Two days later we were not far from the coast of <NAME> , somewhere near what <NAME> sailors call <NAME> , and then the < i > <NAME> < /i > stretched out direct for the <NAME> , between <NAME> and <NAME> .
0	After several delays , caused by the desire of the <NAME> Company to make <NAME> give them a testimonial as to the treatment he had met with from the government of <NAME> , and which he steadily refused , <NAME> at last obtained permission to repair his vessel .
0	It was only made for two persons , without counting the iemschik , who kept his equilibrium on his narrow seat in a marvelous manner .
0	They were therefore , of modern make , easily used , and of terrible effect .
0	But what can be the meaning , ” he added seriously , “ of all this displacement of the heavenly bodies ? ” “ What is that great building at <NAME> , captain , with a top like a cap ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	The <NAME> , having passed the outer belt of rocks by a narrow strait , found itself among breakers where the sea was from thirty to forty fathoms deep .
0	Although his character was independent enough , he was always loyal to the requirements of <NAME> , which is law among the Polytechnicians in all that concerns comradeship and respect for the uniform .
0	This was a very grave dereliction from the instructions which ordered him to survey <NAME> , but the fact of forty sailors being _hors de combat_ and on the sick-list , will suffice to prove how foolish it would have been to make so perilous an attempt .
0	`` My dear boy , '' continued the grim Professor , clasping me to his heart , `` you are saved ! ''
0	He was a good draughtsman , an excellent rider -- having thoroughly mastered the successor to the famous “ <NAME> ” at the riding-school of <NAME> Cyr -- and in the records of his military service his name had several times been included in the order of the day .
0	The engineer then made known to his companions the proposal which had been made to him , and it was agreed that they should build a wooden house at the corral , which they would make as comfortable as possible .
0	When , therefore , the <NAME> government decided , in 1823 , to send reinforcements to Kamtchatka to put an end to the contraband trade carried on in <NAME> , the command of the expedition was given to <NAME> .
0	The thick window inserted in the bottom could bear any amount of weight , and <NAME> and his companions walked upon it as if it were solid plank ; but the sun striking it directly with its rays lit the interior of the projectile from beneath , thus producing singular effects of light .
0	This kindness tended to attach the natives to the admiral , and from that day they came in numbers round the caravels ; their king came with them , a strong , vigorous , and somewhat stout young man of twenty years of age ; he was naked , like his subjects of both sexes , who showed him much respect , but with no appearance of servility .
0	Looking at it only from the side of <NAME> 's own interests , he evidently committed in this a gross blunder , of which he was soon to repent ; but if we consider , what we should never lose sight of , the interest of the country , he had already committed a capital crime in the acts of aggression of which he had been guilty , and in kindling civil war in face of an enemy quite ready to take advantage of it .
0	He went upon the stage , and took his place beside the rest who were to compose the base of the <NAME> of <NAME> .
0	A malignant fever does not declare itself spontaneously ; its germ must previously have existed. ” “ I am not mistaken , ” replied the reporter .
0	There , everyone was lying asleep , not only on the benches , but also on the bales , packages , and even the deck itself .
0	“ I will attempt anything that is desired , <NAME> , ” answered the sailor , “ and you know well that I am not a man to flinch ! ” “ Remember , besides , that we number another sailor amongst us now , ” remarked <NAME> .
0	He only waited to conclude a treaty of alliance with them , before continuing his voyage southward .
0	And off he scampered like a young cat into the depths of the foliage , followed by his friend <NAME> .
0	That worthy fellow persisted in seeing in the <NAME> of the Nautilus one of those unknown _savants_ who return mankind contempt for indifference .
0	[ Illustration ] During the night a favorable breeze carried them well to the north , and soon the lofty mountains of <NAME> were peering above the horizon ; <NAME> , where the governor of the <NAME> settlements lived , was left on the right .
0	He would listen to nothing , and got up in a very bad temper .
0	And hatchet in hand , he was about to cleave the head of the animal , when <NAME> seized his arm , saying , -- `` Spare him , <NAME> . ''
0	laughed one of the group .
0	to prove that it is all over between you , accept frankly the proposal I am going to make to you . ''
0	But at least there remained Mrs. Scorbitt !
0	`` Detestable indeed , and one that does not suit a boat like the <NAME> . ''
0	A few minutes more were all that the doomed man had to live !
0	But , perhaps , he was wrong not to follow the watercourse , as he and <NAME> had done on their first excursion , for after walking an hour not a creature had shown itself .
0	After being carried off by the <NAME> scouts on the <NAME> , <NAME> had been taken to <NAME> .
0	On this island were a number of mountains of conical form with the base very large .
0	`` But they did not know what they should put them in to carry them .
0	This was why <NAME> was in command instead of <NAME> ; why the captain was a prisoner in his cabin ; and why , in short , the <NAME> was directing her course towards <NAME> .
0	Even the great mountain profiles began to fade away , the dazzling colors to grow duller , the jet black shadows greyer , and the general effect mistier .
0	`` Unfortunately , '' said <NAME> , `` they have only given us the ship 's fare . ''
0	But if their works were to require a foundry capable of casting a gun a million times larger than a four hundred pounder , and a projectile weighing one hundred and eighty thousand tons , they would want thousands of workmen ; and where , oh !
0	<NAME> alone , it was clear , had brought <NAME> Proctor on this train ; but there he was , and it was necessary , at all hazards , that <NAME> should not perceive his adversary .
0	This was how it stood proof against the shock of the mighty billow .
0	They all ate heartily , but talked more than they ate , eagerly asking <NAME> questions about the wonders of the country they were just beginning to traverse .
0	He turned , and was stupefied .
0	This was in fact what most of the navigators of the nineteenth century had to do , the progress of science enabling them to complete what had been begun by others .
0	Kai-Koumou treated him with a certain tone of respect , and by the fineness of his tattoo , it was easy to perceive that Kara-Tete held a lofty position in the tribe , but a keen observer would have guessed the feeling of rivalry that existed between these two chiefs .
0	“ Yes , I would. ” “ Well , you would have done wrong in a zoological point of view , ” returned <NAME> .
0	It was evidently the cue of both sides to be silent .
0	229 Portrait of <NAME> .
0	`` Are we falling or are we not ? ''
0	He knows well that it would risk the brig , if the sea got up ever so little !
0	As they climbed they were astonished to perceive every few moments a kind of vibration in the soil .
0	In dwelling on <NAME> 's voyages , we have , for the time , turned aside from those made at the same time by <NAME> , whose extraordinary exploration of <NAME> 's <NAME> had brought upon him the censure of the <NAME> , and who was anxious to regain his reputation for skill and courage .
0	But the balloon did not budge .
0	He , therefore , begged them not to be disturbed by her presence , but to take advantage of it to make known all their wants and longings .
0	The way the natives treated them would answer that question .
0	`` And we will save him , '' replied the sailor .
0	He was one of those originals which nature sometimes invents in the freak of a moment , and of which she then breaks the mould .
0	Do you know , my friends , that a curious establishment might be founded with rooms of oxygen , where people whose system is weakened could for a few hours live a more active life .
0	are we not as much so as you ?
0	The requisite precautions were taken for the night , and <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> undertook in turn to keep watch until sunrise .
0	But we must n't fall asleep in the delights of <NAME> , and we 'd better start out again . ''
0	But J. T. <NAME> would not hear of going away .
0	“ <NAME> could not have depicted yon mountains in a more appalling aspect. ” “ Faith ! ” said <NAME> , “ I wouldn ’ t like to be strolling alone in the evening through this country of ghosts .
0	Something appeared , startled by my noise .
0	Except the thirteen Englishmen who had been left at <NAME> , every living creature had taken refuge in the dark abyss of the volcano ’ s crater .
0	At eight o'clock the day appeared far enough advanced for the reconnaissance to be made under favourable conditions .
0	`` A febrifuge , '' answered the engineer .
0	Below , it is <NAME> , and takes the name of the <NAME> .
0	This is the way they began : ‘ Come in !
0	To understand fully the sufferings of this race thus odiously persecuted , the touching and horrible narrative of <NAME> must be read , himself the indefatigable defender of the <NAME> .
0	`` But what would you do ? ''
0	It is so important , you know , so all important ; the difference of one half minute , you know , would so certainly mar the expectation of reunion with the earth -- ” And seeing a cloud gathering on <NAME> ’ s face , he added : “ I am sure <NAME> would be only too happy to render you any assistance in the revision. ” “ Sir , ” said the professor , bridling up , “ I want no assistant ; my calculations want no revision .
0	At what velocity was the Projectile now moving ?
0	They noted the direction , outlet and inclination of the paths .
0	They were allowed to do it in their own way .
0	On the whole surface of our Earth , there is no mountain even remotely resembling it .
0	The apparatus had been placed at one of the windows of the dining-room at <NAME> , and consequently overlooked the shore and the bay .
0	The Government of <NAME> was monarchical ; at first the imperial power had been carefully limited , but it had increased with the various conquests , and had become despotic .
0	He himself had not only collected much valuable information on the geology and botany of <NAME> and <NAME> , but also drawn up a vocabulary of the languages of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
0	It was consequently impossible to cast anchor , or to use the capstan .
0	The night was beautiful and still , the darkness was not yet deep .
0	The roll of distant thunder was heard .
0	For the first time the long line of coast which forms the peninsula of <NAME> , the <NAME> of <NAME> , and the base of the Gulf of <NAME> , had been explored continuously from cape to cape .
0	lat. , the <NAME> floated on the surface of the sea , approaching the <NAME> coast .
0	The soda , which it was easy to change into carbonate of soda , and the chlorine , of which he made chloride of lime , were employed for various domestic purposes , and especially in bleaching linen .
0	Yes -- it was all a dream .
0	Yes , sir ! ” replied <NAME> quickly .
0	He made no objection to the signal given by the others to return ; he even helped to cut the ropes by which the cannon balls had been attached .
0	He knows us too well for that .
0	it is not a thing of yesterday , ” said <NAME> .
0	He was accordingly hung up by the heels , whereupon he soon regained his senses , and the next day was completely restored .
0	He did not like to abandon it !
0	Certainly , if any thing could have surprised him , this <NAME> would , for he had never seen the stranger in his life before .
0	Under the influence of hunger this reasoning appeared admirable .
0	His boats arrived at <NAME> , explored on the previous trip , on the 7th August ; and on the 1st September they got back to <NAME> , without having sustained any damage .
0	But I made them observe that we should be obliged to direct our course contrary to wind and current ; our schooner herself could hardly have succeeded in doing this .
0	But their searches were vain , and during the half of that day they sought to no purpose among the thickets of trees which covered the islet .
0	It was in the section included between this range and the <NAME> that the <NAME> engineers found the most formidable difficulties in laying the road , and that the government granted a subsidy of forty-eight thousand dollars per mile , instead of sixteen thousand allowed for the work done on the plains .
0	Its very memory , even now , makes my soul shudder , and my blood run cold .
0	You see nothing but difficulties and obstacles .
0	Is it not natural , after all , for the heart to be assailed by a thousand apprehensions as we near the end of any enterprise ?
0	Dr. <NAME> carefully noted the fact , that he had stopped at four degrees north latitude and seventeen degrees west longitude .
0	This courageous woman made heroic efforts to restrain herself , lest she should disturb <NAME> ’ s coolness .
0	“ Then , doubtless , the convicts installed themselves in the corral where they found plenty of everything , and only fled when they saw us coming .
0	This parlour was the principal apartment of the burgomaster 's house , which was one of the pleasantest in <NAME> .
0	He drew it towards him .
0	The appearance of the town was already semi-European , stone houses replaced the primitive native huts , regular streets with shops , café , public-houses , much patronized by the sailors of whalers and fur-traders , together with a fortress provided with cannon , were the most noteworthy signs of the rapid transformation of the manners and customs of the natives .
0	“ Nothing. ” “ Have patience. ” “ Is the time approaching when you will force the old woman to speak ? ” “ It is approaching , Sangarre. ” “ When will the old woman speak ? ” “ When we reach Tomsk. ” “ And we shall be there -- ” “ In three days. ” A strange gleam shot from <NAME> ’ s great black eyes , and she retired with a calm step .
0	To such a bargain the <NAME> officer was unwilling to agree without the consent of his commander ; so he begged the <NAME> captain to sail for <NAME> .
0	The crew could go no farther .
0	<NAME> as he was , he did not stop to see as he wrote if the assemblage of letters made intelligible words .
0	Anatomically , it is distinguished from the white whale and the <NAME> whale by the seven cervical vertebrae , and it has two more ribs than its congeners .
0	In the corral , the flock of musmons had also increased , and several lambs already bleated in the sheds , to the great delight of <NAME> and <NAME> , who had each their favorite among these newcomers .
0	And the sailor , seizing <NAME> by the arm , dragged him behind a rock , just as a magnificent animal showed itself at the entrance of the cavern .
0	She clung to her father with a frightened motion .
0	These poor cetaceans have been so hunted that they have become very rare in the <NAME> and its affluents , and so little time is left them to grow that the giants of the species do not now exceed seven feet .
0	I exclaimed , unable to repress a gesture of incredulity .
0	Why should he present himself at the <NAME> ?
0	“ Very likely he may have met with the fate of <NAME> ’ s abstracted astronomer , who found himself at the bottom of a well. ” “ Ay ; but where _is_ that well ? ” demanded the captain .
0	The <NAME> , as he was called in <NAME> , had two natives called <NAME> , and a boy about twelve years of age under him .
0	For a moment neither of us spoke .
0	The boatswain was inclined to oppose us .
0	The Government house is pleasantly situated on the shores of the bay , and will be greatly improved in a few years if the young trees planted about it thrive .
0	The granite , worn by the water for an infinite time , was very slippery , and falls were to be dreaded .
0	`` But -- in short -- this purchase of wood -- '' `` And you shall be at the wedding , '' replied <NAME> , interrupting the merchant , and shaking his hand as if he would crush it .
0	The two great barrels , hermetically sealed , but which sounded hollow and empty , were fastened to its sides by strong ropes , knotted with a skill which <NAME> directly pronounced sailors alone could exhibit .
0	They were delirious with joy .
0	`` You are <NAME> , I suppose ? ''
0	He was full of animation , well proportioned in all parts of his bodily mechanism , with quicksilver in his veins , and a most elastic step .
0	<NAME> motioned to his companion to be silent and to halt .
0	The jangada then glided along the black waters of the <NAME> , as they mingled with the white stream of the <NAME> .
0	`` Nothing easier , '' said I , pulling out my notebook and pencil .
0	Who this beneficent stranger is , whose intervention has , so fortunately for us , been manifested on many occasions , I can not imagine .
0	<NAME> was the commencement of the Anglo-Russian Company .
0	He felt within him the sacred fire of genius , he worked on unceasingly , he visited influential persons , spreading his ideas and defending them , and combating all objections with the most heroic energy .
0	<NAME> not <NAME> bought from <NAME> in 1803 at the price of sixteen million dollars ? ''
0	All those brought by our traveller were quickly bought up .
0	His curiosity as a naturalist overcame his hunger as a traveler .
0	And he does n't spare the money on the way , either : he has offered a large reward to the engineer of the <NAME> if he gets us to <NAME> well in advance of time . ''
0	The name of <NAME> <NAME> was at that time well known .
0	By a kind of optical illusion it appeared as though the raft was motionless between two moving pathways .
0	When at last I came back to a sense of life and being , my face was wet , but wet , as I soon knew , with tears .
0	our iceberg will end by raising its anchor , '' replied <NAME> .
0	They appeared neither vexed nor alarmed when we shot birds .
0	`` Do not be afraid , '' said the unknown .
0	The artillery was composed of the old culverin of the château , taken in 1339 at the attack on <NAME> , one of the first occasions of the use of cannon in history , and which had not been fired off for five centuries .
0	The Ister or <NAME> , the <NAME> or <NAME> , the <NAME> , or <NAME> ; and he finishes by relating how the alliance , and afterwards the union between the Scythians and <NAME> took place , which explains the reason why the young women of that country are not allowed to marry before they have killed an enemy and established their character for valour .
0	For myself , I was not particularly sorry .
0	At the end of 1819 they left <NAME> with a few companions , and entered the <NAME> desert .
0	The rooms had now only to be furnished , and this would be work for the long winter days .
0	A quarter of an hour after , <NAME> said to <NAME> , -- `` 'The barometer ? '
0	<NAME> was evidently preoccupied , and frequently turned , trying to catch , either some distant noise , or remote glimmer of light .
0	The last gleams of twilight were melting into night .
0	Its breath is pure and healthy .
0	The country was still barren , and looking as if no living being had ever set foot in it .
0	There was not a variation in the surface of the soil , not a hillock of sand , not a pebble , to relieve the gaze .
0	`` The experiment will be made on a large scale , and will be decisive . ''
0	Hans with his usual imperturbable calm remained at the helm .
0	<NAME> was destined almost entirely to carry out this detailed plan , only the survey of the western coast of <NAME> and of the <NAME> of <NAME> , with that of the channel closing the <NAME> , could not be accomplished by the <NAME> navigator , who had , sorely against his will , to leave the completion of this important task to his successors .
0	They were reduced to mere conjecture .
0	<NAME> had , as has been said , taken his seat on the raft , when he felt a hand laid on his arm .
0	<NAME> could only obtain very vague information of their ceremonies and religion .
0	He penetrated a little further north than the <NAME> , and into <NAME> a good deal further east than <NAME> .
0	We bought the various articles indispensable to a journey across the glaciers .
0	He made several attempts to cross the frozen ocean on a sledge , but was always turned back by ice which would not bear him .
0	He never could have imagined that <NAME> was being tracked as a robber around the globe .
0	What cares were lavished on him to bring him back to life !
0	And we used to think him as useless as a rotten keel ! ''
0	“ The courier ? ” inquired the Czar eagerly .
0	“ But how ? ” “ That I do not know , ” answered <NAME> , “ but we shall manage it. ” And now everybody wanted to know about their friend ’ s adventures .
0	I count on you , Pencroft. ” “ No , <NAME> , ” replied the sailor ; “ I have the rigging of the vessel to finish and to look after , and you will have to do without me. ” “ And you , <NAME> ? ” “ I must go to the corral to-morrow , <NAME> , ” replied the lad .
0	This led the sailor to repeat to the engineer , -- “ You see , captain , so long as we have not one or two fowling-pieces , we shall never get anything ! ” “ Doubtless , <NAME> , ” replied the reporter , “ but it depends on you .
0	What <NAME> felt when he overheard this fragment of conversation may be understood when it is known that in this <NAME> he recognised one of his old <NAME> companions , a daring sailor , who had continued his criminal career .
0	The news of the taking of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , successively reached <NAME> .
0	Have you any material proof ? ” “ Perhaps I have , ” answered <NAME> .
0	`` <NAME> , '' said <NAME> , `` you will lower the launch and send six men to bring coal aboard . ''
0	The last supplies of the sledge , a little biscuit and some hot tea , gave them some comfort .
0	Once in a while they could descry a caravan resting in a “ kraal , ” awaiting the freshness and cool of the evening to resume its route .
0	“ <NAME> , ” asked <NAME> , a few days later , “ do you think all this could have happened if <NAME> had been still alive ? ” “ <NAME> , <NAME> , ” answered <NAME> .
0	`` Do you not understand , '' he replied , `` that this congelation of water will help us ?
0	And herein what a strange succession of different events all tending to the same end .
0	The warmest partisans of the enterprise now became its most ardent detractors .
0	At this place the wall appeared to have been separated by some violent subterranean force .
0	Their hair was black and not woolly , and was cut short ; some wore it plaited , some curled .
0	`` Let us continue , '' resumed the engineer .
0	In a few words he explained it .
0	<NAME> was so abundant that one man alone could collect enough of it in ten days to fill a measure .
0	Following the example of <NAME> , who had set up his observatory on the islet of <NAME> , <NAME> landed there and took his observations , whilst his people traded with the natives , who were , throughout his stay , peaceful , friendly , and civil .
0	Fortunately , although the wind was strong , the sea , being sheltered by the land , did not run very high .
0	They were civil , and only used that odd language among themselves , the origin of which I could not guess , neither could I question them .
0	God , who reads our hearts , knows that we had a noble end in view .
0	There was no saying how long this state of the atmosphere might last .
0	“ In fact , ” said <NAME> , “ it ’ s a whale that we have harpooned ; and we ’ re only doing just what whalemen do when out fishing. ” But a change in the nature of the ground compelled the doctor to vary his style of locomotion .
0	As he was about to enter the camp , <NAME> , passing among the officers approached and remained motionless before him .
0	The mountainous and craggy islets intercepted the beauties of this noble island from the view of the travellers .
0	“ We are cut off ! ” cried <NAME> .
0	I knew not what argument would now tell in my favour .
0	The islands which <NAME> calls the islands of the Papuans are <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , which are situated almost immediately below the equator .
0	Other than the corrections listed above , printer 's inconsistencies in spelling , punctuation and hyphenation have been retained .
0	They plainly saw the nature of <NAME> ’ s feelings towards her , and were far from displeased thereat .
0	He and <NAME> had surveyed the coast for a distance of eight miles and consequently much beyond the place where the balloon had fallen the last time but one , a fall which was followed by the disappearance of the engineer and the dog Top .
0	The future would soon teach me that .
0	You would say an express-train was whirling by .
0	Preserved meat , ale , brandy -- all were in abundance ; consequently , as the men expressed it , they were in this respect “ all right. ” Of course , the physical changes that had taken place had attracted the notice both of officers and men .
0	He could never stop still in one place , and relieved himself with impetuous words and a superabundance of gesticulations .
0	When the welcome word resounded on board the <NAME> on the 17th January , 1828 -- ( a day full of incidents according to <NAME> 's diary ) -- it was succeeded by `` <NAME> on the starboard bow ! ''
0	As early as 1816 Major Peddie , starting from <NAME> , reached <NAME> , on the <NAME> , succumbing , however , to the fatigue of the journey and unhealthiness of the climate soon after his arrival in that town .
0	<NAME> , meanwhile , did not remain idle .
0	On the 16th of January , the <NAME> seemed becalmed only a few yards beneath the surface of the waves .
0	`` That 's <NAME> ; '' said M'Nicholl ; `` I know it well ; it 's the darkest spot on the Moon : many a night I gazed at it from my little observatory in <NAME> , <NAME> . ''
0	In <NAME> , after crossing <NAME> , between <NAME> and <NAME> , two of the <NAME> , <NAME> surveyed the eastern coast of <NAME> , in the neighbourhood of <NAME> , which presented a very picturesque appearance , with the hills clothed with grass and stunted trees and the shores with bushes .
0	From <NAME> , <NAME> diverged a little to the west , to <NAME> , a large town inhabited by <NAME> and <NAME> , then to <NAME> , a city frequented by caravans trading between <NAME> and <NAME> ; passing by <NAME> , the capital of the province of that name , and by <NAME> , a town whose situation is uncertain , but in a part of the country where chalcedony and jasper abound .
0	But at length a painful sensation drew them from their watchings .
0	`` It 's useless to argue with a Mississippi steamboat <NAME> , '' ejaculated <NAME> ; `` he never gives in till he blows up ! ''
0	Had he seen the Projectile before it vanished behind the <NAME> 's north pole ?
0	This traitor , impelled by insane ambition as much as by hate , had ordered the movement so as to attack <NAME> .
0	Then <NAME> gave him a letter from the king and queen , couched in the following terms : -- `` <NAME> , our Admiral in the ocean , `` We have ordered <NAME> Bovadilla to explain to you our intentions .
0	`` And we 're still going up ! ''
0	`` It would be a superb idea , though , '' said <NAME> .
0	His father propped himself up against the rock .
0	Yes , yes ; I can swear to it !
0	Arriving at <NAME> from <NAME> , she had left part of her cargo at <NAME> , and thereafter -- in <NAME> , 1827 -- had set sail for <NAME> , where she had remained for a month .
0	They then left the transformation to complete itself , and it would not take less than ten or twelve days for the sulphuret of iron to be changed to sulphate of iron and the alumina into sulphate of alumina , two equally soluble substances , the others , flint , burnt coal , and cinders , not being so .
0	His master called him back directly .
0	In fact , between <NAME> and Kamakore the very heavy rains of some previous weeks were retained by this shallow depression as in a water-tight bowl .
0	That long darkness of the poles sheds a moral and physical influence on mortals which no one can elude , a gloomy and overwhelming impression almost impossible to resist .
0	Towards the west , a cloudy belt , clearly visible at the horizon , increased the gloom , and the eye could not discover if the sky and water were blended together in the same circular line .
0	Behind a huge pyramidal rock they found a hole in the mountain-side , like the mouth of a great tunnel .
0	<NAME> , founded in 1611 , is situated at the confluence of the <NAME> and the <NAME> , on the right bank of the latter river .
0	<NAME> <NAME> gave <NAME> a narrative of the voyage , and made him proud of his son and daughter .
0	The sickness that had afflicted him for so many years was simply perpetual drunkenness .
0	He was dressed in a suit of ample dimensions , loose neckerchief , open shirtcollar , disclosing a robust neck ; his cuffs were invariably unbuttoned , through which appeared a pair of red hands .
0	<NAME> <NAME> 's head had been crushed against the roof , but , though recovery seemed hopeless , they laid the body on a soft cushion , and soon had the satisfaction of hearing it give vent to a slight sigh .
0	I felt that the hands of my uncle and Hans were vigorously clasping my arms .
0	This time when the major rose he found himself with neither horse nor weapons ; and the next moment he was surrounded by enemies , who stripped him and wounded him in both hands and the right side , leaving him half dead at last to fight over his clothes , which seemed to them of great value .
0	The whole party then returned to the ship , after arranging a rendezvous with <NAME> , and ordering him to procure the necessary means of conveyance across the country .
0	It was completely desert ; not so much as a single point of rock relieved the bare uniformity of its surface .

0	They dug down into a parched and powdery sand -- the very dryest of all sand , indeed -- there was not one trace of moisture !
0	But the remembrance is too vague ; the impression , however , is far from being a pleasant one ! ” “ Where and when could you have met him ?
0	But the cordial relations with the viceroy were not lasting .
0	<NAME> , forewarned , determined to be beforehand with him .
0	But <NAME> did not propose to meddle in the enterprise , which was more industrial than scientific ; and , at the outset , she abandoned any chance she might have of a slice of the Polar cake .
0	I will go and repeat at <NAME> all I have seen , all I have heard ; I swear it by <NAME> above !
0	At first , work on the outside occupied the crew ; the sails were kept furled on the yards instead of being placed at the bottom of the hold , as the earlier explorers did ; they were merely bound up in a case , and soon the frost covered them with a dense envelope ; the topmasts were not unshipped , and the crow's-nest remained in its place .
0	And it is not a face of superhuman grandeur which arises before my astonished eyes : it is <NAME> , fierce guardian of the south pole , flaunting the ensign of the <NAME> in those high latitudes !
0	As to <NAME> , he did not speak ; he simply gazed , and by the mistrust which his look expressed , it appeared that he was examining some strange country .
0	Round the Nautilus the sea dashed furiously .
0	In fact , three questions only of importance were asked him by <NAME> , and these were : “ Did not a captain of the woods named Torres belong to your party a few months ago ? ” “ Yes. ” “ At that time had he not one intimate friend among his companions who has recently died ? ” “ Just so ! ” “ And the name of that friend was ? ” “ Ortega. ” This was all that <NAME> had learned .
0	How plant the flag of his country among the waves ?
0	The rest , amounting to 120 , men who were left to guard the fort of <NAME> , after many vicissitudes which can not be related here , perished by the hands of the <NAME> , or were obliged to take refuge in the <NAME> settlements on the coast of <NAME> .
0	What do you think of it , now ? ” “ I think , ” answered the engineer , “ that the combat will now take a new form , for it can not be supposed that the convicts will be so foolish as to remain in a position so unfavorable for them ! ” “ They won ’ t cross the channel , ” said the sailor .
0	`` Suppose what ca n't be supposed , '' replied the matter-of-fact <NAME> , `` what can not possibly be supposed , unless indeed the original impulse proved too weak .
0	Perhaps it will be a means of raising me in my own eyes ! ” “ Go , <NAME> , ” replied the engineer , who felt sure that a refusal would have deeply wounded the former convict , now become an honest man .
0	The advance towards the north was less perilous than a return to the south ; it was time to think of going into winter-quarters .
0	After crossing the mountains that separate <NAME> from <NAME> , the <NAME> traveller entered the country , made famous by the valour of <NAME> , and studied its manners and customs with the care and attention that were among his most striking characteristics .
0	This center , formed of indefinite molecules , began to revolve around its own axis during its gradual condensation ; then , following the immutable laws of mechanics , in proportion as its bulk diminished by condensation , its rotary motion became accelerated , and these two effects continuing , the result was the formation of one principal star , the center of the nebulous mass .
0	The president attempted to speak , but could not .
0	During one whole hour nothing happened to check my progress .
0	“ The goodwife is in better health than I am , if that ’ s possible , ” replied Ford , “ and it will be a pleasure to her to see you at her table .
0	<NAME> and I , ” replied <NAME> , “ go where danger is certainly to be found , and without doubt news also. ” “ To the invaded provinces ? ” asked <NAME> with some earnestness .
0	`` Suffer me to finish , '' he calmly continued .
0	`` No , '' exclaimed <NAME> , after some moments , `` no , we are not falling !
0	The satisfaction of having gained several hundreds of dollars is already lessened , and the prospect of gaining a few more hundreds does not put a stop to disputes .
0	Other bodies were found , as we trod the dusty plain , and my uncle was able to choose the most marvelous of these specimens in order to convince the most incredulous .
0	“ <NAME> , <NAME> of <NAME> , “ RODAMEL , <NAME> , Here ended the astonishing journey of Dr. <NAME> and his brave companions , as vouched for by undeniable testimony ; and they found themselves among friends in the midst of most hospitable tribes , whose relations with the <NAME> settlements are frequent and amicable .
0	The first object that caught their attention as they emerged upon the open rocks was the unfortunate professor , who was scrambling down the mountain-side , piteously displaying a fragment of his shattered telescope .
0	No man is brave in presence of an earthquake , or a bursting boiler , or an exploding torpedo .
0	Henceforth he resolved to make all the reparation he could for the injustice of which his old comrade had been the victim .
0	But I knew the plan , and by its means I discovered the presence of firedamp and consequently that of a new seam of coal in the <NAME> pit. ” All that the old overman had related of the so-called “ monk ” or “ fireman ” was perfectly true .
0	`` To maintain combustion , '' commenced <NAME> syllogistically and sententiously , `` air is necessary .
0	Fortunately , they found upon the shore whole trees , coming doubtless from <NAME> , and driven here by the current , and in such quantity that they sufficed not only for the construction of their habitation , but also for firewood throughout the winter .
0	“ Pay attention to my wishes , ” he continued .
0	“ Why ? ” “ Because the sands are still more dangerous than the rocks , for they swallow up everything that is thrown on them .
0	The brave honest sailor was not content when the workmen were not at the dockyard .
0	Accompanied by his slaves , he walked into the fields , and there met the owner of a fine plot of barley .
0	The last luggage-van has been robbed .
0	Having been set fire to by each party that had successively been victorious , <NAME> was nothing more than a heap of ruins , amongst which loitered a little remnant of scantily clothed inhabitants , the wretched residuum of a once flourishing population .
0	Taking example by the guide , I gave way to a kind of painful somnolency , during which I seemed both to hear and feel continued heavings and shudderings in the mountain .
0	There is enough for everybody . ''
0	And the only man who could have furnished this evidence had been killed through <NAME> !
0	Then my brain grew calmer , my imagination wandered into vague unconsciousness , and I soon fell into a deep sleep .
0	cried <NAME> ; `` let us have more of it ! ''
0	Was not this like a blessing direct from <NAME> ?
0	It turned over when the tide overtook it , and then quietly returned to the deep sea . ''

0	About eleven o ’ clock lightning began to blaze continuously in the sky .
0	He took his father ’ s place as overman , and diligently superintended the works of this colony of miners .
0	On the 20th of October a contract was entered into with the manufactory at <NAME> , near <NAME> , which during the war had furnished the largest <NAME> , cast-iron guns .
0	Still , on their representing that they had seen some parroquets flying in a south-westerly direction , the admiral consented to change his route so far as to steer some points to the south , a change which had happy consequences in the future , for had they continued to run directly westward , the caravels would have been aground upon the great <NAME> , and would probably have been altogether destroyed .
0	Many a time , but for their devotion and courage the small band could not have gone on .
0	The <NAME> , taking <NAME> for its starting-point , extends eastward to meet the road from <NAME> .

0	`` Our science of optics is still very defective , and through our mile-and-three-quarter telescopes -- '' `` Listen to that , <NAME> , '' broke in <NAME> , turning to a second scientist .
0	His combinations I knew now were useless , I having discovered the one only clue .
0	“ Confound that excellent woman , ” he said ; “ if she hadn ’ t called me to the telephone I should not have run the chance of being struck by lightning. ” And to insure being left in quiet , he judiciously put the telephone out of action .
0	who had killed the convicts ?
0	<NAME> <NAME> could not help looking attentively at his newly-arrived fellow-traveler .
0	They were almost touching the surface of the sea !
0	He himself did not , however , look upon the situation in quite the same favourable light .
0	The last telegram sent from the <NAME> ’ s cabinet , before the rupture of the wire , had ordered the governor , the garrison , the inhabitants , whoever they might be , to leave <NAME> , to carry with them any articles of value , or which might be of use to the <NAME> , and to take refuge at <NAME> .
0	<NAME> over , Harding and his companions left <NAME> and returned to the beach .
0	Did not <NAME> M'Connell see it also ? ''
0	Often , too , the brig would leave bits of sheathing on the ice against which she grazed .
0	The command was offered to him , and although he might have passed the remainder of his days in peace at his post in the <NAME> , in the full enjoyment of the honour and glory he had gained by his two voyages round the world , he did not hesitate for a moment .
0	It has therefore had the name dog-fox , or wolf-fox , given to it by whalers .
0	But had not <NAME> escaped one peril only to fall into another ?
0	Passepartout shook it , but with no perceptible effect ; for neither shaking nor maledictions could prevail upon it to change its mind .
0	Smaller than the latter , it is more wooded , better watered , and possessed more goats .
0	They could not even have heard themselves speak .
0	<NAME> Jup smoking calmly and seriously , sitting cross-legged like a Turk at the entrance to <NAME> !
0	Had they formerly invaded it , so that certain unaccountable peculiarities might be explained in this way ?
0	Buried in recollection , or lost in thought , or magnetized by the bright Sun , they seemed to be half asleep while steeping their limbs in his vitalizing beams .
0	A portable organ , an electrical machine , fireworks , and domestic and agricultural implements completed the collection of useful and ornamental presents intended to give the Tahitans an idea of <NAME> civilization .
0	“ Whatever it is , in another hour we shall know all about it , ” said <NAME> .
0	“ He is an intelligent , intrepid man , ” he added , “ whose passions have led him astray .
0	Several days elapsed without the reappearance of <NAME> .
0	The trot was exchanged for the amble as soon as <NAME> awoke , but the kibitka had not the less gained some versts .
0	In the east and west were two capes gently sloping to the water ; at their end the sea was breaking , and the wind was carrying a slight foam .
0	She hoisted no flag at her mizzen-peak .
0	`` Let us eat if you care to , '' was the answer ; `` although our condition is stupid , not to say disgraceful . ''
0	I had something else to think of .
0	I passed a copper ring through their tails , and threw them back into the sea .
0	Where can I hide in this steppe ? ” He gave a look around , and , through the darkness , discovered a confused mass at a hundred paces before him on the left of the road .
0	During the two weeks that followed our last interesting conversation , there occurred nothing worthy of being especially recorded .
0	It is my intention to try my luck with my fishing line and hook . ''
0	But as the boat came nearer , her illusion was dispelled ; all hope forsook her , and she would have sunk in despair , but for the reassuring voice of <NAME> .
0	exclaimed <NAME> , thinking of his absent tooth .
0	There was now eight feet of the opening above the water .
0	We desire our streets to be lighted within a month , or you must pay a large indemnity for each day of delay ; and what would happen if , amid the darkness , some affray should take place ? ''
0	A more suitable time was required for that question .
0	After a rest of fifteen days , during which the peace had not been disturbed , <NAME> found all his invalids restored to health .
0	“ Well , <NAME> , ” she said , “ each to his lot in this world .
0	“ The convicts passed over , but -- ” “ But what ? ” said <NAME> , who foreboded some new misfortune .
0	In 1791 , the <NAME> Government , justly uneasy as to the fate of these two sloops , manned two large merchantmen , the <NAME> and the <NAME> , which left Brest the 28th of September under the command of <NAME> d'Entrecasteaux .
0	We had no time to make reflections ; it was above everything necessary to get out of our dangerous anchorage , to which the rapidity of the current was a great obstacle . ''
0	The <NAME> , a frigate of eighteen guns , was equipped at <NAME> at the latter end of 1768 , and placed under command of <NAME> d'Eveux de <NAME> , known later as Caret-de Fleurien .
0	<NAME> remained as if spellbound for a time ; the voice ceased and all was silence .
0	It was probable that a disabled vessel had been cast on the coast of the island , that one at least of the crew had been saved , and that by means of the wreck this man , having tools at his disposal , had built the dwelling .
0	On the 3rd May Lander at last left <NAME> en route for <NAME> .
0	<NAME> noticed that of the two reporters <NAME> alone had rejoined the steamer .
0	During this trying period <NAME> and <NAME> worked hard , each in the portions of the enclosure in which they found themselves .
0	A hundred and fifty miles only separated them in longitude , and seventy in latitude .
0	So far , however , cartographers had ignored the corrections made by astronomers .
0	All at once , <NAME> uttered a cry .
0	As yet the hunt had not been successful .
0	However , <NAME> would not give in , and though every instant ’ s delay but increased the danger , the discussion continued .
0	`` I should like to know , '' interrupted M'Nicholl , `` what would be the good of throwing anything at all overboard .
0	The hostile demonstrations of the natives prevented the _Endeavour_ from remaining .
0	However , after two hours , appearing to have formed a resolution , he came to find <NAME> .
0	It seemed to them , when they had finished , as if they had scarcely been working more than a few minutes .
0	The latter held him as in a vice , and it was impossible for him to move .
0	Neither Cyrus Harding nor his companions ventured to offer any observation to <NAME> .
0	O , if I only knew half as much as he does , I might be <NAME> of the <NAME> ! ''
0	`` Do you want , then , to kill me , little by little ? ''
0	<NAME> <NAME> threw into it about eighteen grains of quinine , and they succeeded in making <NAME> drink the mixture .
0	There was nothing for it but to run her ashore .
0	The country was swarming with hundreds of birds , of which one species received the name of the `` <NAME> , '' from the exceeding brilliancy of its plumage .
0	The depressions in the soil are covered with a black , rich loam , on which there is a vigorous vegetation .
0	`` Then , '' said <NAME> , `` we shall have time to finish our journey -- that is , if <NAME> does not interfere with it . ''
0	But still I should like them to be submitted to a final examination , in order to make their worth incontestable and uncontested. ” “ Go on , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> ; “ I am ready to answer all your questions. ” “ They are simple enough , as you will see .
0	In the first place , he must not travel as a courier of the Czar usually would .
0	Suddenly a dreadful growling was heard , and then another report .
0	Then , after he saved <NAME> , it was interest .
0	As he was reflecting in this wise , his eyes fell upon an immense placard which a sort of clown was carrying through the streets .
0	The intrepid <NAME> was not , however , to be discouraged .
0	<NAME> had never thought of this .
0	They would make their way with their hatchets , and thus lay the first draft of a road which would place <NAME> in communication with the end of the peninsula for a length of from sixteen to seventeen miles .
0	The bed was hard , the shelter unsatisfactory , the situation painful -- lying in the open air , five thousand feet above the level of the sea !
0	The <NAME> Crown exercises a real and despotic dominion over the larger portion of this vast country , and has a governor-general stationed at <NAME> , governors at <NAME> , <NAME> , and in <NAME> , and a lieutenant-governor at <NAME> .
0	The deliverance of <NAME> at the time when he was dying of exhaustion in the forest of <NAME> ; the hospitable reception he had met with at the fazenda , the meeting with <NAME> on the <NAME> frontier , his embarkation on the jangada ; and lastly , the fact that <NAME> had seen him somewhere before .
0	As soon as the tree is cut down , the pith is extracted , which is then grated , passed through a sieve , and afterwards cut up in the form of small rolls , which are dried in the shade .
0	These descriptions of antiquities , which in our own day are accurately known by drawings and photographs , have , however , little value for us ; and are merely interesting as indicating the state of the ruins when <NAME> visited them , and enabling us to judge how far the depredations of the Arabs have since changed them .
0	“ What can this be ? ” said he ; “ a flood !
0	437 <NAME> ENGAGING A <NAME> '' .
0	This was an utterly unfounded accusation , for <NAME> was both loved and esteemed by <NAME> and his contemporaries , and there is nothing in his writings to justify this calumnious assertion .
0	The <NAME> belong more especially to two distinct races , the <NAME> and the <NAME> .
0	`` I will imagine I am at the <NAME> ! ''
0	Up to this point the president of the <NAME> had been satisfied with the turn which the discussion had assumed .
0	answered <NAME> ; `` for we know now that its initial velocity was greater than they supposed . ''
0	<NAME> complied with the request , and crossing the country lying between the <NAME> and the <NAME> , they arrived at their destination .
0	`` Now inform the reporters of this straightway .
0	At last the wire touched the rocks on the beach .
0	160 Search for lands discovered by the <NAME> -- Stay in <NAME> 's land -- <NAME> 's <NAME> -- <NAME> -- <NAME> fêtes at the <NAME> .
0	<NAME> <NAME> 's eyes brightened for an instant .
0	After two mistakes , he probably hesitated to attempt a third interpretation of the document .
0	One chance in a thousand is always a chance , while death from hunger gave us not even the faintest glimpse of hope .
0	They talked in a low voice , and the blind man , adding what they told him to what he already knew , was able to form an exact idea of the state of things .
0	There was a likelihood that the promoters of the enterprise had been so busy with the advantages the world was to possess that they had overlooked the destruction the operation would entail .
0	And , worst of all , his mother was in the hands of the <NAME> , and the cruel <NAME> had undertaken to make her speak when he wished !
0	The diver answered with his hand , mounted immediately to the surface of the water , and did not appear again .
0	Tents were immediately prepared for the sufferers from scurvy .
0	asked <NAME> with manifest incredulity .
0	<NAME> -- His early history -- His disappointment -- His change of nationality -- Preparations for the expedition -- Rio de <NAME> -- St. <NAME> 's Bay -- Revolt of a part of the squadron -- Terrible punishment of the guilty -- <NAME> 's <NAME> -- <NAME> -- The <NAME> -- The <NAME> -- <NAME> and the <NAME> -- Death of <NAME> -- <NAME> -- The <NAME> and their Productions -- Separation of the <NAME> and <NAME> -- <NAME> to <NAME> by the Cape of <NAME> -- Last misadventures .
0	The fact was that the Governor of <NAME> was a <NAME> sergeant , an old comrade of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> gave the name of <NAME> to this harbour of refuge , which he left on the morning of the 23rd of July .
0	At the moment of <NAME> 's coming out of his swoon the faithful <NAME> was licking his face and hands with lavish affection .
0	The coast with its cocoanut and other trees , promised plentiful refreshments , but contrary winds and currents quickly drew the ships away .
0	`` Where are we , where are we ? ''
0	The destruction of the population of <NAME> whose bones lay about the village was not attributable to that catastrophe .
0	They certainly did not deserve death for refusing to trust to my promises , and to come on board , even if they suspected no danger ; but my commission by its nature obliged me to take observations of their country , and I could only do so by penetrating into the interior , either by open force or by gaining the confidence and good will of the natives .
0	For six months a correspondence had passed between these two men .
0	As soon as <NAME> 's ransom was paid , he claimed his freedom ; but <NAME> , who had only saved his life that he might make all the treasures of Peru his own , and shelter himself under the prestige and authority which the inca still exercised over his subjects , was soon wearied by his entreaties .
0	They can not penetrate them ; the means of transport are insufficient , and the heat and disease , and savage disposition of the natives , are impassable obstacles .
0	The problem was a strange one , it must be acknowledged .
0	Others thought the proposition should be seriously entertained .
0	However , he and his companions were determined to fight to the last gasp .
0	It came from the pah , whose direction <NAME> did not know .
0	The welcome by the natives was cordial .
0	He was standing at the fore part near his flag , which a slight breeze displayed above his head .
0	The launch was to take place at ten o'clock .
0	But they required to know more than the general truth , and felt that they had no time to lose in getting at the exact details .
0	At about ten o ’ clock , however , <NAME> caught sight of a number of black objects moving on the ice blocks .
0	They very rarely succeed in a good show of yellow .
0	Notwithstanding this `` et cetera , '' I must not omit to mention fish that <NAME> will long remember , and with good reason .
0	It is really a river , that flows freely to the middle of the <NAME> , and whose waters do not mix with the ocean waters .
0	In some places , the wind , eddying round the corners , formed the snow into tall whirling columns , resembling those waterspouts which turn round on their base , and which vessels attack with a shot from a gun .
0	That dagger had never been in the possession of the pacific and taciturn Hans .
0	<NAME> is an old sea-dog , who has carried his canvas bag into every corner of the world . ''
0	It will be readily conceived that after an imprisonment of forty-seven days , in a dark and miserable tunnel it was with infinite delight that I breathed this saline air .
0	“ <NAME> ! ” said <NAME> , in a tone of the most supreme contempt .
0	But suddenly an unexpected incident occurred .
0	<NAME> ; but he dared not do it .
0	As the favourable season was now approaching , D'Entrecasteaux determined to avail himself of it to reach the land of the <NAME> , which had been seen by <NAME> , and visited some years later by <NAME> , who , imagining he was making a new discovery , named it <NAME> .
0	I left him in the dying man 's cabin , and returned to my room much affected by this scene .
0	At the same time , to long wars succeeds a peace , destined to endure throughout the reign of <NAME> , so that a great number of adventurers know not how to find indulgence for their love of violent emotions .
0	The <NAME> walked straight to it , and we got on board as the first rays of light whitened the surface of the ocean .
0	How A <NAME> Manages An <NAME> .
0	`` So , in your opinion , <NAME> , <NAME> will fail ? ''
0	I was , therefore , quite right in that part of my conjecture .
0	And yet it was not like the sun , for it gave no heat .
0	The car , which renders the management easy , had not then been invented , and a circular gallery was placed around the lower and contracted part of the <NAME> balloon .
0	For when they paved this church they could not lay the pavement over the place where our <NAME> 's feet had rested , as , when the stones were laid upon that spot , the earth , as though impatient of anything not divine resting upon it , threw them up again before the workmen .
0	Turning round , they saw that the crew of the <NAME> was in hot dispute with the <NAME> soldiers .
0	A favorable result of his arrival , however , was the order which was given to raise the camp that very day , and remove the headquarters to <NAME> .
0	`` My morning 's game , '' answered the doctor , modestly , `` and you 'll see no fox was ever wanted more than this one . ''
0	`` Give it , boatswain , '' I replied , `` at the risk of my not adopting it if I do n't agree with it . ''
0	<NAME> , born at <NAME> about 1465 , and brought up in the household of the <NAME> of <NAME> , had gained his first experience in arms in the wars against the Moors .
0	My head got better again .
0	The <NAME> of <NAME> , the ruler of a good many of these petty principalities , and who takes the title of <NAME> of the <NAME> , was remarkable for a complete disregard of cleanliness , a peculiarity in which , according to <NAME> , his court fully equalled him .
0	For this reason it is as precious as , from another point of view , are the flute used by <NAME> , and the shoes of the poor sailor who died during the winter sojourn .
0	<NAME> ran to the piece of ice behind which he had watched the bear , then to the place of combat , where he had cut him up ; but he could not find anything .
0	So most people came to the conclusion that the villains had been finally dislodged from the mine , and that , as to <NAME> , they must suppose her to be dead at the bottom of the shaft where they had left her .
0	<NAME> was not yet falling , so <NAME> raised the leathern curtains which protected the interior of the tarantass and looked out , watching the sides of the road , peopled with fantastic shadows , caused by the wavering light of the lanterns .
0	Doubtless it was the recollection of his first voyage round the world , so disastrously interrupted , which procured for him the distinction conferred upon him by the <NAME> .
0	“ No , but I must ! ” persisted the professor again .
0	“ <NAME> , ” said he , “ can you restrain your impatience for one hour only ? ” “ But , captain , just think !
0	“ No , but the gutta percha has evidently softened or melted in the heat , and the hydrogen is escaping through the silk. ” “ How can we prevent that ? ” “ It is impossible .
0	What is the good ? ” he would say , and refused to leave his black domain .
0	Two hours wore away thus .
0	Then passing to another idea , -- “ Think , ” said he , “ how astounded <NAME> and his companions must have been when , next morning , they found the place empty , and the machine flown away ! ” “ I am utterly indifferent about knowing what they may have thought , ” said the reporter .
0	Our captain will see what ought to be done , and he will remember that time presses .
0	Whilst he was returning to <NAME> Alvarès Cabral might have encountered a fleet of four caravels under the command of <NAME> da Nova , which King <NAME> had despatched to give fresh vigour to the commercial relations which <NAME> had been charged to establish in the Indies .
0	Their hair is originally black , but they are in the habit of tinting it with powder , so that white , red , and blue hair abounds , which produces a singular effect .
0	“ Hang it ! ” cried the sailor .
0	<NAME> <NAME> proposed to continue the exploration , that the question of the supposed wreck might be completely settled , and he asked at what distance <NAME> might be from the extremity of the peninsula .
0	The conical peak of <NAME> looked black against the bright sky , which seemed all ablaze with the splendor of the rising sun .
0	“ It is there that we shall alight , if God permits. ” “ But , it seems to be inhabited , doctor. ” “ <NAME> is right ; and , unless I ’ m mistaken , there is a group of about a score of natives on it now. ” “ We ’ ll make them scatter ; there ’ ll be no great trouble in that , ” responded <NAME> .
0	His experience on this coast D'Urville thus describes : -- '' One who has not had , as we have , a practical acquaintance with these seas , is unable to form any adequate conception of these incredible rains .
0	Where are you ? ” “ <NAME> beneath you , ” laughed the merry fellow .
0	This was represented to the commander .
0	<NAME> <NAME> suffered no pain , but he was visibly sinking .
0	“ No mistake about that , sir , ” replied <NAME> ; “ a <NAME> would rattle his castanets at the cannon ’ s mouth. ” “ But what is the meaning of it all ? ” asked the captain , more puzzled than before .
0	Before this province of <NAME> belonged to Kublaï-Khan it was governed by a very pacific king , who shunned war , and was very merciful to all his subjects .
0	`` I can not say , <NAME> , '' said the engineer .
0	I tried to cry out , and arouse him .
0	In 1857 the great sepoy revolt broke out .
0	II. , p. Attack upon an <NAME> .
0	`` as the captain 's letter had said . ''
0	Next morning they crossed the conventional line which separates the <NAME> plains from the region of the <NAME> .
0	I left <NAME> on <NAME> ’ s ship on the 12th of March , 1861 .
0	The rain was not very heavy , but the wind was terrific .
0	The possession which places <NAME> on a par with <NAME> is the <NAME> , containing the tomb of <NAME> .
0	They found it hard to answer the question thus squarely put them .
0	The next day , which was the 10th , at four o'clock in the evening , it reached <NAME> , already risen from its ruins , and more proudly seated than ever on the borders of its beautiful <NAME> .
0	After having appointed <NAME> de la <NAME> , <NAME> de <NAME> , viceroy of <NAME> , he caused five vessels to be fitted out , which being laden with provisions and ammunition for two years , were to transport <NAME> and a certain number of soldiers , artizans , and gentlemen to the new colony , which they were about to establish .
0	I am one of the agents of the <NAME> . ''
0	<NAME> <NAME> arrived , surrounded by a large staff of <NAME> officers .
0	“ Well , <NAME> , what ’ s your report ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	Although the King of <NAME> looked more than a hundred years old , he was very gay and light-hearted .
0	<NAME> took a revolver from the rack , and assured himself that it was loaded and primed .
0	Some skeletons of poulps are preserved in the museums of <NAME> and <NAME> , that measure two yards in length .
0	answered the <NAME> of <NAME> .
0	Besides this , at every three miles on the road there is a little hamlet of about fourteen houses where the couriers live , who carry messages on foot ; these men wear a belt round their waists and have a girdle with bells attached to it , that are heard at a long distance ; they start at a gallop , quickly accomplishing the three miles and giving the message to the courier who is waiting for it at the next hamlet ; thus the emperor receives news from places at long distances from the capital in a comparatively short time . ''
0	`` And if it should take place ? ''
0	The engineer 's orders were obeyed , and whilst the reporter and the lad , the best marksmen in the colony , posted themselves in a good position , but out of the monkeys ' sight , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> climbed the plateau and entered the forest in order to kill some game , for it was now time for breakfast and they had no provisions remaining .
0	As to the invisible side , once landed , we should have the power to visit it when we pleased , and therefore we could always choose whatever time would best suit our purpose .
0	Ten o ’ clock had just struck .
0	`` No , '' replied <NAME> ; `` on the contrary , everything went wonderfully well .
0	The château of <NAME> stands in the gorge of the 'Dents-du-Midi ' twenty hours from <NAME> .
0	It is necessary here to mention a proposal of J. T. <NAME> 's .
0	Therefore the carpenters lost not a moment .
0	364 `` <NAME> , I 'VE <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> '' .
0	And under these lines was a name , a signature , the name of <NAME> !
0	We were lying upon the back of a sort of submarine boat , which appeared ( as far as I could judge ) like a huge fish of steel .
0	This was the only word of reproach which came to my lips ; for I thoroughly understood how deeply and sorrowfully the worthy Professor would regret my loss , and how in his turn he would patiently seek for me .
0	While J. T. <NAME> formed part of the “ Co. ” could she do otherwise than applaud ?
0	Sometimes the taste of these designs is really wonderful .
0	“ Can we not avoid them by keeping to the shore ?
0	<NAME> <NAME> also placed at the summit of the mainmast a `` crow 's nest , '' a sort of cask staved in at one end , in which a look-out remained constantly , to observe the icefields .
0	Every one munched away at it with a pleasure which may be easily understood .
0	Some , such as those of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and others , transmitted their good wishes ; the rest maintained a prudent silence , quietly awaiting the result .
0	`` However that may be , '' replied <NAME> , `` let us go forward , or we shall be frozen . ''
0	“ My conscience , ” exclaimed <NAME> , “ I must say I am surprised at such a declaration from the Secretary of a Geographical Society ! ” “ And why so ? ” said <NAME> , touched in his weak point .
0	The train , now detached from the engine , remained a little behind , whilst the locomotive rushed forward with increased speed .
0	The population , so sparsely sprinkled throughout the arid countries which the ambassador had come through , were collected here , and <NAME> .
0	The boards of this prison were concealed under a thick mat , which deadened the noise of the feet .
0	cried <NAME> , springing up at a bound .
0	Innocent ! ” Then complete silence fell on all .
0	They might now be assured of its success .
0	`` I will accompany you , '' said <NAME> .
0	Above all , near the leaden granitic sky , were immense birds , more powerful than the cassowary and the ostrich , which spread their mighty wings and fluttered against the huge stone vault of the inland sea .
0	Seeing that it would be imprudent to send a boat on shore , <NAME> ordered the ship to be put about .
0	Four days later , on the 14th of <NAME> , the jangada passed the mouths of the <NAME> .
0	Moreover , if the detective had been on board at that moment , <NAME> would have joined issue with him on a quite different subject , and in an entirely different manner .
0	<NAME> had doubtless soon fallen into the hands of <NAME> .
0	On their way <NAME> and <NAME> were careful to preserve the wire which had been laid down by the captain between the corral and the grotto , and which might at a future time be of service .
0	There existed in the right side of the hill , as well as in the left , on either side of the fissure , certain winding passages , and it was by crawling along these in the darkness that <NAME> , <NAME> , and the others reached a cavity which let in light and air in abundance .
0	After a noble course of some seventeen hundred miles it mingles its cloudy waters with those of the <NAME> through a mouth eleven hundred feet wide , but such is its vigorous influx that many a mile has to be completed before those waters lose their distinctive character .
0	<NAME> <NAME> could not but welcome such a guest , and shook hands cordially .
0	Thus , the doctor had become well known to the public , although he could not claim membership in either of the <NAME> Societies of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , or <NAME> , or yet with the <NAME> ’ Club , or even the <NAME> , where his friend the statistician <NAME> ruled in state .
0	His eyes slowly opened and then closed again , pained by the glare of light .
0	He asserts that the fatigued state of the crew , who were reduced by privations , and who in spite of everything had not ceased to work the pumps , had decided the captain to stop and buy some slaves to aid them in this work .
0	The bright moonlight showed them the President sitting up in his bed , his eye blazing , his arms waving , as he shouted in a tone reminding them of the day they had found him in <NAME> Helena wood .
0	The natives , intimidated by the lesson they had received in the evening , remained in concealment , whilst the <NAME> picked cocoa-nuts , and gathered anti-scorbutic plants .
0	This day , the 18th of March , there remained only provisions for two days , although they limited their consumption to the bare necessaries of life .
0	The pirates would think that they had to deal with numerous and well-armed adversaries , whom they could not easily get the better of .
0	“ The devastation , gentlemen , ” said the count , who persistently refused to recognize the <NAME> ’ s irritation , “ everywhere was terrible and complete .
0	But how were we to release her from her bed in the ice and restore her to her natural element ?
0	The <NAME> was then within sight of <NAME> !
0	The Captain soon saw this , by noticing with what difficulty <NAME> was panting .
0	This book is a translation from the <NAME> original by <NAME> .
0	The return of the birds indicated a diminution of the cold ; but it was not safe to rely upon this , for with a change of wind , or in the new or full moons , the temperature suddenly fell ; and the sailors were forced to resort to their most careful precautions to protect themselves against it .
0	He himself had said that no remedy could avail , and he awaited with tranquillity that death which had for him no terrors .
0	The awakening is to take place here in my house .
0	However , <NAME> stated explicitly that <NAME> would be able to furnish information relating to the non-communicated chapters , and that he lived at <NAME> .
0	Races between the officers , masquerades and theatrical entertainments , with the temperature maintained at 50 degrees <NAME> kept all the men healthy and happy until the thaw , which set in on the 20th July , 1825 , enabled <NAME> to resume exploring operations .
0	`` Yes , and the <NAME> must extend at least six hundred leagues from side to side .
0	As for me , I should not have cared to ship in her . ''
0	The chain of <NAME> alone remained luminous , and seemed encircled by a golden halo .
0	he is on the island ! ''
0	<NAME> came on ; the train passed on at full speed , in the midst of the roaring of the tigers , bears , and wolves which fled before the locomotive ; and the marvels of <NAME> , <NAME> ruined <NAME> , <NAME> , the ancient capital , <NAME> , <NAME> , and the <NAME> town of <NAME> , where <NAME> would have been proud to see his country 's flag flying , were hidden from their view in the darkness .
0	They felt her lifted up , and for an instant she hung in the air , then she leaned over and fell back on the ice , and then she rolled so heavily that her planks cracked .
0	The <NAME> was sent to the <NAME> of <NAME> , and the <NAME> directed her course to the Cape of <NAME> , which she reached upon the 28th of February .
0	I said at last , coming to myself .
0	I am very glad to have seen you again !
0	The good animal , hidden behind a thicket , had escaped the sight of the <NAME> .
0	`` <NAME> was alone , but he had no want of either ammunition , weapons , tools , or seeds .
0	Their limbs grew torpid , their minds grew dull , and often they walked like men half asleep ; then a slip or a sudden fall would rouse them for a few moments from their sluggishness .
0	“ <NAME> ! ” exclaimed a third time the brave young girl , in a voice to which hate had added ten-fold strength .
0	The captain had only to pick his men .
0	Our gestures sufficiently indicated the different roads each wished to follow -- and which each tried to influence the other to undertake .
0	His Projectile was proving intractable to the laws of gravitation .
0	The government determined to settle a question which had been discussed for so many years , and to despatch an expedition for the purpose .
0	There , under the intelligent hands of the engineer and his companions , everything prospered .
0	`` But , '' urged <NAME> , `` a town which has been un-lighted for eight or nine hundred years -- '' `` All the more necessary is it , '' replied the burgomaster , emphasizing his words .
0	But , if she could neither glide off nor move , she ran the risk of being for ever fastened to these rocks , and then <NAME> 's submarine vessel would be done for .
0	The letter penned , the <NAME> re-read it attentively , then signed it , preceding his name with the words “ Byt po semou , ” which , signifying “ So be it , ” constitutes the decisive formula of the <NAME> emperors .
0	In short , they sometimes went faster than they liked , and had some difficulty in keeping their feet ; but hope gave them strength , for it was not at random that they made their way along the shore .
0	Towards evening a violent tempest raged about the snowy summit ; it was impossible to withstand the force of the hurricane ; they had to lie down on the ground , but so low was the temperature that they ran a risk of being frozen to death at once .
0	These were the <NAME> , the <NAME> , and <NAME> , so named because it was the tenth island seen .
0	From thirty-two men who had embarked on the schooner , our number was reduced to twenty-three : how low was that figure yet to fall ?
0	At this elevation rain is unknown , and vapors only condense into snow or hail .
0	`` Wait a moment , my dear <NAME> , '' he responded ; `` you must take precautions after your illness before going into the open air . ''
0	More than one bold adventurer presented himself , offering to share the dangers as well as the glory of the undertaking ; but he refused them all , without giving his reasons for rejecting them .
0	It was a harmless lizard , but it appeared to me a loathsome reptile .
0	In fine , he was a <NAME> without the growling , and a perfect pattern of constant good-humor .
0	I folded my arms , as well as I could , and looked my uncle full in the face .
0	`` Let us try , '' said <NAME> .
0	But <NAME> persisted in keeping absolute silence .
0	The enormous cavern was empty .
0	<NAME> was far from abundant ; of coal there was none ; trees and shrubs were few in number , and to cut them down in prospect of the cold seemed a very questionable policy ; but there was no doubt some expedient must be devised to prevent disaster , and that without delay .
0	Those who remained at the fort also suffered terribly from cold , the thermometer sinking three degrees lower than it had done when <NAME> was at <NAME> , nine degrees nearer the pole .
0	At that time exit seemed closed , and <NAME> was obliged to stop and anchor to an iceberg ; but steam was kept up all night .
0	From time to time , in certain places where the landing was easy , the canoe was stopped , when <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , their guns in their hands , and preceded by <NAME> , jumped on shore .
0	<NAME> explained the whole matter in a few words .
0	They could even distinguish a second ringed enclosure .
0	“ He sees ! ” he exclaimed , “ he sees ! ” And like a wild beast trying to retreat into its den , step by step , terrified , he drew back to the end of the room .
0	He found safe anchorage in <NAME> , where as usual , he made a careful hydrographical survey .
0	`` Everything , <NAME> , '' answered Harding , `` and we have no means of preventing them . ''
0	I believe it will settle all your doubts , difficulties and objections . ''
0	By degrees and with the course of years the knowledge of these rich countries had increased .
0	Instead of the rudimentary trilobites , I perceived the remains of a more perfect order .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> feared that <NAME> might take it into his head to get out ; but that gentleman contented himself with saying to his servant , `` See what is the matter . ''
0	This was in reality a voyage of six hundred miles , for it was necessary to row along the coast as far as the port where the colony was established .
0	Some cordage gave way , which endangered the foremast .
0	`` Yes , he told me himself . ''
0	However , for the sake of argument , suppose I reply in the affirmative , and say that _the Moon is inhabitable_ . ''
0	We have said that his plan was to penetrate into the town , make his way to the <NAME> , gain his confidence , and , when the time came , give up the gates to the besiegers ; and , that done , wreak his vengeance on the brother of the Czar .
0	The winter , although severe , ended favorably enough .
0	But I am talking too much about myself : the great thing is about you. ” “ No , my child , ” said <NAME> , “ tell us everything that comes to your mind. ” “ My grandfather , ” continued <NAME> , “ always regarded your abode in the mine with a very evil eye -- not that there was any lack of space .
0	Would not the rays of the sun melt away its fragile walls ?
0	`` Do not let us accuse the sun , '' said <NAME> , `` it is not his fault , but that of the moon , which has come and placed herself like a screen between us and it . ''
0	<NAME> was agreeably surprised to see a large number of islands and islets , the bays , & c. , of which were sure to afford excellent anchorage during the monsoons .
0	The latter reproached him in a contemptuous manner for having nothing to offer him , while pretending to be the subject of a rich and powerful king .
0	The simplest conversations threatened to wander to that point , and any word might kindle a blaze of controversy .
0	They have even calculated -- -- '' `` Oh , dear ! ''
0	I am certain as to having made no mistake .
0	The ‘ <NAME> ’ continued her voyage and arrived at <NAME> .
0	When these tempests are at their height the sea seethes and boils . ''
0	In the spring of 1007 , three vessels carrying 160 men and some cattle , left <NAME> ; the object in view was the foundation of a permanent colony .
0	Still , during the nights following August 16th the darkness was never very marked ; the sun , although it had set , still gave light enough by refraction .
0	<NAME> took advantage of the latter and of the first minister both being absent on a neighbouring island , to pay a visit to another wife of Kamea-Mea .
0	<NAME> <NAME> showed his podorojna , made out in the name of <NAME> .
0	Give me that cord , <NAME> !
0	The spiral , which was not to be adjusted until some future moment , was packed up , separately , along with a very strong Buntzen electric battery .
0	The first work was to make the openings .
0	`` Permit me , '' he continued , `` to recount to you briefly how certain ardent spirits , starting on imaginary journeys , have penetrated the secrets of our satellite .
0	Towards morning , <NAME> gave up in despair and went to take a sleep ; but no sleep for <NAME> .
0	In that way we reached the shore , but alone , without our brave officer . ''
0	404 `` <NAME> , <NAME> LIFTING , <NAME> VERY BRIGHT '' .
0	We were enabled to form an approximate idea of the truth .
0	What , then , was her emotion when she accidentally saw the notice in the <NAME> !
0	A painful suspicion seized me .
0	Fifty-five feet from the ground , in an angle of the building , they recognized the window of the cell in which <NAME> was confined .
0	Why shouldn ’ t I work my way out of the scrape as well as they did ?
0	It was a valuable resource of the colony , and it appeared to be inexhaustible .
0	`` Come , sit down , and I will tell you a curious episode in this history .
0	There is no need for dwelling on this period , which extends from the year 1828 to the year 1839 .
0	“ <NAME> , ” continued <NAME> , “ do you not know that he defended you when you were the <NAME> ’ sport ; that he risked his life for me ? ” <NAME> was still silent .
0	Now , tell me , <NAME> , do you believe that the moon is an old comet ? ''
0	He calculated that they were still five or six miles from the coast , and this distance was too great for them to attempt traversing during the night in the midst of unknown woods .
0	They live all together , men and women and children , in one hut , in the centre of which a fire is lighted .
0	`` If <NAME> does sometimes go on dry ground , '' said I , `` he at least chooses desert islands . ''
0	Seeing that the <NAME> was unable or unwilling to respond , he concluded to help himself , by beginning first of all to prepare a little tea .
0	<NAME> , however , would not allow himself to be disheartened ; he went back to <NAME> , and spared neither pains nor expense to make a thorough investigation of the whole seaboard .
0	Let this first time you have come to treat of this subject be the last , for a second time I will not listen to you . ''
0	A providential inspiration bade her restrain herself and retain her liberty that she might lead <NAME> ’ s son to that goal which he had sworn to reach .
0	<NAME> <NAME> had not yet ventured to declare his attachment ; of rivals he was well aware he had not a few , and amongst these not the least formidable was the <NAME> Count Timascheff .
0	<NAME> <NAME> had preceded me .
0	This creek was deep and clear , but it was absolutely unnavigable .
0	<NAME> of the inhabited earth in these unknown worlds he gathered incalculable treasures .
0	One maintained the hyperbola , the other the parabola .
0	His limbs were becoming paralyzed little by little under the electric influences of the gymnotus , which lightly touched his body as it wrapped him in its folds .
0	Babies soon became quite insupportable , though till now so easy to bring up ; and for the first time <NAME> , the judge , was obliged to apply the rod to his youthful offspring .
0	[ Illustration : Gigantic vegetation on the banks of the <NAME> . ]
0	If its speed had been enormous , he could have understood that the fall would not have taken place ; but , with a relatively moderate speed , that resistance to the moon 's attraction could not be explained .
0	I did not know a single word of the <NAME> language , and yet by a sort of mysterious instinct I understood what the guide had said .
0	`` The idea is good , '' replied the reporter ; `` but could you climb to the top of those giants ? ''
0	`` No , '' answered <NAME> , leaning over the railing .
0	thought the doctor , `` what is that ? ''
0	`` No , <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> obstinately .
0	If our world has become so insignificant a spheroid , not only has its gravity diminished , but its rotary speed has been accelerated ; and this affords an adequate explanation of our days and nights being thus curtailed .
0	But it pleased God to prevent the accomplishment of these terrible projects .
0	He did not know how to prepare the roots , and , besides , had no fire .
0	The natives at once decided to harass the wounded in their retreat .
0	From the 19th to the 20th of February the circle of investigation was extended to all the northern region of <NAME> , whose most secret nooks were explored .
0	`` I ca n't say the same of you , '' replied <NAME> ; `` you had at least one sensible moment in all your lives , and that was about an hour ago ! ''
0	In the earlier days of her formation , while still in a state of mobility , she had been probably a perfect sphere in shape , but , under the influence of terrestrial gravity operating for uncounted ages , she was drawn at last so much towards the centre of attraction as to resemble somewhat a prolate spheriod .
0	The great artistic sculptors and builders of the <NAME> might have here completed their studies with advantage .
0	<NAME> petrified thickets , long joints of fantastic architecture , were disclosed before us .
0	`` These resources , '' says <NAME> , `` so vast in comparison with those furnished by the <NAME> , were , to our thinking , partly the cause of his loss .
0	It was <NAME> and <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , the Major , <NAME> , the steward , and the two sailors .
0	I had nothing to do but to lie down again , and this I did .
0	`` Yes , sir ; it shall go to the pole . ''
0	south ; '' should be `` During the day two whales were seen '' etc .
0	It was a rich prize , 1,313,842 `` pieces of eight , '' [ 1 ] and 35,682 ounces of ingot silver , with other merchandise of little value in comparison with the money .
0	And how could her presence at the bay facilitate our means of getting there ? ” <NAME> waited an instant before answering , and then said , rather evasively : “ I have no wish to obtrude my opinions .
0	But it was to be supposed that this direction changed beyond that point , and that the <NAME> continued to the north-west , towards the spurs of <NAME> , among which the river rose .
0	<NAME> 's visage darkened with the skies , and for two days the poor fellow experienced constant fright .
0	`` And he came back alone -- alone -- from that voyage , having left <NAME> . ''
0	But there was little time for <NAME> to examine the changes which a few hours had wrought .
0	The doctor insisted on joining the party .
0	There , to their great joy , they learnt that the legate Theobald had just been made <NAME> with the title of <NAME> X. , on the 1st of September , 1271 .
0	`` They are snow , '' he exclaimed .
0	`` It is true , '' answered <NAME> , `` but a few months of that strange life have sufficed to make you known -- '' `` As a great criminal , doubtless ! ''
0	Just then <NAME> asked me what I knew about the wreck of <NAME> .
0	“ What means all this ? ” he murmured .
0	Could the wine have caused it ?
0	It was also rumored that the principal chief of the rebellion , <NAME> , was inclined to surrender , but the <NAME> papers have not confirmed this , but rather the contrary , and I should not be surprised to find that at this moment the war is going on with renewed vigor. ” “ Then , according to you , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ this struggle is still going on in the provinces of <NAME> and <NAME> ? ” “ I think so. ” “ This very province where the <NAME> ’ S wreck has deposited us. ” “ Exactly .
0	About May they again arrived at the court of <NAME> , who gave them free passes , and they reached <NAME> about the middle of June , 1247 .
0	Although the lands bought of the Indians were far from being all occupied , the <NAME> colonists continued to push their way inland , at the risk of encounters with the legitimate owners of the soil .
0	He was an old man of <NAME> race , with a long white beard , and he looked sullen and angry .
0	`` Oh then I suppose I must make the best of it , '' said <NAME> , laughing .
0	It is obvious that it was most unlikely that a number such as 76223 was the key of the document , and it produced no other result than to bring to the lips of <NAME> such a vigorous ejaculation that <NAME> disappeared like a shot !
0	This mount , situated in 9 @ north latitude and 20 @ east longitude , rose to a height of 10,600 feet above the surface of the moon .
0	`` We shall not even get halfway . ''
0	`` They are pretty numerous , '' replied <NAME> ; `` but they are so small and they move with such enormous velocity that they are very seldom seen .
0	Seven days later , an ensign , named <NAME> , arrived at <NAME> , after a journey from <NAME> , which had occupied only three months and fourteen days .
0	Surely they had a wonderful variety of meaning .
0	Our rapid passage across the <NAME> had not allowed him to put his project into execution , and he could not help showing his disappointment .
0	Devoted from early youth to the study of natural history , <NAME> wished to become famous by the discovery of new species .
0	For <NAME> made no start at the terrible accusations .
0	<NAME> did not know what to make of him .
0	'Make haste and take him to the market ! '
0	“ It is in expiation of his crimes. ” At that moment the boat , in charge of <NAME> , turned away .
0	The temperature had risen , the thermometer standing at 25° above zero .
0	The lunar panorama was unrolling all its splendors beneath them , and they could not bear to lose one of its slightest details .
0	The next morning they set about building stores and a magazine ; this took them about a week , including the time employed for emptying the <NAME> , which was not done without difficulty , for the low temperature did not permit them to work very long .
0	“ These horses are engaged by me , ” he said .
0	The <NAME> type is strongly marked and distinct .
0	But in spite of the repulses they met with , they let no favourable opportunity pass of recommencing their attacks .
0	His correspondence proves that he shared the opinion of <NAME> as to the relatively short distance separating the extreme shores of the old Continent .
0	The fine season this year was full two months in advance , and it is to be feared the bad season may come sooner than usual . ''
0	Nineteen days afterwards he arrived before <NAME> , where the inhabitants assured him of the existence of an unknown land in the west of the <NAME> .
0	Had he in his turn succumbed ?
0	`` Yes , <NAME> , '' the doctor answered , pressing the brave sailor 's hand .
0	`` The latitude before we left `` And , '' said <NAME> , `` how far are we from the nearest sea to the west ? ''
0	`` Do you believe in the influence of the moon upon distempers ? ''
0	At this moment <NAME> and the guide seized <NAME> , who , in an instant of mad generosity , was about to rush upon the pyre .
0	But the colonists ' object was not simply to admire the magnificent vegetation .
0	They embarked in the corvettes <NAME> and the <NAME> , neither of which were again heard of .
0	`` Would he come back , '' said I , `` now that what he thought was known to him and me only has come out ? ''
0	Nevertheless , space was thenceforth but imperfectly lighted .
0	We are going to eat some meat ; and what meat ! ''
0	The colonists were now half way between <NAME> and the corral , having still two miles and a half to go .
0	It was composed of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
0	Hitherto we have forgotten home too much , and those who are dear to us . ''
0	Should the settlers fall into their hands , they must expect no mercy !
0	A thick black smoke was pouring from her two funnels .
0	Having to wait till noon to find his exact position , he ordered the steamer to take a short circular course of a few hours ' duration , in hope of sighting the buoy .
0	First they ate “ hotchpotch , ” soup with the meat swimming in capital broth .
0	It was lucky I had taken double allowance that day .
0	`` But , '' said I , `` is it not very much to be feared that this ever-increasing pressure may not in the end turn out very painful and inconvenient ? ''
0	He did not delay , and soon the <NAME> reckoned one conquest more .
0	`` Once when upon the shore , '' he says , `` I heard what appeared to be wind instruments , the tones now harmonious , now discordant , yet never unpleasing .
0	Moreover , there was some delay in the return of the messengers who had been sent by the King of <NAME> to the different chiefs on the banks of the river , and lastly , <NAME> ( the <NAME> Water ) had to be consulted in order to ensure the safety of the travellers in their journey to the sea .
0	We shall see a little later how slightly the reception given to <NAME> some years afterwards resembled that just related .
0	The emotions of the day had left sad impressions on their minds .
0	Upon my word , this mountain is a paradise !
0	<NAME> was pointing them out to his companions , and muttering in disjointed phrases , -- `` There , look there !
0	In certain places , less crowded , growing in clumps , these pines exhibited considerable dimensions , and appeared to indicate , by their development , that the country was situated in a higher latitude than the engineer had supposed .
0	Never could I have looked for such an experience !
0	The dogs were harnessed to the sledge ; since they were well fed and had thoroughly rested , after a comfortable winter there was no reason for their not being of great service during the summer .
0	These several productions of the sea were immediately lowered through the panel to the steward 's room , some to be eaten fresh , and others pickled .
0	<NAME> was coming down the ladder , when his whistling was cut short by a sudden exclamation of surprise .
0	<NAME> brought a dozen to <NAME> , who placed them on a coal fire , after having cut them in thick slices , and while doing this repeating : `` You will see , master , how good this bread is .
0	Nothing could be more rudimentary .
0	It was “ <NAME> felt , ” and <NAME> possessed yet another manufacture .
0	<NAME> had accepted the offer with much pleasure , and so , after breakfast on the day we speak of , at about eleven o ’ clock , the two young men and the two girls met on the bank at the angle where the two streams joined .
0	And when you are on the river and stop for the night , you must be careful to anchor far from land , for otherwise the lions come to the vessel , seize upon a man , and devour him .
0	<NAME> , however , had turned around to look about him on his journeyings , and turned to such good purpose that he had seen a great deal .
0	It was there that <NAME> had disappeared .
0	These interesting details , and the great quantity of pearls offered to <NAME> , confirmed him in his idea , that he must have reached the <NAME> countries described by <NAME> , and that he could not be far from the empire of <NAME> or <NAME> , of which the <NAME> traveller had described the marvellous riches which were perpetually dazzling the eyes of these avaricious adventurers .
0	The fact of their departure had only been communicated to J. T. <NAME> and Mrs. Scorbitt .
0	The same ceremonies were observed every time the captain landed .
0	He crossed the <NAME> again and hunted through the quarters on the other side , where the crowd was much less considerable .
0	`` First of all , my friend , '' answered <NAME> , `` every aerolite does not fall to the earth ; it is only a small proportion which do so ; and if we had passed into an aerolite , it does not necessarily follow that we should ever reach the surface of the moon . ''
0	`` Sir , '' said <NAME> , `` if that vessel passes within a mile of us I shall throw myself into the sea , and I should advise you to do the same . ''
0	`` Is that your opinion , <NAME> ? ''
0	`` At half-past nine , '' says <NAME> , `` we were at the mouth of <NAME> River .
0	A few minutes later , <NAME> , seated with his comrade in a corner of the hold , told him all that had occurred on board the brig .
0	It was impossible to reach the crater of <NAME> .
0	`` The entrance to the town , upon the side nearest the sea , '' says <NAME> , `` is protected by a battery which overlooks the entire fort , and is surmounted by one enormous piece of artillery capable of discharging a five-hundred pound shot , which is so renowned throughout the <NAME> , that its reputation alone is enough to protect <NAME> . ''
0	What was certain was that <NAME> had been a member of the band for many years , that an intimate friendship existed between him and <NAME> , that they were always seen together , and that <NAME> had watched at his bedside when he died .
0	Few men are more active and strong ; they endure the glacial cold of the mountains equally with the burning heat of the plains .
0	said <NAME> , pressing the boatswain 's hand ; and he added , `` In case we do n't come back , <NAME> , wait till the next thaw , and try to push on to the Pole .
0	<NAME> <NAME> returned to <NAME> in the year 1849 .
0	<NAME> <NAME> and his gang seemed to have flown away like a flock of marauding birds .
0	They gazed , and hoped , and even felt refreshed by the breath of the tempest .
0	One must go without spirits if he expects to escape the scurvy , remain in good health , and sail far . ''
0	In this way , under the influence of the air projected by the blowing-machine , the coal would be transformed into carbonic acid , then into oxide of carbon , its use being to reduce the oxide of iron , that is to say , to rid it of the oxygen .
0	Yes , another moment , and , in my turn , I should have made a fool of myself .
0	<NAME> in a vase some fragments of cork or other floating body , and give to the water in the vase a circular movement , the scattered fragments will unite in a group in the centre of the liquid surface , that is to say , in the part least agitated .
0	I have not a map of the <NAME> , but my memory has preserved a very clear recollection of its southern part .
0	The pilot arrived the evening before .
0	Now and then he climbed up by cramp-irons riveted to the walls , but kept the inspection to himself .
0	Would the captain put out a boat ?
0	At first only noisy and very lively , the natives soon became threatening .
0	And all dressing in haste rushed to the windows , which they opened .
0	Here the current was extremely strong , and this broke the whirling eddy , and gave the raft some stability .
0	His companions , bending over him , watched the operation with extreme interest .
0	`` I do not know , '' he replied .
0	At the same time the <NAME> element became larger and larger , and the difference between the manners of the <NAME> and their conquerors was less marked .
0	`` Perhaps in <NAME> ; you know the <NAME> is a rapid traveller .
0	Hence the necessity of dispelling the darkness .
0	Besides , the smell would have betrayed it ; and in that case <NAME> could not have carried a lighted match with impunity through the space filled with hydrogen .
0	He therefore determined to seek , with no further delay , the land recently discovered by the <NAME> .
0	He was much surprised to see a strong current at this place .
0	<NAME> , close to him , said one word , “ The knout ! ” “ Yes , ” cried <NAME> , who could no longer restrain himself ; “ the knout for this wretched old woman -- the knout to the death ! ” A Tartar soldier bearing this terrible instrument of torture approached <NAME> .
0	The first piece of news that <NAME> d'Urville learnt on entering the river <NAME> , before even casting anchor at <NAME> , was that <NAME> , an Englishman , had received certain information , when at <NAME> , of the shipwreck of <NAME> at <NAME> ; and that he had brought away the hilt of a sword which he believed to have belonged to that navigator .
0	On an order from <NAME> the prisoners defiled , one by one , past <NAME> , who remained immovable as a statue , and whose face expressed only perfect indifference .
0	They encounter <NAME> in <NAME> ; bushrangers in <NAME> ; and <NAME> in <NAME> .
0	This important chain which separates <NAME> from <NAME> was still at a great distance , and they could not hope to reach it until the end of the day .
0	At this moment the young girl observed , by the light which the chafing-dish cast upon <NAME> 's face , that despair and determination were struggling in his rough features for the mastery .
0	It belongs neither to you , nor to me , nor the eider-down hunter , nor to any of the living beings who may still exist so marvelously in the interior of the earth . ''
0	I repeat that every sign of mutiny had disappeared .
0	On the 27th September was sighted part of the coast of <NAME> , ending in abrupt and precipitous cliffs , to which the name of <NAME> Chatham was given .
0	A hundred and twenty minutes ( I counted them ) still separated me from the moment in which I was to join <NAME> .
0	Where were we to come out ?
0	The doctor stepped along with great dignity , the waganga surrounding him and keeping off the crowd .
0	The colonists at first thought the island was rent asunder , and rushed out of <NAME> .
0	The king did not venture himself to go on board the <NAME> , but his son was of a bolder spirit , and inquired the reason of everything he saw with the most lively curiosity .
0	These words stirred up his comrades .
0	`` Well , '' said <NAME> , `` we 'll ask the commander for a ration of gin ; we deserve it , and we 'll see what he 'll say . ''
0	<NAME> noon the wind freshened , and increased the force of the storm .
0	But if one was at the head of his own men , the other was on board of his own ship .
0	But his stay amongst them was too short to enable him to appreciate their character thoroughly ; and he certainly never suspected that they indulged in the horrible practice of cannibalism .
0	`` Poets like <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> ? ''
0	The prisoner mentioned is not the captain at all , but one of my own countrymen ; and his companion , who was assassinated by the <NAME> , was <NAME> .
0	Still , not a single resort for refuge did the inaccessible shore present .
0	`` My father has some secret cause of trouble , that I can not even guess , '' replied <NAME> , as a sad anxiety spread over her face .
0	`` Have you formed any plan , <NAME> ? ''
0	Having made the tour of the world , he was behind-hand five minutes .
0	Rivers running in perfectly straight lines , across plains , and _up_ as well as _down_ mountains !
0	I ’ m sure they must feel like worshipping us ! ” “ Let them worship away , then , ” replied the doctor , “ but at a distance .
0	Hans seemed to accept the difficulties of the journey so tranquilly , with such calm indifference , with such perfect recklessness of all danger , that I actually blushed to appear less of a man than he !
0	He then thanked his companions , and added , that he would rely on their energy and on the aid of <NAME> .
0	After leaving Zanzibar it was <NAME> India whose coast <NAME> explored , sailing towards the north , and first Abassy or <NAME> , a fertile country where the manufacture of fine cotton cloths and buckram is largely carried on .
0	Was the raft really floating on this substance , which is in the highest degree combustible ?
0	The valleys of our harbour were filled with trees , and tallied in every particular with the description given by the <NAME> .
0	of the spot where the Nile , after flowing through the lake with an ever perceptible current , bends towards <NAME> in the <NAME> territory .
0	His country was at that time oppressed by <NAME> , and he was exiled to <NAME> ; but though he soon after rose in arms to overthrow the tyrant , the ingratitude of his fellow-citizens obliged him to return into exile .
0	`` On carefully considering , '' he said , `` what is going on now between <NAME> and <NAME> , it is clear that the same difficulties will recur with all the towns of the favored State .
0	This block covered a small natural crater hollowed in the cone , and by its own weight prevented the egress of the subterranean fire .
0	The report was sounded , and the bear rolled over on the ice .
0	Why did the candles , just as at the theatre , burn with unwonted refulgence ?
0	`` But if any one seizes it in our absence ? ''

0	Certainly , this man , whoever he was , might expect a somewhat too energetic embrace from the worthy Pencroft !
0	From that day , who could tell into what part of the <NAME> basin the <NAME> would take us ?
0	The Inventory -- Night -- A few Letters -- Continuation of the Search -- Plants and Animals -- <NAME> in great <NAME> -- On <NAME> -- The Departure -- <NAME> -- A Gleam of <NAME> -- Lost on the Sea -- A timely Light .
0	Dates of an excellent flavour are its most valuable export .
0	This was succeeded by a still worse road , running for a league alongside of the river , which is scarcely ten paces wide here , although it was then swollen by the melting of the snow .
0	When he entered this village , at the end of July , <NAME> little dreamt of the long stay he would be compelled to make in it .
0	She was evidently not without an object .
0	A sort of tempest arose on the 3rd of November , the squall knocking the vessel about with fury , and the waves running high .
0	`` The rice consumed at <NAME> is not indigenous to the soil , but still it might be successfully cultivated in the low lands .
0	<NAME> accepted the traveller 's presents with childish glee .
0	`` Wonderful instance of subsidence on a grand scale ! ''
0	It contained room enough for a bed , a table , an arm-chair , a chest of drawers , and , what was of still more consequence , for the indispensable telescope .
0	He made his four hearty meals every day , regardless of the most persistent rolling and pitching on the part of the steamer ; and he played whist indefatigably , for he had found partners as enthusiastic in the game as himself .
0	A third method -- to measure the mountain profile directly by means of the micrometer -- is evidently applicable only to altitudes lying exactly on the lunar rim . ''
0	She saw him in the invested town , far from those he loved , but , as she never doubted , struggling against the invaders with all the spirit of his patriotism .
0	On the north side of the peak was an immense mass of snow and ice ... . To the east lay the great plain , rising as it receded , until , in the distant horizon , it appeared to mingle with the sky . ''
0	The longest of the streets of <NAME> runs parallel to the shore .
0	Of the liquid surface of the sea there was no longer a glimpse .
0	There was hardly anybody about on shore , and the few people there were were half savage , from whom it was all but impossible to obtain the slightest information .
0	There are four of us here , four friends , and the life of one is of no more worth than the life of another .
0	This was a question which rendered me very uneasy and uncomfortable .
0	The engineer , towards whom all eyes were turned , shook his head negatively .
0	Despite the cold , they mounted on the forward barricading , and cut off all the wood which was not indispensably necessary to the ship ; then they returned with this new provision .
0	The stream of lava swelled like a river about to overflow its banks , and threatened to demolish the sole obstacle which could prevent it from overrunning the whole <NAME> .
0	You would do as much for me. ” “ I am not quite so sure , ” said <NAME> candidly .
0	it appears to me the danger is over. ” “ And our comrades at the far end of the works -- what about them ? ” cried some of the miners .
0	`` It _sounds_ like <NAME> , I 'd say to myself , '' continued the <NAME> , `` but I _know_ it 's <NAME> , and by and by , when this whirring goes out of my head , I shall easily understand it . ''
0	On the 15th June , 1783 , he started at the head of a caravan numbering nineteen persons .
0	“ What , it was not you ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	He 's made us scrape against rocks , reefs , and land , as if he had never taken a voyage before !
0	The engineer was right in thinking that the guns were of excellent make .
0	`` We have arrived at that period of the world 's existence when the first plants and the first animals made their appearance . ''
0	`` What is it , then , <NAME> ? ''
0	They had never throughout this time been without fish , but they had suffered the cruelest tortures from thirst .
0	To the eastward of the <NAME> ' archipelago , an island was discovered , not marked on the charts , which was named `` Rose , '' after <NAME> .
0	And what changes might not have occurred in nine days !
0	The billows fell as if by magic , the whole foaming sea seemed leveled , and the <NAME> flew over its tranquil bosom into a quiet basin beyond the formidable bar ; but almost the same minute the ocean burst forth again with all its fury , and the towering breakers dashed over the bar with increased violence .
0	Well , what succeeded with him collapsed with me. ” “ Collapsed ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
0	The cavern widened here considerably , the sea forming a little lake .
0	I never was your son !
0	I can ’ t say. ” “ Why not ?
0	<NAME> , for instance , is as ancient as man himself ; electricity was known 3000 years ago , and steam 1100 years ago .
0	The detachment went at full trot into the narrow street .
0	`` Say 'our ' boat , at least , <NAME> , '' replied the engineer , disarmed for the moment .
0	Besides , <NAME> hoped later to establish an hydraulic apparatus , which would avoid all fatigue and loss of time , for the inhabitants of <NAME> .
0	The aeronauts took careful and complete note of the orographic conformation of the country .
0	I will be that audacious traveler -- I , too , will sign my name upon the very same spot , upon the central granite stone of this wondrous work of the Creator .
0	Fortunately , the hurricane had shifted a point towards the south , and the launch was able to run before the wind , straight for the Pole , running the risk of foundering , but sailing very fast ; a rock , reef , or piece of ice might at any moment rise before them , and crush them to atoms .
0	In the sixteenth century <NAME> , the lieutenant of one of the brothers <NAME> , descended the <NAME> , arrived on the main river in 1540 , ventured without a guide across the unknown district , and , after eighteen months of a navigation of which is record is most marvelous , reached the mouth .
0	In fact , a communication had been sent to many of the journals of both continents , concluding with a demand for immediate inquiry on the part of those interested .
0	The “ superb specimen of a chelonian ” was no longer there !
0	`` In the first place , <NAME> , '' answered <NAME> , `` we are in the dark about it all .
0	-- '' That there is no choice between them ! ''
0	[ Illustration ] The next morning the doctor rose early , and made his way over the drifts to the lighthouse .
0	Notwithstanding his great age , his strength is astonishing , and his threats used to make me tremble. ” “ Go on , <NAME> , my child , ” said <NAME> to the girl , who paused as though to collect her thoughts .
0	I followed , and in a few minutes I had climbed to the top , which for a circle of ten yards commanded the whole mass of rock .
0	Had all the sixteen men who accompanied <NAME> , and of whom no news was received , met a like fate ?
0	In fact , I see them there already -- '' `` In my mind 's eye , <NAME> ! ''
0	<NAME> <NAME> led me towards the central staircase ; half way down he opened a door , traversed the upper deck , and landed in the pilot 's cage , which it may be remembered rose at the extremity of the platform .
0	He ran forward , then returned , and seemed to entreat them to hasten their steps .
0	`` To show that I can understand as well as interrupt ! ''
0	They now resorted to the only remaining expedient .
0	“ I will go , too , brother , ” said the young girl .
0	To ascertain the truth on this point , an expedition was sent out under <NAME> , an English naval officer who had given proof of intelligence and courage .
0	This question preoccupied him , for it was possible that from the way the hat inclined , that is to say , towards the north , the plateau was not practicable .
0	The buzzing of the over-heated boiler was heard , and the steam was escaping from the valves .
0	Still , they must be pardoned , both who were treacherous , and those who were led away to it !
0	The consequences would have been his death and that of his companions .
0	<NAME> was already master of <NAME> and the <NAME> , besides the colonies in the <NAME> regions at <NAME> , in <NAME> ’ s <NAME> ; at <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , in <NAME> Sea ; and on the western coast of <NAME> .
0	The enormous heaps were melting away with majestic slowness .
0	`` We must have , '' said <NAME> , `` several touch-holes , so as to fire it at different points at the same time . ''
0	<NAME> and <NAME> , kneeling , prayed a last time for the poor fellow , inoffensive and good , who had paid for his devotion towards them with his life .
0	Suddenly <NAME> , uttering a cry , pointed to the table .
0	The preparations for our departure did not take long , and we were soon making a rapid descent into the tunnel .
0	I made as little use of it as possible , trusting to my own agility and doing miracles in the way of feats of dexterity and strength upon the projecting shelves and spurs of lava which my feet seemed to clutch as strongly as my hands .
0	<NAME> was then the extent of knowledge possessed by every <NAME> on the subject , and of which no one could decently profess ignorance .
0	“ Perhaps there may be some valuable substance in this volcano , which it will spout forth , and which we may turn to good account ! ” <NAME> shook his head with the air of a man who augured no good from the phenomenon whose development had been so sudden .
0	<NAME> , entrusted with carrying them their daily nourishment , leavings from the kitchen , etc. , acquitted himself conscientiously of his task .
0	This was not surprising , as the whole pile of <NAME> would soon burn out and could only ward off the attacks of wild beasts for a brief interval .
0	Passing the mountainous district of <NAME> , where coffee is cultivated , after a month 's delay at <NAME> on account of illness , <NAME> entered <NAME> , the capital of <NAME> , which he calls the most beautiful city of the <NAME> , on the 2nd of June .
0	Such were the internal arrangements of <NAME> ’ s <NAME> , the refuge where the little colony were full of hope that they would be able to brave the rigors of the stern winter-time that lay before them -- a winter-time during which <NAME> might possibly be projected even to the orbit of <NAME> , where the temperature would not exceed one twenty-fifth of the normal winter temperature of the earth .
0	In giving this reply the great navigator had no prevision of his fate , or of the difficulty his fellow-countrymen would have in finding his remains .
0	A telescope-case would probably be the property of some one on board a ship ; and the figures obviously referred to the astronomical wonders that had been experienced .
0	It had followed , on one side , the valley of <NAME> , and on the other that of <NAME> , evaporating those watercourses in its passage .
0	A new trench was made by the same means in the rocky border of the lake forming a small stream , to which they gave the name of <NAME> , and which was thus an affluent of the <NAME> .
0	`` The masters of the island ! ''
0	The wagon resumed its course in the opposite direction , and did not stop again till they halted for the night at the foot of <NAME> .
0	In this latter case , instead of ignorant and savage natives , what would he have found ?
0	At that place <NAME> had founded the colony of <NAME> in In a preceding volume we have narrated the fearful catastrophe which procured the name of <NAME> for this spot .
0	But , upon hearing these words falling , as it seemed , from the sky , the sheik dismounted and prostrated himself in the dust of the highway , where the doctor had to leave him , finding it impossible to divert him from his adoration .
0	`` I know , I guess , what this pretended meteor is !
0	<NAME> had hastened up to his wife and eagerly asked : “ Has he spoken ? ” “ No , ” replied <NAME> , “ but he has yielded to my entreaties , and wishes to see you. ” “ Ah , dear <NAME> , you have succeeded ! ” “ I hope so , Edward. ” “ Have you made him any promise that I must ratify ? ” “ Only one ; that you will do all in your power to mitigate his punishment. ” “ Very well , dear Helena .
0	`` In the museum at <NAME> ? ''
0	“ Yes , <NAME> , both on animals and men. ” “ You are not joking , <NAME> ? ” “ I am not , <NAME> .
0	“ Good-morning , old <NAME> ; we have come to do our little bit of friendly business with you , you know , ” was <NAME> ’ s greeting .
0	This morning <NAME> awoke in very bad humor .
0	They have no doctors , but only enchanters , who jump , dance , and play musical instruments around the invalid 's bed till he either dies or recovers .
0	No reasoning could make him believe it .
0	<NAME> tracks of blood , scattered limbs , charred trunks of bodies , showed here and there ; none could guess how many victims lay dead and mangled under those ruins .
0	The darkness was due rather to the thickness of the foliage than to the disappearance of the sun .
0	he asked , touching a commutator .
0	“ The fewer one ’ s comforts , the fewer one ’ s needs ; and the fewer one ’ s needs , the greater one ’ s happiness. ” “ Now , now , ” said the Major , “ here is Paganel running a tilt against riches and gilt ceilings. ” “ No , <NAME> , ” replied the <NAME> , “ I ’ m not ; but if you like , I ’ ll tell you a little <NAME> story that comes into my mind , very APROPOS this minute. ” “ Oh , do , do , ” said <NAME> .
0	<NAME> would have liked to skirt these northern lands , in order to reach the sooner <NAME> and the entrance of <NAME> ; but , much to his chagrin , the bank-ice obliged him to take only the passes to the south .
0	On the ninth day after leaving <NAME> , <NAME> had traversed exactly one half of the terrestrial globe .
0	`` Nothing , at least yet awhile , friend <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> , `` I have been watching the thermometer carefully for the last few minutes , and , though we are at present at 38° centigrade , or 100° Fahrenheit , I have noticed that the mercury is slowly falling .
0	<NAME> <NAME> is no more a robber than I am a murderer . ''
0	Thus they were condemned to close imprisonment .
0	<NAME> Nature forbid approach to the Pole ?
0	“ It is a fortunate circumstance , ” responded the <NAME> .
0	`` You must remember that , since we started , we have kept up hot fires in all our furnaces , and , though we had coal enough to go on short steam from <NAME> to <NAME> , we have n't enough to go with all steam from <NAME> to <NAME> . ''
0	`` Certainly you have , <NAME> , '' replied the engineer quickly .
0	`` Yes , of course , '' <NAME> used to say , `` and more too , if need be .
0	The travellers set to work at once and soon accomplished it .
0	Then <NAME> , having ended his survey , re-ascended , drew up the ladder , covered the mouth of the well , and returned thoughtfully to the dining-room , saying to himself , -- `` I have seen nothing , and yet there _is_ something there ! ''
0	The pilot walked away a little distance , and gazed out to sea , evidently struggling between the anxiety to gain a large sum and the fear of venturing so far .
0	I 've arrested more than one of these gentlemen in my time , and , if my thief is on board , I 'll answer for it ; he 'll not slip through my fingers . ''
0	Then crossing the <NAME> , he arrived at <NAME> on the 21st November .
0	Her loquacity exhausted itself in preference on the evils of the times , and the little worries of the household .
0	He must go and wake him .
0	Dr. <NAME> hastened to avail himself of such good fortune , and rapidly ascending resumed his aerial journey amid a long wake of golden morning sunshine .
0	`` <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> , after a moment 's reflection , `` I do not know what the object it , but I do know why it maintains our level . ''
0	They also , during this season , made fierce war against the jaguars .
0	By this arrangement <NAME> ' two brothers had the whole administration of the colony in their hands .
0	Thus he learned that , after long persecutions , <NAME> reappeared in <NAME> , and in 1839 founded a community at <NAME> , on the <NAME> , numbering twenty-five thousand souls , of which he became mayor , chief justice , and general-in-chief ; that he announced himself , in 1843 , as a candidate for the Presidency of the <NAME> ; and that finally , being drawn into ambuscade at <NAME> , he was thrown into prison , and assassinated by a band of men disguised in masks .
0	“ <NAME> me again about this Nicholas .
0	Strangely enough , the temperature was very high -- ten degrees above zero .
0	`` At any rate , they have not tried ; still , I stand up for my countrymen .
0	One of the chiefs in the island sent to <NAME> as a delicacy , a quarter of a child , but the <NAME> commander caused it to be buried in the presence of the natives , who appeared much hurt by an act which they could not understand .
0	What a comfort it was to the settlers to clothe themselves again in clean linen , which was doubtless rather rough , but they were not troubled about that !
0	There was a great abundance of this plant growing in the district , and <NAME> gathered a large supply , so that they were sure of food for several days .
0	And , as if he had not already done enough for the generous wine which he had distilled on the slopes of <NAME> , the sun chose to be part of the party .
0	The peaks on the north and east had disappeared from view , and nothing was visible save the fantastic <NAME> of some towering rocks here and there .
0	`` We shall not be able to reach the neutral point . ''
0	And if it is not objectionable to you , <NAME> , I would render myself again worthy of the reputation which I have acquired in these parts , the question of reis , and not that of conceit , being , you understand , the principal. ” “ Go on , then , friend , ” replied <NAME> laughingly ; “ but be quick !
0	A week ago I went to ascertain the depth of this shaft .
0	The projectile 's position with regard to the moon had altered , and the base was now turned to the earth .
0	He came out of the house in which he was hidden .
0	The tall tufts of gastrolobium were motionless .
0	The captain afterwards visited <NAME> , where the natives gave him the most appreciative welcome .
0	Now that we had actually started , I began to believe in the reality of the undertaking !
0	I have endeavoured in vain to trace the origin , or cause of formation of this extraordinary association , and have reason to suppose , that it is now unknown to the generality of the <NAME> , and may possibly be even so to the Purrah themselves , in a country where no traditionary records are extant , either in writing or in song . ''
0	<NAME> offered no farther opposition ; it would always be in his power to put in his word when the stances should be more propitious .
0	They are about fifty in number .
0	There was nothing more to be done but for each to take his place before the fog should be completely dissipated .
0	There , among others , rose , to a height of nearly 200 feet above the ground , some of those superb coniferæ , to which , in <NAME> , the natives give the name of <NAME> .
0	I began to think him particularly lukewarm and unenthusiastic .
0	<NAME> doubtless with sight which enabled him to pierce the obscurity , he was always in the thick of the fight uttering from time to time -- a sharp hissing sound , which was with him the sign of great rejoicing .
0	Further still , even regarding the velocity to be acquired , and granting it to be sufficient , the shell could not resist the pressure of the gas developed by the ignition of 1,600,000 pounds of powder ; and supposing it to resist that pressure , it would be less able to support that temperature ; it would melt on quitting the <NAME> , and fall back in a red-hot shower upon the heads of the imprudent spectators .
0	`` You do n't mean to say , <NAME> , '' observed M'Nicholl , `` that <NAME> has seen this very one ? ''
0	On being informed that the corvette was on a voyage of discovery , he inquired , `` Have you doubled <NAME> or did you come round the Cape of <NAME> ? ''
0	The agile <NAME> was soon upon his feet again , and lost no time in knocking down two of his long-gowned adversaries with his fists and a vigorous application of his toes ; then , rushing out of the pagoda as fast as his legs could carry him , he soon escaped the third priest by mingling with the crowd in the streets .
0	Why , madam , the Indians are not anthropophagi !
0	<NAME> was soon back , bringing no answer except that the professor had told him that “ to-day was the 125th of June , and that to-morrow would be the 1st of July. ” Consequently , <NAME> and the count took it for granted that <NAME> declined their invitation .
0	`` It shall be done , captain , '' answered <NAME> .
0	But not being contented with simply the produce , they made chase after the producers , the result of which was that they were able to bring back to <NAME> a dozen of these chelonians , which were really valuable in an alimentary point of view .
0	The solution of the most complicated problems of mathematical science was but sport to him .
0	that is the perfection of vessels !
0	“ At a distance there ’ s no great difference , ” remarked <NAME> .
0	However , the raft had reached the middle of the river , about half a mile from the starting point .
0	The chief of <NAME> allowed his visitors to take his portrait in full martial costume , thereby showing his superiority to his subjects , who would not do the same for fear of witchcraft .
0	Near this piece of furniture , I saw a chest bound with iron , on the cover of which was a copper plate , bearing the cypher of the <NAME> with its device .
0	The expedition next sent out under the command of <NAME> Dumont d'Urville was merely intended by the minister to supplement and consolidate the mass of scientific data collected by <NAME> in his voyage from 1822 to 1824 .
0	DURING <NAME> FEW days which followed nothing occurred worthy of note .
0	This land is situated on the same parallel as <NAME> , in 41 degrees 40 minutes , but its climate is much colder .
0	There was a well-organized police , and a system of relays which worked with perfect regularity , and enabled the sovereign to transmit his orders with rapidity from one end of the empire to the other .
0	The fate of the whole party would hang in the balance for the ten minutes required to pass along that ridge .
0	It could not fly ; it could hardly walk .
0	If <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> had survived , it was because , assembled under their tent , they had been hurled into the sea at the instant when the fragments of the island rained down on every side .
0	The disc only presented to the travelers ' gaze one half brilliantly lit up , while the other disappeared in the darkness .
0	Many of the former came on board , and showed so much confidence in their visitors as to remain all night , though the vessel was still in motion .
0	<NAME> , it was the proceeding employed by <NAME> , and the first metallurgists of the inhabited world .
0	My two sailors received me half dead .
0	We must follow the <NAME> , who seemed to guide him self by paths known only to himself .
0	said <NAME> , `` if the earthly <NAME> were to be named over again , the name of <NAME> would suit it to a miracle ! ''
0	It even numbers two thousand three hundred and ninety-three souls , allowing one soul to each inhabitant .

0	This group covers an area of 370 square leagues , and it is formed of sixty groups of islands , among which the <NAME> group is remarkable , over which <NAME> exercises sway .
0	48 , would deliver a lecture on Mormonism in car No .
0	Turtle-doves existed there in great quantities , and tortoises , and sea-turtles , of an extraordinary size abounded , thence the name given by the <NAME> to this group .
0	A decided resolution was therefore immediately taken .
0	You are the only man among us whose head is fire-proof , blast-proof , and powder-proof .
0	Judging from the outline of the shore , a large sea , at that time wholly frozen , stretched out farther than eye could reach in the west ; on the east it was limited by a rounded coast , cut into by numerous estuaries , and rising suddenly about two hundred yards from the shore ; it formed a large bay , full of dangerous rocks , on which the <NAME> had been wrecked ; far off on the land rose a mountain , which the doctor conjectured to be about three thousand feet high .
0	for each man , for every degree .
0	The yacht was evidently making her way in the direction of the former mouth of the <NAME> , and the captain was struck with the idea that he would do well to investigate whether there was any suitable mooring towards which he might signal her .
0	<NAME> had complete command over himself .
0	This recital will destroy many illusions and surmises ; but it will give a true idea of the singular changes in store for such an enterprise ; it will bring out the scientific instincts of <NAME> , the industrious resources of <NAME> , and the audacious humor of <NAME> .
0	And the <NAME> , too , his strength and patience at an end , appeared no more .
0	Yes , and I had not been dreaming !
0	At present , the colonists had reason on their side against <NAME> .
0	`` I 'll never answer a question reasonable or unreasonable , unless it is asked in a proper manner ! ''
0	The valley of the <NAME> was already sunk in shadow , and night was fast drawing her mantle over the eastern slopes of the Andes .
0	Only by the exercise of wonderful patience and tact were the <NAME> able to avert bloodshed on this emergency .
0	He spent five months in <NAME> , and then set sail for <NAME> ; but the winds were again unfavourable , and after undergoing great hardships he landed at the town of <NAME> of the present day ; then having spent some time at Nankin he returned to Fi-an-foo , his native town , after an absence of eighteen months .
0	and that is why I took refuge here , as the malefactors used to flee to the sanctuaries in the middle ages. ” “ God be praised ! ” said <NAME> , lifting her hands to heaven .
0	And this had brought him to his present state , this was the source of his passionate pity for the fate of the imaginary shipwrecked mariners !
0	It is known that the elements of modern batteries are generally composed of retort coal , zinc , and copper .
0	The wish of the dying <NAME> was so urgent that resistance became impossible .
0	There she would leave the former river , after having descended it for nearly three hundred miles , to ascend the latter for a full three hundred .
0	They were almost famished : fortunately , the larder was not far off , and <NAME> was noted for being an expeditious cook .
0	The question was , whether a chimney could be discerned between the two masts of the vessel , which was now at a distance of only five miles .
0	<NAME> <NAME> , the mate , the boatswain , <NAME> , and <NAME> , whom I accompanied , went up again towards the schooner in order to make a minute investigation of the hull .
0	suddenly exclaimed <NAME> , `` it is not one whale ; there are ten -- there are twenty -- it is a whole troop !
0	All regarded him with profound emotion .
0	But that is almost as much as can be said for it .
0	`` That is all very well , '' said <NAME> , who had not yet spoken , `` and I 'm much obliged to the doctor for his information ; but we are talking as if we had to endure torrid heats .
0	But after scaling the wall of the <NAME> , it did not terrify us .
0	On the 7th of April , 1774 , <NAME> sighted the <NAME> group , after seeking them in vain for five consecutive days in the different positions assigned to them by geographers .
0	The end of the bridge which rested on the right bank of the <NAME> was to be firm , but the other end on the left bank was to be movable , so that it might be raised by means of a counterpoise , as some canal bridges are managed .
0	What had fate in store for these daring adventurers ?
0	The reporter could not affirm it , but he and his companions almost despaired of the result .
0	The postilions , stimulated by a promise of a princely <NAME> , drove rapidly along over a well-kept road .
0	“ At the least , my Lord .
0	To modify the conditions of the <NAME> ’ s movement is beyond the powers of man .
0	The <NAME> fleet was defeated , and <NAME> had much difficulty in regaining the <NAME> coast in January , 1568 .
0	At heart he knows perfectly well that he IS going. ” “ By <NAME> ! ” said <NAME> , “ I swear -- ” “ Swear to nothing , friend <NAME> ; you have been ganged and weighed -- you and your powder , your guns , and your bullets ; so don ’ t let us say anything more about it. ” And , in fact , from that day until the arrival at <NAME> , <NAME> never opened his mouth .
0	`` And I reply again , '' answered <NAME> .
0	On the 4th of December , when the travelers awoke after fifty-four hours ' journey , the chronometer marked five o'clock of the terrestrial morning .
0	One day <NAME> said to the girl , “ You never speak to me of my mother , Nadia. ” His mother !
0	Two days afterwards we were to start from the <NAME> de la <NAME> .
0	“ For at least two hundred and fifty or three hundred years. ” “ That is reassuring for us , but a bad look-out for our great-grandchildren ! ” observed <NAME> .
0	Upon the 2nd of November Surville descried an island , which received the name of <NAME> , from the contrary winds which for three days checked the progress of the ship .
0	“ Look , father ! ” <NAME> was not mistaken .
0	`` Have you no need of my services , sir ? ''
0	<NAME> replied that he was astonished to see the plains so saturated with water .
0	That this was the case appeared undoubted a few days after the return of <NAME> and <NAME> to the <NAME> .
0	Is this Miss -- ” “ Yes , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> ; “ this is <NAME> and her brother , the two children condemned to orphanage by the cruel <NAME> ! ” “ Oh !
0	If , moreover , she had at her disposal only the money necessary for a journey taken under ordinary circumstances , how could she manage to accomplish it under conditions which made it not only perilous but expensive ?
0	<NAME> and <NAME> were first of all told to extract the grease from the dugong , and to keep the flesh , which was destined for food .
0	The <NAME> went at a rapid pace .
0	cried the <NAME> , gesticulating well enough _à l'étudiant_ , but rather mixing his metaphors .
0	On that day the thermometer fell to three degrees below zero .
0	It was easy to see that it was composed of blocks of all sizes , from twenty to three hundred feet in height , and of all shapes , round like towers , prismatic like steeples , pyramidal like obelisks , conical like factory chimneys .
0	It will be seen that he was an original , and it will be seen also how much <NAME> had lost by the death of Judge <NAME> , inasmuch as his case would come before this not very agreeable judge .
0	The <NAME> , then , had not been observed on her arrival ; this was all the better .
0	We shall do capital here. ” “ Especially when there is a good fire blazing on the hearth , for we are quite as cold as we are hungry .
0	An observation had just given 55° 7 ' latitude and 41° 13 ' longitude .
0	“ And now , gentlemen , we have to see what these coins weigh here upon Gallia. ” He suspended the money bag to the hook ; the needle oscillated , and stopped .
0	`` Perhaps for the travellers as well ! ''
0	These three men had been hurled overboard by a collision which had taken place between the “ Nautilus ” and the <NAME> frigate “ <NAME> , ” which had chased her .
0	The night passed without incident , and on the next day , the 15th of February , the journey through the forest , rather tedious than difficult , was continued .
0	Some fine day , the wind left the seed of a palm on it , and the seed has taken root and grown as though it were on the plain ground. ” “ A fine new style of gardening , ” said <NAME> , “ and I ’ ll import the idea to <NAME> .
0	The maternal sentiment did not seem to Laing to be very fully developed amongst the people of <NAME> , for he was twice roundly abused by women for refusing to buy their children of them .
0	Soon the ice began to break up rapidly , and it became imprudent to venture upon the plain without a staff to sound the passages ; for fissures wound in spirals here and there .
0	Mountebanks , gypsies , <NAME> , <NAME> , mingled with merchants from <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , filled the court and offices of the police station .
0	The two were in incessant communication .
0	The balloon rose a hundred feet or so , and , aided by the cylinder , soon passed above the surrounding summits .
0	I do n't know what irresistible motive induced me to interfere personally , and once again to protest !
0	There flows the <NAME> , a little affluent of the <NAME> , which passes near <NAME> before losing itself in one of the great northern arteries .
0	This fearful revelation took them like a stroke of apoplexy .
0	On Saturday , the 20th June , at six o'clock in the evening , we reached <NAME> , a small town picturesquely situated on the shore of the ocean ; and here the guide asked for his money .
0	<NAME> recounted , with an assurance which never failed , numerous fictitious events of his journey .
0	“ It is I , <NAME> ! ” said <NAME> “ Yes , it is you , captain , ” replied <NAME> , without the least sign of surprise at <NAME> ’ s recovery .
0	But it is not enough to have kicked him out .
0	“ If I had to fight him , it was God that struck him , and his body ought not to go unburied ! ” And so orders were given to the second pirogue to recover the corpse , and take it to the bank to await its burial .
0	They took the precaution to barricade the entrance , but the bears could easily have overcome the obstacles if the idea had occurred to them ; they knew the number and strength of their adversaries , and they could easily have reached them .
0	<NAME> established himself at <NAME> ; although he was an old man , his wife was still young .
0	Its left scuttle was even cracked by a violent shock .
0	quick ! ” And these daring men did not hesitate a moment to avail themselves of this last desperate means of escape .
0	At <NAME> , <NAME> was relieved of half his property by the envoys of the king , under pretence of making him pay for the right to pass through his kingdom .
0	Might there not be rather a malevolent intention to thwart <NAME> ’ s plans ?
0	His master 's last exploit , the consequences of which he ignored , enchanted him .
0	At this juncture , thirty of the crew became incapable of performing their duty .
0	<NAME> and water were easily procurable there .
0	At midnight the steppe was profoundly dark .
0	According to my idea , we must see in this appellation of the <NAME> Sea a translation of the <NAME> word ` <NAME> ' ; and if the ancients gave it that name , it was on account of the particular colour of its waters . ''
0	What became of them after that ? -- '' `` I will tell you what became of them , '' said <NAME> in an energetic voice .
0	The Nanay with its left bank bounded it to the north for about a mile , and for nearly the same distance to the east it ran along the bank of the larger river .
0	`` Yes , a little , '' growled <NAME> ; `` so little that I have already quite finished breakfast .
0	My notion was that , as he either could not or dared not wind up so extraordinary a work of imagination , <NAME> had given it to be understood that he had not received the last three chapters from <NAME> , whose life had ended under sudden and deplorable circumstances which <NAME> did not make known .
0	<NAME> , properly so called , is composed of two distinct towns : one which is exclusively inhabited by the authorities and officials ; the other more especially devoted to the <NAME> merchants , although , indeed , the trade of the town is of small importance .
0	You 're as bad as the rest of us !
0	`` No , no , '' replied <NAME> ; `` I shall stop at <NAME> -- at least for some days . ''
0	“ We have neither <NAME> bark , nor sulphate of quinine. ” “ No , ” said <NAME> , “ but there are willows on the border of the lake , and the bark of the willow might , perhaps , prove to be a substitute for quinine. ” “ Let us try it without losing a moment , ” replied <NAME> .
0	“ <NAME> ! ” cried <NAME> ; “ for a simple merchant , <NAME> , you handle the hunter ’ s knife in a most masterly fashion. ” “ Most masterly , indeed , ” added <NAME> .
0	`` I can feel the window with my hand ; but for all I can see , I might as well be over head and ears in a hogshead of ink . ''
0	A fact indeed ; and it was this counter-current by which the <NAME> profited .
0	`` Also , '' says <NAME> , `` there was perhaps no other country in the world where the obedience and submission of the subjects was carried further .
0	He picked it up and turned it over and over .
0	Professor Agassiz very properly protested against the pretended unhealthiness o the climate of a country which is destined to become one of the most active of the world ’ s producers .
0	It is really a city with straight rows of houses and quite wide streets .
0	The exhausted mine was like the body of a huge fantastically-shaped mastodon , from which all the organs of life have been taken , and only the skeleton remains .
0	There was food enough to sustain ten persons for fifteen days , or the dead man forever .
0	I believe I shall end by thinking , like <NAME> , that the evil demon of the mine revenges himself on us for having invaded his domain. ” <NAME> was allowed to hear as little as possible of these discussions .
0	The wind had died away completely with the twilight .
0	`` A convict vessel is not disciplined like a man-of-war !
0	These people have the following strange custom : when a man has been condemned and put to death , they take the body , cook , and eat it ; but in the case of a natural death they do not eat the body .
0	This shooting globe suddenly appearing in shadow at a distance of at most 200 miles , ought , according to <NAME> , to have a diameter of 2,000 yards .
0	`` <NAME> has no right to wet us in this country , '' he used to say ; `` it ought to appear only as a solid , or a gas ; as to its being liquid , it 's absurd !
0	Its base was turning away slowly and steadily from the <NAME> , and pointing surely and unmistakably towards the <NAME> .
0	It is the only injury the <NAME> has sustained .
0	`` But , in admitting that the sun does not go out , might it not happen that the earth might move away from it ? ''
0	( 1 ) The <NAME> word is _banquise_ , which means the vast stretch of icebergs farther south than the barrière or ice wall .
0	By means of some fragments of cordage , he had again made the raft seaworthy .
0	And he drew quickly back , gliding like a savage into the thickest underwood .
0	It was just before we left <NAME> that I came to this decision .
0	The guide made her drink a little brandy and water , but the drowsiness which stupefied her could not yet be shaken off .
0	Perhaps even this water , having to contend against the accumulated subterraneous fires of the interior of the earth , had become partially vaporized .
0	The corpses of Kara-Tete and his wife were raised , the limbs were bent , and laid against the stomach according to the <NAME> usage ; then came the funeral , not the final interment , but a burial until the moment when the earth had destroyed the flesh and nothing remained but the skeleton .
0	“ Do you know what this plant is ? ” asked <NAME> of the sailor .
0	The expedition directed by M. d ’ Escayrac de <NAME> made an equally unsuccessful attempt to reach the famous sources of the Nile .
0	`` We shall return to-morrow , '' replied <NAME> , `` but it is necessary that I should go to the corral .
0	Where should it be celebrated ?
0	Even the <NAME> would leave its bed and float away into space .
0	`` You are free , monsieur ; but I shall not go with you .
0	They took them , looked at them as if they had never seen such things before , and threw them aside with an angry air . ''
0	At the bottom of the ladder was a deck , lighted by electricity .
0	The officers of the quarter-deck hurried to the after-part of the vessel .
0	`` No , sir , you shall not go alone , '' cried the captain , touched in spite of himself .
0	The traveller at once fell ill and became so weak that it was impossible for him to resort to a country place .
0	The happy ones coming from the hands of <NAME> went proudly from one house to another , showed themselves off without daring to shake themselves , like the big children that they were .
0	Lastly , yards , masts , boom , spars , oars , etc. , were all furnished by the first week in October , and it was agreed that a trial trip should be taken round the island , so as to ascertain how the vessel would behave at sea , and how far they might depend upon her .
0	ignorant and barbarous brethren , whom religion alone can instruct and civilize. ” Dr. <NAME> , yielding to the priest ’ s request , talked to him long and fully about <NAME> .
0	But they found nothing , some curious formations of the rocks having deceived them .
0	Finding the impossibility of rallying his squadron , he sailed along the west coast of <NAME> , as far as the strait which was soon to be called <NAME> ' <NAME> , and penetrated as far as the <NAME> of <NAME> .
0	This individual said , in a rough and hardly intelligible voice , -- `` <NAME> , I have to make a proposal to you . ''
0	The previous escape was doubtless owing to some slight , though unaccountable , modification in the rate of motion ; but whether the inhabitants of the earth had fared so fortunately , was a question that had still to be determined .
0	A profound darkness ensued , which favored his flight .
0	<NAME> <NAME> and his companions ran up to them .
0	`` The poor man must no doubt have been in this state for a long time , '' said <NAME> .
0	said I , `` it no longer changes its place ? ''
0	Some were wrestling , others on horseback mixed with the pedestrians .
0	My books -- my accounts ! -- '' With these words he sprang from his bed towards a book in which the names of his customers and the articles which had been sold to them were inscribed .
0	On this day the two lovers -- one might say , the two betrothed -- were seated upon the verdant bank .
0	We shall follow his fortunes hereafter .
0	`` Not to anybody , '' I protested .
0	“ But I think I heard you mention a village at the confluence of these rivers. ” “ Yes , ” said the geographer , “ here it is , marked on <NAME> ’ s map .
0	At the same time they had got an animal of whom a naturalist would have made more than did the cook .
0	<NAME> , his iron-tipped spear in his hand , wished to go to <NAME> ’ s help , and attack the dangerous animal in its own element .
0	The travellers continued their journey southwards , rounding <NAME> , which they had first touched at its most northerly point .
0	<NAME> was surrounded by a detachment of <NAME> soldiers , made prisoner with all his men , and taken to <NAME> .
0	He was ordered not to open the sealed packet until three years should have expired , when <NAME> would have completed the term of his mission .
0	This is an interesting fact , and a singular avowal for an <NAME> of the sixteenth century , deeply imbued with superstition ; it offers one more proof that the idea of the <NAME> is not innate , as some theologians have imagined .
0	These sand banks are considered to be the richest turtle grounds in the basin of the <NAME> .
0	The heath began to show timidly its little pale , rosy flowers .
0	During the evening many fin-backs were seen playing in the ice , and occasionally blowing .
0	<NAME> , father ! ” And the young enthusiast , whose imagination was already stirred , continued to her brother and to <NAME> : “ Let us be off to the library !
0	Now , this wall is seamed with fissures and clefts which already allow the sulphurous gases generated in the interior of the volcano to escape. ” “ Well ? ” said <NAME> , his brow suddenly contracting .
0	Top and Jup themselves no longer growled round the well or gave any signs of uneasiness .
0	And the provinces to which the river has given its name have acknowledged right to call themselves the healthiest of a country which is one of the finest on the earth .
0	On taking the bearings by the chart , I saw that we were passing the mouth of the <NAME> , and that our course was hurrying us towards the northern seas at a frightful speed .
0	<NAME> , more experienced , did not think so , although he was not a man to trouble himself about a small or great grievance .
0	<NAME> <NAME> , however , thought some vague streaks of intermittent light which were perceived in the night , between the 14th and 15th , probably proceeded from a volcano which might be that of <NAME> , as the crater frequently emits flames .
0	<NAME> <NAME> ever fall in with this great sheet of water ?
0	Then turning to the two reporters : “ Well , gentlemen , the time is come for us to separate. ” “ What , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ shall you not stop even for an hour at <NAME> ? ” “ <NAME> , sir ; and I also wish to leave the post-house before the arrival of the berlin which we distanced. ” “ Are you afraid that the traveler will dispute the horses with you ? ” “ I particularly wish to avoid any difficulty. ” “ Then , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ it only remains for us to thank you once more for the service you rendered us , and the pleasure we have had in traveling with you. ” “ It is possible that we shall meet you again in a few days at <NAME> , ” added <NAME> .
0	`` While wintering there , <NAME> 's officers explored all the neighboring coasts : <NAME> , <NAME> 's <NAME> ; <NAME> , <NAME> 's <NAME> , to the south ; and <NAME> , <NAME> , to the north .
0	`` Now then , friends , '' said M'Nicholl , rubbing his eyes but hardly able to keep them open , `` I 'm not over fond of talking , but this time I think I may offer a slight proposition . ''
0	And , as we shall not fire from the windows of <NAME> , the pirates will not think of causing irreparable damage by throwing shell against it .
0	It is the height of the tide , and I am anxious to study its curious phenomena . ''
0	`` There exist several explanations on the subject , M. Aronnax .
0	The reporter 's argument was just , and besides , the incident of the bullet proved that a shot must have been fired in <NAME> within three months .
0	The doubt caused me serious uneasiness .
0	At seven in the evening <NAME> had not returned .
0	<NAME> had evidently hit upon the only plausible reason of this deviation .
0	Her energy was evidently both prompt and persistent , and her calmness unalterable , even under circumstances in which a man would be likely to give way or lose his self-command .
0	I too much feared the counteraction of disappointment .
0	When the latter came to <NAME> he showed himself very ill-disposed towards <NAME> , who had abandoned the service of <NAME> , and who , at this very moment was procuring for <NAME> a commerce which would soon immensely increase the maritime power of an already formidable country .
0	On the 4th , however , the sea became more calm , and the storm lessened its violence ; the wind veered southward , and was once more favourable .
0	In a mystery every one found himself upon the earth again .
0	<NAME> <NAME> contrived to slip through the stowage of the hold , but his head swam , and , falling against a bale , he let his knife drop from his hand .
0	He was a man of fifty , a sort of sea-wolf , with big eyes , a complexion of oxidised copper , red hair and thick neck , and a growling voice .
0	In fact he had seen that <NAME> had said nothing about the document which formed the material proof of his innocence .
0	All lived cheerlessly enough in the village , mixing little together , and if they did meet occasionally , it was only at such times as the bell of the mission called them to the dilapidated cottage which served them for a church .
0	The engineer , revived by this rude shampooing , moved his arm slightly and began to breathe more regularly .
0	Either because there are people who are so wanting in politeness as to call it “ <NAME> , ” or for some more meteorological reason , <NAME> is subject to violent tempests .
0	Besides a sufficient stock of pure brandy , he arranged two water-tanks , each of which contained twenty-two gallons .
0	And then , you will not escape the spur of the <NAME> .
0	One winter 's night the old servant <NAME> served the supper , which , according to old custom , she and the young mechanic shared with their master .
0	<NAME> to be always well supplied with the products in most general demand -- coffee , sugar , rice , tobacco , cotton stuffs , and gunpowder -- and being at all times ready to barter , and prepared to deal in secondhand wares , he had contrived to amass considerable wealth .
0	If this was the case , it would be easy for the <NAME> to defend <NAME> , and any time gained against an invasion was a step towards repulsing it .
0	`` You do n't mean to say that you have any idea of the meaning of the scrawl ? ''
0	You are quite correct , it is the 26th of March. ” “ Strange ! ” muttered <NAME> .
0	They had one night in which to prepare for death .
0	Once , when somebody heard him muttering : `` He 's now seventeen days in the ocean ! ''
0	The king came to meet the <NAME> , and invited them to go on board his canoe .
0	To him I knew this would be the last fatal stroke .
0	but at the bottom of the valleys , and not exceeding a few hundred feet in height . ''
0	As things stood with the <NAME> , and even admitting that she could be floated again , an accident would have rendered her return impossible before the winter set in .
0	His family were rich , and having large commercial transactions they were able to encourage the taste for explorations which he showed .
0	On the 15th December <NAME> was sighted , and seven days later an island was discovered in the south-east , to which the name of <NAME> was given , and the position of which was fixed at 52 degrees 15 minutes S .
0	“ But he will make us a fire ! ” replied <NAME> , “ only have a little patience , <NAME> ! ” The seaman looked at <NAME> in a way which seemed to say , “ If it depended upon you to do it , we wouldn ’ t taste roast meat very soon ” ; but he was silent .
0	71 The beginning of his maritime career -- The command of the <NAME> entrusted to him -- Tierra del Fuego -- Discovery of some islands in the <NAME> -- <NAME> at <NAME> -- Manners and Customs of the inhabitants -- Discovery of other islands in the <NAME> group -- <NAME> off <NAME> -- Interview with the natives -- Discovery of <NAME> 's <NAME> -- Circumnavigation of two large islands -- Manners of the people and productions of the country .
0	74 degrees 15 minutes and W. long .
0	my father is there ! ” And the poor girl started up , and leaning over the side of the yacht , wanted to throw herself into the sea .
0	His object now was to raise within the center of the well , and with a coincident axis , a cylinder 900 feet high , and nine feet in diameter , which should exactly fill up the space reserved for the bore of the <NAME> .
0	A new discovery was made on the 5th of September .
0	“ <NAME> , who accompanies me , ” continued the count , “ has been most severely tried by the disaster .
0	asked M'Nicholl , who was carefully studying the situation .
0	They looked in vain for some harbor of refuge , and the terrified horses galloped so wildly along that the riders could hardly keep their saddles .
0	They are divided into two packets , about a foot apart ; <NAME> hangs a ladder of rope knotted to one of these , which answers instead of a parapet .
0	From this , our first real stage , we began to ascend the slopes of the <NAME> volcano .
0	said <NAME> , moving his jaws significantly .
0	and with what disinterestedness and enthusiasm must be embued the savants , sailors , and explorers , who give up all the joys of existence to contribute to the best of their power to the progress of knowledge and to the moral and intellectual development of humanity .
0	Would it not , before we proceed to set up winter quarters for seven or eight months , be better to leave the iceberg altogether , if such a thing were possible ?
0	`` But Mr <NAME> and <NAME> ? ''
0	During the first days of June , <NAME> was obliged to stop to repair the ships , of which the keels were much damaged by the shallow water on the coast .
0	`` Your explanation is ingenious , my dear companion , '' replied <NAME> , `` but inadmissible . ''
0	On the bed lay the body of a man .
0	But so irregular was the formation of the valleys that <NAME> was obliged to conduct the exploration in a strictly methodical manner .
0	But <NAME> bravely set the example , and <NAME> was not the last to imitate him .
0	<NAME> resounded , and the echo was repeated again and again till it died away in the dark naves .
0	Her absolute silence as to her former life , when by speaking out she might benefit us , proves to me that some awful secret , which she dares not reveal , weighs on her mind .
0	For once <NAME> had no reply to make , he and <NAME> resuming their walk in silence .
0	“ You can easily see , then , that time presses if we are to take part in these exploring labors .
0	All we could distinguish was a vast dome of white , which fell downwards from the head of the giant .
0	The traveller , who had great difficulty in keeping his daily journal , was obliged to resort to all manner of subterfuges to obtain permission to explore the neighbourhood of his house .
0	But <NAME> loved it ; the pastime was congenial to his temperament .
0	<NAME> feeling , you will say .
0	From that day I noticed with uneasiness that <NAME> 's ill-will towards <NAME> increased , and I resolved to watch the <NAME> 's gestures closely .
0	“ Let us take , for example , one of the words in the sentence we have just written -- my name , if you like .
0	But the subterranean sounds were too perceptible to allow of the supposition that it was of any great thickness .
0	The two vessels had as crew seventy-three jack-tars , who could be thoroughly depended on .
0	Within less than ten fathoms a floe was balancing on the waves ; it fell and rose like the launch , threatening in its fall to crush it to atoms .
0	But the joiners had soon to be replaced by carpenters .
0	We only thought of the future .
0	It was from the sides , by means of long boathooks or props thrust against the bed of the stream , that the jangada was kept in the current , and had its direction altered when going astray .
0	They had cold water , that is to say , the most powerful sedative that can be employed against inflammation of wounds , the most efficacious therapeutic agent in grave cases , and the one which is now adopted by all physicians .
0	<NAME> <NAME> , the governor , gave a cordial reception to the expedition , and at once took the necessary steps to furnish it with provisions .
0	The reporter leaning up in a corner , watched these preparations without saying anything .
0	I was tight bound , and did not succeed in changing my position an inch .
0	Five minutes afterward , and the horses were swimming ; the current alone carried them along with tremendous force , and with a swiftness equal to their fastest gallop ; they must have gone fully twenty miles an hour .
0	It must have been the glitter of those spangles in the bright flames issuing from the steamboat ’ s funnel which had attracted his attention .
0	too late ! ” But by a superhuman effort he raised himself up .
0	I could no longer judge of the time that was passing .
0	An important dispatch from <NAME> , it was said , was the cause of it .
0	“ While you soar to the heights , I plunge into the depths. ” “ Fare ye well .
0	When the exact sciences began at last to make some progress , watch and clock making followed in their path , though it was always arrested by an insurmountable difficulty , -- the regular and continuous measurement of time .
0	A dozen horsemen dashed forward , and the kibitka was surrounded .
0	At least I have not missed the steamer , which is the most important thing . ''
0	It was time ; the two icebergs met with irresistible force , crushing the whale between them .
0	We must put ourselves on rations . ''
0	<NAME> and <NAME> , having bought horses , had already taken the road to <NAME> , where events were to reunite the principal personages of this story .
0	“ Did you not weep ? ” “ Yes. ” “ I should have wept too .
0	<NAME> <NAME> in a balloon !
0	“ Because this document is a cryptogram , and -- -- ” “ Well ? ” “ We have not got the key ! ” THIS WAS a contingency which neither Joam Dacosta nor his people could have anticipated .
0	I knew not what to think , when a voice near me said : `` Is that you , <NAME> ? ''
0	But their corn was now entirely exhausted , and though they tried successively at <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> for further supplies , it was all in vain , these miserable little towns not being able to furnish more than enough for their own consumption .
0	`` Good beast , good beast , '' he would cry .
0	The doctor would gladly have gone out to reconnoitre , but how could he with such a wind raging ?
0	In order to make their way through some thickets , they were obliged to cut down trees .
0	This conversation between the officers of the <NAME> was kept up until nearly one in the morning .
0	The second stranger merits a more detailed description .
0	the cipher ! ” exclaimed <NAME> , mad with grief -- “ the cipher of the document. ” “ Do you know it , then ? ” shouted the judge .
0	Did he hesitate to speak ?
0	<NAME> fastened this to a well-feathered arrow .
0	If you dare , meet me there ! ” “ At Judge <NAME> ’ s ? ” said <NAME> , evidently disconcerted .
0	The sailor trusted <NAME> as he would himself , and his confidence was justified by the coolness and judgment of the lad .
0	<NAME> to pacify him , <NAME> assured him that every exertion should be made to procure the instrument , and directed <NAME> to go to the Jew and borrow it .
0	The comparison of our chart with that of the strait as laid down by <NAME> will suffice to show how much he left to be done . ''
0	The mouth of the <NAME> was reached on the 18th July , when the <NAME> , afraid of meeting their enemies , the <NAME> , at once returned to <NAME> , whilst the Canadians scarcely dared to launch their frail boats on the angry sea .
0	`` Lost her tail you mean , '' said <NAME> .
0	It is therefore not astonishing that many of his assertions were either rectified or denied after this more careful exploration .
0	To the traveller 's usual sufferings from heat , thirst , and privations of all kinds , was now added the pain of a wound incurred in a fall from his camel .
0	Their heads were covered with palm-leaf hats , they wore beards , and their hair descended to their waists .
0	<NAME> saw that he was locking himself in .
0	The temperature was not so low as during the preceding winter , and its maximum did not exceed eight degrees Fahrenheit .
0	<NAME> <NAME> , taken prisoner by the natives , owed to this sad circumstance his long residence in the country and the collection of the first authentic documents relating to the forests and the savage natives of <NAME> , the <NAME> , with a commercial jealousy which they were not singular in evincing , having until now kept secret all the information which had come to light concerning an island of which they were endeavouring to make a colony .
0	`` My nose does n't need your advice ; it does n't ask for it ; you 'd better mind your own business . ''
0	It could now be seen that one of the convicts held a lead-line in his hand , and that he wished to fathom the depth of the channel hollowed out by the current of the <NAME> .
0	<NAME> care to have all our weapons close at hand .
0	And <NAME> left her , for the tears were also welling up in his eyes and witnessing against the words of hope to which he had just given utterance .
0	After an examination of the ocean , I looked upward , towards the strange and mysterious sky .
0	Hence they were not averse to being put into harness .
0	Besides , we will watch , and we are numerous enough to repulse a fleet of <NAME> and other wild animals. ” “ We only want fire-arms. ” “ I have my revolvers , ” said <NAME> .
0	But think of <NAME> after <NAME> .
0	So the sailors were accustomed to climb into the chimney , whence , as from a watch-tower they could shoot the animals and drive them off .
0	<NAME> , more than mist , a thick yellow , mouldy-smelling fog .
0	No lateral gallery opened from the side walls of the pit , which was gradually narrowing into the shape of a funnel .
0	Just as the last growlings of the thunder were lost in the recesses of the mountain , <NAME> felt <NAME> ’ s hand pressing his , and he heard her whisper these words in his ear : “ Cries , brother !
0	`` You will be starved to death , '' she said .
0	As for wintering in that part of the antarctic circle , not a man of us could have survived it .
0	A long swell , which the canoe scarcely felt , as it was heavily laden , rolled regularly over the surface of the water .
0	<NAME> was buried with great pomp .
0	The faces of these half breeds were good-looking and pleasant in expression , and their figures were well-proportioned , showing unusual muscular development .
0	<NAME> and his companions were obliged to fire upon the natives in order to regain their ship , from whence they could examine them at their leisure .
0	The stones rolled and sparkled like fiery balls when they crossed through the gleams of light .
0	In fact , <NAME> after leaving <NAME> visited the province of <NAME> with its capital of the same name , and what struck him most in this country , ( and we can not but think that the bold explorer was also a keen hunter ) was the great number of lions that were to be seen about its mountains and plains .
0	The right bank of the river still continued to be the margin of the land , and only in one spot had its integrity been impaired .
0	`` Pardon me , sir , '' I resumed , `` but this liberty is only what every prisoner has of pacing his prison .
0	THE <NAME> DAVIS STRAIT .
0	“ Here ’ s our work , ” said <NAME> , “ and if we ever see <NAME> again , he will know how to make something of this labyrinth. ” “ We shall see him again , <NAME> , ” cried <NAME> , “ and when he returns he must find a tolerable dwelling here .
0	Your pay will continue as before .
0	“ Oh , ” cried <NAME> , his countenance full of animation , “ how I should like to thank him , he who saved you first , and who has now saved us ! ” “ Of course , my boy , ” replied <NAME> , “ so would I and all of us .
0	Their labours were now carried on with feverish ardour .
0	`` We have nothing to do but to go away , '' whispered <NAME> .
0	And , instantly , opening the upper valve , he let some hydrogen escape , and slowly descended , taking the ground at about two hundred feet from the edge of the oasis .
0	It was not a body abandoned to the waves ; it was a living man , swimming with a strong hand , disappearing occasionally to take breath at the surface .
0	Besides , <NAME> would never consent to leave his vessel .
0	Send your men to the forecastle , sir . ''
0	<NAME> soon reached the warm mineral baths at the foot of the <NAME> , which , at that time , were much frequented , the company having built a house near the mountains .
0	<NAME> , all observation , chatted with the pilot and acted as manager .
0	Without having uttered a word , in a few moments they had left <NAME> , and were standing on the beach .
0	<NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , the whole world belongs to the <NAME> .
0	Most of them being however absolutely illiterate , they could not turn their discoveries to scientific account .
0	The corral is only a store-house to them , and not a definitive encampment . ''
0	A forest of firs , growing on the bank , had supplied the necessary materials ; the trunks , fastened together with osiers , made a platform on which a hundred people could have easily found room .
0	<NAME> was the first to recover from the deadening shock : his levity came to his relief .
0	It was the crejimba , of the palm family , which does not bear edible fruit .
0	At the distance of half a mile was the entrance to the narrow bay , where was the landing-place for our tourists , who meant to return to Stirling by <NAME> .
0	It was explored thus to the very summit of the truncated cone terminating the first row of rocks , then to the upper ridge of the enormous hat , at the bottom of which opened the crater .
0	`` I do n't know , '' he said .
0	he said , in a hesitating kind of way , `` it really does not look like <NAME> . ''
0	His noble features , paled by the approach of death , were perfectly calm .
0	On the 30th March , <NAME> dropped anchor in 32 degrees 50 minutes in the <NAME> of <NAME> .
0	`` There is no winter there , '' he says ; `` a soil dry and fertile , with game , and birds of every species in great abundance , who filled the air with hitherto unknown notes ; it was a real concert for us .
0	In fact , all the grouse flesh had been consumed , and there no longer existed any means of cooking more game .
0	Had he been free , his master knew he would have fled away to the north as fast as his legs would have carried him .
0	“ Yes , ” said <NAME> ; “ and since this stream feeds the lake , most probably on the side near the sea there is an outlet by which the surplus water escapes .
0	<NAME> , thanks to the eddy produced by the prolongation of one of the spurs running out into the stream , the current was absolutely _nil_ .
0	Very soon the <NAME> , who had hitherto been content to place obstacles in the way of the travellers , approached them with intent to stop them .
0	It was indeed the boat which <NAME> had stolen , and it was simply smashed to pieces ; in a word , only the formless wreckage of a craft which has been flung against rocks by the sea , remained .
0	The crew of the <NAME> was composed of <NAME> , the master , and four hardy mariners , who were familiar with the <NAME> seas .
0	It was a detachment from <NAME> , composed of <NAME> horsemen , a race of the <NAME> type .
0	Notwithstanding the excessive heat of the climate , the thermometer rising in the open air to 45 degrees , and in the shade to 33 degrees , and even to 35 degrees , the commander and his officers carried on with unremitting zeal the observations and surveys which it was the object of the <NAME> to make .
0	`` Very simple , '' observed <NAME> , who always got muddled at any kind of a difficult sum in addition .
0	It was no longer doubtful that men at some period or other had visited this islet , and this became still more evident when paths appeared trodden through the forest , felled trees , and everywhere traces of the hand of man ; but the trees were becoming rotten , and had been felled many years ago ; the marks of the axe were velveted with moss , and the grass grew long and thick on the paths , so that it was difficult to find them .
0	On this very day , just as <NAME> and his party were on their way from <NAME> to <NAME> , the mail dashed by at full speed ; but though the horses were at a gallop , <NAME> caught sight of the glittering weapons of the mounted police that rode by its side , as they swept past in a cloud of dust .
0	But hang me , if I can endure your Algebra ! ''
0	The three travelers approached the orifice of the enormous cast-iron tube , and a crane let them down to the conical top of the projectile .
0	We shall run no danger of an explosion ; and it is necessary that our powder should take fire instantaneously in order that its mechanical effect may be complete . ''
0	“ From the province of <NAME> Geraes. ” “ And you were born -- -- ” “ In the capital of the diamond district , Tijuco. ” Those who had seen <NAME> at this moment would have been surprised at the fixity of his look which met that of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> had instructions to survey the neighbourhood of the <NAME> , where the <NAME> Government hoped to find a place suitable for the reception of the wretches then huddled together in their convict-prisons ; but the flag of <NAME> had just been unfurled on the shores of <NAME> and <NAME> , in King <NAME> 's <NAME> , <NAME> , the little Leschenault inlet , and on the <NAME> , so that there was no longer any reason for a new exploration .
0	<NAME> friends , how is that for high ? ''
0	`` I am perfectly certain that this gallery through successive layers of coal was not cut by the hand of man .
0	“ But have we still far to go to the northward ? ” “ One hundred and fifty miles at <NAME> ” “ In that case , ” said <NAME> , “ I ’ ll turn in and sleep a bit. ” “ Sleep , sir ; sleep ! ” urged <NAME> .
0	Their last hope , the vessel , had been shattered to pieces .
0	`` We should all fall into the sun ! ''
0	It is well known what inroads the <NAME> had made under Gengis-Khan , and in 1206 this chieftain had made <NAME> , an ancient <NAME> town , his capital .
0	“ We are too rich ! ” exclaimed <NAME> , “ But what are we going to do with all this ? ” And every moment burst forth the hurrahs of the delighted sailor when he caught sight of the barrels of gunpowder , firearms and sidearms , balls of cotton , implements of husbandry , carpenter ’ s , joiner ’ s , and blacksmith ’ s tools , and boxes of all kinds of seeds , not in the least injured by their short sojourn in the water .
0	It was therefore lower in temperature than the preceding winter .
0	It was now seen how advantageous the engineer 's arrangements had been .
0	`` Did you know , sir , '' he asked , smiling , `` that the sea contained such riches ? ''
0	A tear glistened in the eyes of the dying man .
0	From what the travellers could learn , it was pretty certain that <NAME> would not let them go without exacting a considerable ransom .
0	I tried mechanically to open the valve , but the unknown cut the cord several feet above my head .
0	The interests of commerce stimulated fresh explorations , and it was this motive that actuated two noble Venetians to leave their homes , and brave all the fatigue and danger of a perilous journey .
0	The native trees are only found on the edge of long prairies and about <NAME> .
0	`` And where is he now ? ''
0	Whither are we going , I ask ?
0	The terrible fall had begun .
0	“ What did <NAME> do ? ” he repeated .
0	I felt an insurmountable horror for <NAME> .
0	<NAME> <NAME> was overwhelmed by this new complication .
0	The engineer ’ s thought was at once understood .
0	When the others wondered at the doctor 's prescriptions : `` This is the land of these complaints , '' he answered ; `` the cure must be near the disease . ''
0	In many doubtful or dangerous places , it became necessary for us to be tied together by a long rope in order that should any one of us be unfortunate enough to slip , he would be supported by his companions .
0	Throughout this day ( Sunday ) the house in <NAME> <NAME> was as if uninhabited , and <NAME> , for the first time since he had lived in that house , did not set out for his club when Westminster clock struck half-past eleven .
0	For some moments there was silence under that dark and gloomy vault .
0	help ! ” -- Reply in French. -- The Morning. -- The Missionary. -- The <NAME> .
0	The inevitable consequences of such conduct are easily comprehended ; that night the thermometer fell below -44° , and the mercury froze .
0	The first of my perceptions which returned in full force was that of hearing .
0	`` After all , master , you are right , '' replied <NAME> , as if quite convinced .
0	But it was exactly this continuance of east wind which frightened the greater part of the sailors , who saw in this persistence , so favourable for the outward voyage , the promise of a formidable obstacle to their return home .
0	It ran about here , there , and everywhere , it clambered up one of the bulwarks of the raft , it leaped upon the sack of provisions , and then finally descended lightly , fell like a football and landed on our powder barrel .
0	Besides other things the nets brought up , were several flabellariae and graceful polypi , that are peculiar to that part of the ocean .
0	Was it simple chance which brought it to that part of the <NAME> , where the maps mentioned no land except <NAME> , which itself was out of the route usually followed by vessels from the <NAME> , from <NAME> , and from the <NAME> coast ?
0	The youthful maiden , hitherto entombed in the massive depths of the earth , had now obtained an idea of the universe -- of the works both of God and of man .
0	We have said that the different pits communicated with each other by means of long subterranean galleries .
0	Descending the left bank , the explorers began their march into the interior of the country , through districts consisting partly of swamps and partly of yam plantations .
0	Why , the heat of his stomach will melt the ice , and the bone , springing straight , will pierce him with its sharp points. ” “ Well !
0	No incident occurred during the cruise , and the two vessels cast anchor in <NAME> <NAME> .
0	murmured the engineer , leaping first up the ladder .
0	<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> reasoned thus with their simple good sense , and they acted as the best surgeon would have done .
0	During the three years and a half which had elapsed since their escape from <NAME> , it might be said that they had had everything their own way .
0	The window had hardly been open for longer than a second , yet that second had been enough to admit a terrible icy chill into the interior of the Projectile .
0	<NAME> was aware of the feelings of veneration with which the natives regard this great arterial stream .
0	He was so good to me and my sister .
0	“ Does not <NAME> please you then ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	He had besides sworn not to see his mother .
0	The sun was shining brightly ; the doctor held the lens so that the rays should be focused on the tinder , which took fire in a few seconds .
0	The minerals were on the surface , and had only to be picked up from the ground .
0	In addition to <NAME> , it comprised <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , canon of <NAME> , a secretary named <NAME> , a draughtsman , <NAME> , and the scientific <NAME> astronomer , <NAME> .
0	If we addressed them they replied , but if we continued our way seldom joined us in our excursions .
0	Here , then , was a fresh mystery .
0	`` But why , if you please , captain , '' asked <NAME> , knitting his brows , `` why should our hemisphere , as you say , be so badly divided ?
0	`` I begin to think that very curious things happen in <NAME> ! ''
0	The upper ladder , which generally hung from the door to the landing , was in its place , but the lower ladder was drawn up and raised to the threshold .
0	When <NAME> was on <NAME> , he knew the thermometer to fall to 56 degrees , ” said <NAME> .
0	In that latitude , the degree of longitude represents eight and forty miles .
0	Thirty years previously , the escort of a traveler of rank consisted of not less than two hundred mounted <NAME> , two hundred foot-soldiers , twenty-five Baskir horsemen , three hundred camels , four hundred horses , twenty-five wagons , two portable boats , and two pieces of cannon .
0	The sailor was wounded himself , but his wound was insignificant , as were those of his companions ; for thanks to their firearms they had been almost always able to keep their assailants at a distance .
0	After a short excursion inland , during which they visited the huts of the natives , which were shaped like beehives , the officers and naturalists prepared to re-embark .
0	Either the explorers had strayed from the right path on their return , or the narrow orifice , broken in the rock by the dynamite , had been recently stopped up .
0	<NAME> to the Coast -- Troops of <NAME> -- A new River -- The Reason the <NAME> was not felt -- A woody Shore -- Reptile Promontory -- <NAME> envies <NAME> -- Explosion of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> , far from being , as at the present day , an act falling under the ban of the law , was not only encouraged in that barbarous or half-civilized society , but was celebrated in the songs of the <NAME> , who reserved their most enthusiastic eulogies for celebrating chivalrous struggles , adventurous privateering , and all exhibitions of strength .
0	I have failed at <NAME> , and I have failed at <NAME> ; if I fail at <NAME> , my reputation is lost : Cost what it may , I must succeed !
0	The crew obeyed the captain and <NAME> because they gave no orders but such as were of urgent necessity .
0	He speaks of the inhabitants of <NAME> as clever magicians , who , by their enchantments , obtain the fulfilment of all their wishes as well as the power of stilling storms and tempests .
0	<NAME> was discovered -- no human being emerged from the opening .
0	They were well made and martial-looking , but wore no clothes beyond a kind of apron .
0	If I can persuade Kai-Koumou that we have expiated our profanation , that the wrath of the <NAME> has fallen on us : in a word , that we have died a terrible death , do you think he will leave the plateau of <NAME> to return to his village ? ” “ Not a doubt of it , ” said <NAME> .
0	But that which made him jump was the recollection that it contained the precious document , the loss of which was irreparable , as it carried with it that of all his hopes .
0	<NAME> meanwhile had advanced into much deeper water with far less floating ice , and had met with a great many Esquimaux of mild and hospitable manners .
0	“ Thanks to our friend , all that remains to be done now is to get to <NAME> , and look out for traces of the wreck on the western coast. ” “ Or the eastern ? ” said <NAME> .
0	There would have been great laughter at the Institution , had the mistake happened there .
0	The three Venetians remained a year in this large city ; it is easy to understand , from their long halts and deviations , why they required three years for their journey across <NAME> .
0	Did he understand that he had made a grave mistake ?
0	The balloon was raised to an immeasurable height .
0	People were restless who were never known to be restless before .
0	`` We ca n't be more than forty-eight hours from the <NAME> , '' said <NAME> , who could now begin to speak once more .
0	“ Ten. ” “ In an hour he may be here .
0	“ The truth is there ! ” he said .
0	Small heathers , rosy and white , peeped out timidly above the lingering snow , and seemed to smile at the little heat they received .
0	The animalcule that the marine polypus secretes live by millions at the bottom of their cells .
0	The asteroid passed several hundred yards from the projectile and disappeared , not so much from the rapidity of its course , as that its face being opposite the moon , it was suddenly merged into the perfect darkness of space .
0	This woody islet did not offer the varied aspects of <NAME> , arid and wild in one part , but fertile and rich in the other .
0	At the same time , on one of the highest points of the <NAME> , the <NAME> had a gigantic telescope erected , in order that they might be able to follow the course of the projectile through space .
0	`` Fear nothing , '' said the unknown .
0	<NAME> was evidently ebbing slowly , and his extremities were already cold .
0	Birds , subsisting only on scraps thrown out to them did not cease to follow the population in its migration , and so numerous did they become that multitudes of them had repeatedly to be destroyed .
0	<NAME> could not help smiling at <NAME> 's reply ; then , returning to his theory , said : `` Thus , in case of a shock , it would have been with our projectile as with a ball which falls in a burning state after having struck the metal plate ; it is its motion which is turned into heat .
0	It was <NAME> , and <NAME> brought me here , to my master ! ” <NAME> ended his account by saying what had been his grief at finding the inanimate body , in which he vainly sought for the least sign of life .
0	<NAME> too , as well as heat , could be modified , tempered , and _genialized_ if I may use the expression , by the air .
0	A circle of fire hemmed the <NAME> in ; the crackling of the dry wood mingled with the hissing and sputtering of the green branches ; the clambering vines , the foliage , all the living part of this vegetation , writhed in the destructive element .
0	`` Well , yes , <NAME> , I am <NAME> , there is a brig <NAME> , and it will sail . ''
0	“ <NAME> to me , <NAME> , ” continued <NAME> ; “ it is to your interest to speak .
0	Before anything else was done this boat had to be put in a safe place , because it might prove our only means of escape .
0	But nothing could oppose serious delay to our travellers .
0	`` Twenty-two minutes after eleven , '' returned <NAME> , drawing an enormous silver watch from the depths of his pocket .
0	The authorities of <NAME> gave <NAME> a bottle found on the coast , which contained a document bearing these words : -- `` This 26th April , on board the 'Froöern , ' after being accosted by the long-boat of the 'Jeune-Hardie , ' we were drawn by the currents towards the ice .
0	A great mass of ice , drifting northward with the tide , was rushing towards the brig with the speed of an avalanche .
0	“ I am here , ” replied <NAME> .
0	The thoughts of each one were about their situation .
0	Yes , but not for everything !
0	Besides his telephone , each reporter , as the reader is aware , has in front of him a set of commutators , which enable him to communicate with any desired telephotic line .
0	At the end of this room opened another smaller room , hung with cloth of gold , in which were 300 men of the king 's guard armed with poniards .
0	and the Ouest they reached <NAME> , where they went on board the <NAME> and crossed the <NAME> .
0	The fact was , the learned geographer after his heroic exploits , could not escape celebrity .
0	They left Khan-tcheou , and after riding for twelve days they reached the borders of a sandy desert , and entered the city of <NAME> .
0	His hand was lifted in a menacing attitude .
0	Now , just as I was writing , the newspaper was lying on the ground , folded in such a manner that only two syllables of the title were visible ; these two syllables were <NAME> .
0	“ What reply do you want from me ? ” said <NAME> quietly .
0	The shells were a little open ; the <NAME> came near and put his dagger between to prevent them from closing ; then with his hand he raised the membrane with its fringed edges , which formed a cloak for the creature .
0	At the bottom of the immense cavity burrowed hundreds of small extinguished craters , riddling the soil like a colander , and overlooked by a peak 15,000 feet high .
0	At night the tempest increased in violence .
0	As to bottles and tumblers , that was only play .
0	“ But suppose the change of axis throws the seas out of their existing basins ? ” “ And if the ocean level is lowered at different points , ” said <NAME> , “ some people may find themselves so high up in the world that communication with them will be impossible ! ” “ If they go up too high they will not be able to breathe ! ” said <NAME> .
0	All the inhabitants of the city had teeth of gold ; that is to say , they covered their teeth with little plates of gold which they removed before eating .
0	The ice-blocks appeared `` quite new '' ( to employ a perfectly accurate expression ) , and perhaps they had only been formed some days .
0	Before entering upon further explanation , he said that he counted upon the cordial co-operation of them all for the common welfare .
0	The most respectable men in <NAME> , with eyes blackened , noses bleeding , and collars torn , saw the inside of a prison that night for the first time in all their lives .
0	He is to keep you at <NAME> as if you were his daughter .
0	`` That , '' shouted the doctor , `` I know what it is ; let 's go look at it ; it will tell us of itself why it was put here . ''
0	But what epithets he lavished on them , including the names of all the saints in the calendar , when they behaved like docile and conscientious animals !
0	Just then <NAME> passed near me .
0	They were determined to struggle to the last minute , to do anything to retard their fall .
0	The raft took a sudden turn , whirled round , entered another tunnel -- this time illumined in a most singular manner .
0	`` True , '' replied <NAME> , `` and I do not fear an earthquake in the sense in which the term is commonly applied to convulsions of the soil provoked by the expansion of subterranean gases .
0	It was wonderful to see how rapidly the bottles of wine and the flasks of rum and of brandy were emptied , and to witness the speedy disappearance of the viands with which the table had been covered .
0	At length one night in October , 1864 , he managed to escape the vigilance of the natives , and took refuge in the depths of immense forests .
0	<NAME> was forced to guide himself by points which he selected at a distance ; sometimes he fixed upon a hill bristling with peaks ; sometimes on a vast iceberg which pressure had raised above the plain .
0	<NAME> , delighted at having found her again , approached the girl .
0	<NAME> <NAME> had estimated the average height of the chain at 22,000 feet , and even this would appear to be less than the reality .
0	On the 8th January anchor was finally weighed , and the second entrance to the strait was slowly navigated against the tide .
0	At that moment the trembling of the screw sensibly diminished , then it stopped entirely .
0	“ <NAME> , mind you give it a wide berth. ” “ Yes , captain , ” answered the sailor , throwing his whole weight on the great oar that steered the raft .
0	This population , however , fluctuates very much according to the season .
0	On the 19th of October , another fearful hurricane broke the mast of this vessel , which had then to make more than two thousand miles with incomplete sails .
0	`` I have slept very well , '' was my reply , `` but every bone in my body aches .
0	He had made use of his staff as a pole on which to fasten the <NAME> flag .
0	A vibration quivered through the atmosphere .
0	Since we are being borne along in space we shall end by falling into some center of attraction or other . ''
0	Then we will return with any who may wish to follow us to colonize it definitely , and endow the <NAME> with a useful station in this part of the <NAME> ! ” “ Hurrah ! ” exclaimed <NAME> , “ and that will be no small present which we shall make to our country !
0	Besides , we all began to get used to this kind of existence .
0	Now haul in the sounding line .
0	In consequence of the intense cold , their fingers felt as if burned when they touched the rounds .
0	What was their disappointment , when , after trudging nearly two miles , having reached an elevated point composed of slippery rocks , they found themselves again stopped by the sea .
0	The minister of <NAME> , who had seen <NAME> 's proposition well received by the <NAME> , decided to entrust its examination to a ship 's officer , who was accustomed to work of the kind .
0	Eyes and ears could not surely both deceive me .
0	<NAME> jockeys in this steeplechase , this hunt after information , they leaped hedges , crossed rivers , sprang over fences , with the ardor of pure-blooded racers , who will run “ a good first ” or die !
0	“ He is a brother that will never forsake us , never !
0	Yes , perhaps , and also appearances of land towards the south . ''
0	The boy ’ s heart sank ; the sailor had not been deceived in his forebodings ; the engineer , <NAME> , had not been found !
0	`` Never mind , '' I continued , `` let us fill our goatskin and gourds , and then try to stop the opening up . ''
0	He saw in <NAME> the man he wanted ; he presented his plans by an anonymous letter to him and to Dr. Clawbonny .
0	They set out accordingly about ten o ’ clock in the morning , <NAME> confident , <NAME> joyous , <NAME> murmuring aside , -- “ If , on my return , I find a fire at the house , I shall believe that the thunder itself came to light it. ” All three climbed the bank ; and arrived at the angle made by the river , the sailor , stopping , said to his two companions , -- “ Shall we begin by being hunters or wood-men ? ” “ <NAME> , ” replied <NAME> .
0	The time was then propitious for sowing this single precious grain of corn .
0	I hesitated before giving it .
0	<NAME> <NAME> might , by its very position , be considered impregnable ; therefore the corral with its buildings , its stores , and the animals it contained , would always be the object of pirates , whoever they were , who might land on the island , and should the colonists be obliged to shut themselves up there they ought also to be able to defend themselves without any disadvantage .
0	The water will penetrate into the reservoirs , and the <NAME> will gradually sink beneath the water to repose at the bottom of the abyss . ''
0	It was a dead world , such as we see it to-day . ''
0	It would be necessary to fell a half-mile square of the forest which was situated at the junction of the <NAME> and the <NAME> -- that is to say , the whole river side of the fazenda , to form the enormous mass , for such were the _jangadas , _ or river rafts , which attained the dimensions of a small island .
0	I was powerless , almost unconscious .
0	`` Yes , '' said <NAME> , `` and icebergs are met with in lower latitudes in the south than in the north of the <NAME> . ''
0	The depth of the sea is not great at <NAME> -- not more than some hundreds of fathoms ; but towards the south is a depression of 1,500 fathoms .
0	On the 17th they set out in the usual line of march , a line which it was hard work for <NAME> to keep , his ardor constantly compelled him to get ahead of the <NAME> , to the great despair of his mule .
0	“ These only thought of themselves , and not at all of travelers. ” Everyone inclined to the opinion of <NAME> except <NAME> , who congratulated himself on walking under shadeless trees , though all the time he was wiping the perspiration from his forehead .
0	For this purpose the frigate <NAME> was equipped at <NAME> , and the command was given to a most distinguished officer , <NAME> la <NAME> , who was to become vice-admiral in 1786 .
0	<NAME> , that the exiles would make common cause with the rebels ? ” exclaimed the Czar .
0	“ No ! ” at length exclaimed <NAME> ; “ to remain here would look as though we were abandoning my father and doubting his innocence -- as though we were afraid to make common cause with him .
0	End of the <NAME> EBook of <NAME> , by <NAME>
0	The vapors gradually condensed in diluvial rains , which fell as if they had leapt from the necks of thousands of millions of seltzer water bottles .
0	A large broad-bladed oar was fixed behind to act as a rudder in case the wind was sufficient to require it .
0	Now comes in the narrative a list of names , which are of no great interest : we may mention among them , <NAME> , whence the traveller returned towards the <NAME> ; and finally that he reached <NAME> , the residence of the <NAME> .
0	<NAME> howling for her breakfast !
0	In order to nip the evil in the bud , he had the mutinous captains seized , and notwithstanding their reputation and the brilliancy of their past services , he made them get into a boat , and abandoned them on the shore .
0	The _hällristningar_ , for so they call the graphic representations so often met with on the rocks of <NAME> and <NAME> , enable us to picture to ourselves these swift vessels , which could carry a considerable crew .
0	They offered the viands to her in their fingers ; and she had only to take the trouble to open her mouth .
0	It was not that any one of them regretted the fatigue they had so heedlessly endured or the dangers they had run , but they felt their hope of success was gone , for there was no chance of coming across <NAME> between the <NAME> and the sea , as <NAME> must have heard if any prisoners had fallen into the hands of the <NAME> on the coast of the <NAME> .
0	We will rather summarize the traveller 's report of the physical aspect of the country .
0	If free , would he attempt to fly , or would he remain ?
0	It is a formidable weapon in their hands , and one they handle with surprising skill .
0	During low water the natives roamed about near the <NAME> , but were not troublesome ; I heard them frequently repeat the word `` <NAME> , '' and by their gestures I understood that they invited me to go on land , an invitation that I declined .
0	Upon the morning of the 6th , after three days devoted to tacking about and reconnoitring the coast in search of a roadstead , <NAME> decided to cast anchor in the bay he had seen the first day of his arrival .
0	This demand could not be complied with as <NAME> well knew ; but upon the refusal he resolved to seize the town , fixing upon <NAME> <NAME> ' day for the attack .
0	[ Illustration : A soft voice said in his ear , `` Have good courage , uncle . '' ]
0	I am now in his game . ''
0	Having <NAME> in her power , she would have been the woman to torture her with all the refinement of a Redskin in order to wrest her secret from her .
0	As these thoughts were crossing his mind , a harsh bark was heard to the left of the footpath , and a jackal was seen emerging from a large grove of lentisks .
0	The moon had grown so large in their eyes that it filled half of the firmament .
0	This popular error as to distance had the happy effect of inducing navigators to try to cross the <NAME> , a feat which , had they been aware of the 15,000 miles of ocean separating <NAME> from <NAME> , they would scarcely have dared to attempt .
0	I tried to speak , but <NAME> stopped me by a gesture , and , picking up a piece of chalk-stone , advanced to a rock of black basalt , and traced the one word : What a light shot through my mind !
0	He plunged the body in the hole , and thousands of little prawns removed the flesh in small pieces ; at the end of half a day the work was half finished , and the most skilful of the honorable corporation of tanners at <NAME> could not have done better .
0	Upon its embattled walls floated the national colors of <NAME> .
0	No traces were found on the western coast , although they were carefully sought for .
0	Although it was apparently much nearer to <NAME> than the moon to the earth , its superficies was hardly one-tenth as large , and so feebly did it reflect the light of the remote sun , that it scarcely emitted radiance enough to extinguish the dim luster of stars of the eighth magnitude .
0	I looked at my companions ; they were armed like us , and , more than that , <NAME> was brandishing an enormous harpoon , which he had placed in the boat before leaving the <NAME> .
0	The <NAME> still wore his uniform .
0	If Madame the <NAME> becomes as cold as this every time that her surface is withdrawn from the sunlight for fourteen days , I do n't think , boys , that her hospitality is much to hanker after ! ''
0	Their chief is a hundred paces ahead of them and they are rushing after him at headlong speed. ” “ Whoever they may be , <NAME> , they are not to be feared , and then , if necessary , we can go higher. ” “ Wait , doctor -- wait a little ! ” “ It ’ s curious , ” said <NAME> again , after a brief pause , “ but there ’ s something going on that I can ’ t exactly explain .
0	I also found my cousin and affianced wife as warm on the subject as was her father .
0	As a precaution , the doctor had urged his companions to prepare themselves for some time beforehand , and to `` train '' with much care .
0	Measures were so skilfully taken , that when the sea rose to its height , all the officers and crew worked the capstan , and as the vessel was disengaged from the rock , it was ascertained that she drew no more water than when on the reef .
0	The hull of the <NAME> was just beginning to issue from the water .
0	It is impossible to conceive a wilder prospect , or a more savage and frightful one than this country from the sea , because from every point of view nothing is visible but the summits of rocks ; so close to each other that in lieu of valleys there are only fissures between them .
0	Thus they maintained a profound silence during their journey to the corral .
0	Top and <NAME> , the latter armed with his club , sometimes in front , sometimes beating the wood at the sides of the road , signalized no danger .
0	<NAME> <NAME> made up his mind rapidly .
0	The night is passed in temporary huts made of the leaves of the heliconia , brought on purpose .
0	This was the conclusion at which <NAME> arrived , after mature reflection .
0	`` And here shall I sleep the sleep of eternity , if -- '' replied the captain .
0	It was a dark night , with a strong breeze and a rough sea , nothing being visible but the occasional fires on shore , with here and there a lighthouse .
0	During the first day 's voyage , the admiral -- the title by which he is usually known in the various accounts of his exploits -- bearing directly southwards , sailed forty-five miles before sunset ; turning then to the south-east , he steered for the Canaries , in order to repair the <NAME> , which had unshipped her rudder , an accident caused perhaps by the ill-will of the steersman , who dreaded the voyage .
0	<NAME> was the last English ground on which he would set foot ; beyond , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> offered to <NAME> an almost certain refuge .
0	It was only too easy to recognize the letters of two names , arranged in two lines , thus : The <NAME> !
0	It was an island situated at the north-eastern extremity of <NAME> , and very near the coast .
0	`` What on earth is the matter with us ? ''
0	Finally , however , all was arranged , and the reception was as cordial as diplomatic customs permitted .
0	`` Well , sterile as it is , it supports a good many inhabitants , and among them are some civilized Europeans . ''
0	Ten warriors , armed to the teeth , kept watch at the door of Ware-Atoua .
0	The last named found himself at the head of a small fleet , consisting of the <NAME> , two sloops , the <NAME> and the <NAME> ; two schooners , the _Sea-Gull_ and the _Flying-Fish_ ; and a transport ship , the <NAME> , which was sent on in advance to Rio with a reserve of provisions , whilst the others touched at <NAME> , and the <NAME> .
0	However , after <NAME> had calmly surveyed the actual state of affairs , he determined to bring things to a crisis .
0	When it had rolled on , the men reappeared on the surface , and counted each other rapidly ; but all the horses , except <NAME> , who still bore his master , had gone down forever .
0	“ I am always wrong ! ” replied <NAME> , and he hurried on to finish his task .
0	With his strong hand he bent me to the ground , his companion doing the same to <NAME> .
0	replied <NAME> , checking the pulsations of her heart .
0	But an instant after his head was raised , and his expression was that of a man resolved to do his duty to the last .
0	We say `` probably , '' for the towns of <NAME> and <NAME> dispute with <NAME> and <NAME> , the honour of having given him birth .
0	Nothing could exceed the melancholy monotony of the hours which we passed in the midst of a fog so thick that the wind could not lift its curtain .
0	But this acid was wanting , and he would have been in some difficulty , if nature had not happily furnished the saltpeter , without giving them any other trouble than that of picking it up .
0	And then he had the curiosity to examine this flaw with a strong magnifier which he unscrewed from one of the telescopes .
0	`` Why may not there be something plausible in such a hypothesis ? ''
0	“ There she was , at a thousand leagues from the ocean which she was trying to reach !
0	O no , -- its wheels are good !
0	“ I ’ ll pay the villains off ! ” cried the sailor , shaking his fist in a menacing manner .
0	The last day they passed carousing ; they ravaged and stole everything , and it was during this drunkenness that <NAME> and two or three others set fire to the ship .
0	But this wager totally ruined him .
0	We may be very near the ocean . ''
0	The boat scudded thus northward during the whole day , borne on by monstrous waves , preserving always , fortunately , a speed equal to theirs .
0	Five minutes after , as it was getting dark , I heard the barking of a dog .
0	He had a few of all the coins of the neighboring States -- ten double-condors in gold of the <NAME> of <NAME> , worth about a hundred francs ; <NAME> reis , worth about as much ; golden sols of <NAME> , worth , say , double ; some <NAME> escudos , worth fifty francs or more , and some smaller coins ; but the lot would not amount to more than five hundred francs , and <NAME> would have been somewhat embarrassed had he been asked how or where he had got them .
0	It was a band of voters coming to the rescue of their allies , and taking the <NAME> forces in flank .
0	But the <NAME> , remembering what had happened to them in the <NAME> , refused the invitation while presenting compliments and excuses to the king .
0	There were deodars , <NAME> firs , casuarinas , gum trees , eucalypti , hibiscus , cedars , and other trees , generally of a moderate size , for their number prevented their growth .
0	At least , no one could complain that they had been deceived as to the nature of the goods .
0	<NAME> began to fall an hour after they started , a fine snow , however , which happily could not obstruct the train ; nothing could be seen from the windows but a vast , white sheet , against which the smoke of the locomotive had a greyish aspect .
0	<NAME> was the situation of these lonely men lost in the snow , enclosed in this vault with its walls rapidly thickening under the snow-fall .
0	But there was a much greater quantity of ice this year , and on the 17th of July , the expedition fell in with an `` icefield '' of such extent that it took thirteen days to coast along it .
0	returned the really astonished <NAME> , recognising his crony of the <NAME> .
0	Nevertheless , I think that we should return to <NAME> by the south coast. ” “ But , ” observed <NAME> , “ from <NAME> to <NAME> there must be at least another ten miles .
0	I saw clearly he was a dangerous individual , and I must take precautions against him. ” “ And since then ? ” “ Since then he has remained in his cabin without attempting to go out. ” “ That ’ s well , Tom. ” Just at this moment <NAME> and <NAME> were summoned to the saloon where breakfast , which they so sorely needed , was awaiting them .
0	He noticed , however , that the slope of the river bed was very abrupt , and he concluded that <NAME> had rolled beyond the eddy toward the center of the stream .
0	One thing was certain , that it was possible to reach the palisade without being seen , and also that it did not appear to be guarded .
0	On the left there comes the <NAME> and the <NAME> , flowing from the northeast ; and on the right the <NAME> , which joins the main stream twenty-eight hundred miles from the <NAME> , and can be ascended by steamboats for over two hundred miles into the very heart of <NAME> .
0	The <NAME> aborigines are gentle and inoffensive , never exhibiting the fierce hatred toward their conquerors which characterizes the <NAME> , and possibly a few of the races of <NAME> .
0	`` I know it , '' replied the burgomaster , in a tone of vanity very pardonable in the chief magistrate of <NAME> .
0	The mystery was about to be unveiled .
0	<NAME> , who had silently assisted at the ceremony , could not conceal the horror with which it inspired him .
0	At dawn next morning , all the slumberers started to their feet and rushed to the shore , shouting “ <NAME> , hurrah ! ” as <NAME> <NAME> ’ s loud cry , “ The <NAME> , the <NAME> ! ” broke upon his ear .
0	The expedition lost sight of land on the 29th of May .
0	One of the fears he entertained had been that , during his descent , the cord might be cut above him , but he had seen no projection from the walls behind which anyone could have been concealed .
0	Moreover , it was unnecessary to manufacture rigging , that of the <NAME> having been saved entire , so that the hull only of the vessel needed to be constructed .
0	The sea was as deserted as the land , and it was there , a few hundred feet from the coast , that the engineer must have found a tomb .
0	The rate of progress , however rapid it might be , can not produce any sensible effect on the human frame when it takes place in a vacuum , or when the mass of air circulates with the body which is carried with it .
0	Falling from the neutral point , the Projectile should strike the <NAME> with a velocity of more than 25,000 miles an hour !
0	It happened also , on the 23rd of November , that <NAME> made a joyful discovery .
0	`` Now , listen carefully , '' said <NAME> to the sick man ; `` we must know where this ship lies .
0	The distance of the projectile from the lunar disc was on the increase , and the details of the soil were being lost in a confused jumble .
0	<NAME> G. Lejean even reports that he has seen it carried on , openly , under the <NAME> flag .
0	<NAME> <NAME> , the physician , had plenty to do with the heartburns , inflammations , and nervous affections , which proved to what a strange degree the nerves of the people had been irritated .
0	It is composed of a <NAME> pile , which I do not work with bichromate of potash , but with sodium .
0	<NAME> and the <NAME> were crossed , and the explorers penetrated into <NAME> , which <NAME> was to visit a few years later , a district inhabited by a people as fanatic and fierce as those of <NAME> .
0	He busied himself with the numerous flock confided to his care , and spared his companions the trouble of coming every two or three days to visit the corral .
0	In any case , I shall trust rather to my own intelligence than theirs . ''
0	But it was certain that the projectile would not fall directly on the moon ; for its lower part , by reason of its weight , ought to be turned toward her .
0	His fate was uncertain until it was discovered by <NAME> .
0	<NAME> <NAME> declared that she seemed to him to be an uncommonly interesting kind of ghost .
0	<NAME> , taking off his hat , made a profound bow to both of his companions , without saying a word .
0	It is no wonder , therefore , that in honour of the man who did so much to make <NAME> known , the name of <NAME> should have been given to an immense flower native to it , and of which some specimens measure over three feet in diameter , and weigh some ten pounds .
0	“ No , I am not mistaken , ” he added ; “ it is a light on the horizon. ” “ A light ! ” exclaimed <NAME> ; “ show me where. ” “ Look there ! ” answered the lieutenant , and he kept pointing steadily in its direction , until <NAME> also distinctly saw the bright speck in the distance .
0	We saw fire across the forests several times , very far from the shore , and concluded that the country was well populated . ''
0	lat. , and 27 degrees 21 minutes W .
0	“ But that is not all , <NAME> .
0	All this was but a pretext for murders , raids , and pillage .
0	<NAME> grass took the place of the fine trees of the east ; only a few belts of half-scorched herbage still contended against the invasion of the sand , and the huge rocks , that had rolled down from the distant summits , crushed in their fall , had scattered in sharp-edged pebbles which soon again became coarse sand , and finally impalpable dust .
0	The elephant halted , lifted his trunk , and resumed his run toward the wood with all his speed ; he shook his huge head , and the blood began to gush from his wounds .
0	It was then eight o'clock , the hour at which their companion was to leave them .
0	Then her chattering was heard in all the streets of the neighbourhood , where she had long been known .
0	It would be too small for them , '' replied <NAME> simply .
0	But it is not the history of his success , but the history of his trials , which deserves to be related .
0	From the foot of the wall to the canal side was hardly a hundred yards .
0	That direction was at once taken , but again it was found impossible to cut a passage , and when night came the crew had to make the ship fast to a huge block of ice .
0	Would you like to visit one of them , M .
0	His eyes were fixed on the top of the volcano .
0	`` That , my dear boy , is nothing , and you will easily get rid of that source of discomfort by bringing the exterior air in communication with the air contained in your lungs . ''
0	They had then little to fear from the waves , which always endanger small craft .
0	However , they waited till the first boat was within range , when two well-directed balls threw its crew into disorder .
0	“ Shall I be able to find this head and heart ? ” thought the Czar .
0	Leaving the children to entertain each other , <NAME> began his address .
0	Now that a crowd of adventurers , attracted by the treasures which had been brought back to <NAME> , vied with each other in hastening to <NAME> , now that he could assemble 500 men -- after leaving an important garrison at <NAME> under <NAME> 's command , -- <NAME> had no further reason for delay .
0	But in spite of all , the storm raged with redoubled fury , and even the admiral feared for the result .
0	`` It 's only <NAME> 's apparatus that is of any use in such depths . ''
0	And , besides , this side , looking towards the east , is not exposed as the other is to the trade-winds , which in this hemisphere blow from the northwest. ” “ Then , captain , ” replied the sailor , “ let us build a house on the edge of the lake .
0	It was under the action of this cylinder , charged with some explosive substance , nitro-glycerine , picrate , or some other material of the same nature , that the water of the channel had been raised like a dome , the bottom of the brig crushed in , and she had sunk instantly , the damage done to her hull being so considerable that it was impossible to refloat her .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> , lying in the afterpart of the raft , bore this increase of suffering without complaint .
0	Certainly my trouble and agitation would have betrayed me to <NAME> 's eyes .
0	`` I believe you , '' added <NAME> , `` and these derelicts are more dangerous than a rock , for they are now here and again there , and there 's no avoiding them . ''
0	“ It is by their movements that the velocity of light has been calculated ; and they have been made available for the determination of terrestrial longitudes. ” “ It must be a wonderful sight , ” said the captain .
0	`` More than two thousand <NAME> leagues , '' exclaimed <NAME> .
0	The inhabitants were tall and well proportioned , alert , vigorous , and intelligent .
0	Suddenly <NAME> , taking a spring , left the floor and remained suspended in the air , like <NAME> 's monk of the <NAME> des Anges_ .
0	With this bill of fare , strict cleanliness was enforced ; every other day each man was obliged to bathe in the half-frozen water which the iron pump brought up , and this was an excellent way of preserving their health .
0	The respectable classes never go out except in the evening , unless compelled by some pressing circumstance or for the performance of religious duties ; and it is in the evening that the ladies especially show themselves .
0	He had only to live and expiate in solitude the crimes which he had committed .
0	There is nothing more to do here . ''
0	I detected a restrained irritation in these words .
0	`` I 'm ready , <NAME> , '' answered <NAME> ; `` if it were necessary I could easily build a whole city with houses and streets out of these blocks of ice -- '' `` We sha ' n't need as much as that ; let us follow the example of the agents of the <NAME> 's <NAME> ; they build forts which protect them from the wild beasts and the <NAME> ; that is all we need ; let us make it no larger than necessary ; on one side the dwelling , on the other the stores , with a sort of curtain , and two bastions .
0	They had been wise in unloading the <NAME> .
0	The <NAME> , recognizing the rights of individuals , did not attempt to change the religion , laws , or customs of their subjects .
0	The recollection of this book impressed him .
0	said I , looking at the leaden sky .
0	But Fourrier of <NAME> , a distinguished member of the <NAME> des <NAME> , whose _Mémoires_ on the temperature of the Planetary spaces appeared about 1827 , reduced these figures to considerably diminished proportions .
0	This meadow was to be surrounded by a palisade , high enough to prevent even the most agile animals from leaping over .
0	The three travellers uttered a short prayer over their companion , and at seven o'clock in the morning they set off again for the ship .
0	“ Whatever happens , do not leave this spot. ” “ You will find me where I now am. ” <NAME> pressed her hand , and , turning the corner of the slope , disappeared in the darkness .
0	In my present state of excitement and enthusiasm , I was always first .
0	Their territory included <NAME> , <NAME> , the provinces of <NAME> , <NAME> , and the <NAME> .
0	But all these appliances had been carried away , after the cessation of the works .
0	At sight of them he began dancing and singing and throwing dust upon his head .
0	His quiver was dangling at his side , his bow was bent , and an arrow which was pointed at our breasts already trembled on the string , when we were within a few yards of his person .
0	We must be particularly careful to guard against a rush of blood to the head . ''
0	<NAME> was seized with a desperate rage .
0	Unfortunately his explorations did not extend to that portion of <NAME> 's <NAME> which lies north-east of the strait , and which was only superficially examined by the <NAME> boats . ''
0	In truth , I was simply in the presence of a very ordinary product of the earth , of singular and gigantic proportions .
0	“ <NAME> , ” said he , “ we left <NAME> without permission from the authorities !
0	The doctor , unwilling to dwell on that subject , hastened to resume his reading .
0	179 , <NAME> , one of the quietest streets in <NAME> , far from the business quarter , for in commerce he took no interest ; far from the noise of the crowd , for the mob he abhorred .
0	By these two means they would be enabled to restore to the vitiated air its life- supporting properties .
0	Now , they had been talking in the room for a few minutes , when a light knock was heard at the door .
0	`` But not by a single ship , '' said <NAME> .
0	All the passengers had got out of the train , the wheels of which were stained with blood .
0	A long flame twisted and bent under the gale , on the summit of the old tower .
0	Suddenly <NAME> uttered a fresh bark and darted towards a gigantic bird which had swooped down .
0	<NAME> got up under our feet like birds in the long grass .
0	Two yards only separated us from the open sea .
0	Towards five o ’ clock day began to break .
0	<NAME> had asked to be allowed to “ blow ” in his turn , and it was great fun for him ; but he blew so hard that his productions took the most ridiculous shapes , which he admired immensely .
0	The very year of his return , on the 15th of May , 1501 , <NAME> , in pursuance of an order of the 15th of April , received provisions , and left <NAME> in the hope of extending the field of his discoveries .
0	All along this land there are other inhabited islands .
0	Harding instructed his companions in many things , principally explaining to them the practical applications of science .
0	On the 24th February , as the little squadron came forth from the strait , it encountered a violent storm , which dispersed it .
0	Whatever it may be to which the document refers , I have not yet given up discovering the cipher .
0	Looking back to all that has occurred to me since that eventful day , I am scarcely able to believe in the reality of my adventures .
0	A few horsemen were strolling up and down the road in front of the wood .
0	As soon as the quartermaster was brought into the presence of <NAME> , his keepers withdrew .
0	He was now in the latitude of <NAME> -- i.e .
0	The <NAME> was less than two degrees from the pole .
0	I am simply going to take you up above these clouds that are now deluging us , and remove you from this pestilential atmosphere .
0	He had put <NAME> at the helm , posting himself in the bows , inspecting the water , whilst he held the halliard in his hand , ready to lower the sail at a moment 's notice .
0	In our opinion these societies resemble the clans of <NAME> or the <NAME> tribes of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> as the thing seems , a noise -- a real noise , such as the town had certainly not heard since the taking of the donjon by the Spaniards in 1513 -- terrible noise , awoke the long-dormant echoes of the venerable <NAME> mansion .
0	<NAME> , it is well known , is only generated in coal seams ; therefore the existence of a vein of precious combustible could no longer be doubted .
0	and 151 degrees 55 minutes E. long .
0	<NAME> fish and animals seemed to form strange conjunctions .
0	Moreover , we had no cause to fear that the light would fail us during the sunny hours of the night .
0	No signs of cities , no signs of buildings , not even of ruins , none of anything that could be reasonably ascribed to the labors of intelligent creatures .
0	<NAME> made an observation with great exactness , and found they were in latitude 77° 15 ' , and longitude 85° 2 ' .
0	`` You are right , sir , '' replied <NAME> ; `` the discussion has become irregular .
0	His embarrassment and consternation had been great , when on arriving at the confluence of the <NAME> and <NAME> , he had not found <NAME> , who was to have been awaiting him .
0	They left off rowing , lest they should get farther from the ship .
0	Just as we were about to leave the little port where the raft had been constructed , my uncle , who was very strong as to geographic nomenclature , wanted to give it a name , and among others , suggested mine .
0	In 1863 , after a long and sanguinary struggle , the Maories were entrenched in strong and fortified position on the <NAME> , at the end of a chain of steep hills , and covered by three miles of forts .
0	The papers resumed their discussion about the wager ; all those who had laid bets , for or against him , revived their interest , as if by magic ; the `` <NAME> bonds '' again became negotiable , and many new wagers were made .
0	The ship was the <NAME> brig <NAME> , laden with timber , and bound for <NAME> .
0	A few sailing-vessels , on the road to <NAME> , were making for the Cape of <NAME> .
0	He was also included amongst the most active members of the <NAME> ; and the <NAME> frequently published clever articles signed by him .
0	In the mean time the doctor assured himself of the presence of a sufficient quantity of gas in the mixing-tank to feed the cylinder , if necessary , without there being any need of resorting for some time to the <NAME> battery .
0	`` In the steward 's room , I suppose , '' returned the mate , without stirring .
0	<NAME> indeed was now the joyful enthusiasm on both vessels .
0	All you had to do to understand the document was to read it backwards .
0	`` He came in order to be lost , '' answered <NAME> ; `` he brought his crew to death , like all those whose foolhardiness leads them here .
0	He fired his revolver , and two of the convicts fell ; but a blow from a knife which he could not ward off made a gash in his shoulder .
0	It must not be supposed that the doctor could entirely extinguish his cylinder , during these halts .
0	“ If those dresses were worn properly , ” said <NAME> , “ they might not be so ridiculous ! ” “ My dear <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ with your simple gown and straw hat , you are better dressed than any one of these Brazilians , with their headgear and flying petticoats , which are foreign to their country and their race. ” “ If it pleases you to think so , ” answered <NAME> , “ I do not envy any of them. ” But they had come to see .
0	The ships had sustained some damage , and fresh water was needed ; it was therefore urgent for them to find some harbour , which they succeeded in doing on the 10th of January , 1498 .
0	“ From the recitals of the <NAME> .
0	<NAME> , having by a rapid movement firmly fixed his hat upon his head , calmly continued his harangue : `` There is no one among you , my brave colleagues , who has not seen the <NAME> , or , at least , heard speak of it .
0	I don ’ t know a better fashion of traveling than in a mountebank ’ s caravan -- a movable house , which goes or stops wherever you please .
0	The supper was a dull meal , and neither appetizing nor reviving .
0	They surely did not start on a voyage which might be prolonged to an indefinite time without a proper supply of provisions !
0	were his stifled mutterings , as he struggled in the arms of the <NAME> giant who had at last succeeded in securing him .
0	They had been accustomed to count upon the intervention of that power which existed no longer , and <NAME> , and even <NAME> , could not escape this impression .
0	Doubtless he wanted to know to what <NAME> was coming .
0	The unmounted horsemen might walk , of course , as many squatters had done already ; but if they abandoned the wagon , what would the ladies do ?
0	`` I am not sure , '' says <NAME> , `` that the first sight of the llanos is not as surprising as that of the Andes . ''
0	Then imagine a fall from a height of four thousand miles !
0	This sight of course made the <NAME> still more anxious for reprisals , and the natives on their side had to avenge the death of five chiefs and a score of men .
0	On the 5th of January , <NAME> sighted the lands he had discovered in his first voyage , and between that date and the 16th he recognized various points , <NAME> , Re-union <NAME> , <NAME> , which in his estimation made more than eighty leagues of coast .
0	On returning to the surface , in the half light , he felt a living creature struggling near him .
0	<NAME> <NAME> was now made acquainted with the strange history of <NAME> and the colonists of <NAME> .
0	The colonists left the <NAME> .
0	<NAME> profited by these events to accuse the emperor of perfidy .
0	He will find his master ! ” “ Who ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	[ Illustration : `` The little band made their way towards the southeast . '' ]
0	The three friends looked and listened without speaking , and scarcely breathing .
0	`` By the bye , M. Aronnax you are not afraid of sharks ? ''
0	Manco-Capac had taught the men agriculture and mechanical arts , whilst Mama-Oello instructed the women in spinning and weaving .
0	Besides , by listening to them , <NAME> had understood that there were fifty on board .
0	There , very fortunately , for <NAME> saw that his provisions were becoming exhausted , he found in an oven a dozen “ pogatchas , ” a kind of cake prepared with sheep ’ s fat and a large supply of plain boiled rice .
0	Looking at the matter from every point of view , it did not seem to him impossible that , by some mistake , the man might have embarked on the <NAME> at the last moment ; and this was also <NAME> 's opinion , who regretted very much the loss of the worthy fellow to whom she owed so much .
0	It was a run of eighty miles , and was accomplished in two hours .
0	The whole southern slope of the <NAME> Alps poured its liquid masses into this single bed .
0	Three miles to the south the dim outline of <NAME> was to be seen .
0	> My typographic conventions : > There are a few lines longer than 80 character , usually because I have > inserted a { sic phrase } in the line .
0	`` Then , '' resumed <NAME> , rising with much dignity , `` the <NAME> on <NAME> , appointed by the <NAME> , solemnly assembled in the Projectile belonging to the aforesaid learned and respectable <NAME> , having carefully weighed all the arguments advanced on each side of the question , and having also carefully considered all the new facts bearing on the case that have lately come under the personal notice of said <NAME> , unanimously decides negatively on the question now before the chair for investigation -- namely , 'Is the <NAME> inhabitable ? '
0	<NAME> computes the number of inhabitants at three millions .
0	However , the only way to know was to examine the bottle , and <NAME> set to work without further delay , so carefully and minutely , that he might have been taken for a coroner making an inquest .
0	The waves rebounded in dazzling foam , the beach entirely disapppearing under the raging flood , and the cliff appearing to emerge from the sea itself , the spray rising to a height of more than a hundred feet .
0	`` Nothing at all , my boy .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> , particularly , were not contented with the mystery , but allowed their imaginations to wander into the domain of the supernatural .
0	Now you come to tell me that the bearer of this letter is in my power .
0	Am I right , <NAME> , maestro illustrissimo ? ''
0	After its departure from <NAME> the jangada did not stop anywhere as it passed down the much less encumbered course of the <NAME> .
0	Perhaps the thought of the gas , which was remorselessly burning at his expense in <NAME> , had something to do with his hot impatience .
0	In appearance , at least , <NAME> had agreed to light the town , which had much need of it , `` especially at night , '' as <NAME> wittily said .
0	`` And when arrived at this dead point , what will become of us ? ''
0	Of all the animals left here by <NAME> , the cats , now become wild alone , had survived , and thus far they had not destroyed the legions of rats with which the island was overrun .
0	<NAME> , slipping between the tall shrubs , got within reach of the suspicious shadows he had noticed about half a mile away from the encampment .
0	Seeing that they were not pursued , and conscious that they themselves had been the aggressors , they returned to traffic with the <NAME> as if nothing had happened .
0	I have done with society entirely , for reasons which I alone have the right of appreciating .
0	<NAME> made no immediate reply .
0	One token alone will remain with you of <NAME> , with whose history you are now acquainted .
0	`` Well , the brig is n't in the channel yet , I fancy ! ''
0	It is a sieve , whose interstices furnish a passage for the earth ’ s vapors in the shape of boiling geysers and solfataras .
0	<NAME> is situated in exactly 77 @ south latitude , and 16 @ east longitude .
0	This , however , was out of the question .
0	`` We shall see , stupid beast ! ''
0	monsoon before reaching the <NAME> , which form the extreme north of the <NAME> .
0	A perfect concord ruled the little colony .
0	In vain <NAME> tried to calm <NAME> , whose head seemed on fire .
0	It appeared likely that <NAME> would return to its habitual apathy , which that unexpected event had for a moment disturbed .
0	<NAME> then explained to <NAME> that he thought he ought first of all to stop the hemorrhage , but not close the two wounds , or cause their immediate cicatrization , for there had been internal perforation , and the suppuration must not be allowed to accumulate in the chest .
0	One of the ropes which fastened the barrels was partly unlashed and used as a cable to unite the floating apparatus with the canoe .
0	The <NAME> was no longer moving , the heat was becoming unbearable .
0	After my fall I lost much blood .
0	I must have walked like a somnambulist , without any knowledge of my steps , and <NAME> must have guided me here , after having dragged me from the waves ... Come , <NAME> !
0	62 degrees 20 minutes and W. long .
0	The situation did not change in the least , though a discovery I suddenly made seemed to complicate it very much .
0	`` It is a calculation the converse of the differential , '' replied <NAME> seriously .
0	356 FEAR , <NAME> ON CLAWBONNY 'S <NAME> , '' <NAME> .
0	Now it must be said that was what the commander thought ; he allowed himself to think that at the last moment he would receive definite instructions as to the object of the voyage , and that he would remain in command of the <NAME> .
0	You can well understand that there would not be water enough for my Nautilus . ''
0	The engineer and <NAME> , each armed with a double-barrelled gun , and <NAME> carrying his rifle , had nothing to do but start .
0	Then they began to act , each one as he thought best .
0	The only quadrupeds were pigs , dogs , and rats , who multiplied rapidly .
0	In a few minutes the half-breed had swum several cables ' lengths towards the boat in an oblique direction .
0	“ To the water ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
0	“ Would you like me to try and swim across ? ” said <NAME> .
0	In ten minutes it would be high-tide : and , if <NAME> had not made a rash promise , the <NAME> would be immediately detached .
0	A rope leads to the ground .
0	Some unseen and mysterious obstacle intervened and stopped me .
0	Consequently a <NAME> could catch an occasional glimpse of our Earth , without altogether quitting the dark side . ''
0	And lastly , to crown the repast , <NAME> had brought out a fine bottle of <NAME> , which was found `` by chance '' in the provision-box .
0	`` Accept this cigar , M. Aronnax ; and , though it does not come from <NAME> , you will be pleased with it , if you are a connoisseur . ''
0	But no pleasant sound of falling water fell upon my listening ear .
0	Seeing a canoe manned by not more than seven or eight men approaching the corvette , this `` _Shaki_ '' and the rest came to entreat D'Urville most earnestly to kill the new arrivals , going so far as to ask for muskets that they might themselves fire upon them .
0	<NAME> , on the 26th of May , in the midst of a fog and a snow-storm , the <NAME> found herself off <NAME> ; a lofty , steep mountain was soon recognized ; the weather got a little clearer , and at midday the sun appeared long enough to permit an observation to be taken : latitude 74° 4 ' , and longitude 84° 23 ' .
0	But as to entering the channel , <NAME> , contrary to <NAME> 's opinion , could not believe that she would dare to attempt it .
0	Three parts of this day I spent on the platform .
0	<NAME> <NAME> was inclined to think that such was the case , for the development of these storms was attended by the renewal of volcanic symptoms .
0	The passage of the <NAME> was thus open to the besiegers .
0	The nearer we approached the more nearly vertical became its slope .
0	As to taking you to <NAME> , is it not you , <NAME> , who are now taking me there ?
0	We must think of the present .
0	Even their decided novelty and very strange character produced any thing but a pleasing effect on the organs of sight .
0	<NAME> <NAME> provided for his wants as best he could , but during the first few months he had great difficulty in conquering the sadness and mastering the horror consequent upon his terrible loneliness .
0	Nevertheless , they saw , though unable to get near them , a couple of those large birds peculiar to <NAME> , a sort of cassowary , called emu , five feet in height , and with brown plumage , which belong to the tribe of waders .
0	<NAME> ’ t the name of the country strike you even in the mere mention of it ? ” “ <NAME> ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
0	They wished him to join them again , and relied upon his aid to enable them to gain possession of <NAME> , to penetrate into that hitherto inaccessible dwelling , and to become masters of the island , after murdering the colonists !
0	perhaps at that very moment the poor fellows were making their last and almost superhuman struggles to burst their watery prison and ascend once more into the cheerful regions of light and air !
0	D'Urville was greatly surprised to find that a good many inaccuracies had crept into the work of the great <NAME> navigator , and in that part of the account of his voyage which relates to hydrography , he quotes instances of errors of a fourth , or even third of a degree .
0	In a picture representing the poulp in question . ''
0	That day being <NAME> Day , <NAME> seemed to regret sorely the non-celebration of `` Christmas , '' the family fete of which Protestants are so fond .
0	To this confusion the discoveries of the <NAME> expedition were destined to put an end .
0	The substitution of electricity for steam as a motive power means the expenditure of coal just the same .
0	As for the <NAME> , they had no other ambition than to take possession of this new continent of the sky , and to plant upon the summit of its highest elevation the star- spangled banner of the <NAME> of <NAME> .
0	It was to the brothers Frobisher , fur traders , and to a <NAME> , who reached <NAME> , that their discovery is partially due .
0	The journey from <NAME> to <NAME> <NAME> consumed , formerly , under the most favourable conditions , at least six months .
0	I am cold , and I imagine that it is -- '' `` What , <NAME> ? ''
0	The aeronauts remained as they were , completely motionless , and lost not a detail of the populous city .
0	Each group of these booths , of all sizes and shapes , formed a separate quarter particularly dedicated to some special branch of commerce .
0	This reasoning calmed me a little and I began to hope !
0	Fifteen years ago I settled down comfortably at <NAME> with my <NAME> ; she has presented me with ten children , who in their turn will present me with grandchildren . ''
0	Why should I live longer , now that I have dispersed my existence over the earth ?
0	It is only a question of time. ” “ And how many months would be required to build a vessel of from 250 to 300 tons ? ” asked Harding .
0	Our road grew lighter and lighter .
0	I think that the ‘ Bonadventure ’ will be safe there. ” “ Perfectly , ” replied <NAME> , “ and besides , the north coast is merely sand , very uninteresting to look at. ” “ I shall not be sorry , ” resumed the engineer , “ to pass not only to-night but to-morrow in that bay , which is worth being carefully explored. ” “ I think that we shall be obliged to do so , whether we like it or not , ” answered <NAME> , “ for the sky looks very threatening towards the west .
0	The cavern , however , was quite capable of being lighted by means of lamps and lanterns .
0	These last words justified the colonists ’ presentiment .
0	`` You can go now , M. Aronnax , '' said the <NAME> .
0	asked the engineer , `` for a depth sufficient for the keel of the <NAME> , would not be enough for those of our iron-clads . ''
0	With some imagination and a little artistic feeling the result was highly satisfactory .
0	The hunters who wandered far from the camp were massacred by the <NAME> , and sickness found an easy prey in men overwhelmed with ennui , disappointment , and misery .
0	The following days brought new discoveries .
0	They then began to repent , but too late , the intrepidity which had prompted them to leave their native shores ; for intrepid they justly deserve to be called , seeing that again and again they asked the <NAME> sailors if they were not to be eaten , and it took several days of kind treatment to dispel this fear from their minds .
0	cried the sailor , `` this is queer ! ''
0	Two or three of them climbed on board , and in a determined manner came up to the main watch to look down into the orlop-deck to find out how many men were disabled , whilst a malignant joy lit up their diabolical features .
0	The <NAME> entered the Straits of Fo-Kien , which separate the island of Formosa from the <NAME> coast , in the small hours of the night , and crossed the Tropic of <NAME> .
0	The last words in his note-book were these : “ A <NAME> rifleman has just taken aim at me , but -- ” The <NAME> notwithstanding missed <NAME> , who , with his usual fortune , came out of this affair without a scratch .
0	Seeing only certain objects and in a limited space , always in contact with the colonists , to whom he would soon become accustomed , having no desires to satisfy , better fed , better clothed , it was natural that his physical nature should gradually improve ; but was he penetrated with the sense of a new life ?
0	After having been raised by the water-spout , she had fallen on her side , and had sunk in that position , doubtless in consequence of some enormous leak .
0	In most <NAME> towns and villages we have been regarded as demigods , and treated in consequence with universal kindness , civility , and veneration ; but here , alas , what a contrast !
0	The difference evidently depends on the conductibility of certain rocks .
0	It was now exactly seven months since the balloon voyagers had been thrown on <NAME> .
0	He was ready to don the diving-dress himself , or try the air apparatus , in order to reconnoiter the situation of his courageous friends .
0	They rose like an amphitheater on natural terraces ; their waters gradually flowed together under folds of white smoke , and corroding the edges of the semi-transparent steps of this gigantic staircase .
0	<NAME> <NAME> blushed like a child when his turn came , and his voice trembled as he spoke to <NAME> ’ s father .
0	So I didn ’ t spend much time thinking about it , but jumped right on the back of one of those innocent animals and away we went galloping north as fast as our legs could carry us .
0	It consisted in offering to a friend a piece of food which had been already chewed , that he might have no trouble but that of swallowing it .
0	In the meanwhile the “ Bonadventure ” entered the winding channels among the reefs , and <NAME> observed every turn with extreme care .
0	<NAME> ran toward him , saying , `` Have you seen a man go into the wood , armed with a rifle ?
0	Setting sail from <NAME> , on March 15th , 1603 , the two chiefs of the enterprise first ascended the <NAME> , as far as the harbour of <NAME> , 240 miles from its mouth .
0	I then thought of quitting my room .
0	“ They may adopt other sentiments ! ” said <NAME> , “ and perhaps repent. ” “ They repent ! ” exclaimed the sailor , shrugging his shoulders .
0	[ Illustration : Captain <NAME> 's chart of <NAME> . ]
0	This has occurred in the two hemispheres -- at <NAME> , <NAME> , at <NAME> -- and on the eve of an eruption there is everything to be feared .
0	“ Will you reply ? ” repeated <NAME> .
0	The forepart had disappeared completely , and the hind part up to the axle .
0	`` Do not cry out before you are hurt .
0	`` Calm yourself , '' I said to the impetuous Ned ; `` anger will do no good . ''
0	The casting was to take place at twelve o'clock precisely .
0	“ <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ you need not reproach yourself .
0	By the evening , according to calculation , it was thought that the “ Bonadventure ” had accomplished a distance of a hundred and twenty miles since her departure from <NAME> , that is to say in thirty-six hours , which would give her a speed of between three and four knots .
0	“ <NAME> has given me a nosegay and I am quite content .
0	Beyond it we heard loud bellowings such as a troop of ruminants would produce .
0	The morning of February 13th arrived .
0	The reporter , therefore , thought it best to simply bathe the two wounds with cold water .
0	And <NAME> gave one more despairing cry .
0	Soon a ruin , old and gloomy as the rocks at its base , rose before him .
0	asked the old sailor , who was always seeking information from the doctor .
0	Ferguson. -- Reply of the <NAME> Koner. -- Bets made. -- Sundry Propositions offered to the Doctor .
0	After draining it with much apparent relish , the professor got out of bed , walked into the common hall , round which he glanced with a pre-occupied air , and proceeded to seat himself in an armchair , the most comfortable which the cabin of the <NAME> had supplied .
0	“ <NAME> , ” said his master , as he appeared in answer to his summons , “ we are going to have a turn before breakfast .
0	<NAME> prudently lowered the foresail , not wishing to be caught by a sudden gust while carrying too much canvas ; it was perhaps an unnecessary precaution on such a calm night , but <NAME> was a prudent sailor and can not be blamed for it .
0	This was not a new country to <NAME> , as he had visited it about 1280 , when he was on a mission for the Emperor .
0	The departure was fixed for ten in the morning , on the 5th .
0	Why , it 's like emptying money-bags into the sea not to fill one 's barrels when one can .
0	Paganel could not stand any more .
0	Nevertheless , <NAME> and his companions , being anxious to finish it , and , it must be said , very much confused at being thus imprisoned by the beasts , were about to try a direct attack , when the captain thought of a new means of defence .
0	The station resembles , from the variety of characters assembled , a small news exchange .
0	“ You may count upon me !
0	But a kind of lurid brilliancy spread over the island , against which stood out confusedly the wooded masses of the heights .
0	`` But , '' asked the doctor of <NAME> , `` are you not going to tell the crew about this letter ? ''
0	When this occurred we saw the sea foaming along the sides of the ice packs , covering them with spray like the rocks on the coast of a floating island , but without hindering their onward march .
0	I am going to floor you completely , and never was an Englishman more thoroughly defeated than you will be .
0	<NAME> seizing the telescope which the sailor had put down , put it to his eye , and in a hoarse voice , -- “ The black flag ! ” he exclaimed .
0	Was the brig about to penetrate far into the bay ?
0	When he arrived there , he found a city measuring three miles in circumference , which had been for a long time the capital of the <NAME> , before it was conquered by Gengis-Khan , the grandfather of the reigning emperor .
0	`` But , '' asked <NAME> , `` might it not happen that some day the Pole should get farther from its place ? ''
0	“ In the house ? ” “ Yes ! ” All five advanced and indeed , through the window fronting them , they saw glimmering a feeble light .
0	`` We found , '' says the narrative , `` different houses where we could repair our sails , salt our provisions , construct two boats , lodge the naturalists and geographical engineers , and the governor kindly lent us his own for the establishment of our observatory .
0	He tried to make out the words which the poor fellow could not pronounce .
0	Then their fears suddenly aroused , they disappeared , bounding over the rocks .
0	The <NAME> of <NAME> , and the <NAME> of <NAME> , were now exciting the desires of King Emmanuel , who had already been surnamed `` the fortunate . ''
0	It was in these trying circumstances that two brave officers , <NAME> and <NAME> , proposed to the admiral to attempt to cross from <NAME> to <NAME> in <NAME> canoes .
0	`` To ask for means to leave a country , '' added <NAME> , `` When we have not yet arrived there , seems to me rather inopportune . ''
0	But the engineer did not reply to the sailor except by proposing to examine the cliff more attentively , from the mouth of the river to the angle which terminated it on the north .
0	It was so far unknown , that it was not even decided whether it formed a part of the southern continent , as <NAME> supposed , when he named it <NAME> .
0	`` I beg you to excuse me , '' he resumed , `` I have so many things to occupy me and make me anxious .
0	`` And now , '' he resumed in a sharper tone and with a shake in his voice which denoted a certain amount of nervous irritation , `` it is possible that you did not know the <NAME> family ; that you have never met them either at <NAME> or at <NAME> -- '' `` Or elsewhere . ''
0	Towards the summit fluttered myriads of sea-fowl , and especially those of the web-footed species with long , flat , pointed beaks -- a clamorous tribe , bold in the presence of man , who probably for the first time thus invaded their domains .
0	365 The Emperor of <NAME> .
0	After crossing a rather large prairie , we arrived at the skirts of a little wood that was enlivened by the songs and flight of a large number of birds .
0	`` The heat of the ground is so great in some parts that it is impossible to stand on it for a minute at a time .
0	I often had a good laugh to myself , thinking of your astonishment and the <NAME> 's at seeing a lot of <NAME> poultry scratching for worms on a Lunar dunghill ! ''
0	The ship and its inmates , <NAME> , M. Fridriksson , and the great summit of <NAME> !
0	It was enough to scour the clay with sand , then to mold the bricks and bake them by the heat of a wood fire .
0	Moreover <NAME> had collected a vast number of interesting observations on natural history , physical geography , astronomy , and the new science of anthropology , then in its earliest infancy .
0	<NAME> someone wish to prevent <NAME> from troubling himself either uselessly or otherwise ?
0	Some presented the appearance of blue mountains of harmonious conformation ; upon others , much more distant , there appeared a prodigiously lofty cone , above the summit of which hung dark and heavy clouds .
0	<NAME> proposed to return to this enchanting island the next day , for he wished to depopulate it of all the eatable quadrupeds .
0	‘ There is nothing you desire ? ’ ‘ Nothing. ’ ‘ You would not change your lot for that of a king ? ’ ‘ Never ! ’ ‘ Well , then , sell me your shirt. ’ ‘ My shirt !
0	The question was , whether a chimney could be discerned between the two masts of the vessel , which was now at a distance of only five miles .
0	In 1829 he reentered <NAME> by the western coast of the Gulf of <NAME> ; he then followed in the track of <NAME> and of <NAME> , recovered at Boussa the documents relative to the death of the former , and arrived on the 20th of August at <NAME> , where he was seized and held as a prisoner , until he expired in the arms of his faithful attendant <NAME> Lander. ” “ And what became of this Lander ? ” asked <NAME> , deeply interested .
0	listened to the sound critically for an instant , and then said to himself in a relieved tone , but in his native tongue : `` One man all right !
0	[ Illustration ] The Governor was born on the island of <NAME> , and he has never left the place ; he did the honors of his capital , which consisted of three wooden houses , for himself and the Lutheran minister , of a school , and shops which were supplied by what was cast upon the shore from wrecked ships .
0	But before <NAME> had time to reply one of the boatmen exclaimed in an accent of terror : “ The <NAME> !
0	<NAME> maintained it was the parabolic ; M'Nicholl insisted that it was the hyperbolic .
0	The limits of the horizon , too , had become much circumscribed .
0	The <NAME> was brought in and covered up carefully ; the four Englishmen sat about the fire .
0	This island afforded much silver , gold , copper , sulphur , spices , lemons , cucumbers , cocoa-nuts , and other delicious fruits .
0	<NAME> decided upon -- Conjectures -- Preparations -- The three Passengers -- First Night -- Second Night -- <NAME> -- Searching the <NAME> -- Searching the <NAME> -- No one -- Animals -- Plants -- A Dwelling -- Deserted .
0	In an instant , our travellers , changing attitudes , formed the new group with tolerable success .
0	They were those of the convicts who , four months previously , had landed on <NAME> !
0	Still , in the end limes , bitter oranges , cocoa-nuts , bread-fruits , guavas , and others were found .
0	The cannon ought to be planted in a country situated between 0 @ and 28 @ of N. or S. lat .
0	This time it is certain that the sea is breaking upon the rocks at no great distance .
0	Here are to be found the formidable ruffians who in a civilized country were the terror of their government .
0	Then the two friends , followed by their foremen , reached <NAME> , where they found a vessel starting for <NAME> .
0	Could a fresh exploration of the mine , undertaken by the engineer , account for such a long absence ?
0	As to flint , that would not be wanting in these regions of <NAME> origin .
0	After a few days passed at <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> entered <NAME> , and , <NAME> Fedor settling down in <NAME> , neither his son nor his daughter had any occasion to leave him , except to go and see their old mother .
0	`` How much food have we left ? ''
0	It is quite visible from the earth ; and astronomers can study it with ease , particularly during the phase between the last quarter and the new moon , because then the shadows are thrown lengthways from east to west , allowing them to measure the heights .
0	You will confess that it is not impracticable ; having once come with our brig to latitude 83° , we shall have only about six hundred miles between us and the Pole . ''
0	They found there a considerable quantity of ammunition and provisions , conveyed thither by the convicts in order to form a reserve .
0	The wind blew with extraordinary violence .
0	It was during this time that the captain of the <NAME> buried the bottle in which his namesake of the <NAME> claimed to have found a letter containing <NAME> 's announcement of his intention to visit the austral seas .
0	The fact remains , whether it is to be accounted for by a storm or by some secret design , that the fleet was out of the right way for doubling the Cape of <NAME> when , on the 22nd of April , a high mountain was seen , and soon afterwards a long stretch of coast , which received the name of <NAME> , changed afterwards to that of <NAME> .
0	It may be imagined what were the apprehensions of <NAME> and <NAME> , when they thought of the combustible liquid on which the raft floated .
0	If any difficulty should arise on sea , give us warning by firing three shots . ''
0	The ships next passed by the <NAME> of the <NAME> , the haunt of <NAME> pirates , who have even now only lately submitted to the <NAME> arms ; then by <NAME> , which had been already visited , for it was known that the eagerly sought-for Moluccas must be in its neighbourhood , whether more or less remote .
0	Like the coral islands of the <NAME> , it may , for aught we know , be still rising by slow and imperceptible degrees .
0	The principal trade of the country seems to be in horses and asses , which are sent to <NAME> or <NAME> and thence to <NAME> .
0	Could I retract my word , and take upon myself the responsibility of compromising the future of my companions ?
0	At a certain period , the earth consisted only of an elastic crust , liable to alternative upward and downward movements in virtue of the law of attraction .
0	`` Well , a perfect vacuum as far as air is concerned . ''
0	`` If I were sure of hitting him , I would do so , even at the risk of having my head torn open , but he would flee at my approach .
0	The mole no longer protected the coast , which was directly exposed to the attacks of the open sea .
0	And -- a fact which touched him more nearly -- the <NAME> had not been visited by either Len Guy or his crew since the arrival of the <NAME> .
0	He lowered his voice and continued : `` But <NAME> will tell you all that , sir .
0	In the face of this fact , so much had to be admitted .
0	The crew did not utter a word .
0	As soon as the whole party were ensconced in the <NAME> , <NAME> asked Thalcave what he thought was best to be done .
0	The three miles which remained would take three hours to travel , and to keep to the course of the river it was necessary , above all things , to have a clear outlook .
0	On the 23rd June the <NAME> left <NAME> , filled with gratitude to the king , who had given them valuable presents , and warned them to accept no food , lest it should be poisoned , from any but the governors of the places they should pass through .
0	No ; these vibrations are due to the effervescence of the central fire .
0	`` My dear young lady , '' said <NAME> , at last , `` do you know that our master has been out of sorts for several days ?
0	“ It is not impossible that our care will have an effect upon him , for it is solitude that has made him what he is , and from this time forward he will be no longer alone. ” “ The poor man must no doubt have been in this state for a long time , ” said <NAME> .
0	<NAME> was just in the mood to take <NAME> ’ s part , which drew from <NAME> the remark that <NAME> could not be held responsible for any accidental injury done by her cannon , and if the <NAME> ’ s long nose came in the way of the ball , the <NAME> must submit to the mischance .
0	Above us the crater seemed to gape like the mouth of a well .
0	Here a sad piece of news was awaiting him .
0	Under the centripetal force , the base of the projectile tended toward the moon ; but the centrifugal still prevailed ; and it was probable that its rectilineal course would be changed to a curve of some sort , the nature of which they could not at present determine .
0	To the northwest rose <NAME> , which concealed a great part of the horizon .
0	`` Let us trust in <NAME> , '' said the old sailor ; `` he is able to preserve us ! ''
0	Less fortunate than his female companion , the poor fellow had received a frightful shock and his life was evidently in great danger .
0	But there were two or three public buildings , a barrack , and a church dedicated to <NAME> Theresa , which was a cathedral by the side of the modest chapel at <NAME> .
0	As the lieutenant did not return on board either in the evening or the next morning , <NAME> , feeling sure that an accident had happened , sent in search of him .
0	I remember it as if it were yesterday .
0	The journals of all <NAME> were untiring in their praises of the bold explorers , and the <NAME> struck off an edition of three hundred and seventy-seven thousand copies on the day when it published a sketch of the trip .
0	To hear them talk , it would have been more extraordinary if nothing of the kind appeared .
0	`` Meanwhile the <NAME> had been sent to <NAME> for repairs .
0	These natives of <NAME> wore some clothing , and appeared altogether more civilized than those of <NAME> ; they inhabited houses made in the shape of tents and having high chimneys ; the interiors of these dwellings were remarkably clean and well kept .
0	Do you say to yourself , ` This prison may be our tomb ? '
0	I do not intend to use any other , ” was the professor ’ s bluff reply .
0	`` You have been talking long enough , men , '' shouted the boatswain , advancing at the moment when the conversation threatened to become dangerous ; `` to work , and have the saws put in quicker !
0	<NAME> also showed great courage and much of that presence of mind which may justly be called `` the reasoning of bravery . ''
0	His admirable discovery led to many another .
0	The duty of this committee was to resolve the three grand questions of the cannon , the projectile , and the powder .
0	In fact , at this hour , the rising tide would have turned back the current of the creek , if its mouth had only been a few miles distant .
0	`` In your little room , sir , '' replied <NAME> , `` and in your museum , sir ; and I should have already classed all your fossils , sir .
0	The group , lying between 50 degrees 57 minutes , and 52 degrees 45 minutes S. latitude , and 60 degrees 4 minutes , 63 degrees 48 minutes west of the meridian of <NAME> , consists of several islets and two principal islands , named <NAME> and <NAME> .
0	Are you , or are you not , the quartermaster of the <NAME> ? ” <NAME> remained impassive , gazing at the coast , deaf to every question .
0	`` And thou art right , <NAME> .
0	During this excursion they saw several wild boars , which however , did not offer to attack the little band , and it appeared as if they would not meet with any dangerous beasts ; when , in a thick part of the wood , the reporter thought he saw , some paces from him , among the lower branches of a tree , an animal which he took for a bear , and which he very tranquilly began to draw .
0	`` The air confined in his body , freed from external pressure , would burst him like a shell , or like a balloon that suddenly rises to too great a height in the air !
0	<NAME> at these caricatures of all periods , of which my portfolio is full . ''
0	I know where you are <NAME> , and I know where to find you .
0	Can he leave the island if he likes ?
0	This is not , however , the opinion of <NAME> , who looks upon them as a separate tribe of the <NAME> family .
0	<NAME> , in fact , had been taken by Feofar-Khan some days previously , and it was thence that the invaders , masters of <NAME> , were to march upon <NAME> .
0	<NAME> , you are taken ; taken , you are executed .
0	“ To land here would be a ticklish matter ! ” said the <NAME> .
0	The bow was bent , the arrow flew , taking the cord with it , and passed between the two last rounds .
0	<NAME> was named captain-general of the squadron , with unlimited powers .
0	He was sure his strength would return more quickly in his room , with the air and sight of the sea !
0	Those Spaniards who had remained faithful to the cause of order , were obliged to take up arms , and they valiantly defended the admiral , losing but one man in this sad affair .
0	How closely he follows , and imparts to his readers , the scientific probabilities of the universe beyond our earth , the actual knowledge so hard won by our astronomers !
0	All ran after the dog , among the tall pines on the border of the forest .
0	Therefore the chapter that he devotes to <NAME> , recording the marvellous and rapid advance of this effort at colonization , excited a lively interest in <NAME> , where the development and growing prosperity of <NAME> were very imperfectly known .
0	Then settling himself firmly , he listened .
0	“ <NAME> , my heart is broken ; and sometimes despair nearly masters me .
0	The fugitives had by this time reached the dangerous part of their voyage , and they were still twenty miles from the capital .
0	`` What heat does the thermometer really indicate ? ''
0	It appeared that the <NAME> must have been the first to trade with them , for they were quite unacquainted with the use or value of iron , and preferred a single coloured bead to a hatchet , or a nail six inches long .
0	Above her head rustled the white sails , which seemed like great white wings .
0	What happened to Joe. -- The <NAME> of the Biddiomahs. -- The <NAME> shown him. -- The <NAME> that sank. -- The <NAME> of the Lake. -- The <NAME> of the Serpents. -- The Foot-Tramp. -- <NAME> Suffering. -- Mosquitoes and Ants. -- Hunger. -- The <NAME> seen. -- She disappears. -- The Swamp. -- One Last Despairing Cry .
0	This was the signal for renewed cries of still greater intensity .
0	`` What will you do then ? ''
0	There were disagreeable and painful disputes between these two great men , in which all the wrong done was on the side of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> has become a fixed fact in <NAME> , as it is in the <NAME> and in <NAME> .
0	The travellers succeeded in making fast to a tree , and , the wind having fallen calm toward evening , they remained quietly at anchor .
0	In a word , the crew had taken courage again .
0	Perhaps he , the former convict , still felt himself unworthy to do so !
0	The traditional soup of fragrant herbs ; cake , so often made to replace bread in <NAME> , composed of the flour of the manioc thoroughly impregnated with the gravy of meat and tomato jelly ; poultry with rice , swimming in a sharp sauce made of vinegar and _ “ malagueta ; ” _ a dish of spiced herbs , and cold cake sprinkled with cinnamon , formed enough to tempt a poor monk reduced to the ordinary meager fare of his parish .
0	He gave the name of <NAME> to this territory , and to fitly conclude the ceremony , he caused three salutes to be fired .
0	This he could not now delay in doing .
0	Presently one of the passengers , after vigorously pushing his way through the importunate crowd of porters , came up to him and politely asked if he could point out the <NAME> consulate , at the same time showing a passport which he wished to have visaed .
0	`` Yes , two or three of those terrible shocks , so common in these regions where the sea penetrates by infiltration , and a day comes when the quantity of accumulated vapour makes its way out and destroys everything on the surface . ''
0	About this time , the weather being extremely dry , the colonists , clothed as warmly as possible , resolved to devote a day to the exploration of that part of the island between the <NAME> and <NAME> .
0	In the case of the <NAME> , it would be the road that ran along .
0	The crew seemed to have returned to their habits of discipline and obedience .
0	“ You perceive , ” said he , “ that the labors of this savant have been conducted with great precision ; we are moving directly toward the <NAME> region , and perhaps toward <NAME> , its capital .
0	M'Nicholl took upon himself to fasten the door of the trap on the inside by means of a powerful combination of screws and bolts of his own invention .
0	`` The trap-hole alone would take ten or fifteen minutes to open . ''
0	Notwithstanding this , the examination is carried out , the vein discovered .
0	Up to this time no other means have been devised , and it is this that has always prevented long journeys in the air. ” “ My dear <NAME> , I have only one word to answer -- I shall not lose one particle of gas. ” “ And yet you can descend when you please ? ” “ I shall descend when I please. ” “ And how will you do that ? ” “ Ah , ha !
0	TEN minutes afterwards , <NAME> and <NAME> issued from the principal gallery .
0	At last , late in the evening of <NAME> Day , amidst the most enthusiastic cheers of all the inhabitants of <NAME> , who welcomed them with a splendid pine brand procession , <NAME> and his friends , thoroughly used up , feet swelled , limbs bruised , bones aching , stomachs seasick , eyes bleared , ears ringing , and brains on fire for want of rest , took their places in the <NAME> Car waiting for them , and started without a moment 's delay for <NAME> , about a hundred miles distant .
0	“ Ay , sir , a <NAME> , ” said <NAME> .
0	They descended to the shop .
0	The constant outrages and humiliations to which Europeans were daily subjected under the most despotic and cowardly government in the world , aroused the indignation of the <NAME> captain , and made him heartily wish that an international expedition might put a stop to so intolerable a state of things .
0	Giving the <NAME> Point a good wide berth , the <NAME> found the fog gradually clearing away , and by half-past three the passengers , looking under it , enjoyed the glorious view of the <NAME> mountains east of <NAME> , which had obtained for this entrance the famous and well deserved appellation of the <NAME> .
0	cried <NAME> with warmth ; `` there are no insuperable obstacles ; there are more or less determined minds , that is all ! ''
0	<NAME> hastened to join him in the shop , and received an affable `` Good-day . ''
0	`` It was just because she was not an honest vessel ! ''
0	This journey from the camp to <NAME> , performed under the lashes and spear-points of the soldiers , proved fatal to many , and terrible to all .
0	To facilitate the sale it has been decided that the biddings for this extensive region shall be made per square mile .
0	Make a start , like a good fellow . ''
0	<NAME> , entrusted with carrying them their daily nourishment , leavings from the kitchen , etc. , acquitted himself conscientiously of his task .
0	It soon became needful to check their advances , as there were many sick among the crew , and it was unwise to allow too many natives on board .
0	Some of them were four yards and a quarter long .
0	It was late , and half dark outside , for at this date the sun was on the edge of the horizon , and would very soon disappear below it .
0	The <NAME> is not like a chicken on a spit , that we can take it in our hand and shift it as we will .
0	Until 1815 he remained with the army , but after the peace he employed his leisure in visiting <NAME> and <NAME> .
0	The pieces which were cut off soon encumbered the hut .
0	All three felt this , and they well knew that <NAME> would approve of their acting thus .
0	Then <NAME> went up to <NAME> .
0	This proposal was agreed to , and <NAME> and <NAME> prepared to start immediately .
0	asked the sailors , turning to <NAME> .
0	Others have enormous hats of brown gulls ' feathers , almost as large as the wigs of <NAME> lawyers , and many have a simple wooden hoop , surrounded with white gulls ' feathers , which wave in the air .
0	<NAME> can not be far off .
0	The merit of them , however , if we are to believe <NAME> ' Literary anecdotes , rests rather with <NAME> , than , as the title would appear to indicate , with the chaplain of the expedition , <NAME> .
0	A few hares , which they were able to shoot , appeared on the shores of the bay , as well as the arctic mice , the burrows of which were like a honeycomb .
0	A quarter of an hour later we were far away from that terrible monster !
0	We have a tendency to sink , and , in order to keep our elevation , I am compelled to give greater dilation to the hydrogen. ” “ The deuce ! ” exclaimed <NAME> with concern ; “ I see no remedy for that. ” “ There is none , <NAME> , and that is why we must hasten our progress , and even avoid night halts. ” “ Are we still far from the coast ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	Many of the adventurers wished to enjoy this unexpected good fortune in a peaceable manner in their own country , and eagerly asked for their dismissal .
0	<NAME> such a scene in an appropriate setting , the whole lit up with a dim and wavering light , and you can perhaps form some idea how it struck me when it first burst upon me . ''
0	`` I 've known all my men for a long time . ''
0	During the ensuing day , the recent passage of a large body of foot and horse became more and more apparent .
0	We were turning our backs on <NAME> .
0	Leaving the <NAME> in the charge of two men , we again took our way to the interior , in order to extend our search over a wider expanse .
0	“ Here , ” replied <NAME> , after some hesitation tearing a leaf out of his note-book .
0	<NAME> <NAME> gazed on it in silence .
0	As far as I was concerned , death had claimed me for his own .
0	<NAME> smoked a good pipe of tobacco , and from time to time the old couple spoke of <NAME> , of their boy , of <NAME> , and wondered how they liked their trip to the surface of the earth .
0	Perhaps its springs were left to wear out , its wheels to get clogged .
0	“ This is what happened , ” he continued .
0	“ We are going to <NAME> ! ” With a grave face , and without speaking a word , <NAME> received the congratulations of his son and the kisses of his daughter .
0	In the lunar orography they have discerned some chains of mountains , which are chiefly distributed over the northern hemisphere .
0	Before this tent , on a japanned table inlaid with precious stones , was placed the sacred book of the <NAME> , its pages being of thin gold-leaf delicately engraved .
0	During a storm which was encountered at the point where the strait opens into the <NAME> , <NAME> beheld one of his ships founder , while his last companion was separated from him a few days afterwards , nor did he see her again until the end of the campaign .
0	But I forgot I did n't come alone . ''
0	<NAME> was the first repast of the castaways on this unknown coast .
0	<NAME> nomenclature , however , insists on the name of <NAME> , which is generally adopted for the group which lies in 49° 45 ' south latitude , and 69° 6 ' east longitude .
0	Just as the reading of the proclamation by the head of the police came to an end , an idea darted instinctively into the mind of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> , defended by the three brothers <NAME> with but 170 Spaniards , was exposed for eight consecutive months to the incessant attacks of the Peruvians , who had now become expert in the use of the arms which they had taken from their enemies .
0	With a sigh I discovered that the bottom was still wholly invisible .
0	It is only two leagues wide , and is divided in its narrowest part from the mainland by a channel of two hundred fathoms .
0	They were too surely the first victims of the frenzied natives .
0	But the moon grew larger to their eyes , and they fancied if they stretched out their hands they could seize it .
0	A peak of about four thousand five hundred feet high , visible at a distance of eighteen or twenty leagues , rises in the centre of the island ; the land slopes gently from thence to the sea , so that the houses look like an amphitheatre .
0	`` Cut away , boatswain , cut away ! ''
0	<NAME> had no trouble in finding a tree suitable for the mast .
0	I swam more vigorously ; but , cramped by my clothes , which stuck to me like a leaden weight , I felt great difficulty in bearing up .
0	They paid the same homage to <NAME> , <NAME> 's second in command , and successor .
0	Accordingly , under cover of the night , the broadsides of the vessels were brought to bear upon the town , which was bombarded for the space of three days .
0	No misfortune could damp his ardour , his was one of those great spirits which seem only invigorated by trouble and disasters .
0	At Oubinsk he gave his horse a whole night ’ s rest , for he wished on the next day to accomplish the hundred versts which lie between <NAME> and <NAME> without halting .
0	It was a species of the <NAME> nilotica , peculiar to <NAME> ; its beak is black , head grey and pointed , the eye surrounded by white spots , the back , wings , and tail of a greyish colour , the belly and throat white , and claws red .
0	The old myth of the <NAME> realized !
0	`` After having passed the north pole , '' replied <NAME> .
0	A constitution of exceptional vigour is necessary to enable a traveller to bear the fatigue , privations , and interruptions of every kind with which he has to contend in these unhealthy districts , with impunity .
0	I began now to lose my head and to scream and cry out in my agony .
0	I think he will be at least twenty days behind-hand , and that <NAME> will lose a cool five thousand . ''
0	`` Look here , <NAME> and M'Nicholl ! ''
0	It is better that disinterested witnesses should affirm that this case was really found on the corpse of <NAME> ! ” “ You are right , ” replied <NAME> .
0	It was evidently a block without any possible egress .
0	“ Am I right ? ” “ You are quite right , <NAME> , ” answered <NAME> ; “ and when we have reached <NAME> , we shall be at the foot of the <NAME> on the opposite side. ” “ How long will it take to get across the mountains ? ” “ Forty-eight hours , for we shall travel day and night .
0	Many workmen , it is true , paid with their lives for the rashness inherent in these dangerous labors ; but these mishaps are impossible to be avoided , and they are classed among the details with which the <NAME> trouble themselves but little .
0	No , no ; it can not be .
0	His eyes would close , and in a tone of mild reproach he would answer : “ Why leave our home ?
0	At midnight the wind freshened , and before long the cracking of the masts , and the rattling of the cordage , and groaning of the timbers , awakened the passengers , who speedily made their appearance on deck -- at least <NAME> , <NAME> , the Major and <NAME> .
0	They took it into their heads that some mischief was meant to the sun and the moon .
0	Thus , in their trigonometrical surveys <NAME> and his associates never calculated the third angle by the observation of the two first , but always observed all three .
0	To withstand the vertical beams of that noontide sun would seem to require a skin of brass and a brain of adamant ; but yet , hour after hour , he would remain conscientiously scanning the surface of the <NAME> , which , calm and deserted , lay outstretched before him .
0	`` We wo n't waste time , '' returned <NAME> .
0	But the most astounded personage in the town was <NAME> the burgomaster .
0	Did they mean to say that he had seen nothing at all ?
0	There <NAME> revictualled , and by accurate observations settled its position at 10 degrees 35 minutes southern latitude , and 237 degrees 30 minutes west longitude .
0	When his services were not required , either for carrying wood or for climbing to the top of some tree , <NAME> passed the greatest part of his time in the kitchen , where he endeavoured to imitate Neb in all that he saw him do .
0	“ Everything is possible , ” replied <NAME> , who was getting uneasy .
0	<NAME> could have withstood the tenderness with which <NAME> spoke these last words .
0	He was much impressed by the wealth of the faithful and the peculiar characteristics of that city , which lives for and by the <NAME> cultus .
0	'Well , then , give me some rum . ' ''
0	The main point is to complete our armament with the least possible delay .
0	Some sailors , however , succeeded in capturing a young woman , whom they carried on board with them .
0	`` But was it not a star ? ''
0	As to <NAME> , he took part in the common work , and was not less skilful in it than his companions , which always rather astonished the sailor .
0	`` But once more on dry ground , we shall know what to do .
0	And , lastly , he made an appeal to `` all the living energies of the nation ! ''
0	`` The story which he has told is true in every point .
0	Two hundred houses at the very least !
0	However , the admiral was received at court with a certain measure of favour , the narrative of his second voyage doing much to reinstate him in public opinion .
0	<NAME> to throw some light upon the mystery , <NAME> hurriedly made his way through the oleander bushes that overhung the shore , took up some water in the hollow of his hand , and carried it to his lips .
0	Something which occurred on the night of the 12th of December was of a nature to support the opinions of all partisans of the supernatural , and there were many at <NAME> .
0	The governor excused himself upon the ground of his ignorance of the <NAME> language , and said , that not wishing a cause of misunderstanding to exist , he was quite ready to kill or put out the eyes ( as the envoy pleased ) of the person who had written the letter .
0	We caught some young kids , which soon grew quite tame .
0	The ground , formerly black with coal dust , had a bright look , to which <NAME> ’ s eyes were not accustomed .
0	Things hanging in the saloon were sensibly returning to their normal position .
0	`` Well reasoned , <NAME> ; and may we find more bays of <NAME> in our journey than capes of Despair ! ''
0	You know -- the three turtles that were in the boat .
0	A black coat or the waistcoat of an <NAME> uniform was the only garment worn by some , whilst others contented themselves with a jacket , a shirt , or a pair of trousers .
0	Who are you dressed up in that way ? ''
0	The envoy had not reached <NAME> when <NAME> landed at the fort on <NAME> .
0	For the present he tried to console himself with the hope that the deviation of the Projectile would be followed by no worse consequence than carrying them towards the northern border of the <NAME> , where for several reasons it would be comparatively easier to alight .
0	Between this coast and the <NAME> of <NAME> there is a dangerous gulf , the Gulf of <NAME> , in which a ship can with difficulty resist the currents which flow towards the west with great rapidity .
0	“ Yes ; and I heard afterward that the <NAME> was saved. ” “ Saved ! ” exclaimed young <NAME> , his very life hanging on the lips of the <NAME> .
0	Some leagues beyond are the ruins of <NAME> or <NAME> .
0	This doubtless formed a fall , which , if it could be discovered , would be of great use .
0	Fortunately , they could still get a few minutes farther north , but only by breaking the new ice with huge beams , or by blowing it up with charges of powder .
0	Dogs , goats , and other animals run about the dirty streets half-starved , whose hungry looks can only be exceeded by the famishing appearance of the men , women , and children , which bespeaks the penury and wretchedness to which they are reduced ; whilst the persons of many of them are covered with odious boils , and their huts are falling to the ground from neglect and decay . ''
0	`` Their looks and gestures , '' says the narrative , `` sufficiently expressed their surprise .
0	In fact , the substances thrown up fell back again into the abyss , and it did not seem that the lava , though swollen by the internal pressure , had yet risen to the orifice of the crater .
0	It was a remarkable fact that , although in the very midst of the furious tempest , they did not suffer from it .
0	They refused to return to <NAME> .
0	“ Why in the world , ” repeated <NAME> , “ should he take all this trouble to account for a set of facts so very easily and simply explained by the supernatural intervention of the spirits of the mine ? ” But , notwithstanding his objections to the scheme , <NAME> and three miners of his gang arrived next morning with <NAME> at the mouth of the opening of the suspicious shaft .
0	He knew <NAME> and <NAME> quite well .
0	`` Let 's see , '' asked <NAME> , `` who was <NAME> , and who was <NAME> ? ''
0	The natives of various portions of the empire appeared in their distinctive costumes and exhibited the different productions of their provinces .
0	All these lands belonged to the <NAME> group , which is also known as the <NAME> , a very suitable name for this archipelago .
0	The rectilinear movement has thus become changed into a circular motion of extreme velocity , and it is now pursuing an elliptical orbit round the moon , of which it has become a true satellite .
0	`` Besides , '' added <NAME> , `` even to the most piercing eye a man can not be distinguished farther than three and a half miles off ; so that , if there are any Selenites , they can see our projectile , but we can not see them . ''
0	`` Let us stand nearer , '' resumed <NAME> , who , glass in hand , kept examining the shore .
0	`` As you will , <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> .
0	They cut the flesh into pieces , and dry it upon a slope in the open air , by exposing it to the sun .
0	`` I do not say we are not , '' replied <NAME> ; `` but why ? ''
0	ha ! ” laughed <NAME> ; “ I do not believe in ships that steer themselves ; and if <NAME> is drunk when we get among soundings , he will get us all into trouble. ” “ Let us hope , ” said <NAME> , “ that the neighborhood of land will bring him to his senses. ” “ Well , then , ” said <NAME> , “ if needs were , you could not sail the <NAME> into <NAME> ? ” “ Without a chart of the coast , certainly not .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> , although they knew they ran the risk of being cut off , had not left their post , both that they did not wish to show themselves as yet to their assailants , and expose themselves to the “ <NAME> ’ s ” guns , and that they relied on Neb and <NAME> , watching at the mouth of the river , and on <NAME> and <NAME> , in ambush among the rocks at the <NAME> .
0	But even <NAME> did not catch the words , for his voice was drowned in the frightful uproar made by the wolves , who had dashed off at a tremendous speed on the track of the horse .
0	Perhaps the king may have still evinced a certain degree of coldness towards him , but the queen was his avowed and enthusiastic protectress .
0	On silence being restored , the triumphant orator contented himself with adding the following remarks : `` Gentlemen , you will observe that I have but slightly touched upon this great question .
0	On the 3rd of August an excursion which had been talked of for several days was made into the southeastern part of the island , towards <NAME> .
0	It was therefore necessary to fix piles in the bed of the river so as to sustain the floor of the bridge and establish a pile-driver to act on the tops of these piles , which would thus form two arches and allow the bridge to support heavy loads .
0	<NAME> tradition has it that the <NAME> came in the first instance , some thirteen hundred years ago , from the <NAME> .
0	`` But suppose she had run against this piece of iron ? ''
0	The rustling sound produced with every movement of the wearers of this singular ornament , increased by knocking against the cuirass or the buckler , with the addition of the tinkling of little bells , which also formed part of the warrior 's equipment , altogether made such a jumble of discordant sounds that we could not refrain from laughing .
0	He started up , and went toward the wood ; but what was his surprise to perceive a purely natural phenomenon !
0	When the high temperature of the oven had reduced it to a liquid , or rather a pasty state , <NAME> collected with the tube a quantity of the paste , he turned it about on a metal plate previously arranged so as to give it a form suitable for blowing , then he passed the tube to <NAME> , telling him to blow at the other extremity .
0	The environs of <NAME> are terribly bare , without houses or any signs of cultivation .
0	<NAME> <NAME> had taken no notice of her .
0	Leaving the devious windings of the footpath , they went as a crow would fly across the country .
0	It was a meadow land , dotted here and there with clumps of trees , and watered by a little stream , which sprung from the slopes which closed it in on one side .
0	Every day , the reporter and <NAME> , who had been voted purveyors to the colony , devoted some hours to the chase .
0	Completely master of himself , he closed his eyes , in order not to see the inexpressible anguish which agitated the revered countenance of his mother .
0	On the 6th June , the explorers left <NAME> 's Fort , as they called their winter quarters , and ascended the <NAME> for more than a hundred miles , its grassy plains , frequented by vast herds of bisons and deer , supplying them with plenty of provisions .
0	<NAME> stole around behind some clumps of shrubbery , while <NAME> remained motionless where he was .
0	Each time a company passed , <NAME> chuckled , and said to himself : `` Good !

0	This cleaning was done in vats filled with water , which was maintained at the temperature of seventy degrees , and in which the wool was soaked for four-and-twenty hours ; it was then thoroughly washed in baths of soda , and , when sufficiently dried by pressure , it was in a state to be compressed , that is to say , to produce a solid material , rough , no doubt , and such as would have no value in a manufacturing centre of <NAME> or <NAME> , but which would be highly esteemed in the <NAME> markets .

0	By a sad association of ideas , he referred everything to his monomania , and a human existence seemed to have departed from him , to give place to the extra-natural existence of the intermediate powers .
0	The explorer next visited <NAME> , a harbour little used , as it is too much exposed to the west winds ; and thence he proceeded to the country of the <NAME> , or , as <NAME> 's map calls them , the <NAME> .
0	“ Delighted. ” “ And so am I .
0	I did not say one word .
0	Then another day passed without food .
0	The waters of this river are still almost strangers to any craft but the native canoe .
0	The vessel is hardly anchored when the <NAME> leaves her and makes for <NAME> 's Wharf at <NAME> as hard as ever his men can pull !
0	A few days later , a boat seeking anchorage upon the coast of the <NAME> , was in danger of attack .
0	“ <NAME> to the shore , <NAME> ! ” said <NAME> .
0	Nothing of the sort , however ; his lips muttered no other words than these : “ I will get there ! ” Half an hour after the attack of the <NAME> horsemen , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> entered Nijni-Oudinsk .
0	The doctor had carefully taken his position by the altitude of the stars , during the preceding night .
0	And then anger seized him .
0	“ Because it is too small and too dark. ” “ Couldn ’ t we enlarge it , hollow it out , make openings to let in light and air ? ” replied <NAME> , who now thought nothing impossible .
0	An additional reason , by the way , for pushing on as far as possible .
0	`` Besides , '' said the cautious <NAME> , `` if we take the commander back with us , and act under his commands , we shall have earned our pay ; but if we go back without him , it 's not so sure . ''
0	<NAME> clasped his hands , and remained motionless .
0	This fatal region was only a desert , unfrequented even by animals .
0	It was , therefore , judged best to send a fresh despatch , requiring an immediate reply .
0	<NAME> , who was accustomed to the dangers of the sea , and an old sailor in arctic regions , lacked neither coolness nor courage .
0	“ Wherever you go I will follow you .
0	The grand duchesses , covered with diamonds , the ladies-in-waiting in their most exquisite costumes , set the example to the wives of the military and civil dignitaries of the ancient “ city of white stone. ” When , therefore , the signal for the “ polonaise ” resounded through the saloons , and the guests of all ranks took part in that measured promenade , which on occasions of this kind has all the importance of a national dance , the mingled costumes , the sweeping robes adorned with lace , and uniforms covered with orders , presented a scene of dazzling splendor , lighted by hundreds of lusters multiplied tenfold by the numerous mirrors adorning the walls .
0	`` It is more than useful , it is necessary !
0	She was the cause of the disaster !
0	There is an <NAME> mosque , called Goman-Dammesec , meaning the synagogue of <NAME> , and this building has not its equal ; it is said to have been <NAME> 's palace , and it contains a glass wall , built apparently by magic .
0	They could scarcely believe it possible ; at two yards and a half below water-mark was a regular rent , in the form of an isosceles triangle .
0	The sun had set the evening before in a red mist , in the midst of the phosphorescent scintillations of the ocean .
0	Would not their track betray them ?
0	The blocks were manufactured by <NAME> under <NAME> ’ s directions by means of the turning lathe .
0	The greater portion of this is laid out in gardens .

0	It is quite incomprehensible. ” A moment afterwards the noise of wheels and whip showed that the berlin , drawn by the tarantass ’ horses , was driving rapidly away from the post-house .
0	“ You are <NAME> ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	<NAME> defended him with great warmth and with all his powers , but he could not succeed in saving him .
0	The doctor leaned over and looked out .

0	This time his companions followed him in the new exploration .

0	<NAME> <NAME> , however , could not feel sure about it ; neither could <NAME> be satisfied on the subject , often repeating , “ Nell has clearly been mixed up with all this secret business .
0	at this last moment I ask you , have we not long been betrothed to each other in our secret hearts ?
0	Fortunately the <NAME> or <NAME> priests interfered in their favour , and some of their property was restored to them , but the best part had gone to the bottom of the river with <NAME> 's canoe .
0	These petticoats , which are kept for grand occasions , are often inherited like diamonds , and are handed down from generation to generation .
0	In one of these excursions , <NAME> met a band of itinerant musicians and _improvisatori_ .
0	His attitude was threatening , his countenance ferocious .
0	The whole region was bristling with spikes and circles .
0	In what condition was he going to find it ?
0	By what geological phenomena could this blazing coma have been possibly produced ?
0	As he spoke thus , <NAME> appeared superb in his vanity .
0	“ Decidedly , I have not your legs , my lad , ” said the engineer , panting .
0	It was gravely asserted that among the animals , there was an elephant not larger than a monkey , but as fierce as a lion , and a cock which was fed upon coal .
0	if I had a harpoon , I bet my head that I could send it into one of the four yellow spots they have on their bodies .
0	Once more again before the travellers ' eyes the <NAME> 's disc revealed itself in all the old familiar features so characteristic of lunar landscapes -- no blending of tones , no softening of colors , no graduation of shadows , every line glaring in white or black by reason of the total absence of refracted light .
0	It was necessary to carry Harding to the <NAME> , and that as soon as possible .
0	On that account <NAME> hastened to <NAME> , and had some enormous grappling-irons fixed on an automatic system , which would never let the projectile go if it once succeeded in seizing it in its powerful claws .
0	`` But , my good sir -- '' `` I tell you to come .
0	Then I felt all solid support give way not to my feet , but to the raft itself .

0	These apparatuses were at <NAME> , where they had been used in the construction of a submarine breakwater ; and very fortunately it was so , for there was no time to construct any .
0	At the same time with the gusts of wind a noise was heard beneath the frozen soil ; icebergs , broken from the promontory , dashed away noisily , and fell upon one another ; the wind blew with such violence that it seemed sometimes as if the whole house moved from its foundation ; phosphorescent lights , inexplicable in that latitude , flashed across the whirlwinds of the snow .

0	The same phrase was pronounced by the same individual .
0	He made the captain sit down on his stool , and inquired solicitously for the various Englishmen he had known on the former voyage .
0	`` Well , gentlemen , '' said he , `` I 'm off , you see ; and , if you will examine my passport when I get back , you will be able to judge whether I have accomplished the journey agreed upon . ''
0	Having described my uncle , I will now give an account of our interview .
0	The route to <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> ( countries already known through the wonderful narrative of <NAME> ) , viâ , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , was long and dangerous .
0	Then <NAME> decided energetically that they should at once set about devising means of safety .
0	I passed the evening reading , writing , and thinking .
0	And yet he was prepared to go still further in disinterestedness .
0	Some handfuls of grass , leaves , and dry moss were placed under the fagots and disposed in such a way that the air could easily circulate , and the dry wood would rapidly catch fire .
0	Why have they allowed you to come here ? ” “ To use whatever influence a boundless admiration may have on him who is its object ! ” “ What ! ” exclaimed J. T. <NAME> , “ you have consented to talk thus to me !
0	Quite a nice little ride ! ” “ If we were within range , ” sighed the sportsman , “ I should amuse myself with dismounting a few of them. ” “ Exactly , ” said the doctor ; “ but then they would have you within range also , and our balloon would offer only too plain a target to the bullets from their long guns ; and , if they were to make a hole in it , I leave you to judge what our situation would be ! ” The pursuit of the <NAME> continued all morning ; and by eleven o ’ clock the aeronauts had made scarcely fifteen miles to the westward .
0	They hastened up the slope , spurred on by the loud cries that drew nearer and nearer .
0	The death of the great usurper was followed by the decadence of the empire .
0	It is His own secret that <NAME> will tell us !
0	They , for their part , did not dare attack the captain 's dog , `` his familiar spirit , '' as <NAME> called him .
0	In a few minutes the engineer was made acquainted with the state of affairs .
0	Then they sank under the waves , to rise again in the year 69 , when they again subsided .

0	The mosquitoes of <NAME> have a deserved reputation for driving away such visitors as do not care to leave much of their blood with the redoubtable diptera .
0	“ I think I should ! ” replied the young man .
0	The resident at once sent him the order of the Governor of <NAME> , which expressly forbade his receiving any strange ship in his harbour , and begged <NAME> to make a written declaration of the reason for his putting into port , in order that he might prove to his superior that he had not infringed his orders except under paramount necessity .
0	“ The atmosphere of the earth has a height of six thousand fathoms , ” said the doctor ; “ and , with a very large balloon , one might go far .

0	`` Just one degree and a half above zero , <NAME> ! ''
0	`` Especially , '' replied M'Nicholl , `` if the stature of the <NAME> is in proportion to the mass of their globe . ''
0	If one of the mules stopped , they urged it on with a guttural cry , and if that proved unavailing , a good-sized pebble , thrown with unerring aim , soon cured the animal ’ s obstinacy .
0	We must calculate on several weeks delay , and if our vessel is ready by next November we may think ourselves very lucky. ” “ Well , ” replied <NAME> , “ that will be exactly the most favorable time for undertaking a voyage of any importance , either to <NAME> or to a more distant land. ” “ So it will , captain , ” answered the sailor .
0	On their way <NAME> and <NAME> were careful to preserve the wire which had been laid down by the captain between the corral and the grotto , and which might at a future time be of service .
0	In the outer world , the day was one of the hottest of the month of <NAME> , peculiarly oppressive in northern countries .
0	His guests congratulated him heartily as he ended his narration ; and <NAME> ’ Moore no doubt expected confidence for confidence , but he waited in vain .
0	Well , it so happened that the <NAME> got a seat that left him with his back turned toward the lake .
0	The crew was exceedingly demoralized .
0	He was horrified , for on the evening before he could still stand upright .
0	Did escape occur to him ?
0	It is needless to say that <NAME> and <NAME> were happy .
0	Not an obstacle on the plain , white and level farther than the eye could reach !
0	Game was so scarce that for four days the explorers were without food .
0	The soil they walked upon was choked with the pulverised matter fallen from the cloud .
0	Then an irresistible drowsiness crept over their brain .
0	`` It seems to me , '' said M'Nicholl , `` that , taking everything into consideration , the invisible side has been rather shabbily treated . ''
0	Standing there , with his arms stretched out like an exerciser , he made some grimaces , whose meaning was obvious to the prisoners .
0	He was everywhere received with cordial congratulations from officers , soldiers , and citizens .
0	<NAME> <NAME> and the <NAME> cook had quite surpassed themselves .
0	The launch tossed helplessly about , now plunged into deep abysses , now oscillated on the pointed crest of a wave , inclining often at an angle of more than forty-five degrees .
0	And she would certainly have fallen had not <NAME> ’ s arm supported her .
0	Soon afterward was seen the <NAME> , with its eighteen villages clinging to its flanks like a whole brood of children to their mother ’ s bosom -- a magnificent spectacle for the beholder whose gaze commanded and took in the entire picture at one view .
0	In the bows of all the other canoes fetish priests were dancing , and performing various extraordinary antics , their persons , as well as those of the people with them , being chalked over in the same manner as that of King Boy ; and , to crown the whole , Mr .

0	`` We have much poorer luck , '' answered <NAME> ; `` if we could only get enough bear 's meat , we would do very well . ''
0	<NAME> was still following him .
0	Above the forest were passing large clouds , to which the crater of <NAME> incessantly added fuliginous matter .
0	The latter were preparing to charge , when some of the more moderate among the officers caused an arrangement to be entered into , by virtue of which <NAME> was to withdraw to his own province after receiving 100,000 pesos to defray the expenses of the armament .
0	All these questions presented themselves simultaneously to the minds of the colonists , but how could they be answered ?
0	I even hesitated to tell you any thing about it , for fear of exciting your regret ! ” “ What ! ” said <NAME> , again , “ abandon these treasures -- a fortune for us ! -- really for us -- our own -- leave it behind ! ” “ Take care , my friend !
0	The month of May had come -- it corresponds in those regions to the month of November in northern lands -- and the ice-packs which the current carried towards the north were beginning to drift past Tsalal .
0	<NAME> sank prostrate on the ground , and clasped his hands despairingly .
0	<NAME> Harding then took two slips of zinc , one of which was plunged into azotic acid , the other into a solution of potash .
0	“ My master is lost ! ” cried <NAME> .
0	Then , by bribing the merchants with a gun and a little tobacco , he persuaded them to conduct him to <NAME> .
0	But at any rate this ship brought news from the world , perhaps even from their native land .
0	At eight o ’ clock , however , the colonists observed a movement on board the “ Speedy. ” A boat was lowered , and seven men jumped into her .
0	Before starting , the doctor had prudently renewed his stock of water , having feared that he should not be able to touch ground in these regions , infested as they are by the Aouelim-Minian Touaregs .

0	<NAME> struggled with his father .
0	His opinion was shared , moreover , by the geographer , as it corroborated his own notion about <NAME> .
0	I was perfectly up in the subject which was the question of the day .
0	“ You would think that there was a whole band of these ruffians , ” <NAME> kept saying , “ and we can ’ t lay hands on a single one of them. ” Search was made in all directions .
0	And yet <NAME> , as has been said , is not the capital of this important province .
0	There I should meet him for the last time .
0	112 A Fa-toka , <NAME> .
0	Pretty time to tell us so !
0	On the evening before , <NAME> , who had not yet given his answer to <NAME> , came to his house .
0	Over the bed of the streams ran a liquid substance without any appearance of limpidity , streaked with distinct veins , which did not reunite by immediate cohesion when they were parted by the blade of a knife !
0	<NAME> deserves much > of the credit for inspiring the early rocket pioneers , and ultimately > today 's space program .
0	To fly is , therefore , the course to be suggested by ordinary prudence .
0	<NAME> again began to hope .
0	They could , therefore , without inconvenience , wait until the next day to resume operations ; but , as to the vessel itself , she was doomed , and it would be best to hasten to save the remains of her hull , as she would not be long in disappearing in the quicksands of the channel .
0	Not only did <NAME> fail to keep the rendezvous he himself appointed , but two entire years passed away , and no news whatever of his expedition were received .
0	In spite of the roughness of the sea , and constant bad weather throughout his voyage of 108 days , D'Urville had carried on all his usual observations on the height of the waves , which he estimated at 80 and occasionally as much as 100 feet , off <NAME> ; the temperature of the sea at various depths , & c. <NAME> having found a capital supply of fresh water on the right bank of <NAME> , and at a little distance a site suitable for the erection of an observatory , the tents were soon pitched by the sailors , and several officers made a complete tour of the bay , whilst others opened relations with the aborigines , one of whom was induced to go on board , though it was only with the greatest difficulty that he was persuaded to throw away his _Banksia_ , a cone used to retain heat , and to keep the stomach and the front part of the body warm .
0	You hear my words , <NAME> , and I beg you to repeat such to them. ” “ I thank your Highness in the name of the town , ” answered the merchant chief .
0	The <NAME> durst not finish his sentence , but his face expressed clearly his horror .
0	The dog , excited by his master ’ s words , ran towards the extremity of the cavern , and there redoubled his barking .
0	“ Is everything thrown out ? ” “ No , here are still 2,000 dollars in gold. ” A heavy bag immediately plunged into the sea .
0	But when he perceived that , not content with the old domain , you seemed to think of encroaching upon his , then indeed his anger burst forth .
0	urged <NAME> , who was much disturbed by the servant 's disappearance .
0	“ And what has become , ” he said , “ of all our old comrades in <NAME> ? ” “ As far as I can tell you , ” answered the captain , “ they are all in <NAME> still ; only <NAME> isn ’ t by any means where we expected to find it. ” “ And <NAME> ?
0	And , sure enough , in the distance the long sails of a mill appeared , apparently about three miles off .
0	`` This sea , '' he says , `` is subject to fearful water-spouts which wreck the ships , and throw on its shores an immense number of dead fish and sometimes even large stones .
0	`` But we must have a mill . ''
0	He could do nothing for them .
0	[ Illustration : `` Good-bye , <NAME> , '' said <NAME> . ]
0	Where was he at this moment ?
0	Across these openings were thrown bridges which could be easily destroyed .
0	Its fragments , placed carefully against a wall , might serve again upon occasion .
0	A second time they had been sent on the wrong track by an erroneous interpretation of the document .
0	The weather was splendid , the temperature very warm in the day time , but in the evening the sea-breezes tempered the heat of the atmosphere and procured cool nights for the inhabitants of <NAME> .
0	From this date , the usual incidents of navigation in these latitudes were repeated day by day .
0	Then <NAME> seemed to grow enormously , his features to assume superhuman proportions .
0	His death had evidently occurred some months previously , probably very soon after the unfortunate man had been carried away by the drift .
0	Important operations were now entrusted to him .
0	At length this vast effusion of electric light faded away , and soon after the “ Nautilus , ” now the tomb of <NAME> , reposed in its ocean bed .
0	`` And inasmuch , '' continued the judge , `` as it is not proved that the act was not done by the connivance of the master with the servant , and as the master in any case must be held responsible for the acts of his paid servant , I condemn <NAME> to a week 's imprisonment and a fine of one hundred and fifty pounds . ''
0	They carefully examined the high lava-cliffs of <NAME> from the base to the crest , although it was extremely difficult to reach even the level of the gulf .
0	On leaving <NAME> , he followed the course of a river for twelve days , and found numerous towns on its banks .
0	This would agree with the date assigned by the document to the shipwreck -- the 27th of June , 1862. ” “ Clearly , ” said <NAME> .
0	We will now briefly describe the pompous entry of the <NAME> mission into <NAME> .
0	The two children were living in this touching manner in <NAME> , struggling patiently and courageously with their poverty .
0	It was pointed at an angle of ninety degrees , and suspended upon truncheons , so that the president could balance himself upon it as upon a rocking-chair , a very agreeable fact in the very hot weather .
0	<NAME> exquisite dishes , which seemed to descend from heaven , were placed successively before the guests , and the richest wines of <NAME> flowed in profusion during this splendid repast , served nine hundred feet beneath the surface of the earth !
0	At eight o ’ clock , its form , indistinct though it still was , seemed almost a reproduction of <NAME> .
0	Their knowledge of mathematics and astronomy facilitated their settlement and enabled them to gather , as well from the ancient annals of the country , as during their journies , a prodigious quantity of most valuable information concerning the history , ethnography , and geography of the <NAME> .
0	“ Yes , <NAME> , 79,625. ” “ And how many sheep ? ” “ Including the one we are eating at this moment. ” “ No , without counting that , since it is three parts devoured. ” “ <NAME> , <NAME> , ” exclaimed <NAME> , laughing heartily .
0	<NAME> <NAME> ’ s deep dejection was in strange contrast to his general hilarity .
0	Thus all the dwellers on the coasts , from <NAME> to <NAME> , as well as the people living on the shores of the <NAME> , seeing the great <NAME> ocean open to their vessels , began to inquire , whether indeed this new route might not conduct them to the shores of <NAME> .
0	A single trait of feeling , taken from many others , will serve to show the point which this homage of a whole people to a single individual attained .
0	<NAME> had also provided himself with a work which combined in one compilation all the notions already acquired concerning the Nile .
0	This was accompanied by successive explosions , resembling the discharge of a battery of mitrailleuses .
0	Without turning his head , without replying , he spurred on , and , clearing the brushwood with a tremendous bound , he galloped at full speed toward the <NAME> .
0	Once arrived in that country , circumstances must determine his future course .
0	Had Darwinian theories been in vogue in those days , no doubt <NAME> would have recognized in them that missing link between man and monkey , which is the despair of <NAME> 's followers .
0	The ambassador was accompanied by the minister plenipotentiary , and followed by his page and interpreter .
0	The colors for it were supplied from certain plants used in dyeing , and which were very abundant in the island ; only to the thirty-seven stars , representing the thirty-seven States of the <NAME> , which shine on the <NAME> flag , the sailor added a thirty-eighth , the star of “ the State of <NAME> , ” for he considered his island as already united to the great republic .
0	Our march had not been interrupted by this incident .
0	Their hair is black and woolly , curly , but not thick .
0	But no explosion , properly so termed , could be heard .
0	What one grasshopper does on a small scale , thousands do on a grand scale. ” “ It ’ s a terrible shower , ” said the hunter ; “ more so than hail itself in the devastation it causes. ” “ It is impossible to prevent it , ” replied <NAME> .
0	She will not doubt me for an instant !
0	He was a fine , open-hearted fellow , and I sold him a cargo of seal-skins .
0	Seventeen degrees above the <NAME> Circle a broad red line around the eighty-fourth parallel marked off the portion of the globe which the <NAME> Practical Association had brought to the hammer .
0	`` Thirty-seven minutes six seconds past ten . ''
0	On the 24th of January at mid-day , they sighted its extreme point , but eastward stretched some more land , which also appeared to be of great elevation .
0	`` Has he got on the track of some animal ? ''
0	After a busy day the colonists were sleeping soundly , when towards four o'clock in the morning they were suddenly awakened by <NAME> 's barking .
0	<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , posted themselves in different parts of the wood , whilst the two cavaliers and <NAME> galloped in a radius of half a mile round the corral .
0	<NAME> was the wonderful structure which was going down the <NAME> .
0	But though she may be brave -- and she certainly is so -- her strength must fail her , and , to say nothing of dangers and obstacles , she will be unable to endure the fatigue of such a journey .
0	<NAME> mists passed like clouds close to the ground .
0	Fortunately there were hundreds of other animals to secure our little company from hunger , and even from thirst , at need .
0	THE <NAME> had not so suddenly left the ball-room of the <NAME> , when the fete he was giving to the civil and military authorities and principal people of <NAME> was at the height of its brilliancy , without ample cause ; for he had just received information that serious events were taking place beyond the frontiers of the <NAME> .
0	409 <NAME> and <NAME> -- Champlain and <NAME> -- The <NAME> upon the coast of the <NAME> -- The Spaniards in <NAME> -- Summary of the information acquired at the close of the 17th century -- The measure of the terrestrial degree -- Progress of cartography -- Inauguration of <NAME> .
0	`` And I answer in the negative , '' continued <NAME> .
0	The country was evidently habitable and inhabited .
0	<NAME> had its drawbacks , but it had some compensating advantages .
0	His attitude and mien were that of a man utterly stupefied .
0	As to the forest , including <NAME> , as well as the forests of the <NAME> , it extended as far as the eye could reach .
0	There they found an empty house , the door wide open .
0	<NAME> ’ s place was , of course , to be in front of the wagon , and M. Olbinett , who did not much care for equitation , was to make room for himself among the baggage .
0	Therefore it was probable that Harding could easily solve the question of “ island or continent , ” to which he attached so much importance .
0	I became alarmed , and determined to discover what were our resources .
0	The elephant , which its owner had reared , not for a beast of burden , but for warlike purposes , was half domesticated .
0	Some , extending beyond the dome of smoke , dissipated it , leaving behind an incandescent powder .
0	Upon returning on board , the officers reported that the natives had invited them to land , more especially the women , with unequivocal gestures , and that moreover , there was excellent anchorage near the shore within reach of water .
0	To see them first , and then to hear them , such was the universal longing .
0	Avoiding <NAME> , whose inhabitants are fanatics and thieves , <NAME> entered <NAME> .
0	Lieutenant Procope had brought in his hand a mercurial thermometer , and <NAME> carried an aneroid barometer , by means of which he could estimate the depth of their descent below the level of the <NAME> .
0	`` Then , M. Aronnax , I propose a curious excursion . ''
0	<NAME> had saved <NAME> ’ s life in <NAME> ; <NAME> had rendered his master a like service in the <NAME> .
0	These were , however , the only results of the mission , which was thwarted by the <NAME> General <NAME> , whose influence was then paramount ; and <NAME> , disheartened by finding all his efforts frustrated , and recognizing that success was hopeless , returned to <NAME> the following year .
0	Never before had the <NAME> power in <NAME> been exposed to such danger , and if , as they had hoped , the sepoys had received assistance from without , the influence and supremacy in <NAME> of the <NAME> would have been a thing of the past .
0	“ Very good ; you may groom them and saddle them as quickly as you like .
0	The Indians along the river belong to peaceable tribes , and the fiercest of them have retired before the advancing civilization , and drawn further and further away from the river and its tributaries .
0	<NAME> has done it as well as I. ” “ At what height ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	At this point the excavation exhibited a depth of six and a half feet and the work of the masonry was begun .
0	<NAME> , overcoming her repugnance , looked at all these corpses !
0	He saw my hand in that of my uncle , and I venture to say that , taciturn as he was , his eyes beamed with lively satisfaction .
0	Do not let us leave our geography incomplete. ” “ All right ! ” said <NAME> .
0	it was he who threw us the ladder ! ''
0	Possibly it might not yet be extinguished , but no ray escaped from the depths of the abyss in which reposed all that was mortal of <NAME> .
0	“ What does it all mean ? ” exclaimed the captain , every hour growing more and more bewildered .
0	A middle-aged , respectable woman to help dress the ladies of the troupe of the `` Theatre Royal of <NAME> . ''
0	`` But that is the top of the volcano ! ''
0	cried <NAME> ; `` if we ever become Selenites we must inhabit the visible side .
0	The question of our wintering on the land whereon we had been thrown was settled for us .
0	In an instant we were by his side .
0	This personage would have made a good figure to support a pendulum , for the dial would have naturally been placed on his face , and the balance-wheel would have oscillated at its ease in his chest .
0	That makes twenty-five days of journeying .
0	“ I thought I heard someone walking behind us , ” replied the young miner , listening more attentively .
0	`` The huts of these islanders , who call themselves Orotchys , '' says the narrative , `` are surrounded by a drying ground for salmon , which were exposed to the sun upon perches , after having been smoked for three or four days at the stove which is in the centre of the hut .
0	But if all the information that we owe to the ancients , both <NAME> and <NAME> , with regard to these hyperborean countries be extremely vague and so to speak fabulous , it is not so with that which concerns the adventurous enterprises of the `` Men of the <NAME> . ''
0	Four others proceeded to a favourable distance from the fort , where <NAME> himself proposed to await the transit of the planet .
0	`` Is the steam full on ? ''
0	Fortunately , I eventually found means to free my raft , and float it again . ''
0	`` I am afraid the <NAME> will force me to violent measures , '' said <NAME> , upon learning what had passed .
0	`` The women sent their servants to find large pieces of their finest stuffs , tinted scarlet , rose , and straw colour , and perfumed with the most odoriferous oil .
0	<NAME> had heard of the existence of a <NAME> of female warriors who had founded a vast empire , which caused the river <NAME> to be called the _River of the <NAME> .
0	<NAME> water freezes only at a lower temperature than fresh ; the course of the <NAME> was therefore unimpeded by ice , but it could not be concealed that there was the greatest necessity to maintain the utmost possible speed .
0	At one time he was ordered to seize all the <NAME> ships lying in the <NAME> ports , in revenge for the capture by <NAME> pirates during a time of peace of a rich <NAME> galleon returning from <NAME> .
0	<NAME> was so elated with these happy results , that he arranged to revisit his own country , leaving Courtois as governor during his absence .
0	From thence he proceeded to <NAME> , where he remained for two years , and bought a large portion of the oriental manuscripts which now enrich the library of <NAME> .
0	It was like the arch of a bridge , under which rushed the foaming water .
0	Upon the 21st of <NAME> , 1721 , three vessels set sail from <NAME> , under his command .
0	<NAME> evening , <NAME> had his turn of delirium .
0	Let us follow the liana ! ” And off they went as happy as children home for their holidays .
0	The country being rich , the town is so likewise , for it is in the center of fruitful mines .
0	It is a question if he really visited all the places that he describes , and it seems probable that he did not ; in fact , in the narrative written at his dictation by <NAME> of Pisa it is stated `` Marco-Polo , a wise and noble citizen of <NAME> , saw nearly all herein described with his own eyes , and what he did not see he learnt from the lips of truthful and credible witnesses ; '' but we must add that the greater part of the kingdoms and towns spoken of by <NAME> Polo he certainly did visit .
0	“ <NAME> was alone , but he had no want of either ammunition , weapons , tools , or seeds .
0	They have been observed in all the level portion of the <NAME> 's surface .
0	During the morning of the 16th April , the balloon was placed in safety in the middle of a clearing in the great woods , with which the soil is studded .
0	They felt an undefinable dread of the abyss !
0	“ The more of those terrible creatures that are killed the better , at all events , ” said <NAME> , “ so let ’ s seize the chance , and it will not only give us a little diversion , but be doing a good action. ” “ Very well , set to work , then , ” said <NAME> .
0	<NAME> to its slight specific gravity , the Projectile , after reaching unknown depths of ocean through the terrific momentum of its fall , had been at last arrested in its course and even obliged to return to the surface .
0	After the long stay made by <NAME> in equinoctial <NAME> , the impulse his explorations would doubtless otherwise have given to geographical science was strangely checked by the struggle of the <NAME> colonies with the mother country .
0	`` The Indians in their pirogues surrounded our frigates , hovering about for three or four hours before beginning to exchange a few fish , or two or three otter skins ; they seized every opportunity of robbing us ; they tore off all the iron which could be easily carried away , and they took every precaution to elude our vigilance at night .
0	M. de <NAME> engaged as private secretary a professor , the <NAME> Jean-Baptiste Le Chevalier , who spoke <NAME> fluently .
0	`` Yes , <NAME> , and if the next crop gives a proportionate yield , we shall have four thousand bushels . ''
0	Suppose we talk about the question of light. ” “ Nothing is easier , ” replied Harding .
0	Few can possibly have forgotten the terrible storm from the northeast , in the middle of the equinox of that year .
0	for here we are pinned to the ground , like a bird with broken wings. ” “ With this difference , however , my dear <NAME> , that our wings are unhurt , and I hope that we shall be able to use them again. ” “ Ah !
0	They passed several farms fortified by battlements and surrounded by a deep moat , the principal building being encircled by a terrace , from which the inhabitants could fire down on the marauders in the plain .
0	As soon as the movement was assured , and there could be no error as to the height to which the flood would rise , all those interested in the undertaking were seized with no little excitement .
0	He ordered three boats to be manned , and landed with <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
0	In short , they had a supply for six weeks , and powder enough .
0	Leaving Mas-a-Fuero , <NAME> changed his route , with the intention of seeking <NAME> , now known as <NAME> , which was placed by geographers in 27 degrees 30 minutes , a hundred leagues westward of the <NAME> coast .
0	A noise of bolts was now heard , the door opened , and two men appeared .
0	<NAME> looked over and greedily read the work as it proceeded .
0	there is the gulf of <NAME> !
0	At once accepted by the <NAME> , <NAME> hastened his preparations , and left <NAME> upon the 22nd of May , 1795 .
0	Three of our men had perished , and in what frightful fashion !
0	But how the conditions under which they traveled were altered !
0	Though not very large , it appeared not likely to be filled for centuries .
0	No one was ignorant of the lengths to which the widow would go when the celebrated calculator was in peril .
0	The natives whom business called beyond the <NAME> frontier could not leave the province for a time at least .
0	At ten the moon will not be risen .
0	My master will be sending for us directly. ” “ I shan ’ t go. ” “ Oh !
0	The first volley so astonished them that they remained motionless .
0	A current in the lake runs along by the upper bank to the mouth of the <NAME> ; this current they hoped to utilize , and with its assistance to reach the outlet of <NAME> .
0	He had never thought of his proposal being met with any objection .
0	In vain had he refused admission to <NAME> ; every day the inquisitive neighbors scaled the palisades , some even carrying their imprudence to the point of smoking while surrounded by bales of gun-cotton .
0	A hundred arms were ready , and <NAME> ’ s revolver was snatched from him .
0	Crossing the line for the third time , they passed the site given by <NAME> as that of the <NAME> , without finding them ; and , upon the 6th of December , entered the <NAME> , the merit of discovering which belongs to <NAME> .
0	There yet remained much useful advice to give them , and , his heart being softened by the approach of death , he invited , as we are aware , the colonists of <NAME> to visit the “ Nautilus , ” by means of a wire which connected it with the corral .
0	“ That is rather a warm trade , I think. ” “ Very warm , ” answered the engineer .
0	Here he was abandoned by his negro servants , who were unwilling to accompany him to the country of the Moors .
0	It was about this time that the question began to be mooted whether it would not be right to reopen some communication with the Englishmen at <NAME> .
0	Now , of the seniors , there remained ten men , counting <NAME> ; of the new men there were thirteen ; twenty-three in all .
0	The silk was doubled , at the upper extremity of the oval , where most of the strain would come .
0	Strangers were not allowed to inspect two other magazines in which were stored powder and other war-materials , strong liquors , iron , & c. All these places were for the present abandoned by the new sovereign , who held his court at <NAME> .
0	<NAME> <NAME> briefly drew attention to these points , and concluded by saying , “ My friends , we must , without delay , hasten to the assistance of this unfortunate man. ” “ For my part , ” said the count , “ I am quite ready to accompany you ; it is not unlikely that he is not alone in his distress. ” Lieutenant Procope expressed much surprise .
0	What _had_ switched them off ?
0	There was no longer any doubt as to the pirates ’ intentions .
0	If the boat had not returned in the afternoon a second was to be sent in search of us .
0	The professor scowled at him , and was manifestly annoyed at having the insignificant dimensions of his comet pointed out in so disparaging a manner .
0	So the day passed , and night came on , calm and peaceful as the preceding had been .
0	He seems to have specially turned his attention to the overflow of the banks of the Nile , and he gives an account of the different opinions held as to the source of this river , which the <NAME> worshipped as one of their deities .
0	The traveller was not to be deceived .
0	`` Do n't you know that the sea turned it over ? ''
0	The captain concluded the narrative of his life .
0	I appeal to your sagacity .
0	`` Are those from <NAME> of any interest ? ''
0	In 1504 and 1505 four vessels explored the Gulf of <NAME> .
0	From this day , the thoughts of the inhabitants of <NAME> were solely occupied with the intended search .
0	The pirogues were full of women , who might vie with most Europeans in pleasant features , and who certainly excelled them in beauty of form . ''
0	How could it be otherwise with a place liable to incessant raids from the <NAME> ?
0	At length , the rapidity of the wind became excessive , approaching thirty miles per hour .
0	There will not always be scientific men , perhaps ; but there always will be poets. ” “ We can still see cataracts , ” said <NAME> .
0	But in the case under consideration , the solution of the problem regarding the conquest of the <NAME> , <NAME> had no flight to take in the sublime regions of analysis .
0	It would be difficult to imagine a collection of greater ruffians .
0	It was Boy who finally achieved the rescue of the <NAME> , for he consented to pay to Obie the ransom he demanded for them and their people .
0	And do you think now that she could undertake a voyage of some extent ? ” “ What voyage , <NAME> ? ” “ One to <NAME> , for instance. ” “ My friend , ” replied Harding , “ I think that in any pressing emergency we need not hesitate to trust ourselves to the ‘ Bonadventure ’ even for a longer voyage ; but you know I should see you set off to <NAME> with great uneasiness , since nothing obliges you to go there. ” “ One likes to know one ’ s neighbors , ” returned the sailor , who was obstinate in his idea .
0	Had not <NAME> seen the Projectile ?
0	Besides , according to the calculations of some naturalists , one of these animals only six feet long would have tentacles twenty-seven feet long .
0	The prisoner remained quiet in the fore-cabin , and as he had been a sailor it appeared that the motion of the vessel might produce on him a salutary reaction .
0	I returned to my room , clothed myself warmly -- sea boots , an otterskin cap , a great coat of byssus , lined with sealskin ; I was ready , I was waiting .
0	When he returned to <NAME> , by means of the original as well as of some supplementary notes , he wrote a longer narrative of the expedition , at the request of <NAME> .
0	It was a work of the higher mechanics , appreciable only by mathematicians .
0	Until further information , therefore , I shall maintain it to be a sea-unicorn of colossal dimensions , armed not with a halberd , but with a real spur , as the armoured frigates , or the ` rams ' of war , whose massiveness and motive power it would possess at the same time .
0	One hour more , and the point of equal attraction would be reached .
0	`` No , <NAME> , '' answered the captain ; `` when the doctor took you from your icy tomb , I did not know who you were , and you have saved me at the risk of your own life , knowing who I was . ''
0	This unbroken level discouraged the beholder , and gave him that kind of malady called the “ desert-sickness. ” The impassible monotony of the arid blue sky , and the vast yellow expanse of the desert-sand , at length produced a sensation of terror .
0	There seems a <NAME> .
0	It was in <NAME> , the vast riches of which had been hinted at in the accounts given of their travels by <NAME> and <NAME> , that the attention of the <NAME> was now concentrated .
0	`` How have we forgotten them ? ''
0	`` My son , '' said he to <NAME> , `` I give my daughter to thee . ''
0	`` Not more , captain , '' replied <NAME> .
0	At that moment the doctor and <NAME> came up to <NAME> .
0	Most of them anointed their hair and beards with a yellow ointment , and some even rubbed their faces with the same stuff . ''
0	It shifted abruptly from south to north , but finally the <NAME> was carried away by it toward the west .
0	The crust of the vast globe still yielded under the influence of the seething , boiling mass , which was forever at work beneath .
0	Five hundred feet from the rocks the sea was boiling under the action of subterraneous fires .
0	They determined to act the next night , and to kill these wretches , so as not to be killed by them .
0	<NAME> Harding feared above all lest the liquefied matter should overflow the shore , for in that event the dockyard could not escape .
0	The great number of plants discovered by the naturalists in this part , induced <NAME> to give it the name of <NAME> .
0	But as the aeronauts were being hurried on at a speed of 70 miles a second , this vague aspect of the earth soon developed itself into definite outlines .
0	First , the rocks of the coast were lost to view ; then the white crests of the cliffs were no longer to be seen ; and at last , the summit of the volcano , with its corona of vapor , was entirely out of sight .
0	Neither the accustomed bleating of the sheep nor <NAME> 's voice could be heard .
0	I , however , was very far from being in humor to discuss the matter .
0	After spending six months in this fruitless search , he was tired of playing the dupe , so giving up the business he returned to <NAME> on the 5th of October , leaving <NAME> de <NAME> and the pilot <NAME> de Alaminos to continue the search .
0	Moreover , the steep sides , where breathing was difficult , were clothed with magnificent forests of tapering pines , and firs , and wide-spreading cypress and cedar-trees .
0	Thus five determined persons were about to abandon themselves to the mercy of the tempestuous elements !
0	At last , after trying for five minutes , he managed to utter this word : -- `` _Porpoise_ . ''
0	Thus perished the illustrious <NAME> on the 27th of April , 1521 .
0	`` To know what is going on in <NAME> . ''
0	bah ! ” “ The conclusion of all , ” said <NAME> , “ is that we must not fall into their hands .
0	As soon as the anchor , imbedded in the sandy bottom , had made good its hold , a boat was lowered .
0	During long hours this work was prosecuted busily but silently ; <NAME> had the furnace-fires lighted to help him through this passage so providentially discovered .
0	<NAME> seems to have been well acquainted with the geography of the <NAME> , for he speaks of it as a Sea `` quite by itself '' and having no communication with any other .
0	But on this occasion , instead of <NAME> , an old and extinct volcano , we were inside a mountain of fire in full activity .
0	`` We will begin our researches as soon as possible .
0	<NAME> , however , checked the intrepid explorers , who continued to follow the <NAME> , now dwindled down to a stream only 300 roods wide , and arrived in February at <NAME> , where they were received with enthusiasm at the camp of some trappers and fur hunters from <NAME> .
0	A little spluttering was heard and a tiny blue flame sprang up , making a choking smoke .
0	This occupied them until February 15th .
0	The danger lies there , and a terrible danger ! ''
0	<NAME> was <NAME> ’ s sorrowful story , and she recounted it in so simple and unaffected a manner , that it was evident she never thought her conduct had been that of a heroine through those long trying years .
0	But they are only partial , during which the earth , cast like a screen upon the solar disc , allows the greater portion to be seen . ''
0	Was he bent on a voyage of discovery ?
0	The flashes dazzled and almost blinded them .
0	asked <NAME> , trying to keep cool .
0	President <NAME> , however , less sensitive to these wonders , was in haste to press forward ; the very luxuriance of the country was displeasing to him .
0	In the afternoon , <NAME> sent the lieutenant to procure water and to take possession of the island in the name of King <NAME> .
0	This Macartney rightly interpreted as his _congé_ !
0	What they were nobody else seemed to know , and he seemed to be in no hurry to tell .
0	It was a glorious night .
0	All that day , and night , too , they traveled on at the rate of six miles an hour .
0	`` Yes , we will save him ! ''
0	A few churches , with <NAME> cupolas colored green and gold , stood up against the gray sky .
0	I looked at all points of the horizon .
0	The only trees were either stunted cedars , so far apart , as to be often denominated <NAME> ; and , besides wormwood , the only plant was the sage plant , about two feet high , gray , dry , crisp , and emitting a sharp pungent odor by no means pleasant .
0	There is what will furnish us with linen for years .
0	Of the other men , <NAME> and <NAME> seemed to be the best ; <NAME> was a jolly fellow , always laughing and joking ; <NAME> , a man about thirty-five years old , had an energetic , but rather pale and sad face .
0	This put an end to the discussion .
0	It was too little ; for , as the wind did not freshen , they only advanced very slowly towards the <NAME> coast .
0	In his hand was a branch of a tree , which served as a crook for this antediluvian shepherd .
0	`` I will do so , '' replied <NAME> , `` or rather I will simply afford you the explanation which , during our few minutes of private conversation , was given me by <NAME> . ''
0	<NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> remained silent in the midst of the darkness .
0	<NAME> faith , and let my device be yours -- ‘ Excelsior ! ’ ” “ ‘ Excelsior ’ be it then , ” said the sportsman , who did not understand a word of <NAME> .
0	This was in 1861 , and for twelve months , or up to May , 1862 , letters were regularly received from him , but no tidings whatever had come since his departure from <NAME> , in June , and the name of the <NAME> never appeared in the <NAME> .
0	No wonder that <NAME> cared so little to quit his observatory ; for throughout those calm , clear <NAME> nights , when the book of the firmament lay open before him , he could revel in a spectacle which no previous astronomer had ever been permitted to enjoy .
0	This is <NAME> .
0	Its climate is mild and moist .
0	`` The voice of violent waves was heard .
0	At eight o ’ clock , the summit of the <NAME> was lost in portentous darkness .
0	<NAME> approach showed it to be of great extent .
0	Nevertheless , I want to ask you whether it is your intention to go ashore , captain ? ''
0	This question seemed a very hard one .
0	<NAME> and shoes went whirling through the air , and <NAME> thought he even heard the crack of revolvers mingling in the din , the rout approached the stairway , and flowed over the lower step .
0	Will they go from one planet to another , from <NAME> to <NAME> , and after awhile from one star to another , from the Polar to <NAME> ?
0	It is the residence of one of the sultans of the <NAME> country , where civilization is , perhaps , the least backward .
0	So much effort ineffectually expended , so much labor lost .
0	On his fourth voyage <NAME> and his small party of followers started from <NAME> , the nearest point to the <NAME> regions , and , after passing <NAME> , made for the north ; but a violent storm broke up the ice , there only three feet thick , and involved the explorers in the greatest danger .
0	He undertook to convey all documents of every kind collected during the voyage to <NAME> ; but being taken prisoner by an <NAME> frigate , he was deprived of his property , in defiance of justice ; and when <NAME> obtained the objects of natural history , of which she had been robbed -- the expression is not too strong when we recall the instructions given by the <NAME> government with regard to <NAME> 's expedition -- they were in so bad a condition that they had lost much of their value .
0	A thick white beard flowed over his chest ; a fur cap covered his head ; his aspect was grave and austere .
0	`` I am certain of it . ''
0	In 29deg 2 ’ south latitude , and 165deg 42 ’ east longitude , to the east of <NAME> , is found a little island , six miles in circumference , overlooked by <NAME> , which rises to a height of 1,100 feet above the level of the sea .
0	<NAME> , a little contracted in territory , gave nevertheless 9,000 ducats , proving her love for scientific experiments .
0	At this point of his narrative <NAME> gives an account of the `` Old Man of the <NAME> , '' the chief of the <NAME> sect called the <NAME> , who were noted for their religious fanaticism and terrible cruelty .
0	at sight of the lash raised upon <NAME> , could you refrain ?
0	To this question , which each one asked himself , a reply was suddenly made by <NAME> .
0	Did a brighter light burn in the depths of that obscured mind ?
0	The ground had once more become a dead level , the last mountains of the <NAME> were passed , and a long carpet of verdure unrolled itself over the monotonous prairie beneath the horses ’ tread .
0	His third son , <NAME> , after having been in the service of King Emmanuel , when the latter was only <NAME> de <NAME> had felt himself attracted while still young to the enterprises of discovery which had rendered his father illustrious .
0	What seemed easy at <NAME> , seemed here in the wide ocean almost impossible .
0	From what <NAME> had said in his journal , the explorers expected to have to contend with natural dangers of a very formidable description , and also to fight their way amongst natives of gigantic stature , whose hostility to the white man was invincible .
0	One 's native land ! -- there should one live !
0	One need not be surprised at this .
0	“ The heart has not been touched ; if it had been , <NAME> would be dead ! ” “ Dead ! ” exclaimed <NAME> , with a groan .
0	Have you fixed the day ? ” “ I shall be at home every day to my friends , ” replied <NAME> ; “ and you are -- ” “ The most devoted among them all , ” interrupted <NAME> , gaily .
0	“ So , <NAME> , ” added the engineer , “ you have made a discovery of great importance to us .
0	The archæological expedition of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> had been published in succession , and the <NAME> <NAME> was at work upon the publication of its large and magnificent work .
0	He reconnoitred the northern coast , and thence reached the shores of <NAME> , which <NAME> had announced his intention of visiting when he left <NAME> , and surveyed <NAME> .
0	A month had elapsed since the meeting in the rooms of the <NAME> , and a change had taken place in public opinion .
0	said <NAME> , who had made up his mind quickly ; and with his active imagination he saw the chance of safety .
0	The little procession now crossed the railway some two hundred yards below the bridge , and then resumed their eastward course .
0	<NAME> , her feet riveted to the floor , stood breathless and motionless .
0	In certain places the current flows with the speed of two miles and a half an hour .
0	The doctor glanced around him in the car .
0	To a solitary individual , a little troop of eight men , all mounted and well armed , wore a suspicious aspect , so that any intercourse either with honest men or even banditti , was almost impossible .
0	The moment of departure had come .
0	Some wore crowns of birds ' feathers .
0	`` It looks like it , '' answered <NAME> .
0	cried <NAME> , when his companion had depicted this scene to him with much energy .
0	I could see its green and red lights , and its white lantern hanging from the large foremast .
0	From this point its course was pursued through a forest of magnificent trees .
0	These tardy questions of <NAME> 's respecting his brother were put , I had no doubt whatsoever , at the instigation of <NAME> , but what was his motive , and was it at the Falklands that he had discovered the secret of <NAME> ?
0	At eight o ’ clock <NAME> had not appeared , but there was no doubt that the frightful weather alone hindered his return , and that he must have taken refuge in some cave , to await the end of the storm or at least the return of day .
0	Flashes of lightning rivaled in intensity the volcano ’ s eruption .
0	Nothing could be easier than to execute this project , and this is how the engineer intended to set to work .
0	In the meanwhile night came on , and it was already dark when the settlers reached <NAME> , the place where they had discovered the precious chest .
0	In spite of all this , the admiral , who never forgot the principal object of his mission in these new countries , had succeeded in establishing regular intercourse with the natives .
0	[ Illustration : Portrait of <NAME> .
0	They may be divided into three parts .
0	He can try again. ” “ Why , these apes are so cunning , ” returned <NAME> ; “ they won ’ t show themselves again at the windows and so we can ’ t kill them ; and when I think of the mischief they may do in the rooms and storehouse -- ” “ Have patience , ” replied <NAME> ; “ these creatures can not keep us long at bay. ” “ I shall not be sure of that till I see them down here , ” replied the sailor .
0	<NAME> <NAME> wished to set out without delay ; but as the expedition would be of some days ' duration , it appeared best to load the cart with different materials and tools in order to facilitate the organisation of the encampments .
0	At last , on the 26th July , a messenger arrived from the King of <NAME> to inquire into the strange conduct of the <NAME> of <NAME> , and the cause of his detention of the white men .
0	The Projectile advanced , but the scene of desolation seemed to remain unchanged .
0	He soon found a channel , which shortly brought them to the open sea .
0	The <NAME> made a sign at which all the crowd bent low their heads .
0	The <NAME> Government had just passed a law prohibiting the introduction of furs into the ports of the empire under most severe penalties .
0	It was an opportunity for him to talk , and for me to hear , that old language of <NAME> , which is still in use in some <NAME> provinces .
0	And then came a sandy tract , without any transition , but with the abruptness of change so characteristic of <NAME> scenery .
0	We were in sight of the island for twelve hours , and then it was lost in the evening mists .
0	At the expiration of two months and a half the ribs had been set up and the first planks adjusted .
0	While the boring went on in the flank of <NAME> , the workmen were busy at the second foundry .
0	“ Blessed be God for having vouchsafed to me the joy before I die of having pressed your friendly hands , and having heard , once more , the language of my country ! ” The missionary here grew weak again , and the whole day went by between hope and fear , <NAME> deeply moved , and <NAME> drawing his hand over his eyes more than once when he thought that no one saw him .
0	`` Come , <NAME> , '' said he : `` come , my girl !
0	<NAME> took <NAME> ’ s hand , and they started .
0	Those intended for the table never ate meat , but were fed upon bread-fruits , cocoa-nuts , yams , and other vegetables .
0	But <NAME> opened his hunting knife , and at the risk of being ripped up himself , sprang at the animal , and plunged it into his heart .
0	It was now necessary to complete the observations of the evening before by measuring the height of the cliff above the level of the sea .
0	After we had gone about five hundred yards , we suddenly turned a steep promontory , and found ourselves close to a lofty forest !
0	$ 5,446,675 Such was the sum which the public poured into the treasury of the <NAME> .
0	In this alarming situation and amid dreadful alternations of hope and despair , the 12th of December passed away , and the ensuing night , <NAME> never left his post , not even to take food .
0	He took great care not to touch these nests , to which their proprietors would not fail to return .
0	<NAME> <NAME> made this one last objection , that the presence of <NAME> was necessary to discover traces of the <NAME> or <NAME> .
0	The cold may be resisted by one who succumbs to dampness ; hence it was necessary to guard against it .
0	Then burst forth the unending argument between the believers and the unbelievers in the societies of the wise and the scientific journals .
0	said <NAME> , `` these beasts can turn themselves over , then ? ''
0	“ I thought , captain , ” said <NAME> , “ that turtles , once placed on their backs , could not regain their feet , especially when they are of a large size ? ’ “ That is true , my boy , ” replied <NAME> .
0	During the night of the 8th of December , <NAME> was seized by a more violent delirium .
0	`` Take him , guide , '' returned <NAME> , `` and I shall still be your debtor . ''
0	`` An idea which has just occurred to me -- '' `` An idea , '' said <NAME> ; `` one of your ideas !
0	They went on as before , hand in hand , speaking little , <NAME> looking about on every side ; twice a day they halted .
0	<NAME> to his exertions in its behalf all over the country , the phrase is now the most popular of the day , well known and relished in every part of the <NAME> .
0	There was good sense in <NAME> 's words ; I could not deny the fact .
0	The addition of a couple of iron runners would be all that was requisite to convert it into an excellent sledge , which , if a sail were hoisted , might be deemed certain to make a rapid progress over the smooth surface of the ice .
0	However , the temperature was not as yet much lower , and a centigrade thermometer , transported to <NAME> , would still have marked an average of ten to twelve degrees above zero .
0	It would have been difficult for matters to have turned out otherwise .
0	We have need of all our self-possession .
0	But the dam held firm , and after a moment of terrible suspense the torrent precipitated itself into <NAME> from a height of twenty feet .
0	His emotion showed the extreme importance he attached to the possession of this letter .
0	Had the <NAME> veered round ?
0	The schooner was to sail on the 15th of <NAME> , and on the eve of that day I had no reason to think that Captain Len Guy had repented him of his categorical refusal .
0	When the cart reached the palisade , it stopped .
0	The agitation caused by the <NAME> and <NAME> affair had subsided .
0	This continent is not much better known than the interior of <NAME> , and yet it is from no lack of enterprising travelers .
0	“ Who ’ s there ? ” he cried , in no very amiable tone .
0	He tossed about on his sandy couch , scarcely giving a thought to the struggle of the elements .
0	But neither the unfortunate vessel nor her crew was destined ever to return to <NAME> .
0	The latter was then led towards the mouth of the <NAME> , and all climbing the left bank of the river , reached <NAME> .
0	`` Then he must have found all that remained of the crew of the <NAME> -- my brother <NAME> and those who had survived with him ? ''
0	`` You believe in this journey around the world , then ? ''
0	`` <NAME> has calculated that a force five times greater than that of our gun would suffice to send a meteor from the moon to the earth , and there is not one volcano which has not a greater power of propulsion than that . ''
0	P.M. , were due on the 4th at 0h .
0	And lastly , a pallisade , high and regularly built , surrounded the summit of the hill .
0	I should have ventured out on the very point of the Projectile , and there I should have danced and postured and kicked and bobbed and capered in a style that <NAME> never dreamed of ! ''
0	“ There is no doubt that the problem of the change of the terrestrial axis was correctly stated , and it should have been correctly worked out .
0	Cases of all sorts encumbered it , and , as they had been but a very short time in the water , their contents were perhaps uninjured .
0	It was then four o ’ clock in the afternoon , and from the poop the passengers could see the quartermaster gazing at the ship , standing with folded arms on a rock , motionless as a statue .
0	I sought them greedily , and ferreted them out indefatigably , and I have been able to bring together some objects of great value .
0	The cold forced him to return .
0	We were then upon the dangerous coast of <NAME> .
0	`` It is simply an olive porphyry , genus olive , order of the pectinibranchidae , class of gasteropods , sub-class mollusca . ''
0	Yes , but he was smiling in a very strange way . ''
0	He was brought , indeed , very nearly lifeless on to the beach .
0	<NAME> counselled a debarcation by night , which was done , and then he took the command of a small body of men and scoured the island with them for eight days without meeting one native , they having all fled to the mountains .
0	Not only had <NAME> announced that he would attain his object—and now the capital at his command enabled him to reach it without hindrance—but he would certainly not have appealed for funds if he was not certain of success .
0	All the sails were up , and the jib was so arranged as not to screen the brigantine .
0	Harding made arrangements , therefore , for living in the corral , of which the provisions would last for a tolerable length of time .
0	The waters of the <NAME> ran silently , like a sheet of oil over a surface of marble .
0	<NAME> was warmly welcomed by the viceroy , and thus describes his first interview .
0	<NAME> <NAME> was buried on the coast .
0	They could not stay in the town , as it was in flames , and about to be left by the last of the marauders .
0	It was now light , although the sun had not yet risen above the horizon .
0	`` It is necessary to carry a notice there to point out the position of our island and say that <NAME> is here in case the <NAME> yacht should come to take him off .
0	“ I confess , dear <NAME> , it would be extremely painful for me to see the wretched man. ” “ He must be confronted with us , <NAME> , ” replied <NAME> ; “ I beg you will stay .
0	He arbitrarily rejected all that had been done before his time .
0	interrupted <NAME> , desirous to keep his friends from losing their tempers in idle disputation .
0	Although he had received very costly presents , <NAME> was anything but satisfied , and declared that if the travellers did not make him other and more valuable gifts , he would require their guns , pistols , and powder , before he allowed them to leave <NAME> .
0	The hunters took the route by the sea and went forward rapidly .
0	`` 'Only , ' added he , 'it was not on the west coast , but on the east coast of <NAME> that the vessel was lost ; and if <NAME> is still living , as his document indicates , he is a prisoner among the natives , and it is on the other coast that he must be looked for . '
0	That 's a mean way of refusing politely what we ask for . ''
0	Arrived at <NAME> , <NAME> saw with extreme satisfaction that the “ Bonadventure ” was tranquilly floating in the narrow creek .
0	`` It was n't the wind that blew down this post , '' observed <NAME> .
0	At 11,000 feet all trace of vegetation had disappeared .
0	<NAME> was the density of the atmosphere that they could not be certain whether it was day or night .
0	When a rich man had no sons , he came to the king and asked of him some of his wards , who were immediately given to him .
0	The surrounding attendants , and especially ladies , were much more inquisitive .
0	There exist guns , according to <NAME> , perfected in <NAME> by <NAME> and <NAME> , in <NAME> by <NAME> , and in <NAME> by <NAME> , which are furnished with a peculiar system of closing , which can fire under these conditions .
0	said an ingenious naturalist , `` in which the animal kingdom blossoms , and the vegetable does not ! ''
0	But let us hasten to add that Quiquendone has neither industry nor commerce , and that it does very well without them .
0	So passed the winter months , June , July , and August .
0	Now my worthy uncle , the Professor , no doubt regarded this discovery as a very simple fact , but to me the idea was by no means a pleasant one .
0	The orderly shook his head dubiously .
0	But , once more , what possible interest could any human being have in the destruction of our works ? ” “ It is quite incomprehensible , ” replied <NAME> .
0	The young woman , who was seated aft , was profoundly affected as she looked out upon the ocean , darkening now with the twilight , on which she had ventured in so frail a vessel .
0	a fall is a grand thing !
0	For what had she come to look at the shores of <NAME> ?
0	The colonists had reached the bottom of the basalt cliff .
0	At half-past twelve the train stopped at <NAME> where <NAME> was able to purchase some <NAME> slippers , ornamented with false pearls , in which , with evident vanity , he proceeded to encase his feet .
0	After all , suppose the old fellow was right !
0	<NAME> 's confused replies , and the half-broiled head of a man , found by <NAME> in a pirogue in <NAME> , placed the existence of this barbarous practice beyond the possibility of doubt .
0	But , in short , <NAME> did not suffer much from the inclemency of the weather , and it was the same with the corral , which , less exposed than the plateau , and sheltered partly by <NAME> , only received the remains of the hurricanes , already broken by the forests and the high rocks of the shore .
0	Here and there luminous spots appeared , dying out and rekindling constantly , in all directions , like fantastic lights dancing over the surface of an immense lagoon .
0	<NAME> soon saw there was nothing more to be got from his crew ; kindness and persuasion were fruitless ; he resolved to employ severity , and , if need be , to be pitiless ; he distrusted especially <NAME> , and even <NAME> , who , however , never dared to speak too loud .
0	Meanwhile a frightful tempest was raging under us , but we were above it .
0	He had just written 40,000—when the bell rang a second time .
0	This declaration was received with enthusiasm by the whole crew , who were animated , like all Dutchmen of that period , with a love for great discoveries .
0	“ You wish to shake my hands ! ” said <NAME> .
0	<NAME> saw at once that the young man was <NAME> ; his face was phlegmatic , but pleasant , and at once inspired confidence .
0	Here I weigh more , because I am nearer the centre of attraction ; and on another planet I should weigh more or less according to the mass of the planet . ''
0	Being unable to see his enemies , he had not thought of defending himself .
0	`` Sir , '' he would have said to me , `` this is not the way !
0	<NAME> undid the belt which encircled the body of <NAME> underneath the torn poncho , and feeling his breast-pocket , exclaimed : “ The case ! ” A cry of joy escaped from <NAME> .
0	I can see up yonder natural cradles , in which once safely tucked up we shall sleep as if we were in the best beds in the world .
0	`` Two of their number , '' says the narrative , `` which carried about sixty armed men , approached within hearing , and the natives began their war-song , but seeing that this attracted little attention , they began throwing stones at the <NAME> , and paddled along the shore .
0	`` My friends , '' said the doctor , intervening for the best , `` come , a little calm , it can all settle itself .
0	That would be an imprudence I would not commit , even though the crew would allow me . ''
0	For , although the rascals can do nothing to our house , they may plunder the plateau , our plantations , our poultry-yard ! ''
0	It was an almost perpendicular ridge that ended in a regular wall rising abruptly in a straight line .
0	In a few moments this prayer would ascend to the feet of the <NAME> .
0	The admiral put to sea again , and sailed along the southern coast of <NAME> for about one hundred and fifty miles .
0	<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and the <NAME> nobles have appeared , somewhat prematurely , perhaps , upon the scene .
0	She consulted the officers , who all gave their approval in writing ; and she found in <NAME> a devotion and skill which were speedily to be put to a severe proof .
0	These habitations give interest to the scene , and are surrounded by very fine plantations ; yams , rice , onions , pistachio nuts , & c. , are exported in large quantities . ''
0	Nevertheless , the brig put out slowly into the ice-streams , while the ice crushed noisily against her bows ; the packs at this time were six or seven feet thick ; it was necessary carefully to avoid them , for if the ship should try to withstand them , it ran the risk of being lifted half out of the water and cast on her beam-ends .
0	A month passed away , but <NAME> found no opportunity of getting at the information he had pledged himself to gain .
0	On the contrary , they looked , if possible , more dreary and inhospitable than before .
0	The strangers gave them iron and glass wares , on which they set no store ; but one of them , having succeeded in possessing himself secretly of <NAME> 's cutlass , the others recommenced their hostile demonstrations , and it was necessary to fire at the robber , who was hit , when they all threw themselves into the river to gain the opposite shore .
0	The ice masses had just `` weighed anchor , '' as the sailors say .
0	<NAME> drew on ; the sun ’ s disc , enlarged by refraction , was dipping blood-red below the horizon .
0	Neither <NAME> nor <NAME> cared to attend .
0	A vague idea of ruin began to take possession of his mind : he must yield to necessity ; he must do the best he could .
0	There was no one in the rooms nor in the storehouse , which had been respected by the band of quadrumana .
0	The cart was waiting on the beach before the <NAME> .
0	If the vanguard of Feofar-Khan ’ s troops appeared , it would then be time to strike across the country .
0	A letter had apprised him of the death of his wife , and at the same time of the departure of his daughter , who had obtained from the government an authorization to join him at <NAME> .
0	“ There , there , ” said <NAME> , “ they ’ re rather rough in their orders to their good moon and her divine sons. ” The doctor , equipped with his travelling medicine-chest , descended to the ground , preceded by <NAME> , who kept a straight countenance and looked as grave and knowing as the circumstances of the case required .
0	But hope urged him onward .
0	Showers of red-hot stones , clouds of reddish vapor and rockets of lava , all combined , presented the appearance of glowing sparkling streams .
0	It is needless to say that no one troubled himself to institute a search after him , and , as <NAME> sententiously remarked , “ Perhaps old <NAME> is making money in <NAME> by exhibiting himself as the latest arrival from a comet ! ” But however great was the reserve which <NAME> might make on his part , nothing could induce <NAME> to conceal his experiences .
0	But habit was too strong for him !
0	<NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> were present on board the boat , and assisted at the operation with an interest which may readily be comprehended .
0	The cocoa-nuts from which it received its name were procured with difficulty .
0	However , the balloon , lightened of heavy articles , such as ammunition , arms , and provisions , had risen into the higher layers of the atmosphere , to a height of 4,500 feet .
0	`` For my part , however , '' continued <NAME> , not heeding these interruptions , `` I must confess that , notwithstanding the magnificent splendor of the spectacle when viewed for the first time by the Selenite who inhabits the dark side of the <NAME> , I should prefer to be a resident on the illuminated side .
0	The travellers followed a deep ravine , up to their waists in snow , and perspiring violently in spite of the intense cold .
0	Desirous of satisfying the <NAME> mob , as well as the mob of other countries , the <NAME> Government decided to bring J. T. <NAME> to trial .
0	`` Three cheers for the <NAME> ! ''
0	The members of the <NAME> , a circle of artillerymen formed at <NAME> after the <NAME> war , conceived the idea of putting themselves in communication with the moon ! -- yes , with the moon -- by sending to her a projectile .
0	As for the savages , they returned to the shore about eleven o'clock in the morning , as soon as the coral tops began to disappear under the rising tide ; but I saw their numbers had increased considerably on the shore .
0	And having shaken hands with his friends , on the 12th of November , at six o'clock A.M. , after strictly informing them not to open his prison before the 20th , at six o'clock P.M. , he slid down the projectile , the plate of which was at once hermetically sealed .
0	This fresh obstacle forced us to seek a new road , or to pass around the foot of the avalanche .
0	“ <NAME> ! ” cried the engineer , seizing the arm of the man whom he had just found again under such unexpected circumstances .
0	But though there might be no inconvenience in the enclosure being so far from <NAME> , it would not be the same with the poultry-yard , to which <NAME> called the attention of the colonists .
0	Thus the 3rd of <NAME> arrived , and they might calculate upon launching the vessel in ten days .
0	Nominated ambassador at <NAME> , <NAME> determined to profit by the leisure he enjoyed in travelling as an artist and archæologist through the <NAME> of <NAME> and <NAME> .
0	At that time the country was invaded by five armies , and the belligerents sent a succession of envoys to the <NAME> ambassador , hoping to obtain , if not substantial assistance , at least moral support .
0	Thereupon <NAME> began to choose his crew , bearing in mind the captain 's wishes about the independence and health of the men .
0	The <NAME> offered a retreat sufficient for the present .
0	But others found it after <NAME> , and others will find it again . ''
0	“ <NAME> ? ” asked the chief of the police .
0	<NAME> , not being able to get around this obstacle , determined to attack it boldly in front .
0	My uncle would simply have quoted the example of <NAME> .
0	This day , as on other <NAME> , we observed as a day of rest and pious meditation .
0	You have tried it already ?
0	He knew this , but he also knew that he would certainly surmount them .
0	Ten , twenty , fifty , a hundred ? ''
0	“ They were destroyed by the Fouillanes in 1826 ; the city was one-third larger then , for <NAME> , an object generally coveted by all the tribes , since the eleventh century , has belonged in succession to the <NAME> , the Sonrayans , the <NAME> men , and the <NAME> ; and this great centre of civilization , where a sage like Ahmed-Baba owned , in the sixteenth century , a library of sixteen hundred manuscripts , is now nothing but a mere half-way house for the trade of <NAME> Africa. ” The city , indeed , seemed abandoned to supreme neglect ; it betrayed that indifference which seems epidemic to cities that are passing away .
0	The 18th , the 19th of <NAME> passed without any alteration in the weather .
0	It was needful , therefore , to descend again to the east-south-east .
0	The air was full of the noise of avalanches falling from the hills to the bottom of the ravines , and the cracking of the ice-field produced a deafening sound .
0	`` Let us advance , then , '' I cried eagerly , no longer able to restrain my curiosity .
0	They stretched out their hands , and alternately struck their feet against the ground with frantic contortions .
0	The result , however , of this decision was to create a rivalry entirely without precedent between the different towns of these two States .
0	He was then to survey the whole of the north-west coast , from 30 degrees N. lat .
0	However , the travellers ' eyes were soon able to trace the rest of the <NAME> 's surface not only with facility , but even to follow its outline with absolute delight .
0	The only incidents which imparted a slight animation , were the sudden and unexpected differences in the depth of the sea , caused by the line of breakers which it was necessary to avoid .
0	“ But at what time , ” asked <NAME> , “ must your daughter have left the <NAME> territory ? ” “ About the same time that you did , ” replied Fedor .
0	Lying low , it was scarcely visible above the water , and had the sun not shone out , the <NAME> would have been lost upon it .
0	This course of reasoning roused my drooping spirits , and I resolved to resume my journey without further delay .
0	But at length he managed to react against all these sufferings ; and when evening came again , he resolved to pass the night on the shores of <NAME> .
0	And yet , what remained of the long journey of four thousand miles for the <NAME> ’ s courier to reach his end ?
0	said <NAME> , in a voice which betrayed his emotion .
0	`` With a piece of ice which we shall cut out . ''
0	He had begun to take some nourishment .
0	This imprisonment in the corral wearies me horribly , and I have never felt so excited as I do now .
0	The roof is very high , the walls of the rooms are covered with gold and silver , and on this gold and silver are paintings of dragons , birds , horses , and other animals , so that nothing can be seen but gilding and pictures .
0	The twelve men who held the balloon by twelve cords fastened to the equatorial circle , let them slip a little between their fingers , and the balloon rose several feet higher .
0	<NAME> soon satisfied their curiosity .
0	The train pursued its course , that evening , without interruption , passing <NAME> , crossing <NAME> , and reaching <NAME> .
0	<NAME> was forced to acknowledge that nothing tangible had hitherto presented itself to his mind .
0	It was also less difficult to ventilate it , by means of canvas funnels which opened without .
0	`` Yes , and it was the last service he desired to render us before his death ! ''
0	We saw the heads , hearts , and lungs of many of the crew upon the sands , and at a little distance dogs were devouring the entrails . ''
0	`` Really , '' said the doctor , `` I believe we have experienced the greatest cold that has ever been observed , since our spirit thermometer indicated one day -72° ; and if I remember aright , the lowest temperatures ever observed before were only -61° at <NAME> , -65° at <NAME> , and -70° at <NAME> . ''
0	The operation , ably directed by <NAME> , was a complete success .
0	It was nine o ’ clock before the festivities came to an end , and by that time the company , heated by the high temperature of the hall , and by their own exertions , felt the want of a little fresh air .
0	“ The same , sir , ” replied the doctor , quietly , “ and his two friends. ” The <NAME> escorted our travellers from the river , while the balloon , half-empty , and borne away by a swift current , sped on , to plunge , like a huge bubble , headlong with the waters of the <NAME> , into the cataracts of <NAME> .
0	Another cry , this time a perfect howl , answered him .
0	Here a fresh locomotive and a Pullman car taking charge of them , they were whirled off to <NAME> , reaching that busy locality at about supper time on the evening of December 16th .
0	It was a matter of debate that night whether the professor should be invited to join the party ; it was scarcely likely that he would care to come , but , on the whole , it was felt to be advisable to ask him .
0	The sole expedient that their united counsel could suggest was to obtain a refuge below ground , and _that_ was denied them by the strange and impenetrable substratum of the soil ; yet hour by hour the sun ’ s disc was lessening in its dimensions , and although at midday some faint radiance and glow were to be distinguished , during the night the painfulness of the cold was becoming almost intolerable .
0	Then , possessed in this hour of peril with superhuman strength , he threw himself behind it , and planting his feet on the ground , by main force placed it out of danger .
0	Some pipes full of opium lay upon the table .
0	The few houses here belong to foreigners .
0	And the effect would have been no less terrible if all the guns of all the artilleries of the world had been joined to the thunders of the sky to give one long continuous roar together .
0	But <NAME> 's charts and the `` Elements of <NAME> '' by <NAME> did not tally as to their situation .
0	The elliptical curve was being rigidly carried out .
0	President <NAME> reached his house , bruised , crushed , and squeezed almost to a mummy .
0	A large bird of great breadth of wing , clearly visible , approached , hovering over us .
0	he cried ; `` wake up , my friends ! ''
0	In these two men <NAME> recognized with astonishment , which everyone will understand , two personages of whom he was not thinking at all , and whom he had never expected to see again .
0	A few strokes of the oar brought the canoe into a little creek , and its passengers leaped on shore .
0	Well , I don ’ t like such jokes , and the joker had better look out for himself , if he falls into my hands , I can tell him. ” As soon as the first gleam of light appeared in the east , the colonists , suitably armed , repaired to the beach under <NAME> .
0	The account of this expedition to a place which has only lately been revisited , would be of great interest ; but unfortunately , so far as we know , his journal has not been published .
0	Indeed , on the morning of the 17th , the “ Bonadventure ” had been forty-eight hours at sea , and nothing showed that she was near the island .
0	At all events , I was able to speak .
0	<NAME> exaggerated the exploits of these pirates , which however presented something of the marvellous .
0	Could it be possible that the secretary of the <NAME> had made a mistake ?
0	<NAME> went up to him and asked if he had lost his way .
0	The wall had fallen headlong and been then shattered to fragments , and a few of the rocks of the large room were piled one above another to form this point .
0	Heads where _x_ ’ s knocked against _x_ ’ s like nuts in a bag , brains which rejoiced in algebraic formulæ , hands which threw about triple integrals as an equilibrist plays with glasses and bottles , intelligences which understood this sort of thing : ∫∫∫Φ ( _xyz_ ) _dx dy dz_ —these were the wise men who appeared worthy of all the admiration of a woman , attracted to them proportionally to their mass and in inverse ratio to the square of their distances .
0	Our party formed quite a procession .
0	Presently , recognizing <NAME> ’ s voice , it dropped the burning match into the water , and , describing a wide circle , flew downwards , alighting at the maiden ’ s feet .
0	“ It is a very delicate instrument , your Excellency .
0	`` This man spoke in a frank voice and with a confident look ; his words could not be doubted .
0	`` He is already sinking out of view too far to the right to be carefully observed . ''
0	Judge if I was astounded !
0	I long , <NAME> , to hear you say , ‘ Come , <NAME> , my eyes can bear daylight , and I want to see the sun !
0	He therefore retired to the monastery of Mar-Hannd , in <NAME> , and devoted himself to the study of <NAME> .
0	In this difficulty he had recourse to <NAME> , who , by virtue of his authority and of the prestige which still clung to him , could appease the tumult , give the Spaniards some respite , and enable them to prepare for their retreat .
0	But these questions are of too much importance to be allowed to remain long unsettled. ” “ No !
0	This was a suspension-bridge thrown over some rapids , about a mile from the place where they now were .
0	As he obtained neither encouragement nor help from the colonial government , he went to <NAME> , where the governor , who did not wish to deprive <NAME> of the credit of being the first to arrive at <NAME> , rejected his proposals .
0	They did not even turn on the gas full head to see what they were eating ; each man stood solidly at his window , the glass of which they had enough to do in keeping free from the rapidly condensing moisture .
0	cried <NAME> , almost broken-hearted at the destruction of the vessel of which he was so proud .
0	Soon the boat was very near the whale .
0	We must not omit to mention a most hazardous attempt made in B.C .
0	`` He believed that <NAME> and his companions must all have perished in the landslip of the hill of Klock-Klock ? ''
0	The night was dark and cold .
0	The <NAME> was about to dismiss his officers and retire to his apartments , when a tumult was heard outside the palace .
0	The spectacle spread out before us was alike grand and terrible .
0	“ Now , there ’ s something that I would never have believed ! ” said he .
0	This lasted for three days ; to the inquiry whether he was well treated , he said “ Yes and no ! ” without further answer ; he was a prisoner , and except that he expected immediate execution , his state seemed to him no better than that in which he had left his unfortunate friends .
0	such important news , and <NAME> had not known it ; and his rival , who had probably learned it from some inhabitant of <NAME> , had already transmitted it to <NAME> .
0	Before daybreak the next morning , the 26th of <NAME> , the horse was drawing the kibitka through the forests of birch trees towards the banks of the <NAME> .
0	Do you see anything abnormal ? ” “ Nothing. ” “ There is , however , one thing which absolutely proves that the language is subject to the laws of number. ” “ And that is ? ” “ That is that you see three _h ’ s_ coming together in two different places. ” What <NAME> said was correct , and it was of a nature to attract attention .
0	<NAME> had followed me for the last ten years wherever science led .
0	`` Not with you , <NAME> , '' was her answer .
0	“ But what is Joe about ? ” said <NAME> ; “ he don ’ t stop ! ” “ He ’ s doing better than that , <NAME> !
0	The lake is of fresh water , rich in fish , and frequented by hippopotami and aquatic birds .
0	Whether or no , I weigh anchor. ” “ We will be punctual. ” This said , <NAME> , the Major , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> left the ship , <NAME> not so much as touching the oilskin that adorned his red locks .
0	<NAME> folded his arms stoically , and said not a word .
0	These wretches , who were as miserable and debased as possible , subsisted upon the raw flesh of seals and penguins .
0	`` This appeared the more probable , '' says the narrative , `` because all the dried vegetables , such as peas , beans , lentils , & c. , together with the rice , and a quantity of biscuits , were spoiled in the store-room .
0	The weather was splendid , the heat being tempered by the refreshing breezes which blew from off the <NAME> , and everything invited them out for an excursion into the country .
0	In a few days the hull of a ship of several hundred tons would disappear entirely in there ! ''
0	On the 18th of February , about three o'clock in the morning , we were at the entrance of the Straits of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> had a great desire to play on it .
0	In the evening they arrived alongside a narrow island , called <NAME> , from the name of the river which here comes in from the north-northwest , and mingles its waters with those of the <NAME> through a mouth about eight hundred yards across , after having watered the territories of the <NAME> and <NAME> .
0	Their military weapons attained colossal proportions , and their projectiles , exceeding the prescribed limits , unfortunately occasionally cut in two some unoffending pedestrians .
0	I must go. ” <NAME> approached <NAME> ; then , having looked at him , -- “ Let us go , then ! ” said he .
0	They did not doubt that if <NAME> had arrived safely at <NAME> , <NAME> would have sent him back immediately .
0	`` Well , I repeat to you , '' replied the burgomaster , tartly , `` that if the people of <NAME> do not profit by this occasion to vindicate their rights , they will be unworthy of their name . ''
0	Many others succumbed , and twelve only returned from the expedition .
0	`` We are no longer , '' he says , `` in the days when navigators in the interests of commerce thought it necessary carefully to conceal their route and their discoveries , to avoid the competition of rival nations .
0	`` Why , do you think -- '' `` Why not ?
0	The engineer , <NAME> , had collected the hundreds of workmen which composed the active and courageous population of the mine .
0	“ But that is no reason why we should despair , ” said <NAME> , “ still less why we should give up our search. ” “ Will it be necessary , ” exclaimed <NAME> , “ to search the river throughout its breadth and its length ? ” “ Throughout its breadth , perhaps , ” answered <NAME> , “ throughout its length , no -- fortunately. ” “ And why ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	My disclosures , unfortunately , can not put you on the track of <NAME> , and you perceive that you have made but a poor bargain by coming to my terms. ” The quartermaster said no more , but crossed his arms in his usual fashion and waited .
0	And the two crouched on the piece of ice , which their weight detached from the floe .
0	They would not start , therefore , until the morning of the 27th .
0	I caught a glimpse of a black mass disappearing in the east , its beacon lights dying out in the distance .
0	cried M'Nicholl stoutly ; `` I deny the existence of anything of the kind , and I denounce every one that maintains any such whim as a visionary , if not a fool ! ''
0	“ And who would it be ?
0	Leaving <NAME> in November , 1820 , <NAME> arrived , on the 5th January in the ensuing year , at <NAME> , and reached <NAME> in the <NAME> country , where are a vast number of ruins of temples , pyramids , and other monuments .
0	This was a mere phantom of my fancy !
0	They paused a moment to enable us to examine the bark , the hammer , and the beam which served them for a table .
0	We know what we have to expect !
0	[ Illustration ] `` They are <NAME> , '' said <NAME> .
0	An elephant that belongs to an Indian who lives but a hundred steps from here . ''
0	They had to tear the strong silk away piece by piece , and then cut it in narrow strips so as to extricate it from the meshes of the network .
0	“ Let us see , however , ” he said , “ if there is not some assemblage of letters which appears to form a word -- I mean a pronounceable word , whose number of consonants is in proportion to its vowels .
0	He read the letter slowly , so as to take in its meaning fully .
0	<NAME> , during the squalls , had taken his place on the platform .
0	<NAME> V. pretended not to recognize him , and asked who this man was .
0	Had the brig been attacked by pirates ?
0	The natives resembled those of <NAME> in every particular , and quickly surrounded the two frigates , offering the multifarious productions of their island .
0	`` I 'll wager another cent that our bold savants calculated the heat of the Sun himself , '' cried <NAME> , with an incredulous laugh .
0	<NAME> , to-day is the 13th Prairal , the first of June , 1868 .
0	At last <NAME> sent forward one of the ship 's boats , under command of <NAME> , to seek the intrepid explorer .
0	Their observations , recorded by <NAME> , were vigorously remade , revised , and re-determined , by the others .
0	then the gentleman is going on terra firma ? ''
0	`` Still , '' resumed <NAME> , `` we are in a more open sea ; we are going along a well-known route ; do n't you exaggerate somewhat , <NAME> ? ''
0	But to get into the office and up to the clerk ’ s little window was a much more difficult business .
0	The colonists were soon obliged to fight at close quarters , not without receiving some wounds , though happily very slight ones .
0	At this moment , the light of the lantern slowly fell , and at last went out !
0	why was <NAME> so much worse ?
0	It was this : the party followed a line of hills not more than fifty feet high , which appeared to run on several miles , and their eastern side was covered with red snow .
0	This town was all in ruins and desolate , for the armies of the barbarians had been there , and <NAME> could not remain in it , but wished to go westward to the frontier of <NAME> .
0	The latter composed a distinct group ; the sealing-master was their spokesman and exercised a baneful influence over them .
0	The sailors went on shore and saw the <NAME> , the Gulf of <NAME> , and reached the <NAME> del Retrete_ or _de los <NAME> , in the <NAME> of <NAME> .
0	A piece of crimson damask excited the most vivid admiration from all the assembled natives .
0	He took up the torn envelope , and examined it .
0	He hoped to meet the N.E .
0	Thus , a pilot in the service of the King of <NAME> , while sailing at 1350 miles ' distance from <NAME> , the south-western point of the <NAME> province of <NAME> , met with a piece of wood ornamented with ancient sculptures , which he considered must have come from a continent not far off .
0	A few moments more , and they had fallen in the forest of <NAME> .
0	You must regain eight hours .
0	From that day <NAME> , for some reason at present incomprehensible , quite altered his behavior to <NAME> , a man for whom he had always hitherto evinced the greatest repugnance and contempt .
0	`` O , you ca n't see them till you get ashore ; they are hidden behind those hillocks you see there ! ''
0	“ He ’ ll be colonel-major or brigadier-general some day. ” <NAME> seemed so enchanted that it would have been useless to express a contrary opinion , either to the profession of arms or the probable future of his children .
0	One island visited may be especially noticed ; it was named the island of _la Gente Hermosa_ on account of the beauty of its inhabitants , and of the fair colour and coquetry of its women , who , as the <NAME> declared , even bore away the palm for grace and attractiveness from their own fellow-countrywomen of <NAME> , whose beauty is proverbial .
0	The present case compelled them to dispense with hunting-dogs , and , no matter what <NAME> ’ s agility might be , he could not be expected to have the scent of a setter or a greyhound .
0	<NAME> , like industry , is transformed and altered .
0	D'Urville now set to work on a very strange task , which , as compared with others of a similar kind , was likely to be of considerable value .
0	I will now add that all our observations , so far made , have only served to confirm me in my opinion .
0	Now the wool furnished by the musmons was composed of very short hairs , and was in a good condition to be felted .
0	When the atmosphere was calm , the low temperature was easily borne , but when the wind blew , the poor settlers , insufficiently clothed , felt it severely .
0	Do not let us enter upon them .
0	They extricated from amongst a large number of shot twenty barrels , the insides of which were lined with copper .
0	“ <NAME> , ” said the sailor , “ you will never abandon <NAME> ? ” “ Never , <NAME> , and especially if you make up your mind to stay there. ” “ That was made up long ago , my boy , ” answered <NAME> .
0	Neither the islet nor <NAME> were visible , and could not be from thence , for the rising ground and the curtain of trees closed the northern horizon .
0	It is something gained even to hear each other . ''
0	His cheques were regularly paid at sight from his account current , which was always flush .
0	<NAME> <NAME> , with folded arms , remained motionless .
0	It did not take more than a few days to perform this work , and indeed as soon as the machine had been commenced , <NAME> left his companions to follow the trade of wiredrawers , and occupied himself with manufacturing his battery .
0	But before then , the stranger , whose presence at this place no one had suspected , crossed <NAME> , which separated the plateau from the forest , and bounded up the opposite bank .
0	Some day the coal-rooms of steamers and the tenders of locomotives will , instead of coal , be stored with these two condensed gases , which will burn in the furnaces with enormous calorific power .
0	he was compelled , therefore , to give up the idea , and let his new friend run the chances of a public conference .
0	August 18th , <NAME> was sighted through the mist , and the next day the <NAME> cast anchor in <NAME> Bay .
0	<NAME> threatened these exhausted men .
0	The apple , peach , apricot , cherry , and pear-trees , which have thriven well , have already supplied the colony with valuable shoots .
0	Nevertheless he seemed to have decided upon one , for that evening he sent for the engineer , and said to him , `` Feed all the fires until the coal is exhausted . ''
0	You are not a myth ?
0	The rain and the heavy spray raised by the storm , and the coming on of night , made it necessary to put the <NAME> under a close-reefed topsail and jib , under which pressure of sail she behaved splendidly .
0	That evening the hunters returned to <NAME> quite exhausted .
0	<NAME> calculated the quantity of spirits of wine overflowed into the little vial soldered to the lower part of the instrument , and said : `` A hundred and forty degrees <NAME> [ 4 ] below zero ! ''
0	It was only after a long search that <NAME> discovered a native dealer in old clothes , to whom he applied for an exchange .
0	The water was shallow everywhere , and the breakers were heavy .
0	The settlers went to the <NAME> to take some pickaxes , iron-tipped spears , string made of fibers , flint and steel ; they then returned to the plateau , Top accompanying them .
0	`` Can you believe that you will ever die ? ''
0	This kiss made the lieutenant chief of the council , and placed him temporarily above the khodja .
0	It was almost too much happiness to be true .
0	Hence he resolved not to let the two adversaries discuss the subject ; but he did not always succeed .
0	<NAME> J. T. <NAME> given this unexpected news to the world ?
0	`` I dare say , '' replied <NAME> ; `` but if the earth had been _full_ , the moon would have been _new_ ; that is to say , invisible , because of the rays of the sun .
0	The maneuver would have been a difficult job for five men if the <NAME> had not carried a double yard , on the <NAME> plan .
0	long. , I found a small island , recognised in 1801 by <NAME> , and marked in the ancient <NAME> maps as <NAME> de la <NAME> , the meaning of which is The <NAME> .
0	`` Neither quicker nor slower , dear friends , '' interposed <NAME> , desirous to stop a quarrel ; `` we are floating , you know , in an absolute void , where specific gravity never counts . ''
0	`` The convicts discovered her in her little harbour only eight days ago , they put to sea in her , and -- '' `` And ? ''
0	From <NAME> proceeded to <NAME> in <NAME> , a place not visited by any <NAME> vessel since the time of <NAME> , arriving on the 27th December , 1827 .
0	Fifty years had now elapsed since the discovery of most of the islands of <NAME> , and everywhere changes had taken place as sudden as those in the <NAME> .
0	During the night , or rather what ought to have been the night of the 19th-20th , my sleep was disturbed by a strange dream .
0	In spite of the cold , he had not been seen since the day of his arrival from <NAME> .
0	The force of the wind carried the doctor farther onward than he wanted to go ; but it changed a second time , and bore him back exactly to his starting-point , on the sort of enclosed island where he had passed the preceding night .
0	At last , impatient of further restraint , he burst out : `` Who the deuce cares for her secrets ?
0	After some minutes , our fall was stopped .
0	Supposing <NAME> makes a mistake when he puts <NAME> ’ s theory in practice ?
0	`` Where can they have gone to ? ''
0	There will be dancing and singing. ” “ Thank you , <NAME> , but it ’ s impossible. ” “ Impossible ? ” “ Yes ; <NAME> ’ s visit will last some time , and I must take him back to Callander. ” “ Well , <NAME> , it won ’ t be for a week yet .
0	In fact , it was to the end of the world that he wanted to go .
0	In the meanwhile <NAME> was ordered to mount guard below the windows of <NAME> , and when <NAME> received an order he obeyed it without any questioning .
0	His faith in the engineer was complete ; nothing could disturb it .
0	`` Let me come back to the question of the boat , '' said I , `` for the last time .
0	So they struggled on all day , braving death at every instant , and making no progress northward , but also losing no ground ; they were wet through by the rain and waves ; above the din of the storm they could hear the hoarse cries of the birds .
0	It was Schroeter who in 1789 first drew attention to them .
0	He appeared anxious , timorous , ashamed , and his eyes were constantly fixed on the ground .
0	It is asserted that these natives are cannibals ; but if that is true -- and it is said of many of the riverine tribes -- there must have been more evidence for the cannibalism than we get to-day .
0	But his farewells were calmly spoken , and he speedily disappeared down a path which skirted the wood .
0	The <NAME> was just about to get under way , and already the vibration of the screw began to agitate the limpid waters of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , stood armed with carbines and <NAME> ’ s revolvers .
0	It was his own fancy to follow the trade of ‘ monk , ’ which few would have liked .
0	If ever complete isolation was to be found on earth , it was on this little out-of-the-way island .
0	They remind one of the confusion in the islands of the <NAME> , where the land is excessively indented .
0	Is it you ! ” he said ; “ my father ! ” <NAME> could not reply .
0	The rainy season had commenced , and it would soon be impossible to travel otherwise than by boat .
0	Armed with javelins , they uttered shrill cries , and showed dispositions far from peaceful .
0	It is one of those errors which some admire , others blame ; which God alone can judge .
0	But while doing so , the friends were astonished to find that the birds , though good sized creatures , and now pretty fat and plump , hardly felt heavier in their hands than if they had been so many sparrows .
0	`` It is the floating light of <NAME> , '' he continued .
0	But my ear deceived me , for I found that I was not a hundred yards from the instrument .
0	During the ten days that <NAME> and his companions were passing through this part of the country they were very badly treated , and had it not been for their own store of biscuits , they must have died of starvation .
0	I announced our names and rank , introducing in person Professor Aronnax , his servant Conseil , and master <NAME> , the harpooner .
0	His map shows you a <NAME> the midst of an _Arabia_ , an _Ætna_ in the centre of a _Sicily_ , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , a _Mediterranean_ , a <NAME> , a <NAME> , and a <NAME> .
0	The objects lying around had no weight .
0	At this moment I heard an accustomed and well-known sound running along the floors of the granite rock -- a kind of dull and sullen roar , like that of a distant waterfall .
0	“ Nothing can be more simple , ” answered the judge .
0	How can anyone , moreover , help obeying , unhesitatingly , orders which emanate from a monarch who has the right to employ this formula at the head of his ukase : “ We , by the grace of <NAME> , <NAME> and Autocrat of all the <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , <NAME> of <NAME> and <NAME> , <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> of the <NAME> , <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and of <NAME> , of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and many other countries ; <NAME> and <NAME> of the territory of Nijni-Novgorod , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and of <NAME> , Governor of the <NAME> , <NAME> of the countries of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> of the <NAME> princes , of those of the mountains , and of others ; heir of <NAME> , <NAME> of Schleswig-Holstein , <NAME> , <NAME> , and Oldenburg. ” A powerful lord , in truth , is he whose arms are an eagle with two heads , holding a scepter and a globe , surrounded by the escutcheons of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and of <NAME> , and environed by the collar of the order of <NAME> , surmounted by a royal crown !
0	In this document there are one hundred and thirty-two letters , giving seventy-nine consonants to fifty-three vowels .
0	Thus everything had become calm again ; the old existence had been resumed by men and beasts , beasts and plants ; even by the tower of <NAME> gate , which the explosion -- these explosions are sometimes astonishing -- had set upright again !
0	Not a bit of it .
0	[ Illustration : `` The <NAME> in <NAME> Channel . '' ]
0	But with this miserable cabin they were obliged to be content .
0	At the same time as the coal , the store of wood was renewed at <NAME> , and they profited by the current of the <NAME> having again become free , to float down several rafts .
0	<NAME> vines abounded and climbed over the trees in long festoons as they do in <NAME> .
0	Just see them swimming between two waves , quietly , making no jumps .
0	A magnificent plain , thickly covered with chrysanthemums , stretched out beyond the lake , and <NAME> and his friends would gladly have explored its beauties when they awoke next morning , but they had to start .
0	The serpent , who fled from them with great swiftness , carried his head out of the water , and one of them attempted to seize his tail .
0	A few days later , the three friends proceeded in a small boat to examine the natural pillars on which had rested the solid earth forming the basin of <NAME> .
0	At last the hour of sleeping came .
0	[ Illustration : The sea was so encumbered with whales . ]
0	<NAME> could neither sit , stand nor lie still for a second , though he tried all three .
0	“ <NAME> is all right , <NAME> -- so much so , in fact , that I hope in a month or six weeks -- ” “ To marry her , <NAME> ? ” “ Jack , you don ’ t know what you are talking about ! ” “ Ah , that ’ s very likely ; but I know quite well what I shall do. ” “ What will you do ? ” “ <NAME> her myself , if you don ’ t ; so look sharp , ” laughed <NAME> .
0	`` Then , '' added <NAME> , `` we can clear the plateau , and transplant wild plants to it . ''
0	Consequently , the level of the lake would be greatly lowered , and the opening where the water escaped would be exposed , which was their final aim .
0	This was sugar of rather a reddish color , but nearly transparent and of a delicious taste .
0	It was a hazardous method , for , if their imprisonment lasted long , the spirit , of which they had but little , would be wanting when needed to prepare the meals .
0	But I could not act otherwise .
0	`` I should like to know how people set about it , '' observed <NAME> incredulously .
0	“ In fact , <NAME> , ” he said in conclusion , “ I am here to inquire whether you and your friends would be disposed to join us in our present quarters. ” “ I am obliged to you , <NAME> , ” answered the major stiffly ; “ but we have not the slightest intention of abandoning our post .
0	Between them were canals , iguarapes , lagoons , temporary lakes , an inextricable network which renders the hydrography of this country so difficult .
0	This same year , King Emmanuel wishing to organize a regular government in the <NAME> , had made <NAME> da Cunha his viceroy , but <NAME> having become temporarily blind was obliged to resign his power before he had exercised it .
0	`` How can you doubt it , <NAME> ?
0	It furnished the ships touching there , now a merchantman , now a pirate , with horses and with wild pigs , the flesh of which had a well-known reputation for delicacy of flavour .
0	A brig and three or four schooners might have lain there with perfect ease .
0	“ Indeed , ” remarked <NAME> , “ Wassili Fedor is a man of worth and courage .
0	And <NAME> read what the powder had left visible : “ I will deliver him , for he hath trusted in me. ” “ My friends , ” said <NAME> , “ we must carry these words of hope to our dear , brave ladies .
0	It was further observed that <NAME> itself was almost void of scintillation .
0	“ But isn ’ t there another thing to be done ? ” said <NAME> .
0	While J. T. <NAME> was speaking , <NAME> , without interrupting him , had hastily put on his clothes ; and , in less than two minutes , the two friends were making for the suburbs of <NAME> with rapid strides .
0	The voyagers directed all their energies to this urgent work .
0	He neither thought of eating nor drinking .
0	Their offer was accepted , and they embarked on a government vessel for <NAME> , where they arrived on the 19th March , 1830 .
0	But , wherever the chest might have come from , it was a treasure to the settlers on <NAME> .
0	The <NAME> entered <NAME> roadstead upon the 23rd of March , and three days later the vast collection of natural curiosities was landed .
0	`` And <NAME> , the president , '' howled <NAME> .
0	So I returned to my cabin , where I threw myself on my bunk in my clothes .
0	This attention paid , the travelers watched the earth and the moon attentively .
0	The Muras are remarkably clever at sending through their blow-tubes arrows which cause incurable wounds , even at a range of three hundred paces .
0	`` <NAME> , <NAME> , you have an answer for everything , '' was my only reply .
0	He discovered successively the <NAME> , and <NAME> and <NAME> , the last of the group .
0	You wear better than I do , my old friend ! ” “ And , sir , you shall be our viewer again .
0	It was impossible for <NAME> and <NAME> , with these impediments , to make rapid progress .
0	The <NAME> was at the end of <NAME> .
0	Next day the ceremony was to be continued by a holocaust of pigs .
0	It is too bad that millions of horse-power should lie under our feet unavailable for our needs .
0	Once in a while , the reflection of a wandering ray of light in the dull water disclosed a succession of ditches regularly arranged , and , by one last gleam , the eye could make out the calm and sombre forms of palm-trees , sycamores , and gigantic euphorbiae .
0	They know the good spots . ''
0	The responsibility for the general safety is mine , and I will not yield any of it to anyone .
0	<NAME> <NAME> had not been forgotten , and he occupied a room at the back , near the storeroom , a sort of cabin with a cot always full of good litter , which perfectly suited his taste .
0	It was so much taken from the enemy .
0	But as in that place the channel was not more than twenty feet in depth , it was certain that the sides of the submerged brig would reappear at low water .
0	However , one day her heart overflowed , and she told all the events which had occurred from her departure from <NAME> to the death of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> degrees multiplied by five hours give seventy-five degrees .
0	That was ten years ago .
0	<NAME> was created rear-admiral shortly after his return , and received important commands .
0	Two days subsequent to the governor 's banquet , the officers found themselves at a dinner-party of fifty guests , where no less than forty-four separate dishes were served at each of the three courses of which the dinner consisted .
0	In 1822 , <NAME> Laing explored all the western part of <NAME> near to the <NAME> possessions ; and he it was who got so far as the sources of the <NAME> ; and , according to his documents , the spring in which that immense river takes its rise is not two feet broad .
0	What can I do better than follow the method of that great analytical genius , <NAME> ? ” Judge Jarriquez herein alluded to a story by the great <NAME> romancer , which is a masterpiece .
0	After all , it is worth more than a logogryph or a rebus ! ” At these words <NAME> rose , shook hands with the magistrate , and returned to the jangada , feeling more hopeless when he went back than when he set out .
0	I am convinced that under your charge it will furnish us with a great deal of amusement , and will serve to lighten materially the gloom of our hundred days of darkness .
0	A clever sailor , <NAME> , of whom <NAME> says , `` that never did any one better understand the seafaring profession , that his courage was equal to any emergency , and that his application was indefatigable , '' concluded an agreement with a company of merchants to search for the passage by the north-west .
0	It did not take <NAME> long to find out that the <NAME> was a bad sailer , and that he might anticipate much trouble during his voyage .
0	“ The savage wretches ! ” exclaimed <NAME> , trembling with indignation .
0	But though at least a hundred telescopes scanned the calm ocean breast for many miles in all directions , it was nowhere to be seen .
0	<NAME> <NAME> would not lose a single point of view , nor a single detail of the straits .
0	Neither rain nor any river , increased by a sudden swelling , could supply these ponds .
0	All approached , and saw to their extreme surprise , a boat floating down the current .
0	Then he put on the shirts of artists , and warriors , and merchants ; but these were no better .
0	We were nearly six hundred yards above the city ; but nothing betrayed the horizontal displacement of the balloon , for the mass of air in which it is enclosed goes forward with it .
0	However conscientiously the assistant on the <NAME> coast might look to the kindling of the beacon , <NAME> had no glances to spare for that direction ; he had no eyes except for the one object of his notice , no thoughts apart from that one quarter of the firmament .
0	Nor is it a piece of a shattered planet ! ''
0	<NAME> , his eyes fixed on the ground , still looked for his box .
0	The colonists of <NAME> , too had explored <NAME> , but so little disposition was there at this time to believe in the existence of a new world , that <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> were all thought to be a continuation of the <NAME> continent .
0	It received the name of <NAME> , in honour of <NAME> , <NAME> of the <NAME> .
0	The hunters had scarcely entered the bushes when they saw <NAME> engaged in a struggle with an animal which he was holding by the ear .
0	There , on a half-cracked hill of clay , stand a dozen houses , covered with the leaves of the _ “ boiassu ” _ palm placed round a central space .
0	Its powers of adjustability seemed to fail before the strange and bewildering scene .
0	The instruments suspended under the awning clattered together as though they would be dashed to pieces ; the pipes of the spiral bent to and fro , threatening to break at every instant ; and the water-tanks jostled and jarred with tremendous din .
0	All these questions , which would no doubt be answered the next day , kept them in suspense , and at the dawn of day they all fixed their gaze on the western horizon .
0	They then ascended to <NAME> , when they were always ready to go to bed .
0	For the first year and a half of his existence he had been the foster-child of the sturdy wife of a vine-dresser of <NAME> -- a lineal descendant of the heroes of ancient prowess ; in a word , he was one of those individuals whom nature seems to have predestined for remarkable things , and around whose cradle have hovered the fairy godmothers of adventure and good luck .
0	A false step would have been dangerous on the narrow passes sloping down to the sides of the gulfs ; but I walked with firm step , without feeling any giddiness .
0	`` Real polar stomachs , '' answered the doctor ; `` prodigious stomachs which can be dilated at will , and , I ought to add , can be contracted in the same way , so that they support starving as well as gorging .
0	They had no means of quitting the reef ; no fire , nor any means of obtaining it .
0	The opening into this shaft or well was twelve feet wide .
0	Our feet crushed with a dry and crackling sound the remains of those prehistoric fossils , for which the museums of great cities quarrel , even when they obtain only rare and curious morsels .
0	<NAME> , always enthusiastic in his projects , already spoke of constructing a battery to command the channel and the mouth of the river .
0	Besides , this was , in a way , the betrothal dinner of <NAME> and the charming <NAME> -- that of <NAME> and <NAME> had taken place at the fazenda of <NAME> several weeks before .
0	It is not known how or why a communication had been established between the reservoir which contained the oxygen and that which enclosed the hydrogen .
0	It must in all truth be confessed , things as yet had gone on well , and I should have acted in bad taste to have complained .
0	Suddenly she heard , in the shade , a voice murmur in her ears , -- `` <NAME> , dear <NAME> !
0	While such were the thoughts of those occupying the first carriage , what was happening in the second ?
0	<NAME> <NAME> took the document and carefully examined it .
0	<NAME> , the reporter , <NAME> , and <NAME> , embarked in turn .
0	<NAME> away by the waves three times in his efforts to re-embark , he was finally swallowed up without the possibility of assistance being rendered to him , or even the fact of his death being ascertained -- so violent were the waves , and so dark the night ! ''
0	How long I remained buried in this drowsiness I can not judge , but , when I woke , the sun seemed sinking towards the horizon .
0	Perhaps the balloon will rise .
0	They made a halt at seven o'clock , the young woman being still in a state of complete prostration .
0	There , on the 8th December , 1741 , this brave man and skilful explorer perished miserably .
0	Towards seven o ’ clock in the morning , the “ Bonadventure , ” weathering the <NAME> , entered the strait and glided on to the waters , so strangely enclosed in the frame of lava .
0	[ Illustration : `` Travelling at a slow pace . '' ]
0	It was a charming house , built of wood and brick , hidden in groves of emerophilis .
0	There they were before me , but how unreal .
0	`` We can not tell whom we shall have to deal with , '' said <NAME> .
0	On our return to the coast the boatswain discovered several caverns in the granitic cliffs , sufficiently spacious to house us all and afford storage for the cargo of the <NAME> .
0	“ And as the price of that important cession , ” continued <NAME> , “ they have received a fair equivalent in <NAME> gold. ” “ Ah ! ” cried <NAME> , “ that accounts for that fellow Negrete and his people having such a lot of money. ” <NAME> was silent .
0	We there found M. N -- -- and his party , safe and sound .
0	Had their lives been the forfeit of this first attempt at colonization ?
0	I could understand , when looking through a lens at an object , why we get only its reversed image -- a simple law of optics explains _that_ .
0	This town was a little north of <NAME> .
0	He stumbled and fell , accidentally catching hold of a rope with both hands in his fall .
0	This young man , about nine and twenty years of age , almost a giant in stature , but well proportioned , surprised Freycinet by the extent of his information .
0	But in 1514 <NAME> had asked the king to bestow upon him as a reward for his services the title of <NAME> of <NAME> , and it was this imprudent step which gave an advantage to his adversaries .
0	For this retreat <NAME> was preparing in secret .
0	The fit lasted five hours .
0	“ The captain is too good an observer to be mistaken , and , if it has not moved from its place , the island is just where he put it. ” “ We shall see. ” On the next day , therefore , by means of the sextant , the engineer made the necessary observations to verify the position which he had already obtained , and this was the result of his operation .
0	Evidently the Gulf of <NAME> would be emptied to form a huge territory of the <NAME> , which the Mexicans and <NAME> might claim in accordance with the <NAME> doctrine .
0	`` But , my dear president , '' said the major , `` is not the cost price of aluminum extremely high ? ''
0	The <NAME> understood me , and signed me to follow him .
0	`` What can I say , my man ? ''
0	It was , however , not the only source of revenue ; and <NAME> calculated , that deducting the maintenance of troops , the pay of the civil officers , and all the expenses of the administration , the King of <NAME> drew no less than ten million francs from the <NAME> .
0	The next day passed without any appearance of preparation for their punishment ; and this was the reason of the delay .
0	The chief question now was , whether this was merely a vein which would yield comparatively little , or a bed occupying a large extent .
0	<NAME> alone , the chief of the expedition , was mortally wounded ; he was buried by his companions on a promontory , to which they gave the name of the promontory of the <NAME> .
0	A portion of <NAME> , which stretches to the north of that country , was the first to be recognized .
0	`` Even so , '' replied the engineer , `` you will risk depriving the colony of <NAME> of two settlers out of five . ''
0	I saw a fathomless , a bottomless abyss , which yawned beneath the turgid waves .
0	At first , accustomed to the open air , to the unrestrained liberty which he had enjoyed on <NAME> , the stranger manifested a sullen fury , and it was feared that he might throw himself onto the beach , out of one of the windows of <NAME> .
0	Before the conquerors of the <NAME> the <NAME> <NAME> have been wiped out .
0	And in this condition of mind , over-excited by the succession of wonders continually passing before my eyes , I should not have been surprised to meet at the bottom of the sea one of those submarine towns of which <NAME> dreamed .
0	`` I mean , '' said <NAME> in a decided tone , `` I mean that our deviation is owing solely to our meeting with this erring body . ''
0	`` No doubt , '' replied <NAME> ; `` I expected it . ''
0	Surely he is mistaken , '' I cried in a tone of wonder .
0	`` Captain , '' answered the carpenter , `` it is true we have no family awaiting us in <NAME> , but our country is our country : do n't you think of going back ? ''
0	They did not meet again until both reached Noukha-Hiva .
0	His reason for coming to this conclusion was that the caloric emitted by the rising vapors of the hot lava seemed to be oozing , as it were , out of the tellurium , which had been demonstrated already to be a conductor of heat .
0	Their address in the use of arms and their bearing supported this idea , but it was impossible to know with any certainty .
0	It may be so ; but nothing can be less certain .
0	<NAME> <NAME> and his companions rushed to one of the windows -- The brig , irresistibly raised on a sort of water-spout , had just split in two , and in less than ten seconds she was swallowed up with all her criminal crew !
0	<NAME> gave a full account of this catastrophe to the demoralized sailors .
0	On the 12th of December Carteret sorrowfully perceived that the western monsoon had commenced .
0	“ I ’ ve a notion ! ” exclaimed <NAME> , “ that this vessel will be difficult to get afloat again. ” “ It will be impossible , ” said <NAME> .
0	He held his instruments in his hands , having evidently been calculating the exact height of the mountain .
0	<NAME> ( translation from <NAME> )
0	`` Very well , '' said the captain .
0	“ This little isle is just a paradise ! ” “ Yes , ” replied <NAME> , “ a paradise to these poor , shipwrecked fellows that <NAME> had pity on , but I am sorry that <NAME> was not an extensive and fertile island , with a river instead of a stream , and a port instead of a tiny bay exposed to the open sea. ” “ And why , captain ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	“ The polar-star there , that does its work honorably in pointing out the direction due north to everybody else , will , most likely , do me that service. ” He discovered , with satisfaction , that the current was taking him toward the northern shore of the lake , and he allowed himself to glide with it .
0	`` A crater , '' he said , `` you hear ? ''
0	They also heard the noise of a waterfall , which showed that a few hundred feet up the river there was a natural barrier .
0	`` It awoke in me , '' says <NAME> , in a narrative preserved by <NAME> , `` a great desire and a kind of ardour in my heart to do myself also something famous , and knowing by examining the globe , that if I sailed by the west wind I should reach <NAME> more rapidly , I at once made my project known to His Majesty , who was much satisfied with it . ''
0	The tempest of snow continued till the next day .
0	Even <NAME> would have surprised him by an exhibition of such stoicism .
0	In other words , while <NAME> , going eastward , saw the sun pass the meridian eighty times , his friends in <NAME> only saw it pass the meridian seventy-nine times .
0	Naturally , at the short distance of four or five paces , every shot killed an <NAME> ; but there was no time to re-load .
0	The fur company established at <NAME> at the mouth of the <NAME> also did much towards the exploration of the <NAME> .
0	Let us hold ourselves ready .
0	A gesture of his might destroy me , a single word chain me on board .
0	As soon as he had collected the needful troops , he marched towards <NAME> .
0	He looked like a man equally prepared to enjoy superfluity or total want .
0	Now the first principle of training is to get rid of the fat on both horse and jockey , and this is done by means of purging , sweating , and violent exercise .
0	At last , after three long and weary hours of navigation , that is to say , about six o'clock in the evening , we found a place at which we could land .
0	Has he ever understood that my gratitude to him is overflowing ?
0	To satisfy his companions , <NAME> began to uncover the window at the bottom of the projectile , which would allow them to observe the earth direct .
0	`` I thoroughly allow that the celebrated <NAME> wrote the lines , but only , I believe , as a kind of mystification , '' was my answer .
0	`` Look sharp also after our recruits , '' added the captain .
0	“ What ’ s the matter ? ” he cried , rousing himself , and collecting his ideas with the promptitude usual to seamen .
0	At half-past ten everybody was on board , even <NAME> and <NAME> , and <NAME> weighed the anchor , which was fast in the sand near the mouth of the <NAME> .
0	<NAME> was swept off by a wave , and thrown among the breakers , where he lost consciousness .
0	Not satisfied , however , with what he looked upon as too perfunctory an estimate , he measured , with all possible mathematical accuracy , the <NAME> or <NAME> , and ascertained its height to be no less than 27,500 feet .
0	Was he engaged in a struggle with some animal whose retreat he had disturbed ?
0	the doctor said to him .
0	<NAME> went back to <NAME> , who stood beside <NAME> , with his arms crossed , looking quietly at the troubled waves .
0	I can understand that an Englishman should give up his life and his fortune for the honor of his country .
0	They then proceeded together towards the little stream .
0	And what turns and twiggles there were in his π ’ s , his λ ’ s , his ω ’ s !
0	“ Let us get across first , and we shall soon find out the road to <NAME> on the other side of the river. ” “ To work , then , ” said <NAME> , beginning to empty the bottles .
0	<NAME> , always enthusiastic in his projects , already spoke of constructing a battery to command the channel and the mouth of the river .
0	“ We are right in the open desert , ” said the doctor .
0	`` Notwithstanding that the summit of one pole is only sixty miles away from us now . ''
0	The difference between the image and the reality could scarcely be described .
0	`` We have to think so , Dr. Clawbonny , because <NAME> is just ; but I have often visited these coasts , and I am always saddened at the sight of its gloomy loneliness ; the capes , promontories , and bays ought to have more attractive names , for <NAME> and <NAME> Desolation are not of a sort to cheer sailors . ''
0	From this point to <NAME> the beach was very narrow between the edge of the forest and the reefs .
0	He dived and went up successively .
0	They are much prone to drink to excess ; they are very proud and disdainful to strangers , and have no respect for the lives of human beings . ''
0	`` Well , young or old , '' added <NAME> , `` he 's a good capture . ''
0	The storm exasperated him , the gale made him furious , and he longed to lash the obstinate sea into obedience .
0	<NAME> 's desire to find land at the <NAME> is perfectly comprehensible .
0	Besides , he went so far as to chat agreeably with them .
0	After receiving a visit from the queen-mother , <NAME> was invited to a _soirée_ given in his honour in the palace at <NAME> .
0	They were in unknown regions of the mine ; narrow passages crossed each other like the windings of a labyrinth .
0	<NAME> Raleigh believe really in the existence of this city of gold , for the conquest of which he was about to sacrifice so many lives ?
0	The captain-general being one of the latter nation , had never , according to them , tendered a whole-hearted allegiance to the <NAME> flag .
0	Up to this date the position of the island of <NAME> , was differently given on nearly all maps , and <NAME> , who intended to harbour there , take in water , and get a little fresh meat , came upon it almost unawares .
0	The <NAME> carries provisions for five or six years , and coal in proportion .
0	The blood flowed from his shoulder under his torn shirt , but he took no notice of it .
0	Here round _ “ tucumas , ” _ or ficuses , capriciously twisted like centenarian olive-trees , and of which <NAME> had fifty-four varieties ; here round the kinds of euphorbias , which produce caoutchouc , _ “ gualtes , ” _ noble palm-trees , with slender , graceful , and glossy stems ; and cacao-trees , which shoot up of their own accord on the banks of the <NAME> and its tributaries , having different melastomas , some with red flowers and others ornamented with panicles of whitish berries .
0	Perhaps in his heart <NAME> , in whom the journalist sometimes came to the surface , was not sorry to have the opportunity of sending forth to take its chance an exciting article relating the adventures of the settlers in <NAME> .
0	Although the <NAME> explored but a part of the <NAME> group , the information they collected was extremely interesting on account of its novelty .
0	The whole party began to make almost daily visits to the Hive , and frequently proceeded to the shore , where they resumed their skating exercise , rejoicing in their recovered freedom like prisoners liberated from a dungeon .
0	His companions uttered a shout .
0	The Indians have everything to gain by these intestine strifes , and can not lose such fine opportunities of plunder .
0	His travelling overcoat was divided into two unequal parts , and his trousers resembled those of certain Indians , which fit less compactly than they are easy to put on .
0	`` Well , we 'll talk about it to-morrow ; I have n't time now . ''
0	Two years and a half were spent in this manner .
0	Taking advantage of a change of wind the <NAME> sailed on to the <NAME> of <NAME> , and <NAME> was about to send an officer in advance to take soundings , when a canoe put off from the shore , having on board the governor of the island , <NAME> , otherwise <NAME> , [ 3 ] who promised the captain that he would find boats suitable for the taking of the necessary supplies to the corvette .
0	the country is already changing its aspect : the villages are fewer and farther between ; the mango-trees have disappeared , for their growth ceases at this latitude .
0	<NAME> creatures who had left the terrestrial sphere , and returned after this strange voyage into celestial space , could not fail to be received as the prophet <NAME> would be if he came back to earth .
0	The <NAME> , upon which <NAME> 's fleet sailed , scarcely answered to the idea such a reminiscence inspires .
0	Were it not at one of the extremities of the world , it should be visited by every one . ''
0	Several times ten or twelve united tried to crush the Nautilus by their weight .
0	<NAME> <NAME> paid him sincere compliments on his mythological visitants , and so did the Major , though he could not forbear adding : “ But mind no fits of absence of mind , my dear <NAME> ; and if you take a fancy to learn <NAME> , don ’ t go and study it in a <NAME> grammar. ” Things went on perfectly smoothly on board .
0	What enjoyment it would be to feel oneself thus suspended in ether , more favored than the birds who must use their wings to keep themselves up ! ''
0	Too impatient to await the awakening of the astronomer and to hear what representations he had to make , <NAME> , the count , and the lieutenant , constituting themselves what might be designated “ the <NAME> ” of the colony , spent the whole of the remainder of the day in starting and discussing the wildest conjectures about their situation .
0	The two young men , and <NAME> and <NAME> , thinking no more of danger , rushed out of the house , guns in hand .
0	Matters remained thus until the third week of February .
0	`` Is there really no way of warning him ? ''
0	`` In fact , we are very much better off than those who skate on the <NAME> , and who are in constant dread of falling through ; we have no such fear . ''
0	<NAME> <NAME> 's indifference did not content <NAME> .
0	Were not these facts providential ?
0	It only remained now to find a guide , which was comparatively easy .
0	As soon as <NAME> , who went before me , could comprehend what was passing , he stopped , and after exchanging ' some words in _patois_ with his comrades , declared that we must detach ourselves from M. N -- -- 's party .
0	To work , <NAME> , to work , and let us not lose an hour ! ” During eight days more , that is to say until the 7th of February , the lava continued to flow , but the eruption was confined within the previous limits .
0	Then he went to <NAME> , where the tombs of <NAME> and Esther are found , and by Dabrestan he reached <NAME> , the capital of the kingdom , a city measuring twelve miles in circumference .
0	<NAME> did not beg off , and recommenced our story .
0	During several hours the <NAME> floated in these brilliant waves , and our admiration increased as we watched the marine monsters disporting themselves like salamanders .
0	He was a mining engineer of about five and thirty years of age .
0	This road , after running right down to the coast took a sudden bend in the direction of <NAME> .
0	`` It is <NAME> of <NAME> , surnamed <NAME> .
0	I am compelled to hold onto the mast , which bends like a reed beneath the violence of the storm , to which none ever before seen by mariners bore any resemblance .
0	He chose a clear place on the shore , which the ebbing tide had left perfectly level .
0	This was not his first tiger , and advancing to within ten feet of the animal he remained motionless , his gun to his shoulder , without moving a muscle .
0	It proved to be a fragment of dis-colored marble , on which several letters were inscribed , of which the only part at all decipherable was the syllable “ Vil. ” “ Vil -- <NAME> ! ” he cried out , in his excitement dropping the marble , which was broken into atoms by the fall .
0	<NAME> , master , at length gave the order to start , and the <NAME> , taking the wind under her brigantine , foresail , and standing-jib , bounded briskly forward over the waves .
0	“ We must bide our time and hear , ” replied the count .
0	* * * * * And that very evening , an hour or two only before the discharge was to take place , and while <NAME> and <NAME> were thus congratulating themselves , <NAME> , shut up in his room at <NAME> , jumped to his feet and whooped like a Redskin .
0	Then , with <NAME> 's assistance , he built a resting-place in an iceberg .
0	political exiles returning from <NAME> , from <NAME> , from <NAME> !
0	At last , these words escaped his lips : `` Boiling water ! ''
0	The way in which he got admission to this exclusive club was simple enough .
0	On this account the operation was enveloped in a mystery that the cleverest detectives of <NAME> and <NAME> failed to penetrate , and if it was discovered at last it was because the <NAME> had relaxed his severity after the completion of the works , and that there are traitors or chatterers even among negroes .
0	This seemed very odd ; he made another examination , and at last he looked at the glass , -- the object-glass was missing .
0	Every one felt more and more puzzled , and even excited , for with the turn of the tide the <NAME> was to set sail for its unknown destination .
0	I shuddered as I evolved from my mind the idea and recollection of these awful monsters .
0	“ And where ’ s the fire ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	We disembarked at our yesterday 's landing-place , and <NAME> again led the way towards the hill of Klock-Klock .
0	“ <NAME> ! ” he exclaimed , “ the lunatic !
0	In the centre stood an immense table , covered with pamphlets , amongst which were some newspapers , already of old date .
0	“ And , naturally , you made it ‘ radiant , ’ in the columns of the <NAME> Telegraph. ” “ Exactly. ” “ Do you remember , <NAME> , what occurred at <NAME> in 1812 ? ” “ I remember it as well as if I had been there , sir , ” replied the <NAME> correspondent .
0	164 `` The natives had sufficient confidence '' .
0	<NAME> made his companions observe that the height of this mountain above the surrounding plain was far from equaling the depth of its crater .
0	From that moment their companions were never to see them more .
0	In the meantime , <NAME> de <NAME> , sent by the King and Queen of <NAME> to compliment <NAME> in their names , arrived at <NAME> with four vessels .
0	<NAME> had been warned by the Tlascalans that he must place no trust in the protestations of friendship and devotion made by the Cholulans .
0	Though there was sufficient depth of water to allow a light craft to pass the bar , there was not enough for the <NAME> , whose draught of water was considerable .
0	The coquetry which is innate in the female mind , induces them to add to their natural charms by the use of a labial ornament , as ugly as it is inconvenient , of which we have already spoken in our account of <NAME> 's stay in these waters .
0	Too many eyes were watching on board -- especially those of <NAME> , whose gaze never quitted the horizon of that southern zone for an instant .
0	“ But where was the last place he was in ? ” “ With the <NAME> Calfoucoura. ” “ In the line we have been following ? ” “ Yes. ” “ And who is this Cacique ? ” “ The chief of the <NAME> , a man with two tongues and two hearts. ” “ That ’ s to say false in speech and false in action , ” said <NAME> , after he had translated this beautiful figure of the <NAME> language .
0	Two powerful locomotives , carrying nine cars of invited guests , amongst whom was <NAME> , vice-president of the road , stopped at this point ; cheers were given , the <NAME> and <NAME> performed an imitation <NAME> battle , fireworks were let off , and the first number of the <NAME> was printed by a press brought on the train .
0	They galloped off in the direction of the <NAME> , and were not long in discovering that the diminution in the pressure of the atmosphere had precisely the same effect upon their horses as it had had upon themselves .
0	It was then the favourable season for attempting explorations in the <NAME> .
0	As he uttered these words , I felt myself seized on the other side by the firm hand of our devoted guide .
0	At six o'clock in the evening one of the crew cried out that there was land ahead on the port side .
0	`` Do you know any who belong to the latter category ? ''
0	This strange and sonorous cry was produced by a game bird called grouse in the <NAME> .
0	And I fancy , when you have seen our tight-rigged little craft , when you have observed how she behaves at sea , when we sail round our island , for we will do so together -- I fancy , I say , that you will no longer hesitate to let me go .
0	The conjuror was congratulated on his skill , and a knife was given to him as a token of gratitude .
0	`` It 's strange , '' said <NAME> , `` that a private person should try to make his way from <NAME> to Behring Strait .
0	The doctor , by means of a temperature increased to one hundred and eighty degrees , gave the balloon a fresh ascensional force of nearly sixteen hundred pounds , and it went up to an elevation of more than eight thousand feet , the greatest height attained during the journey .
0	The one starts among the upper layers of the hydrogen gas , the other amid the lower layers .
0	Books : -- 1 Bible , 1 atlas , 1 dictionary of the different <NAME> idioms , 1 dictionary of natural science , in six volumes ; 3 reams of white paper , 2 books with blank pages .
0	Their skin was brown , and they had long black hair , straggling over the shoulders .
0	`` What do you intend to do ? ''
0	Like certain monomaniacs he had come to believe in his own inventions .
0	For some time past the <NAME> had not spoken to me of his projects of flight ; he was less communicative , almost silent .
0	In two years and a half , <NAME> and his two sailors had metamorphosed the island .
0	“ Because they think that they are certain to take us , ” replied the doctor ; “ and , they will succeed if we descend much farther .
0	`` You are right , <NAME> , '' said the doctor ; `` if we leave to-morrow , Tuesday , February 26th , we ought to reach the <NAME> March 15th , at the risk of starving to death .
0	“ I treat you with water , ” he said .
0	ca n't we carry him to <NAME> ? ''
0	So reasoned <NAME> and his comrades in the <NAME> mines .
0	The “ <NAME> ” now appeared in full view , with a spring on her cable , her head to the north , presenting her larboard side to the island .
0	In three or four days more the minister would have come to a decision regarding the convict , and it was only too certain that justice would take its course .
0	She is asleep , her head sunk in the lace-covered pillows .
0	It was the 27th of July , when <NAME> left the <NAME> .
0	Why should we trouble ourselves about the sufferings and tortures to be endured from hunger when death stared us in the face under so many other swifter and perhaps even more horrid forms ?
0	The <NAME> flew toward it , and at length were not more than two hundred paces away .
0	“ To the moon ! ” exclaimed <NAME> , “ To the moon !
0	`` I will come back , '' answered Dr. Wilkins .
0	`` And yet , '' answered <NAME> , `` there is no possibility of doubting -- '' `` No , '' retorted the doctor ; `` I turn it all over in vain , and say it is improbable , impossible ; I have to give it up .
0	After this , <NAME> found another corpse , that of a man of fifty , exhibiting traces of the sufferings that had killed him .
0	Nearly the half of <NAME> 's <NAME> had been explored , and clear ideas had been obtained of its shores , and of the people inhabiting them .
0	However , by the shape of her boats <NAME> and <NAME> believed that the brig was of <NAME> build .
0	But meanwhile , a marvelous world , never before so close within the range of human vision , was revealing itself .
0	Every one 's attention had to be concentrated on avoiding blocks of ice .
0	asked <NAME> , looking at him intently .
0	<NAME> <NAME> was standing at his door , and as soon as <NAME> ’ s lamp announced the arrival of his former viewer he advanced to meet him .
0	Dr <NAME> , '' answered <NAME> , `` we shall walk under the shade of the trees and sha n't even see the sun ! ''
0	He was on his feet in an instant .
0	Mrs. C. Hoey , 1897 ; An Antarctic Mystery , 1898 .
0	<NAME> made him nice little sweet dishes , which the invalid devoured with great relish , for if he had a pet failing it was that of being somewhat of a gourmand , and <NAME> had never done anything to cure him of this fault .
0	The mill and the poultry-yard particularly suffered .
0	`` I can tell , '' replied my uncle , in a sharp and doctorial tone .
0	But to the increasing surprise of <NAME> , they did not come across even the shadow of an <NAME> .
0	<NAME> was so vexed at not being able to catch a glimpse of any Patagonians , that his companions were quite amused at him .
0	The new crew had firstly to apply themselves to learning their several duties , and the old -- all fine fellows -- aided them in the task .
0	The event justified <NAME> 's predictions .
0	`` If you have a nose left , '' answered <NAME> , `` you ought to be grateful to me . ''
0	It gives a uniform and unintermittent light , which the sun does not .
0	I thought to myself that the boat might very well be used in the latter case .
0	<NAME> , who did not forget to clear his vision and his memory by an occasional application to his demijohn , maneuvered very ably when passing through this archipelago .
0	As to the distance that separated <NAME> from the <NAME> of <NAME> , they calculated it about a hundred miles .
0	The precipice was perpendicular as a wall , its topmost height crowned with the same conglomerate of crystallized lamellae that had all along been so pronounced a feature .
0	`` Oh no , <NAME> , certainly not , '' replied the <NAME> .
0	But <NAME> , who did not want to get too far from land , was about to give the order to go up the coast , when he suddenly stopped rowing .
0	Both animals and birds , influenced by the heaviness of the atmosphere , remained motionless and silent .
0	Some minutes more passed , and the <NAME> withdrew his hand from the stroke of a sharp blade .
0	<NAME> is talked of but war , and they speak of it , with a freedom which is astonishing , as having broken out between the <NAME> and the Vistula. ” The readers of the <NAME> would not fail to be as well informed as <NAME> ’ s “ cousin. ” But as <NAME> , seated at the left of the train , only saw one part of the country , which was hilly , without giving himself the trouble of looking at the right side , which was composed of wide plains , he added , with <NAME> assurance , “ Country mountainous between <NAME> and Wladimir. ” It was evident that the <NAME> government purposed taking severe measures to guard against any serious eventualities even in the interior of the empire .
0	We know already that our travellers , as well as astronomers generally , judging from that portion of the dark side occasionally revealed by the <NAME> 's librations , were _pretty certain_ that there is no great difference between her two sides , as far as regards their physical constitutions .
0	The appearance of the country is similar to that of <NAME> , but is on a smaller scale , for <NAME> is only seven or eight leagues in circumference .
0	She fell in before long with the current from the coast of <NAME> , and on the 7th of September entered the <NAME> hemisphere .
0	He landed in <NAME> , was received with enthusiasm , held meetings , saw himself carried in triumph , reconciled President <NAME> to his mortal enemy , <NAME> , and , as a token of reconciliation , persuaded them both to start with him in the projectile .
0	<NAME> <NAME> entered ; we followed .
0	How many of them remain ? ” “ The document , ” said <NAME> , “ only spoke of one castaway. ” “ Well , if he is still on the island , ” replied <NAME> , “ it is impossible but that we shall find him. ” The exploration was continued .
0	But the view was intercepted by yet higher mountains .
0	At the sound of his voice , the cabin door opened , and the <NAME> ’ s head and shoulders protruded onto the deck .
0	`` Listen to me , <NAME> , '' I said , in a firm but temperate tone of voice , `` there must be some limit to ambition here below .
0	But that mattered little , so long as the lower part grew thinner .
0	And before that we have got _red_ and _let_ .
0	In it two figures may be seen , standing , the top of the heads disappearing in high cylindrical hats , similar to those on the statues in <NAME> .
0	“ More than fifteen hundred inhabitants !
0	No one was in sight .
0	`` I ca n't tell ; '' answered <NAME> , `` but , as a conjecture , I should say that it is probably to the comparatively smaller area of the <NAME> and the more violent character of her volcanic action that the extremely rugged character of her surface is mainly due . ''
0	But one chance remained -- to seek a shelter on the southern side of the coast .
0	But <NAME> , too , was gone ; and when , upon the 14th , the sounding-line was dropped upon its site , it was only with the same result so oftentimes obtained before .
0	As for being herself deceived , and taking another for him , equally impossible .
0	The next day or two were spent in providing for the accommodation of the new comer .
0	It happened at last that the old man , abashed by these reproaches , took some pieces of gold from his old trunk , and began to buy back the damaged watches .
0	[ Illustration ] <NAME> tried to pierce the dense cloud of mist , for , according to his calculation , they should be through the strait at six o'clock of the evening .
0	But I must have some one to help me .
0	<NAME> <NAME> 's imprudences are beginning . ''
0	In the evening , after supper , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , again ascended the plateau of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> remained in his corner , not joining the colonists .
0	The two notables might even now see the orifices of the pipes which were laid on in the laboratory .
0	`` Besides , '' observed <NAME> , `` a plain is easier to disembark upon than a mountain .
0	<NAME> kept his name a secret ; otherwise no one would have gone with him .
0	But the captain did not answer ; <NAME> 's barking alone was heard upon the mountain .
0	His tropical sun is waiting for him .
0	Just note the progress of events : consider the migrations of races , and you will arrive at the same conclusion assuredly .
0	The officer in command of the detachment hastened up on hearing the report .
0	It was named <NAME> , and is in 166 degrees 52 minutes long .
0	In about half an hour they had made the three miles which separated the cape from <NAME> .
0	Once past their hiding place , <NAME> was certain of soon being able to outdistance the convicts , and execute his important mission successfully .
0	If you were to believe him , <NAME> would n't blow his nose without consulting him .
0	In a few minutes , a tall fellow of five and twenty , with a merry face , smiling eyes , a laughing mouth , and sandy hair , appeared at the bottom of the luminous cone which was thrown from his lantern , and set foot on the landing of the fifteenth ladder .
0	The wind being southeast , consequently blew on their backs .
0	He was crossing in an oblique direction .
0	If I feel too hot , I can ascend ; if too cold , I can come down .
0	<NAME> spoke freely of the vanity of competition , of the madness of rivalry , and of the need of agreement between men so far from home .
0	The <NAME> visited several deserted huts .
0	<NAME> had come out of his long stupor .
0	it is a fine death for a sailor ! ''
0	After working an hour , <NAME> , who was in a complete state of perspiration , threw down the pieces of wood in disgust .
0	The <NAME> and <NAME> translation changes it to the 117th meridian .
0	At this point indicated on the planisphere one of these currents was rolling , the Kuro-Scivo of the <NAME> , the <NAME> , which , leaving the Gulf of <NAME> , where it is warmed by the perpendicular rays of a tropical sun , crosses the Straits of <NAME> along the coast of <NAME> , turns into the <NAME> to the <NAME> , carrying with it trunks of camphor-trees and other indigenous productions , and edging the waves of the ocean with the pure indigo of its warm water .
0	The man slipped on to the ground .
0	Five hundred feet from the ship stood a man raising his hands in despair ; he stood there , powerless , facing the fire which was destroying the <NAME> .
0	Almost all the inhabitants are merchants , who trade with <NAME> .
0	At last he was discovered on a ledge in the upper portion of the Projectile , whither he had been shot by the terrible concussion .
0	<NAME> not the journey being accomplished under the most favorable circumstances ?
0	From this village it would be easy to reach <NAME> , and there they could rest in an excellent hotel , highly recommended by Dr. Hochstetter .
0	As it was , fully a quarter of an hour elapsed before he could get any answer from <NAME> to tell <NAME> in reply to his inquiry .
0	The icebergs which are formed in the open sea by the accumulation of ice are not before us .
0	For a few days already a sharp frost had given warning of the approaching rigor of the <NAME> winter , and this evening it was especially severe .
0	<NAME> fell on her knees beside it .
0	`` May this young lady go with us ? ''
0	Say rather breakfast-time , for we certainly have begun another day . ''
0	After this agreeable way of spending an hour or so , I tried to sleep .
0	`` Promise , then , '' continued <NAME> , `` to carry out my last wishes , and I shall be repaid for all I have done for you . ''
0	or a new torture invented by these blacks ?
0	But first let us light up . ''
0	His glance seemed to rest fondly for the last time on these masterpieces of art and of nature , to which he had limited his horizon during a sojourn of so many years in the abysses of the seas .
0	He next visited <NAME> , making a short stay at <NAME> and <NAME> , and thence he visited the Turkomans of <NAME> , where the `` confraternity of young men '' gave him a most hearty welcome .
0	The ship was now quite motionless .
0	Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind , even in the interior of continents , seafaring men were particularly excited .
0	The settlers made a hearty meal , for their appetites were sharpened , and measures were then taken that the night might be passed in safety .
0	Whatever might be her moral energy , her physical strength would soon fail her .
0	At that moment came a hurried tinkle from the telephone .
0	“ We are going to have a storm , ” said <NAME> .
0	But if that sea-hog of a man has not been inside the <NAME> and even the ice wall by a good dozen degrees , may the first sea we ship carry me overboard . ''
0	He was a man of thirty years , simply clad .
0	Again the boy remained silent .
0	If this was an <NAME> craft , we should blow up , perhaps , but we should at all events go faster ! ''
0	The sailors hesitated an instant .
0	Meanwhile , though it had been decided to return , rest had become so necessary that for three days no preparations for departure were made .
0	This floating mass carried the <NAME> with it , in the midst of the ice-field , the edge of which could not be seen ; to provide for any accident that might happen , <NAME> had a large supply of provisions carried on deck , as well as materials for camping , clothing , and cover ; as <NAME> had done under similar circumstances , he surrounded the ship with hammocks filled with air to protect her from damage .
0	Many come to seek fortunes who only find trouble and sorrow , and then they throw the blame on chance , and forget the true cause is their own idleness and vice and want of commonsense .
0	How could her feet , bleeding under that forced march , have carried her thither ?
0	`` Well , I know , '' replied <NAME> .
0	In 1808 , the <NAME> government decided upon sending a new mission to the <NAME> , then under the dominion of <NAME> .
0	The grand-dukes and their aides-de-camp , the chamberlains-in-waiting and other officers of the palace , presided personally in the arrangement of the dances .
0	Tell me , is my father living ?
0	Besides , they would have it that the <NAME> , who made them prisoners , would have dragged them into the interior , and it was impossible , they said , to hunt all through <NAME> for three men -- three <NAME> ; that the search would be vain and perilous , and cost more lives than it saved .
0	<NAME> prudence demanded that we should quit the <NAME> , which might slide down at a sharp shake of the iceberg .
0	<NAME> 's companions stayed with him at the fort of <NAME> ; they appeared much pleased with the country , enjoying the dates and other fruits on the island , `` and nothing seemed to harm them . ''
0	At noon , the doctor , upon consulting his map , calculated that they were passing over the Uzaramo* country .
0	we must have better information to go by .
0	If we were schoolboys , we should all be skinned alive for our ignorance !
0	We shall shortly see how emulation spread among the various nations .
0	His joy overflowed , not in long phrases , but in short ejaculations .
0	By and by the returning waves would break over the deck in great masses .
0	“ Let us wait a little longer , <NAME> , and not lose heart .
0	<NAME> , ” he said at length , “ I am not in the habit of speaking lightly .
0	It hurled itself against the fleshy mass , passing through from one part to the other , leaving behind it two quivering halves of the animal .
0	<NAME> , without taking into account the fatigue of his crew , made use of a device which whalers often employ under similar circumstances .
0	The green cloth of our tables was suddenly covered with a deluge of quill-pens , to the great injury of one of our servants , who , in trying to remove them , got one under his nail .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> are thus united by an uninterrupted metal ribbon , which measures no less than three thousand seven hundred and eighty-six miles .
0	The <NAME> , however , were not discouraged .
0	The same leaden hue , the same eternal glare from above .
0	`` Well , then , I 'll drink for both of us .
0	The caulking operations were completed , and also the slide for lowering the vessel to the base of our floating mountain .
0	The poor blacks had had no hand in the matter .
0	In beholding every one happy around him , <NAME> forgot the anxieties which appeared to trouble his life .
0	Their voyage was very quick ; the sea , which was always open , was easy sailing , and it seemed really easier to go away from the Pole than to approach it .
0	<NAME> , antelopes , and ostriches were seen running and bounding with marvellous agility in the midst of forests of acacias , mimosas , souahs , and date-trees .
0	The natives now demanded good <NAME> dollars and <NAME> clothing , both of which were altogether wanting on the <NAME> .
0	`` And at this stage of our journey , according to all known laws on the increase of heat , there should be here a temperature of < i > fifteen hundred degrees of <NAME> < /i > . ''
0	143 Fourth Voyage : A Flotilla of four vessels -- Canary Islands -- Martinique -- Dominica -- Santa-Cruz -- Porto-Rico -- Hispaniola -- <NAME> -- <NAME> -- <NAME> -- <NAME> of <NAME> -- Cape Honduras -- The <NAME> of <NAME> on the Gulf of <NAME> -- The <NAME> -- Huerta -- The Coast of <NAME> -- Auriferous Strata -- Revolt of the <NAME> -- The <NAME> of <NAME> -- Porto-Bello -- The <NAME> -- Putting into port at <NAME> -- Distress -- Revolt of the <NAME> against <NAME> -- <NAME> -- Arrival of <NAME> at <NAME> -- Return of <NAME> to <NAME> -- His death , on the 20th of March , 1506 .
0	A boat was let down .
0	Since I had known him , never had he been so amiable and pleasant .
0	Under these peculiar circumstances it might have been allowable to postpone the journey till the morning .
0	The arsenal and forts of <NAME> being unable to supply the necessary men , stores , & c. , captains , sailors , equipment , and provisions , had to be imported from <NAME> .
0	The naval doctors , <NAME> and <NAME> , were placed in charge of the natural history department , whilst the staff was composed of officers most remarkable for their scientific attainments , among whom may be mentioned MM .
0	It is impossible to say .
0	<NAME> <NAME> , in his very curious work on <NAME> , tells us that in 1865 , only fifteen bales of _phornium_ were exported , that four years later the export amounted to the almost incredible number of 12,162 bales , and in 1870 to 32,820 bales , valued at 132,578_l_ .
0	`` What became of these poor men , deprived of their leader , during the next ten months ?
0	With a sentiment of respect , which almost amounts to veneration , the sloop in which M. <NAME> made the discovery of the strait which separates <NAME> from <NAME> is preserved .
0	`` I will do all in my power , <NAME> , and by the blessing of God I shall succeed . ''
0	`` Such a supposition or something like it has been put forth by <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> ; `` but your own sense will convince you that it is quite untenable when you consider that lava , however hot and liquid it may be at the commencement of its journey , can not flow on for hundreds of miles , up hills , across ravines , and over plains , all the time in streams of almost exactly equal width . ''
0	<NAME> and morose , <NAME> could never be induced to be present at these social gatherings .
0	These , all industriously copied into the evening papers , the people were carefully reading over again , some with honest regret , some deriving a great moral lesson from an attempt exceedingly reprehensible in every point of view , but most , we are sorry to acknowledge , with a feeling of ill concealed pleasure .
0	A quarter of an hour after quitting the gasworks , <NAME> said softly to <NAME> , `` An amiable man , <NAME> !
0	“ Do you mean the Observatory ? ” “ Yes , the Observatory .
0	A whole flock of birds passed over the hunters , not suspecting the peril from which the doctor 's presence saved them .
0	It was evident that his strength had been gradually undermined by illness , but his voice seemed yet powerful , as he said in <NAME> , and in a tone which evinced extreme surprise , -- “ Sir , I have no name. ” “ Nevertheless , I know you ! ” replied <NAME> .
0	`` Did you not remark that the colour of the sea changed , grew white like milk , and that its surface became ruffled around your boat ? ''
0	But was the death of the adventurers so very certain after all ?
0	<NAME> , did you hear that ? ''
0	<NAME> <NAME> was equally anxious to try the vessel , the model of which had originated with him , although on the sailor 's advice he had altered some parts of it , but he did not share <NAME> 's confidence in her , and as the latter had not again spoken of the voyage to <NAME> , <NAME> hoped he had given it up .
0	There were cresses , horse-radish , turnips , and lastly , little branching hairy stalks , scarcely more than three feet high , which produced brownish grains .
0	`` We had gone but a few paces , '' he says , `` when a noise from the forest struck upon our ears .
0	“ We shall find it , father ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
0	“ That would not have been so amusing , ” exclaimed <NAME> , rubbing his hands , as they disembarked on the right bank of the river , “ if it had not been so difficult. ” “ That which has only been difficult to us , friend , ” answered <NAME> , “ will , perhaps , be impossible to the Tartars. ” <NAME> STROGOFF might at last hope that the road to <NAME> was clear .
0	After he had drunk , such weakness supervened that his eyes turned in his head , and he died so suddenly that we had not time to call the captain , who was in the other boat .
0	The request having been granted , <NAME> , with the nine soldiers , all punctiliously wearing the regimental tunic of scarlet and trousers of invisible green , presented themselves at the door of the colonel ’ s room , where he and his brother-officer were continuing their game .
0	At times it almost seemed as if an under-current raised these monstrous billows which thundered against the wall of <NAME> .
0	`` Be quite at rest on that point ; there is no danger of their breaking through .
0	`` He was to go up with <NAME> and <NAME> .
0	The efforts of the whole of the expedition were steadily applied to the task of trying to repair the main injuries sustained by the <NAME> , with the exception of a few sailors told off to provide , by hunting and fishing , for the subsistence of the community .
0	<NAME> expeditions were formerly made there from <NAME> , to collect the salt deposited on its banks , as the waters contain great quantities of chloride of sodium .
0	What , then , can you expect the fate of our companion to be ?
0	The natives were not slow in remarking that all the blows which they directed towards those parts of their enemies ' bodies which were protected by armour , caused no wounds ; they set themselves therefore to hurl their arrows and javelins against the lower part of the body , which was undefended .
0	After having passed the precipice , <NAME> , the reporter , and <NAME> prudently stepped aside to stop and take breath .
0	The narrative says , -- `` Several of the designs were novel to the <NAME> .
0	He said `` Keep quiet , I shall be safe as long as there is no one in Peru who does not know that I can in a moment take the life of any one who should dare to form the project of attempting mine . ''
0	Harding and his companions had left <NAME> at twelve minutes past nine .
0	At first <NAME> bore his captivity with resignation , which may have been partly due to <NAME> 's doing all he could to soothe him , at least by words .
0	What would be the measure of the eccentricity of its path ?
0	No other incident at that period of our voyage calls for notice .
0	<NAME> rejoined his comrades without opening his lips , and we had no further trouble about him .
0	According to <NAME> , who quotes this remarkable fact from an old native , Laing retained his <NAME> costume , and gave out that he had been sent by his master , the king of <NAME> , to visit <NAME> and describe the wonders it contained .
0	`` But tell me what he said !
0	The engineer gazed about him with a saddened eye .
0	The party at <NAME> , they all agreed , would not , like themselves , have been compelled to have recourse to a stream of lava for their supply of heat ; they , no doubt , had had abundance of fuel as well as food ; and in their solid casemate , with its substantial walls , they would find ample shelter from the rigor of the cold .
0	As the latter was hanging back , <NAME> pushed him towards <NAME> , whose eyes expressed the liveliest gratitude .
0	Several whaling vessels were lying quietly at anchor there , for the coast abounds in seals and other marine animals .
0	Nothing of moment happened on the voyage ; the steamer , sustained on its large paddles , rolled but little , and the <NAME> almost justified its name .
0	The cart had been left outside under the charge of <NAME> and <NAME> , who had been prudently tied to it .
0	The inhabitants of <NAME> would not have taken them there at any price .
0	They sought every means of plundering him , chased him out of their company , and forced him to seek refuge with the guides and donkey-drivers , who cordially welcomed him .
0	<NAME> , stones , twisted branches , wet clay , closed up the galleries open to the south winds .
0	`` They would have roasted , '' said the doctor , laughing .
0	Well , although I do not know <NAME> , I venture to assert that the brothers do not resemble each other -- at least in their behaviour to the Governor of <NAME> d'Acunha ! ''
0	During the following days , from the 15th to the 20th of April , the weather was very uncertain ; the temperature fell suddenly twenty degrees , and the atmosphere experienced severe changes , at times being full of snow and squally , at other times cold and dry , so that no one could set foot outside without precautions .
0	But <NAME> fancied he could see beyond the breakers a quiet basin , where the <NAME> would be in comparative safety .
0	He thought that an early examination of the southern coast of <NAME> , and of the northern coast of <NAME> , would be the most conducive to the interests of science .
0	<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> , after having examined that part of the <NAME> where the cycas grew , took their bearings , and returned to <NAME> , where they made known their discovery .
0	Hence the letter contradicting yours ; hence , after my arrival , all the accidents that occurred , such as the block of stone thrown at <NAME> , the broken ladder at the <NAME> shaft , the obstruction of the openings into the wall of the new cutting ; hence , in short , our imprisonment , and then our deliverance , brought about by the kind assistance of <NAME> , who acted of course without the knowledge of this man <NAME> , and contrary to his intentions. ” “ You describe everything exactly as it must have happened , <NAME> , ” returned old Simon .
0	The want of water forced them to land several times , and they perceived that the savages were most pleased with mirrors , bells , knives , and sheets of paper .
0	They tarried a moment , then resumed their descent .
0	Should chance bring the <NAME> ’ s courier into <NAME> ’ s presence , the latter could not fail to recognize in him the traveler whom he had so brutally treated at the <NAME> post-house , and although <NAME> had not replied to the insult as he would have done under any other circumstances , attention would be drawn to him , and at once the accomplishment of his plans would be rendered more difficult .
0	The captain then offered the presents he had brought for the king which were gratefully accepted .
0	Then , besides the fat , which would insure for a long time a store of stearine and glycerine , there were still the bones , for which a use could doubtless be found , although there were neither umbrellas nor stays used at <NAME> .
0	Albatrosses passed in the air , the expanse of their wings being at least four yards and a half , and justly called the vultures of the ocean ; some gigantic petrels , and some damiers , a kind of small duck , the underpart of whose body is black and white ; then there were a whole series of petrels , some whitish , with brown-bordered wings , others blue , peculiar to the <NAME> seas , and so oily , as I told <NAME> , that the inhabitants of the <NAME> had nothing to do before lighting them but to put a wick in .
0	The nuts which held the bolts to the outer plates of the right-hand scuttle gave way under the pressure of the <NAME> wrench .
0	“ Let us be off ! ” said he , in a decided tone .
0	`` Each separate portion , M. Aronnax , was brought from different parts of the globe . ''
0	`` And what conclusion did you draw from it ? ''
0	By degrees , they appear to swell out , break , and gain in number what they lose in grandeur ; their heaviness is so great that they are unable to lift themselves from the horizon ; but under the influence of the upper currents of air , they are gradually broken up , become much darker , and then present the appearance of one single layer of a formidable character ; now and then a lighter cloud , still lit up from above , rebounds upon this grey carpet , and is lost in the opaque mass .
0	It did not take more than a few days to perform this work , and indeed as soon as the machine had been commenced , <NAME> left his companions to follow the trade of wire-drawers , and occupied himself with manufacturing his battery .
0	`` This time , '' said the doctor , detaching his harness , `` it 's a cairn , there 's no doubt of that . ''
0	`` Understand me ; it is for this that I have embarked on the <NAME> -- yes , to find poor Pym ! ''
0	While wintering at <NAME> , <NAME> was always surprised at the voracity of his guides ; he says somewhere that two men -- two , you understand -- ate in one morning a whole quarter of a musk-ox ; they tear the meat into long shreds , which they place in their mouths ; then each one , cutting off at his lips what his mouth can not hold , passes it over to his companion ; or else the gluttons , letting the shreds hang down to the ground , swallow them gradually , as a boa-constrictor swallows an animal , and like it stretched out at full length on the ground . ''
0	Neither spurts of vapor nor hot springs surround it , and the whole volcanic power of that region is concentrated in one sublime column .
0	It was doubtful , yet <NAME> resolved to dare everything in order to rejoin his companions .
0	I have only been able to make out one or two fugitive observations , jotted down in a mere mechanical way .
0	“ The Fire-Maiden ! ” shouted <NAME> , for the last time , as the apparition , which he and his companions believed supernatural , disappeared .
0	This mode of communication obliged them first to climb <NAME> , making a detour by the river ’ s bank , and then to descend two hundred feet through the passage , having to climb as far when they wished to return to the plateau .
0	The ocean claimed a fresh victim each succeeding day .
0	You want to get away from the <NAME> 's <NAME> ; well , now is your chance ! ''
0	`` A man like <NAME> would not dodge with his enemy , or ensnare him , would not even maneuver !
0	My ear was keenly on the watch to catch the sound of a spring .
0	His eye is prompt , his arm sure . ''
0	But <NAME> 's calculations were in their turn corrected by the observations of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and others ; but it was reserved for the labors of <NAME> and <NAME> finally to solve the question .
0	<NAME> said that he resembled <NAME> -- at least that his head was <NAME> ; but he was a bearded , tranquil <NAME> , who might live on a thousand years without growing old .
0	They could not go out , except at the risk of being frozen .
0	“ Are you <NAME> ? ” he asked .
0	And that one was <NAME> , who was quietly sipping a cup of hot coffee as if he and the old world would last for ever .
0	I recognised magnificent rocks , hung with a tapestry of zoophytes of the most beautiful kind , and I was at first struck by the peculiar effect of this medium .
0	He sailed from <NAME> , the port of <NAME> , on the 19th November , 1567 .
0	`` This sum will be restored to you upon your release from prison , '' said the judge .
0	He must then content himself with gaining <NAME> , then the principal colony of the <NAME> in the <NAME> .
0	For these reasons we shall dwell a little upon the humble beginning of the career of one of the most illustrious navigators whom <NAME> boasts .
0	For two years , three years , this went on ; but <NAME> , humbled by solitude , always looking for some ship to appear on the horizon , asking himself if the time of expiation would soon be complete , suffered as none other ever suffered !
0	I thanked <NAME> , and went up to the shelves of the library .
0	These Greenlanders were small and squat ; they were not more than four feet ten inches high ; they had red , round faces , and low foreheads ; their hair , flat and black , fell over their shoulders ; their teeth were decayed , and they seemed to be affected by the sort of leprosy which is peculiar to ichthyophagous tribes .
0	That officer , a man of feeling , and ashamed of the treatment to which <NAME> was exposed , wished to strike off his chains ; but <NAME> refused .
0	I can see their bournouses puffed out by the wind .
0	On one of the cards was inscribed : <NAME> , <NAME> , Mostaganem._ On the other was the title : <NAME> , On board the <NAME> “ Dobryna. ” _ It did not take long to arrange that seconds should be appointed , who would meet in <NAME> at two o ’ clock that day ; and the captain and the count were on the point of parting from each other , with a salute of punctilious courtesy , when <NAME> , as if struck by a sudden thought , said abruptly : “ Perhaps it would be better , captain , not to allow the real cause of this to transpire ? ” “ Far better , ” replied <NAME> ; “ it is undesirable in every way for any names to be mentioned. ” “ In that case , however , ” continued the count , “ it will be necessary to assign an ostensible pretext of some kind .
0	The soil was thickly studded with cocoa-nut , papaw , and cotton-wood trees , above which the balloon seemed to disport itself like a bird .
0	And yet how many presumptions there were against him !
0	One was the blacksmith of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> sometimes bore them apart , but sympathy always united them again .
0	To think of that , when at one ’ s last gasp !
0	The brig was lying right over on her side , for her masts being broken , pressed down by the weight of the ballast displaced by the shock , the keel was visible along her whole length .
0	The bank was very equal ; there was no fear that the raft would run aground , and before two o ’ clock they arrived at the river ’ s mouth , a few paces from the <NAME> .
0	`` Leave your plans with me , and come back in a week .
0	Torrents swollen by a tremendous downpour had destroyed gardens , walls , and buildings , laid waste plantations , all but demolished one fort , swept down a number of houses in the town , and rendered several streets impassable .
0	The intercourse of the explorers with the <NAME> and the inhabitants generally were all the more pleasant that it was confirmed by banquets given on land and on board the <NAME> in honour of the kings of <NAME> and the <NAME> .
0	`` <NAME> , with a good harpoon !
0	cried M'Nicholl , rapidly flourishing his pencil .
0	`` The wind is breaking the ice against which we are propped , just as it has that of the promontory , and we shall be either driven out or buried ! ''
0	The next day a huge mountain was seen , which rose abruptly to a height of 12,000 feet above a far-stretching land .
0	Our knowledge of it is due chiefly to <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> .
0	For the protection of the passengers it was proposed to erect a kind of wooden roof lined with strong cloth ; beneath this could be packed a supply of provisions , some warm furs , some cordials , and a portable stove to be heated by spirits of wine .
0	the time for throwing out poor Satellite ? ''
0	<NAME> <NAME> 's intention was to take the <NAME> for his point of departure towards the south , after having made acquaintance with <NAME> , distant eight hundred miles from the <NAME> .
0	Some <NAME> , clad in all the sumptuousness of <NAME> apparel , and leading a woman who faltered at every step , followed .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> appeared an instant after at the threshold , almost at the same moment as <NAME> entered the room .
0	The doctor immediately recognized that immense clearing , ten miles in extent , with its villages buried in the midst of baobab and calabash trees .
0	The natives , in addition to fruits , offered fowls , pigeons , fishing instruments , working implements , stuffs , and shells , for which they asked nails and earrings .
0	Provisions are found there in the greatest profusion , and very cheap ; but clothing , <NAME> cutlery , and furniture fetch an enormous price .
0	And did not that discovery lead to the happy result of providing work for a large population , and restoring them to ease and comfort ?
0	It was evident that after having reached Reptile End , <NAME> and his companions would not have time to return before dark to their encampment near the source of the <NAME> .
0	It was ten o'clock in the morning .
0	And as <NAME> endeavoured to seize the hand which had just saved him , the stranger folded his arms , his chest heaved , his look darkened , and he appeared to wish to escape , but making a violent effort over himself , and in an abrupt tone , -- `` Who are you ? ''
0	Gama at the same time was assured that in pursuing the line of the coast , he would find numerous cities ; `` Whereat we were so joyful , '' says <NAME> in his naïve and valuable narrative , `` that we wept for pleasure , praying God to grant us health that we might see all that which we had so much desired . ''
0	This settled , they set out in the morning .
0	This reply , hyperbolical and enigmatical at the time , <NAME> had heard and remembered .
0	The sailor and his companions naturally followed the route which cut diagonally across the island , and they were thus obliged to follow the stream which flowed towards the sea .
0	But then the two rivals in popularity shook hands heartily and parted on terms of intimate friendship .
0	When <NAME> received this news , after giving way for a few moments to a very natural grief , pleading his great age and the different way in which he had behaved with regard to <NAME> and <NAME> when they were his prisoners , he recovered his calmness and awaited his death with a soldier 's courage .
0	“ Well , my dear <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ here is a very secure retreat , well hid in the depths of the rock , but it is , however , uninhabitable. ” “ Why uninhabitable ? ” asked the sailor .
0	Instead of ascending the gallery , he was going deeper down into the gulf .
0	`` What do you want to say , <NAME> ? ''
0	She was asking for her breakfast .
0	The Persians were succeeded by another party of dancers , whom <NAME> recognized .
0	A magnificent dinner was ready .
0	The exact length of the straits is 372 miles .
0	But his replies sufficed to make the route clear to <NAME> , and that was all that was wanted .
0	At the banking-house he was received with the respect due to a man who has sixteen thousand pounds deposited to his credit ; having made that point sure , <NAME> asked for a sheet of white paper , and in his large sailor 's handwriting he sent his acceptance of the plan to the address given above .
0	it is out of the question .
0	At six in the morning I rose .
0	Could they enter any of its doors while the whole party of <NAME> was plunged in a drunken sleep , or was it safer to attempt to make a hole in the walls ?
0	His detachment of the weight is really the starting point for every new improvement in sounding gear .
0	<NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> Fedor were united .
0	`` Good-night , '' said <NAME> , and he disappeared .
0	“ The fire is in the chimney , ” observed <NAME> .
0	The little band resumed its march towards the bay .
0	Are not these acts , which we see so frequently committed by <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> navigators , a true sign of the times ?
0	The rajah and his relatives wore caps of various colours , adorned with precious stones .
0	“ It is a terrible trial they have to bear ! ” “ Yes , ” said <NAME> ; “ excessive grief has produced the same hallucination in both of them , and at the same time. ” “ In both of them ! ” muttered <NAME> ; “ that ’ s strange , and pure science would say inadmissible. ” He leaned over the side of the vessel , and listened attentively , making a sign to the rest to keep still .
0	He will make us a bridge when we want one .
0	It floated on the stream of hot lava , amidst a falling cloud of cinders .
0	As for his own cabin , he had arranged it suitably for the presumed voyage , for he knew very well what was necessary for a polar expedition .
0	“ Come along , ” said <NAME> , so as to get his sister out of her embarrassment ; “ if we walk on we shall not talk so much. ” “ One moment , brother , ” she said .
0	From Rome by <NAME> , and <NAME> , then partly inundated , he went to <NAME> , where he seems to have seen nothing but the five hundred Jews living there ; then by <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> Nicholas of <NAME> , and <NAME> , he arrived at <NAME> , having crossed <NAME> and yet found nothing interesting to relate of this splendid country .
0	I will call to him ; he will hear me , and who knows but that , by returning to him , I may be able to bring him to the knowledge of the truth ? ” The maiden spoke without interruption , for all felt that it was good for her to open her whole heart to her friends .
0	“ Now , then , tell me , without a moment ’ s thought -- you understand -- the first number than comes into your head. ” “ 76223 , ” answered <NAME> , all in a breath .
0	No one suspected the odious part played by <NAME> ; no one guessed that the pretended courier of the <NAME> was a traitor .
0	As to <NAME> , his first satellite , <NAME> , half as far from him as our Moon is from the <NAME> , is comparatively , though not actually , eight times nearer . ''
0	<NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> set out with the <NAME> princess and the <NAME> ambassadors , and it was during this voyage , which lasted eighteen months , that it seems most probable that <NAME> visited the islands of <NAME> and other islands in the <NAME> , as well as <NAME> and the towns on the coast of <NAME> .
0	Some women were with them .
0	From seven in the morning of the 12th to a quarter before nine in the evening of the 21st there were nine days , thirteen hours , and forty-five minutes .
0	“ There are other offenders besides political exiles in <NAME> , ” said the chief of police .
0	They made their way then along the narrow valley separating two of the largest spurs of <NAME> .
0	“ This prisoner , who was he ?
0	The country over which they were passing was remarkable for its fertility .
0	As to his narrative , with the exception of some exaggerations of detail according to the taste of that time , it is exact , and the greater part of the descriptions which we owe to him have been verified by modern travellers and learned men , especially by M. Alcide d'Orbigny .
0	It had followed him from <NAME> , and had come by the <NAME> , on which steamer he himself was supposed to be .
0	`` What giddy spirit has taken possession of my peaceable town of <NAME> ?
0	The raft , at times , caught in certain whirlpools , and rushed forward , yet turned on itself all the time .
0	But to return on board without <NAME> , and after having so completely failed in his search , was what he could not bring himself to do .
0	The delay at <NAME> was rendered very disagreeable by earthquakes and typhoons , which are always of constant occurrence there .
0	“ No , my boy , ” replied the latter , “ we are going to proceed differently , but in as precise a way. ” <NAME> , wishing to learn everything he could , followed the engineer to the beach .
0	`` With a little earth spread on our aluminum planet we should have green peas in twenty-four hours .
0	The course was taken towards the north-west , and the next day the screw of the frigate was at last beating the waters of the <NAME> .
0	<NAME> shouldered his gun and fired ; a sailor dropped into the bottom of the boat .
0	“ To be sure he will !
0	In 1509 Juan Diaz de <NAME> , in concert with <NAME> , discovered a vast province , since known by the name of <NAME> .
0	It required some time to calm our troubled looks .
0	Even your hat would not stay on your head .
0	“ We must attack the dyke , ” said <NAME> , raising his pick ; “ for at the other side of the break , at more or less depth , we shall assuredly find the vein , the existence of which I assert. ” “ And was it on the surface of these rocks that you found out the fire-damp ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	Was it not one of her children , <NAME> , whose audacious voyage in 1611 gave her possession of the island named after him situated within the seventy-first parallel ?
0	Stunned for a moment—and it was a wonder it was no worse—J .
0	<NAME> , with the exception of the captain , the crew of the <NAME> was complete .
0	`` Be easy on that matter , '' I replied , `` there is no fear of my delaying on the road . ''
0	<NAME> came on , bringing with it refreshing coolness after the heat of the day .
0	`` And what answer did you make to <NAME> ? ''
0	<NAME> ice everywhere , the route open , the road sure !
0	The <NAME> had been now more than two months at anchor .
0	<NAME> & Co. were quite <NAME> enough to take care of their own country .
0	In face they resemble the <NAME> , but they have rounder chins , and they are far less black .
0	No one was admitted within the enclosure except a delegation of members of the <NAME> , who had made the voyage to <NAME> .
0	The lines he had formed with the letters of his alphabet had no more sense in them that those of the document !
0	<NAME> was wise enough to understand this , and felt he must set an example in obedience .
0	A special piece was given on Christmas day , in which allusion was made to the situation of the vessels , and a weekly paper was started called the <NAME> and Winter Chronicle_ , which with <NAME> , as editor , run into twenty-one numbers , all printed on the return to <NAME> of the expedition .
0	This caused a double error , that of identifying <NAME> with <NAME> ' <NAME> , and of denying the existence of the latter , which is in reality <NAME> .
0	The sheik alone did not budge an inch .
0	They set about it so precipitately that in less than half an hour not a single boat remained in sight .
0	Here telegraphic communication with all parts of the <NAME> was assured beyond a doubt .
0	But <NAME> could not continue the struggle any longer .
0	He had to live somehow , and so he joined this not very honorable company ; they neither asked him who he was nor whence he came , and so <NAME> became a captain of the woods , and for many years he followed the trade of a chaser of men .
0	`` Will the curve please you , sir ? ''
0	<NAME> returned to Fortaventura with his ships after conquering <NAME> and <NAME> .
0	They were not sleeping on board the brig .
0	<NAME> <NAME> was now so poor that he could not even hire a boat ; he was forced to rely upon public charity .
0	He recognised himself as being personally interested in the wager , and trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable folly of the night before .
0	By watching their preparations <NAME> found to his joy that the detachment were not thinking of visiting the copse , but only bivouacking near , to rest their horses and allow the men to take some refreshment .
0	the last word has not been said concerning the crew of the <NAME> . ''
0	<NAME> is a regular jungle , an almost impenetrable mass of brushwood , above which rise thickets of rimas , tamarind , fig , and palm trees .
0	[ Illustration : <NAME> in <NAME> . ]
0	“ My friends , ” said <NAME> , “ perhaps this vessel only wishes to survey the coast of the island .
0	`` That is true , '' answered <NAME> .
0	From thence we looked upon a vast sea which , towards the north , distinctly traced its boundary line upon the sky .
0	<NAME> <NAME> , first seen by <NAME> on his second voyage , had never yet been explored by any expedition , and on the arrival of the _Astrolabe_ a number of canoes , containing some score of natives , most of them chiefs , approached .
0	`` But your observation applies equally to all attempts at flight , whether in two years ' time , or in two days ' .
0	They prostrated themselves before him ; they howled ; they felt him ; they became even annoyingly familiar ; but at the same time they had the consideration to offer him a superb banquet consisting of sour milk and rice pounded in honey .
0	[ Illustration : `` Three hours later they reached the coast .
0	But he did not know that part of this scene , although it passed so rapidly , had been observed by <NAME> , <NAME> ’ s spy .
0	That day was exceptionally calm and the crew was able to get some rest ; numerous birds were swimming and flying about the ship ; among others , the doctor noticed some wild birds which were very like teal , with black neck , wings , and back , and a white breast ; they were continually diving , and often remained more than forty seconds under water .
0	This would have taken too long with the pickaxe alone , and it is known that <NAME> was an ingenious man .
0	`` I can understand , <NAME> , the delight of wandering about in the midst of such riches .
0	<NAME> was established , and from the morrow a regular and abundant traffic commenced , which supplied the ships with the fresh provisions needed by the crews .
0	The sky , covered with clouds , seemed to be laying in supplies for a fresh deluge .
0	The remains of <NAME> were at first laid in the monastery of <NAME> ; in 1513 , they were removed to the <NAME> monastery of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> <NAME> and his companions had not omitted to observe how severe was the temperature during the winters of <NAME> .
0	This negro was a servant of the first-water , and he served his master as faithfully as he would have served a gun .
0	`` Well , '' cried I , `` do you not see these different layers of calcareous rocks and the first indication of slate strata ? ''
0	What a singular division of the moon 's two hemispheres , joined to one another like man and woman , and forming that sphere of life carried into space !
0	Every arrangement had been made to insure safety and speed , for crossing the Andes is something more than an ordinary journey .
0	The elements , after having handled them so roughly , seemed now disposed to favor them to the utmost .
0	The streets were wide , planted with oaks , and the houses were white , or , to <NAME> 's surprise , painted green .
0	At the end of fifteen days the repairs of the <NAME> were completed .
0	To that there was no possible answer .
0	But what was this _Porpoise_ which had evidently been shipwrecked , and what was he doing in these waters ? ''
0	I had nothing to say .
0	After a comfortable breakfast , served in the car , <NAME> and his partners had just resumed whist , when a violent whistling was heard , and the train stopped .
0	I looked and looked till I was nearly blind , whilst <NAME> kept repeating in a calm voice : `` If , sir , you would not squint so much , you would see better ! ''
0	“ Oh , the dreadful creatures ! ” cried <NAME> , hiding her eyes ; “ they fill me with horror ! ” “ And they are really formidable , ” added <NAME> ; “ are they not , <NAME> ? ” “ To be sure -- very formidable , ” answered he .
0	The work of fortification was finished April 15th .
0	“ Poor as it is , ” returned <NAME> , “ we ought not to lose it .
0	These words restored to <NAME> that self-possession which he had lost in a moment of discouragement on feeling his great responsibility .
0	With us , after a long fast , some mouthfuls of bread and meat , a little moldy biscuit and salt beef triumphed over all our previous gloomy and saturnine thoughts .
0	A solemn ceremonial which he saw at <NAME> , no longer allowed him to doubt the existence of the practice .
0	The voyagers , aiding each other , managed to disengage themselves from the meshes of the net .
0	`` Ah , vivacious and ardent youth ! ''
0	We command you to give credit to , and to execute , whatever he shall order on our part .
0	It led him into an `` immense rotunda lighted from the top , and ending in an arched vault , at least sixty feet high .
0	<NAME> <NAME> states that , having come to the end of <NAME> 's <NAME> , he found there many traces of the presence of men .
0	The men had the provisions given them freely , and the spirits too , and you can easily imagine the abuse they made of them after their long abstinence .
0	<NAME> is at the top of the rock , where you see those very green trees .
0	The novelty of this mode of proceeding , and the request for a garment , which seemed to them even more necessary than food , made our travellers laugh heartily until they became accustomed to it .
0	Before he was judge at <NAME> , and chief magistrate in the province , <NAME> had known the young clerk at the time he was being prosecuted for the murder in the diamond arrayal .
0	`` Well , '' said <NAME> , `` let 's go find the commander ; I 'll undertake to tell him . ''
0	The salt produced by these wâdys , or depressions of the soil , form an important article of commerce with <NAME> and the whole of the <NAME> .
0	Then the river divided into two important branches , which flowed off toward the <NAME> , one going away northeastward , the other eastward , and between them appeared the beginning of the large island of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> <NAME> and the Captain were arguing the point , <NAME> began busying himself in making everything as comfortable as if , instead of a four days ' journey , one of four years was contemplated .
0	Then , by dint of lashing , throwing stones , and shouting , the animal was urged into a gallop .
0	We must go to seek him . ''
0	asked <NAME> , with his usual politeness .
0	The garrison , without including the militia , consisted at that time of 2200 soldiers ; and , in addition to the military navy , always represented by some vessel at anchor , a marine service had been organized for the exclusive use of the colony , to which the name of `` sutil '' had been given , either on account of the small size , or the fleetness of the vessels employed .
0	The robbers had left him nothing , the greater part of his baggage had been rifled . ''
0	<NAME> thunder growled in the sky .
0	But at last he arrived at the partition dividing the after-cabin , and found the door opening into the magazine itself .
0	Hence he resolved to get on at any price a few degrees farther north ; seeing that he could neither try rowing with his crew exhausted , nor going under sail with the wind always unfavorable , he ordered the fires to be lighted .
0	There , by the united efforts of the settlers the pieces of wreck were hauled up .
0	`` My good sir , there will always be enough for a solitary individual ; besides , once arrived up there , I shall do my best to economize , and not to breathe except on grand occasions ! ''
0	cried <NAME> ; `` but the hand ca n't support that heat ! ''
0	“ Most likely you are right , ” replied the count ; “ and so far from dreading a failure of the internal heat , I am not quite sure that we may not be exposed to a more terrible calamity still ? ” “ What ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	In fact , the first cornfield sown with a single grain had prospered admirably , thanks to <NAME> 's care .
0	But the projected voyage was a very different thing ; and only the old sailors of the <NAME> were entirely indifferent to the dangers of such an enterprise , and ready to follow their chief whithersoever it might please him to go .
0	“ We will keep it secret ! ” said <NAME> .
0	J. T. <NAME> , <NAME> , and the delegates of the <NAME> , were already in their cabins .
0	Once there , he would have no trouble , so he thought , in finding the cottage , built , as we have said , at the extremity of the principal passage .
0	Towards six o ’ clock , when the sun was disappearing behind the high lands of the west , <NAME> , who was walking up and down on the strand , signalized the return of <NAME> and <NAME> .
0	Their provisions were giving out , and each man had but a third of a ration , in order to allow to the dogs enough food in proportion to their work .
0	On the 18th November the corvette left <NAME> , and after touching at the <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , arrived on the 25th March , 1829 , at <NAME> , exactly thirty-five months after her departure from that port .
0	The postillion was thrashing his horses with all his might , and only kept them at a gallop by dint of abuse and blows .
0	The anchors held well , but the hawsers gave way , and the <NAME> was carried out to sea .
0	I replied , with a gesture of incredulity .
0	They were the dead of the <NAME> villages , carried by the <NAME> to the level of the sea , and which the vultures , the only undertakers of the country , had not been able to devour .
0	“ The war-tree of these cannibals ! ” said the doctor ; “ the Indians merely carry off the scalp , but these negroes take the whole head. ” “ A mere matter of fashion ! ” said <NAME> .
0	The entrance into this metallic tower was by a narrow aperture contrived in the wall of the cone .
0	The wagon was put up at the <NAME> .
0	They call their country <NAME> , and themselves the Irons .
0	<NAME> leaped about with joy ; besides , since the captain had made himself known , he had become very sociable and very gentle , preserving his ill-temper for some of the crew , whom his master disliked as much as he did .
0	`` Their straight walls , '' says D'Urville , `` rose far above our masts , glowering down upon our vessels , which appeared of absurdly small dimensions , as compared with their huge masses .
0	The colonists , warned by the engineer , left their work and gazed in silence at the summit of <NAME> .
0	[ Footnote 3 : Fifth month of the <NAME> calendar , from 20th January to 20th February . ]
0	If the carpenter , the only healthy man on board , did not succeed in perfectly stopping it , he at least considerably diminished it .
0	In short , the result was satisfactory , and the settlers had no reason to complain .
0	But what would have been the condition of the colonists if his state had been aggravated , -- if , for example , the ball had remained in his body , if his arm or his leg had had to be amputated ?
0	stifled its desperate complaint , and urged forward our poor worn-out mechanism , despite itself .
0	`` We shall have to burn the ship down to the water-line , I suppose , '' said <NAME> .
0	Several times I thought the <NAME> was preparing for attack ; but <NAME> contented himself with allowing his adversary to approach , and then fled once more before it .
0	It is to take <NAME> , the capital of the eastern provinces , and with it a hostage , the possession of whom is worth a whole country .
0	About this time the female onaga gave birth to a young one which belonged to the same sex as its mother , and which throve capitally .
0	An old gunner with a grey beard -- that I can see now -- with steady eye and grave face , went up to the gun and took a long aim .
0	The onagas , who had two pretty colts , were most often mounted by <NAME> and <NAME> , who had become an excellent rider under the reporter 's instruction , and they also harnessed them to the cart either for carrying wood and coal to <NAME> , or different mineral productions required by the engineer .
0	The surface of the sea remained as frozen as ever , and the two vessels , high up on their icy pedestals , remained unaltered in their critical position .
0	The news was received with very different feelings by <NAME> and <NAME> .
0	<NAME> was informed of the plan , of which he approved highly ; he told his companions ; some rejoiced , others heard of it with indifference .
0	He collected many facts about the interior of the country , choosing instinctively those only which could be amply substantiated .
0	<NAME> had the skill to make the owners of his ships partake in the hope which he had conceived .
0	The news of this great discovery was telegraphed over the <NAME> with great rapidity ; the papers printed the name of <NAME> at the head of their columns as that of a martyr , and <NAME> glowed with pride .
0	The Jesuits incite the women to greater austerity in their piety than any other order .
0	`` And cram all the masts into the stove , '' answered <NAME> , `` from the foretopmast to the jib-boom . ''
0	They did not appear surprised , as one would have expected , at the number of new and extraordinary things they met with .
0	For himself , although the departure of the <NAME> had displeased his companions , he continued his route , and reached the river St. Joseph , where he found an encampment of <NAME> , and where <NAME> speedily rejoined him .
0	Besides , they did not wash more than four times a year , as was done by families in the olden times , and it may be added , that Pencroft and <NAME> , while waiting for the postman to bring him his newspaper , distinguished themselves as washermen .
0	`` And our friend <NAME> , '' said a third , saluting the sailor named .
0	he cried , with real joy , `` ah , ah , and here we have the chronometer and the thermometers .
0	I approached , and was bound to believe my own eyes .
0	The women , though sad-looking and mournful , had rather agreeable features , without much expression .
0	In the excavations in the mountain <NAME> found the lamps , crowbars , ropes , and tools used in working these mines by men in the employ of <NAME> .
0	Did not the Captain know his business ?
0	To advance further under these circumstances was not only to risk his life , but to place the results of all his fatigues and efforts in jeopardy .
0	he added , calling in a loud voice .
0	“ That was an attack for you ! ” said <NAME> .
0	“ Oh ! ” ejaculated the astonished friends .
0	But this obstacle could not stop <NAME> : he hurled himself against it with frightful violence .
0	And so Mrs. <NAME> had access to the gaol .
0	<NAME> -- for it was she -- was thus able , without knowing it , to render to the mother those attentions which she had herself received from the son .
0	They came next to the country of the <NAME> to the east of <NAME> , where there was a great deficiency of water ; in this province the people were mostly herdsmen , under the hard yoke of the Mongolians .
0	Their numbers seemed even greater , perhaps owing to the influx of the stragglers of the tribe .
0	Ought they not to fly to the help of <NAME> and <NAME> ?
0	Beyond the houses on the bank were in a blaze .
0	What human being would ever have conceived the idea of such a journey ?
0	He seemed to me like a genie of the sea ; and , as he walked before me , I could not help admiring his stature , which was outlined in black on the luminous horizon .
0	These poor priests receive from the <NAME> Government a most ridiculously inadequate salary , and collect one quarter of the tithe of their parish -- not more than sixty marks current , or about L3 10s .
0	`` That 's tolerably certain , '' replied <NAME> , quietly ; `` I think they will make fun of you , sir .
0	<NAME> <NAME> 's wardrobe was amply supplied and in the best taste .
0	That reminds me that , thirty years ago , <NAME> , going to seek the <NAME> Passage -- '' `` Commanded the <NAME> , '' said the doctor , quickly , `` a brig of about the tonnage of this one , and also carrying machinery . ''
0	`` Yes , '' repeated J. T. <NAME> incessantly , whose confidence gained over everybody , `` our friends are clever people , and they can not have fallen like simpletons .
0	Redoubling his attention , he soon satisfied himself that what he saw was not a planet ; the rapidity of its displacement rather forced him to the conjecture that it must be a comet , and this opinion was soon strengthened by the appearance of a coma , and subsequently confirmed , as the body approached the sun , by the development of a tail .
0	<NAME> , motionless , her arms folded , gazed forth also , though without leaning forward , whilst her companion , his body half out of the carriage , examined both sky and earth .
0	There remained for consideration merely the question of powders .
0	There <NAME> was to await the result of the struggle between the brothers , which would decide the fate of the throne of <NAME> , but he had received letters of recall .
0	<NAME> had the recommendation of having been the residence of the incas ; but this town , situated more than 400 miles from the sea , was very distant from <NAME> , of which the importance seemed to Pizarro to be extreme .
0	“ Where would we be , ” said he , “ with only one balloon ?
0	In a mood of stolid and sullen resignation , I was about to take my accustomed place on the raft when my uncle placed his hand upon my shoulder .
0	It is not for me to go to the bath ; the bath will come to me .
0	The fatal moment had , however , at last arrived .
0	He traced out his island , which he called <NAME> , and made a line for the little river upon the shore of which we were -- placing it two-thirds of the length of the island from north to south .
0	`` But if they lap us round ! ''
0	He was taken back on shore loaded with presents , and the kind welcome which he had received induced eighteen of his companions , thirteen women and five men , to come on board .
0	The King , Seif-Ed-din , who was then reigning over <NAME> , was still a child , and his Prime Minister , Kodja-Atar , a skilful and cunning diplomatist , governed in the king 's name .
0	All the blocks of ice detached by our passage went the same way , and after two or three bounds , ingulfed themselves in the crevasse , as in the jaws of the minotaur , only the jaws of the minotaur closed after each morsel , while the unsatiated crevasse yawned perpetually , and seemed to await , before closing , a larger mouthful .
0	What a noise on the surface of the waves !
0	The cart was in good condition .
0	Top held him up by his clothes ; but a strong current seized him and drove him towards the north , and after half an hour of exertion , he sank , dragging Top with him into the depths .
0	Two state-rooms in the rear were , however , unoccupied -- those which had been engaged by <NAME> .
0	This route is generally preferred by steamers on their way to the <NAME> .
0	The volcano to its very summit and the surrounding rocks were still covered with the unsullied mantle of snow that had fallen while the atmosphere was still to some extent charged with vapor ; but on the north side the snow had given place to the cascade of fiery lava , which , making its way down the sloping rocks as far as the vaulted opening of the central cavern , fell thence perpendicularly into the sea .
0	<NAME> was twenty years old .
0	`` We have passed the point where we should have stopped if we had had no more initial velocity than the Cambridge men allowed us ! ''
0	At last Pittonaccio seized it , and , uttering a horrible blasphemy , ingulfed himself in the earth .
0	<NAME> began making a great hubbub when he found that they were burning some of the spars of the <NAME> ; but he was effectually silenced by <NAME> , who told him that if he made any more fuss , he should be compelled to pay 50,000 francs for a balloon-ticket , or else he should be left behind .
0	Wishing to escape all danger from this terrible weapon I made a desperate struggle , and the belt , which surrounded my waist and which had been hitched on a stone , gave way .
0	<NAME> <NAME> looked at them for some moments , stretched his arms towards them , and , kneeling down , burst into deep sobs .
0	... everything ! ” Such were the loud and startling words which resounded through the air , above the vast watery desert of the <NAME> , about four o ’ clock in the evening of the 23rd of March , 1865 .
0	They could not but heartily admire his energy , which was only equaled by the young girl ’ s devotion .
0	All his efforts were in vain , however , and to his repeated cries of “ <NAME> , <NAME> ! ” echo was the only response .
0	On the 5th August the <NAME> flotilla again put to sea and made 1200 miles west-north-west .
0	Savages in general , and particularly the <NAME> , have a notion of dignity from which they never derogate .
0	The admiral gave it the name of <NAME> , and all the crews chanted the <NAME> in sign of thankfulness .
0	Evidently , therefore , the most advisable plan was to sail directly for the bay of <NAME> , the <NAME> , the finest harbor on the <NAME> and one of the safest in the world .
0	<NAME> made a sign , the men stopped rowing , and , brandishing his harpoon , he hurled it skilfully ; this , with sharp barbs , sank into the thick layers of fat .
0	It was necessary to reconnoitre the corral , in order to ascertain if it was occupied .
0	About three o ’ clock in the morning , however , the <NAME> noticed that the roots were beginning to graze the ground occasionally , and by sounding the depth of the water with a long branch , <NAME> found that they were getting on rising ground .
0	In order to carry out this disguise , he had recourse to many expedients .
0	The current is not so rapid and the islets are easily avoided , so that there were no touchings or groundings .
0	The barbarous and inconsiderate greed of these fishermen will one day cause the disappearance of the last whale in the ocean .
0	D'Urville made no pause in the hydrographical survey of the northern island of <NAME> , keeping up daily communication with the natives , who brought him supplies of pigs and potatoes .
0	It puts in at <NAME> and <NAME> , but it starts from <NAME> . ''
0	Unfortunately , they were not only to be found on land .
0	It might be thought that the marvellous poet had exhausted the resources of his imagination in the terror of such a situation ; but it was not so .
0	`` Certainly not , '' said <NAME> ; `` but will you tell us now by what means they extract these pearls ? ''
0	“ Come what may , ” he presently exclaimed , “ we will make up our minds for the future to be surprised at nothing. ” “ Right , captain , ” replied <NAME> ; “ and , first of all , let us settle our little score with <NAME> Timascheff. ” Beyond the ditch lay a small piece of meadow land , about an acre in extent .
0	In a word , the <NAME> had to own their powerlessness .
0	The conformity of their characters and their tastes proved no barrier to their uniting in the closest of friendships , and they became inseparable companions .
0	These two vessels , the property of Messrs. Enderby , were fitted up for whale-fishing , and were in every respect well qualified for the long and arduous task before them , which , according to <NAME> 's instructions , was to combine discovery in the <NAME> seas with whaling .
0	<NAME> , a restless spirit personified in <NAME> ; perfect calmness typified in <NAME> -- such was the contrast .
0	`` He looks as if he was just going to grin ! ''
0	If this astounding news , instead of flying through the electric wires , had simply arrived by post in the ordinary sealed envelope , <NAME> would not have hesitated a moment .
0	At last , a certain Yusuf-al-Milky , a member of the <NAME> church , who , for some thirty years , had carried on traffic with the <NAME> tribes , and travelled in the provinces which <NAME> desired to visit , agreed to bear him company .
0	The prisoners brought by <NAME> had been added to those already kept by the <NAME> in the <NAME> camp .
0	`` Can not you say whether you have slept well or not ? ''
0	However that might be , the English were at a loss to guess why the natives prevented their penetrating to the interior of the country .
0	At a gesture from the judge , however , he sat down again , and in a calmer voice asked : “ And in the first place , sir , what makes you think that the basis of this document is a number , or , as you call it , a cipher ? ” “ <NAME> to me , young man , ” replied the judge , “ and you will be forced to give in to the evidence. ” The magistrate took the document and put it before the eyes of <NAME> and showed him what he had done .
0	`` They have been gone ten days , '' said <NAME> at last .
0	The gallery now began to trend downwards in a horizontal direction , with about two inches of fall in every furlong .
0	His examination lasted some few minutes , and then he lowered the glass , set it up on deck , and leaned on it as if it had been a walking-stick .
0	<NAME> <NAME> thought , and with reason , that it was better to remain in deep water , and keep clear of continents or islands , which the beast itself seemed to shun ( perhaps because there was not enough water for him !
0	`` That 's agreed , '' replied <NAME> , laughing and blushing at the same time .
0	His first act was to vigorously wring the hand which <NAME> extended to him .
0	She pitched violently , and this retarded her progress .
0	It is for my luggage and instruments that I am afraid .
0	They are , moreover , the <NAME> of the ancients , and belong to the <NAME> colony founded in the <NAME> by the Scythians .
0	Meanwhile , let us observe the sunset , which must be magnificent . ''
0	The coast on the eastern side looked like a mass faintly printed upon a damp fog .
0	From the moment that <NAME> had fallen by his side , <NAME> had not ceased his attentions to him .
0	Not a sound in the forest .
0	They were not men to mind the wind tearing at their hair , nor the rain wetting them to the skin , and a blow from a hammer is worth just as much in bad as in fine weather .
0	He approached the girl , took her hand , and put to her the invariable question : “ <NAME> , are you ready ? ” to which she replied as usual , “ I am ready ! ” For a few versts more the raft continued to drift amongst the floating ice .
0	Save that it was in the month of February , the coldest of the whole year , and the ice was harder ; the travellers suffered terribly from the cold , but not from the wind or snow-storm .
0	Their confidence was greater after than before `` the incident of the algebra . ''
0	<NAME> , a <NAME> , and <NAME> , a <NAME> , who had both given many a proof of skill and knowledge , were appointed to the command of the expedition , which consisted of two vessels built at <NAME> .
0	<NAME> still prevailed , but not tranquillity ; for <NAME> caught a glimpse of shadows moving noiselessly over the tufts of CURRA-MAMMEL .
0	The graceful creatures , snuffing danger in the breeze , seemed to be disturbed and uneasy .
0	Soon we were enveloped to the throat in india-rubber clothing ; the air apparatus fixed to our backs by braces .
0	We must now leave the peninsula of the <NAME> for that of <NAME> , where we have to record the result of several interesting journeys .
0	One thing was certain : Captain <NAME> had no intention of coming ashore .
0	<NAME> , therefore. ” “ Captain Harding , ” replied <NAME> , “ I think that we ought to do everything to discover this unknown benefactor .
0	With fin-backs and hump-backs , porpoises of colossal size appeared , and these Hearne harpooned cleverly when they came within range .
0	This dugong , which also bears the name of the halicore , closely resembles the manatee ; its oblong body terminated in a lengthened tail , and its lateral fins in perfect fingers .
0	They would advance beyond the eighty-fourth parallel .
0	By what means had they managed to enter into peaceful relations with the savage tribes of the district , and their cruel and grasping chiefs ?
0	Indeed , they had before believed that , surprised in the corral , <NAME> had fallen by a bullet , as <NAME> had fallen .
0	`` We shall make them ungrateful , '' replied <NAME> , in the tone of a man who esteems the human race at its just worth .
0	It was at once <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , with semicircular doors , Pointed windows , <NAME> rose-windows , fantastic bell-turrets , -- in a word , a specimen of all sorts , half a <NAME> , half a <NAME> Grand Café .
0	The weather was very bad .
0	What our schooner has done , their boat may have done !
0	“ Oh no , <NAME> , ” <NAME> hastened to reply , seeing the young girl ’ s apprehension .
0	Their meal concluded , each retired to the corner in which he had rested the preceding night , and <NAME> was not long in going to sleep near the sailor , who had stretched himself beside the fireplace .
0	`` But this statement is not mathematically correct , because the equinox does not necessarily begin at noon . ''
0	Clearly , it needed a good strong imagination to find any human likeness in that flame .
0	Like all convalescents , he was tremendously hungry , and the reporter allowed him to eat as much as he liked , for he trusted to that instinct , which is too often wanting in reasoning beings , to keep the orang from any excess .
0	A circumstance especially favorable to the success of his plan was , that he was thoroughly acquainted with the country which he was about to traverse , and understood its different dialects -- not only from having traveled there before , but because he was of <NAME> origin .
0	However , the sailor thought that by stopping-up some of the openings with a mixture of stones and sand , the <NAME> could be rendered habitable .
0	At Murzuk they were harassed by annoyances similar to those which had paralyzed <NAME> ; in their case , however , circumstances and character were alike different , and without allowing themselves to be blinded by the compliments paid them by the sultan , the <NAME> , who were thoroughly in earnest , demanded the necessary escort for the journey to <NAME> .
0	He spoke quietly without departing from the calm he had imposed upon himself , without omitting any circumstances which had preceded or succeeded his condemnation .
0	“ That little creek , shut in by rocks , seems to me to be just the harbor we want. ” “ Is it not rather far ? ” “ <NAME> !
0	The descent began at twenty-five minutes past one at night , and the chamber , drawn under by the reservoirs full of water , disappeared from the surface of the ocean .
0	“ <NAME> o ’ clock , ” replied <NAME> .
0	Involuntarily the names of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , rise before the mind , and we seek vainly for <NAME> ' vessel or the `` clipper '' of the <NAME> .
0	To this <NAME> had very little trouble in finding an answer .
0	In that case , the velocity would have decreased by degrees , but the Projectile itself would not have suddenly stopped . ''
0	Their shell is still soft , their flesh extremely tender , and after they have cooked them they eat them just like oysters .
0	Lastly , the <NAME> , who are the lightest in colour , seem much attached to a pastoral and agricultural life .
0	Two , out of the eight men who manned her , were mortally wounded by <NAME> and <NAME> , and the boat herself , carried irresistibly onto the reefs , was stove in at the mouth of the <NAME> .
0	That a phrase so evidently irritating should be pronounced by two of the principal men in the country !
0	<NAME> , however , could still hear <NAME> shouting : “ I say !
0	From the governor 's house where they slept , to the palace of the king , the streets were kept by armed men .
0	They required to go round the bay to gain the coast at the 37th parallel , the exact point where <NAME> was to wait their arrival .
0	There was no doubt about it !
0	This is self-evident , the interposition of the Earth being possible only between this visible face and the <NAME> .
0	“ But , ” said <NAME> , “ our journey is not dangerous , is it ? ” “ Not at all , ” replied <NAME> , quickly .
0	`` And all my limbs are sound and capable of new exertion ? ''
0	`` Ah , it 's you , is it , monsieur ? ''
0	Without saying anything to the captains of his fleet , who , without doubt , would have rebelled at the idea of attacking so strong a town , and the capital of a powerful empire , <NAME> gave orders to double <NAME> , and the fleet soon entered the <NAME> of <NAME> , the door of the <NAME> , from whence was seen rising in all its magnificence a busy town built upon a rocky island , provided with formidable artillery , and protected by an army amounting to not less than from fifteen to twenty thousand men , while its harbour enclosed a fleet more numerous than could have been suspected at first sight .
0	Outside these islands stretch reefs and shallows ; the islands are between these dangers and the mainland , and a channel runs between .
0	An oath burst from the latter , whose features contracted .
0	I thought the second , by the `` <NAME> 's <NAME> , '' the best ; but it was regarded as too dangerous , and it was decided that we should attack the ice-wall conducting to the summit of the <NAME> .
0	They wished to put some further questions to him .
0	`` And besides , '' said the boatswain , `` even supposing they do reach the <NAME> .
0	`` Still burning , and has been for the last three weeks . ''
0	<NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ I did not wish to tell any man but yourself. ” “ And you did quite right , <NAME> .
0	[ Illustration ] The doctor and his companions went through all these emotions ; they had reached the western limit of the ice-field , and yet they saw the ship disappear , taking no note of their presence .
0	How much blood had it not cost ?
0	The watery expanse did not present a single speck of land , not a solid surface upon which their anchor could hold .
0	To turn aside this flow , an earthquake would be necessary to change the mountain ’ s center of gravity. ” “ But an earthquake is always to be feared at these times , ” observed <NAME> .
0	The stores of the <NAME> contained some excellent wine , some of which was broached to do honor to the occasion .
0	The calculations of the Professor were perfectly correct .
0	It is probable that at the point of equal attraction , its conical cap will be directed rigidly toward the moon ; at that moment we may hope that its speed will be _nil_ ; then will be the moment to act , and with the influence of our rockets we may perhaps provoke a fall directly on the surface of the lunar disc . ''
0	For , candidly and truly speaking , never before had mortal eye revelled on such a scene of starry splendor .
0	Since 1817 the <NAME> had been pretty well the only people who had done any satisfactory business with the people of <NAME> , a state of things resulting from the presence of <NAME> residents at the court of <NAME> , on whom alone of course depended the maintenance of the exceptionally cordial relations so long established between them and the government to which they were accredited .
0	<NAME> <NAME> was baffled by mother and son .
0	<NAME> is a universal practice .
0	`` No , my boy ; but I would willingly have given a finger for my discovery . ''
0	During these few days , which to them appeared like centuries , it would seem that the old woman and the girl would have been led to speak of their situation .
0	We must see where we go .
0	He soon made some snares with creepers , by the aid of which the warren henceforth every day furnished its quota of rodents .
0	<NAME> took great delight in arranging it with her own hands , and adorning it for the reception of the loved inmate .
0	The tempests which are frequent during the seasons of the equinox , and which are so prolific in catastrophes , are above all terrible over this immense ocean , which opposes no obstacle to their fury .
0	Inside , these guns were flush with the bottom ; outside , they protruded about eighteen inches .
0	I began with you because you were the top man .
0	To save our boy you have risked your life ! ” “ My life ! ” murmured the stranger .
0	On the sea shore , a low land covered with trees and shrubs , the balmy odours of which reached the ships , rose like an amphitheatre towards the mountains , whose summits were lost in the skies .
0	At <NAME> there was no sign of any disturbance whatsoever .
0	Just at that moment <NAME> ’ s horse gave a smothered neigh and disappeared .
0	“ This creek evidently runs to the sea .
0	Besides , from my post here , I can observe the face of the country , and , at the least suspicious thing I notice , I ’ ll fire a signal-shot , and with that you must rally home. ” “ Agreed ! ” said <NAME> ; and off they went .
0	April came ; <NAME> had supplies for only eighteen months .
0	`` The planet that we call the <NAME> , '' continued the <NAME> , as grave as a judge , `` will become uninhabitable to human beings , after a lapse of 400 thousand years from the present time . ''
0	He gave his orders in a clear voice , not repeating them , but so as to be heard at once , and he was understood .
0	One evening , after a warm day in which the ice had given unmistakable signs of breaking up , he turned the conversation to the question of an open sea .
0	Why did the orchestra hurry with its harmonies ?
0	Were n't we both half-killed by the shock ?
0	“ Is the fracture recent ? ” asked Harding .
0	Without allowing himself to be disconcerted by an incident which he regarded as a simple contretemps , <NAME> proceeded in the direction of <NAME> , where after a day and a half 's journey he met <NAME> , travelling with the <NAME> caravan .
0	And the entire length of the coast , upon the shore below the higher level , is a stretch of low land , unbroken and covered by plantations .
0	The whole question was almost forgotten , when the discoveries made quite recently by <NAME> reopened the discussion .
0	He goes on and does not appear to have discovered that he has left us behind ! ” “ To deceive me , too !
0	`` Well , <NAME> , fortune was against us yesterday . ''
0	His aim was always to give a true impression of the places he visited ; and this in itself was no small merit , at a time when other explorers did not hesitate to enliven their narratives with imaginary details , with no recognition whatever of their true responsibility .
0	<NAME> , and you shall see our excellent guide at work . ''
0	<NAME> figures , tattooed on the wood , set forth the rank and achievements of the deceased .
0	He declared himself , therefore , ready to start .
0	`` Gentlemen , '' said he , in opening the discussion , `` I presume that we are all agreed that this experiment can not and ought not to be tried anywhere but within the limits of the soil of the <NAME> .
0	We inhabit a new world , peopled by ourselves -- the projectile !
0	<NAME> had succeeded in assembling together fifteen hundred artisans .
0	<NAME> turned their presence to account as a means of reassuring his companions , who were beginning to be terribly frightened at not meeting with land after six weeks of sailing .
0	As to the nearest distance at which it would pass her , that must be the result of two forces , attraction and repulsion , affecting its motion .
0	The one which had been seized in the hall of <NAME> was a great fellow , six feet high , with an admirably poportioned frame , a broad chest , head of a moderate size , the facial angle reaching sixty-five degrees , round skull , projecting nose , skin covered with soft glossy hair , in short , a fine specimen of the anthropoids .
0	Let Sunday be a day of rest ; you will see , <NAME> , that the <NAME> is read as usual ; the religious exercises do the men good , and a sailor more than any one ought to put his trust in <NAME> . ''
0	<NAME> , `` In this untravelled world whose margin fades For ever and for ever as they moved , '' they would find themselves in an immense , tawny , treeless plain , outlined by mountains so distant as to resemble fantastic cloud piles .
0	One explorer succeeded another , posts were established , and the country was opened to all comers .
0	`` My dear Clawbonny , '' answered <NAME> , `` it is the custom , not to say the habit , of every explorer to give a name to the continent which he has discovered .
0	<NAME> <NAME> watched his strange adversary with visible anxiety .
0	He has either remained in <NAME> , or we shall arrive at <NAME> before him , so as to cut him off ; in either case he will not reach Irkutsk. ” “ A rugged woman , that old <NAME> , who is evidently his mother , ” said the deh-baschi .
0	The chances of success diminished in rapid proportion ; and it was from chance alone that the meeting with the projectile might be expected .
0	Taking these two typical maps as our starting-point , we shall be able to judge of the magnitude of the discoveries of modern times .
0	It is seldom that a ship is so roughly treated as ours has been , and I consider it real bad luck , after our having profited by such fortunate circumstances -- '' `` These circumstances are all over , <NAME> , '' exclaimed <NAME> , `` and I fear indeed -- '' `` What -- you also , boatswain -- you whom I believed to be so confident ! ''
0	<NAME> <NAME> , followed by several thousand men , made his entry into the <NAME> camp .
0	Another puzzling problem and sadly bewildering to poor <NAME> , who had now almost lost his reason by attempting to clear up questions that were proving altogether too profound for his overworked brains .
0	As it was not yet time to go north , <NAME> made for the <NAME> , _viâ_ the <NAME> .
0	`` What will be the end of this ? ''
0	<NAME> <NAME> often examined the channels , and decided , in consequence of the shape of the southern coast , to attempt a passage in that direction .
0	Let us add that he turned this long cruise to account , to fix astronomically , and with remarkable accuracy , the latitude of various points .
0	Besides , as we approach the centre , I expect to find it luminous -- '' `` Nothing is impossible . ''
0	I could not answer him .
0	If , however , we strip this narrative of all that is ridiculous and grotesque , and calculated to please the imaginations of his contemporaries , it remains certain that <NAME> 's expedition is one of the most remarkable of this epoch , so fertile in gigantic enterprises ; and it furnishes the first information upon the immense zone of country lying between the Andes and the <NAME> .
0	“ What are these ? ” asked <NAME> , touching several objects piled up in a corner .
0	He was like a sister of mercy , like a mother by the bed of her child .
0	Many a time have I considered the matter ; I feel almost sure of it .
0	`` It 's a matter of organization , '' answered the doctor , `` and one which I ca n't explain .
0	It is very unusual to find one who is less than six feet in height .
0	<NAME> , who had been looking out of the window , now turned hastily towards his companions .
0	With the thick bark still covering them , they looked none the worse .
0	And <NAME> , lying down on the bank , plunged his arm into the water , and soon pulled up several dozen of fine crayfish from among the stores .
0	“ Oh , by all means ! -- Five years later , it was Major Laing ’ s destiny to force his way across the desert of <NAME> , penetrate to <NAME> , and perish a few miles above it , by strangling , at the hands of the Ouelad-shiman , who wanted to compel him to turn Mussulman. ” “ Still another victim ! ” said the sportsman .
0	My uncle and Hans pressed my arms , and the raft carried us all three away .
0	You are good citizens , quiet and peaceable !
0	The orderly performed his culinary operations in the adjoining building , which he also used as a bed-room , and where , extended on what he called his “ good oak mattress , ” he would sleep soundly as a dormouse for twelve hours at a stretch .
0	The “ Bonadventure ” was then going at a very moderate rate , as the breeze , partly intercepted by the high land , scarcely swelled her sails , and the sea , smooth as glass , was only rippled now and then by passing gusts .
0	The colonists divided their work , and their arms never tired .
0	This enormous hole was beyond all measurement , and formed a gloomy abyss , the bottom of which the sun 's rays could never reach .
0	`` But the compass , '' I cried , `` without that what can we do ? ''
0	`` Perhaps for <NAME> d'Acunha , perhaps for the <NAME> , perhaps for the <NAME> , perhaps for elsewhere . ''
0	We entered their country , as they dared not oppose us ; we endeavoured to disembark as friends , but we landed and maintained our superiority by force of arms .
0	At the same time , the frequent intercourse of the explorers with the natives threw quite a new light upon their manners , their religious notions , their language , and on their attitude of hostility up to that time to the teaching of the missionaries .
0	The town is always full of people , who come to exact what they call presents , but what might with more justice be styled forced contributions .
0	There was a certain similarity between his disposition and that of <NAME> , but their sympathies were different .
0	In 1636 and 1637 <NAME> with forty-seven canoes , and a large number of <NAME> and <NAME> , followed the <NAME> as far as the junction of its tributary the <NAME> , and then ascended , first it , and afterwards the <NAME> , to within thirty miles of <NAME> , which he reached with a few men .
0	It might really be said that he expected to be wrecked , and had prepared for it beforehand. ” “ Nothing is wanting , indeed , ” murmured <NAME> thoughtfully .
0	If <NAME> is still living , he is living on the <NAME> shores. ’ “ ‘ Who are you ? ’ asked <NAME> .
0	The word <NAME> , of <NAME> origin , signifies _grass plain_ , and justly applies to the whole region .
0	This agent must be of a versatile disposition , and able to dissemble ; capable , in a word , of concealing the real meaning of projects which aimed at nothing less than withdrawing all the commerce of <NAME> from the hands of the <NAME> and <NAME> , and through them from the Venetians , in order to enrich <NAME> with it .
0	Into these forests , twenty men penetrated for more than six miles and only returned to the shore from the fear of losing themselves .
0	The magistrate , who had often read and re-read his “ <NAME> , ” was perfectly acquainted with the steps in the analysis so minutely described by <NAME> , and he resolved to proceed in the same way on this occasion .
0	`` Well , <NAME> , '' he asked , `` are you now convinced of the reality of the voyage of the <NAME> , or do you still regard <NAME> 's book as a work of pure imagination ? ''
0	We are about to become the plaything of the great phenomena of the earth !
0	How many times they have struck the hours of prayer and the mass ! ''
0	They began to be seriously alarmed .
0	In their state of mind nothing appeared improbable .
0	Warm beverages , such as coffee and tea , were regularly distributed to the sailors morning and evening ; and as it was important to live on meat , they shot ducks and teal , which abounded in these parts .
0	`` There 's something there , evidently , '' said the doctor .
0	The worst thing about it is the delay it would cause ; but it would save us great fatigue , and perhaps danger .
0	If , then , the steam remains in its normal or habitual state , if their energy does not increase , and if you add to this , the remark that the wind is not replaced by heavy atmospheric pressure and dead calm , you may be quite sure that there is no fear of any immediate eruption . ''
0	<NAME> then took her in his strong arms and , having no longer to think of her fatigue , walked more rapidly and with his indefatigable step .
0	`` Take a lamp , <NAME> , '' answered the engineer ; `` we will start at once . ''
0	Half an hour was passed in terrible anxiety .
0	Nothing but that was wanted to cap the climax !
0	How is that for high ? ''
0	Therefore , whether from the windows of <NAME> , or from <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> , when they were not hunting , or <NAME> , unless presiding over his fires , never left the telescope , but watched all the animal ’ s movements .
0	To M'Nicholl 's question : `` Why ca n't these streaks be simply prolonged mountain crests reflecting the sun 's rays more vividly by their superior altitude and comparative smoothness ? ''
0	`` He was about to throw himself over , when <NAME> held him back .
0	we ought always to treat an adversary with respect ; rest assureed if <NAME> is still alive we shall find him all the more easily ; because if he has not , like you , been amusing himself with freeing oppressed birds , he must be looking for _you_ .
0	Herming reloaded his pistol without replying .
0	“ I doubted , ” said he , holding out his hand to Dr. <NAME> , “ but now I doubt no longer. ” He invited the doctor , <NAME> , and the faithful <NAME> , of course , to his own dwelling .
0	In fact , even his <NAME> politeness could not suppress two or three decided yawns , which of course the mathematicians were too absorbed to notice .
0	A cry was heard , uttered by the sailing-master , whose arm could be seen wildly waving amid the whiteness of the foam .
0	He then made me go round to the south of the church , and coming out of the grove of cedars surrounding it , 'This is the mountain , ' he said , looking maliciously up into my face , 'that when you were on the other side of it , was between you and the fountains of the <NAME> ; there is no other .
0	And at the same time he muttered to himself : “ I certainly have seen this fellow somewhere ! ” <NAME> was not the man to allow a conversation to drop which was likely to interest him , and for very good reasons .
0	They thus visited all the left bank of the <NAME> , along which ran the road from the corral to the mouth of <NAME> .
0	The various soils and the crops suited to them ; industrial pursuits ; the breeding of cattle ; farming economy ; manufactures ; foreign trade ; means of communication ; government ; -- all these subjects are treated comprehensively on the authority of documents then newly compiled , and with an ability that could scarcely have been expected from a man who had not given special attention to questions of this nature .
0	The descent then commenced in the following order : Hans went first , my uncle followed , and I went last .
0	That is , it has undergone less change .
0	The gleam seems intermittent too , sometimes , like that of a lighthouse. ” “ You are right , ” said <NAME> , “ and yet we are not on a lighted coast. ” “ Ah ! ” he exclaimed , “ another fire ?
0	Perhaps it only existed in my own imagination .
0	Thirteen days later , both ships came in sight of <NAME> at the entrance to the <NAME> of <NAME> , which they hastened to enter .
0	It is very like a cigar in shape , a shape already adopted in <NAME> in several constructions of the same sort .
0	<NAME> did not interrupt him .
0	A question of life or death was now to be decided .
0	Not a scout had appeared on the road over which the kibitka had just traveled .
0	added the captain in a tone of agitation .
0	He has , then , no longer any fear of his adversary ! ''
0	The engineer made a turning-lathe , with which he turned several articles both for the toilet and the kitchen , particularly buttons , the want of which was greatly felt .
0	He would have given much of the gold before him for a little water -- for he had to replace what had been thrown overboard when the negro was carried up into the air .
0	But an unforeseen circumstance , viz. , the detonation produced by the <NAME> , had the immediate effect of troubling the terrestrial atmosphere , by accumulating a large quantity of vapor , a phenomenon which excited universal indignation , for the moon was hidden from the eyes of the watchers for several nights .
0	No ship appeared upon the desert sea .
0	“ Famously , my Lord , he swims like a fish. ” “ <NAME> ! ” shouted the Major , in a stentorian voice .
0	`` M. Aronnax , '' he said , in rather an imperious tone , `` I require you to keep one of the conditions that bind you to me . ''
0	“ My dear Mary , ” replied <NAME> , “ you have not the least doubt , have you , that Captain Grant reached the <NAME> continent after his shipwreck ? ” “ No , <NAME> Paganel. ” “ Well , granting that , what became of him ?
0	A reef sometimes extends for miles along the coast .
0	Then the three traveling companions , acted upon by some unaccountable influence above that of intoxication , inflamed by the air which had set their respiratory apparatus on fire , fell motionless to the bottom of the projectile .
0	Before we took our final departure from the island , however , I made some observations to calculate the distance we had gone over , and I put them down in my journal .
0	`` Then you did n't turn it over enough ! ''
0	`` Well , then , what do you mean by repeating the name of the man whose pernicious advice led my brother to the island on which the <NAME> was lost , the greater part of her crew was massacred , and where we have not found even one left of those who were still here seven months ago ? ''
0	The <NAME> Government has always refused to acknowledge them , and Desborough <NAME> , in his `` History of <NAME> , '' subordinates <NAME> 's discoveries to those of Flinders .
0	The chief having died a few days before our travellers appeared , his sudden death was attributed to the missionary , and the tribe resolved to immolate him .
0	`` <NAME> , as I read one evening in the <NAME> , speaks of the Arcadians of <NAME> having a tradition that their ancestors were so ancient that they inhabited the <NAME> long before the <NAME> had ever become our satellite .
0	`` M. de <NAME> and I thought it of the greatest importance to ascertain whether the island we were coasting was that to which geographers had given the name of <NAME> , without guessing its extension southwards .
0	We have already spoken of the fables which <NAME> had invented in 1539 , and which had been the fruitful source of more than one legend .
0	<NAME> , however , with the recognition of his fellow-savants , to which <NAME> gave such eloquent expression in his reply to the address at his reception at the <NAME> , <NAME> consoled himself by composing songs ; and maintained until his death , which was hastened by all he had undergone , the zeal for information on all subjects , even torture , which led him to question the executioner on the scaffold of <NAME> . ''
0	The hunters were tempted by the aquatic game which took up their winter-quarters there .
0	The spot for the crater was chosen thirty paces from Kara-Tete ’ s tomb .
0	<NAME> dead , we know how the unworthy <NAME> acquitted himself of his mission , how he resolved to turn to his own profit the secret of which he was the possessor , and how he tried to make it the subject of an odious bargain .
0	The boat returned to the brig towards evening , bringing back the visitors to the shore ; <NAME> had bought several dozen eider-duck 's eggs , which were twice as large as hen 's eggs , and of a greenish color .
0	[ Illustration ] A few days before their departure , June 20th , the ice had so many free passages , that they were able to make a trial trip on board of the new launch as far as <NAME> .
0	At last the Chief Engineer , excited by some remark that had been made , observed with much earnestness : `` You may say what you please , gentlemen , but I would willingly give my last dollar to know what has become of those brave men !
0	In spite of some tolerably thick clouds it lighted up brilliantly all the air near the horizon .
0	`` Let us go down and urge the captain to leave these parts , where we ought never to have come , at once ! ''
0	At noon they passed on the left the mouth of the <NAME> .
0	On this he halted , faltered , his knees bent under him , and he uncovered his whole flank to the assaults of his enemies in the balloon .
0	The productions of both appear to be the same , and there is an absence of brushwood in the forests of both .
0	`` Every man of us would pack off to <NAME> to see her ! ''
0	And now , after _a_ or _o , _ what are the letters which figure oftenest in our language ?
0	The colonel has again insulted me , by insisting that I should not play a spade , and he shall give me satisfaction for it . ''
0	Both of them , moreover , were rigid disciples of the renowned <NAME> , who pronounces that to play the pawns well is “ the soul of chess ” ; and , accordingly , not one pawn had been sacrificed without a most vigorous defense .
0	A nice sort of captain , indeed , to let all this merchandise be lost , and do such wrong to his crew ! ''
0	A little before eleven o ’ clock , <NAME> and the reporter , rifle in hand , were behind the gate , ready to open it at the first bark of their dog .
0	But there was a great deal of discontent among them .
0	<NAME> being aware of this , hurried the embarkation of his provisions , and set sail after an interval of twelve days .
0	`` Gentlemen , '' resumed the captain , `` to-morrow I shall be dead . ''
0	<NAME> had left the jangada , but instead of mounting to the fort he had made for the village , crossing the ravine which led off from the right on the level of the bank .
0	<NAME> 's note had evidently been written and sent as soon as the convicts had shown themselves there .
0	<NAME> having arrived at <NAME> , met a certain <NAME> Calve who had lately come from the Canaries , and who offered to return thither with all the things needed by the governor , but <NAME> could not agree to this proposal before he had seen the king .
0	`` Well , here are learned men having to learn , '' said the <NAME> .
0	Not knowing the number of the island ’ s inhabitants , they might suppose that <NAME> was defended by a large party .
0	So that the time of the full moon was well chosen .
0	“ Was it the devil who rang it ? ” No one answered .
0	Well , perhaps a stone -- '' And the sailor , raising a heavy block , was about to break in one of the sides of the chest , when the engineer arrested his hand .
0	The climate is very changeable ; in summer , storms are very frequent , many fall victims to the vivid lightning , and the wind is often so strong as even to blow over men on horseback : during the winter there is no rain , which all falls in the summer , and then scarcely enough to lay the dust , while the storms of hail are terrible ; during <NAME> 's residence in the country they were so severe that once 140 persons were drowned by the melting of the enormous mass of hail-stones that had fallen .
0	And , above all , what must he have thought when <NAME> , drawing from the pocket of his dress a bag of pearls , placed it in his hand !
0	<NAME> , the governor of <NAME> , received baptism from the chaplain of the <NAME> .
0	Suddenly there was daylight in the saloon , the iron panels closed again , and the enchanting vision disappeared .
0	Cruising down the western shores of <NAME> 's Bay a long deep gulf no less than fifty miles across gradually came in sight of the eager explorers , yet when on the 29th August the two vessels had sailed up it for thirty miles only <NAME> gave orders to tack about , on the ground that he distinctly saw at the further end a chain of lofty mountains to which he gave the name of <NAME> .
0	However , two hypotheses come here into our consideration .
0	He also names the large rivers that flow into these seas .
0	They simply intended to drive a gallery into the mountain .
0	[ Illustration ] Having agreed on this , they waited for the time of action ; and during the following hours , <NAME> did not spare imprecations against a state of things in which , as he put it , `` there being men and bears concerned , the men were getting the worst of it . ''
0	He was , therefore , extremely surprised at seeing a large number of men upon the shore , and at perceiving a battery of four pieces on the beach , and a fort , pierced with twenty embrasures and surmounted by the <NAME> flag , upon a hill .
0	Do you hear me , <NAME> ?
0	Moreover , the atmosphere was close , as if the oxygen had been partly burnt up , and had become unfit for respiration .
0	The water would not return for several hours , and these hours must be employed in the most profitable way .
0	From a miniature engraved in `` The <NAME> of <NAME> Henry the Navigator , '' by H. Major .
0	let us save it , <NAME> ! ” “ It is the history of a Frenchwoman whose sorrows rendered these banks memorable in the eighteenth century. ” “ We are listening , ” said <NAME> .
0	`` A little more , '' said the doctor , `` and with a few trees I might imagine myself at <NAME> , or even in the hanging-gardens at <NAME> . ''
0	“ <NAME> , do you know the contents of this letter ? ” he asked .
0	But new obstacles soon presented themselves ; the passages were closing in consequence of the incessant crowding of the floating masses ; every moment threatened to close up the clear water before the <NAME> , and if she were nipped , it would be hard to get her out .
0	The southern island was called Tavai-Pouna-Mou , “ the whale that yields the green-stones. ” Abel <NAME> sent his boats on shore , and they returned accompanied by two canoes and a noisy company of natives .
0	I wished it , and I feared it at the same time .
0	He would offer himself as a cook or servant , in payment of his passage and meals .
0	This evening the dinner , which promised to be the last of this first part of the voyage , was not served without a certain amount of ceremony .
0	In leaving this pearl hidden in the mantle of the tridacne he was allowing it to grow slowly .
0	If it happened to be so small as to be only capable of holding the members of <NAME> ’ s family , was not the giant raft large enough to receive all those who wished to assist at the ceremony ?
0	On the table lay also a volume which had been read and re-read a hundred times .
0	“ Who ’ s there ? ” asked J. T. <NAME> .
0	`` Three thousand six hundred and twenty-seven fathoms , '' replied the lieutenant , entering it in his notebook .
0	At a height of about 31 feet the nature of the ground changed without becoming more practicable .
0	His objection has its merits , I admit ; but I think we may successfully combat it , as well as all others which affect the habitability of other worlds .
0	The nearest point the Projectile could ever possibly attain would only be the result of two opposite forces , the attractive and the repulsive , which , as was now clear , influenced its motion .
0	`` It would be but just and fair , '' returned <NAME> .
0	Five hundred feet only separated the explorers from the plateau , which they wished to reach so as to establish there an encampment for the night , but these five hundred feet were increased to more than two miles by the zigzags which they had to describe .
0	Nevertheless , <NAME> -- '' `` What would there be so surprising in <NAME> 's being carried to land somewhere by the action of the currents ?
0	Leave him to wander about in this desert !
0	Hundreds of waggons , if they went by railway , and hundreds of ships , if they went by sea , would be required for the transport of the metal , the fuel , and the meli-melonite .
0	These words were distinctly heard : -- `` <NAME> !
0	Was it not a partial eruption of the volcano , or perhaps some meteor ? ''
0	It announced : That on December 13th , at 2 o'clock in the morning , the Projectile shot from <NAME> had been perceived by <NAME> and his assistants ; that , deflected a little from its course by some unknown cause , it had not reached its mark , though it had approached near enough to be affected by the <NAME> attraction ; and that , its rectilineal motion having become circular , it should henceforth continue to describe a regular orbit around the <NAME> , of which in fact it had become the <NAME> .
0	“ Dead , ” repeated <NAME> ; “ but this man , whom I knew a long time after his crime , and without knowing that he was a convict , had written out at length , in his own hand , the story of this affair of the diamonds , even to the smallest details .
0	<NAME> was accompanied by <NAME> , a <NAME> ; they set out on the 6th of April , 1245 , and went first to <NAME> , where the king gave them letters to some relations living in <NAME> , who he hoped might facilitate their entrance into <NAME> .
0	<NAME> lying at the foot of an amphitheatre of hills , could be distinguished through the ship ’ s glasses , and soon the <NAME> cast anchor in the port .
0	The railway , on leaving <NAME> , passed for a while along the valley of the <NAME> .
0	The <NAME> replied that his master was too great a king to submit to such an unreasonable demand .
0	replied <NAME> , with an attempt at pleasantry .
0	Well , arranging these letters in a column , one under the other , and then placing against them the letters of my name and deducting one from the other the numbers of their places in alphabetical order , I see the following result : <NAME> _n_ and _j_ we have 4 letters “ Now what is the column of ciphers made up of that we have got by this simple operation ?
0	Some of these trees lay on the ground , and they had only to be barked , which was the most difficult thing of all , owing to the imperfect tools which the settlers possessed .
0	<NAME> , illuminated , glittered and gleamed .
0	In some places the plateau opened before them , and they passed without hindrance .
0	All was completely arranged by the 12th of February .
0	It is generally agreed now to recognize in <NAME> 's description of the <NAME> , the group to which <NAME> gave the name of <NAME> .
0	`` Yes , yes , captain , I was wrong , '' replied <NAME> ; `` it was a wicked idea indeed that I had , and nothing justifies it .
0	The strength of the current prevented the _Endeavour_ from touching either shore of the channel , which , however , was but a mile in width , and extremely unequal in depth , giving now thirty fathoms , now only seven of foul bottom . ''
0	I saw little of the <NAME> ; he was at work .
0	The stunning effects of the new blow were hardly over when the <NAME> began to perceive that the wonderful intelligence was decidedly in their favor .
0	We could hear it increasing in volume every moment .
0	I have it now : ‘ Lovers should , whoe ’ er they be , <NAME> in all simplicity. ’ But what next ?
0	After spending twenty-four days in this harbour , <NAME> put to sea again on the 3rd of November .
0	This proceeding , as it turned out , might have cost him dear .
0	The noise was enough to terrify even the boldest of wild beasts .
0	“ What can this be ? ” soliloquized the captain .
0	The name <NAME> comes from the <NAME> word `` sargazzo '' which signifies kelp .
0	He has as much right to speak here as any one ! ” “ Yes , ” said <NAME> , “ but his reserve does him honor , and it is right to respect the feeling which he has about his sad past. ” “ Certainly , <NAME> , ” answered the sailor , “ and there is no fear of my doing so again .
0	The detective had remained behind .
0	However , <NAME> was so well hidden among high rocks , that it could scarcely be discovered either from the land or the sea .
0	As to the wall and buildings of the poultry-yard and the onagers stable , the fire had destroyed all .
0	If there had been no lack of water !
0	Judging from his appearance I should have been a long time before I had suspected him to be what he was , a mighty hunter .
0	The <NAME> , as has been said , was <NAME> 's yacht , which had left <NAME> on the islet , and which was to return there some day to fetch him .
0	<NAME> conspired with fatigue to crush him , for a man ’ s system is not greatly restored and fortified by a diet of roots , the pith of plants , such as the <NAME> , or the fruit of the doum palm-tree ; and yet , according to his own calculations , <NAME> was enabled to push on about twenty miles to the westward .
0	Without that liana -- -- ” “ It is to <NAME> , and to <NAME> alone , that you should tender your thanks , ” said <NAME> .
0	When all these precautions had been taken -- `` My friends , '' said <NAME> , and his voice betrayed some emotion , `` if these wretches endeavour to seize <NAME> , we shall defend it -- shall we not ? ''
0	<NAME> , who had taken good care to procure some feathers for himself , could indulge in any caprice he liked .
0	Thence he visited the town of <NAME> , standing on the right bank of the <NAME> , that he calls <NAME> , and this is the very centre of <NAME> .
0	The foremost guide , <NAME> , had the most perilous task ; it was for him to make the steps over again , now more or less worn away by the ascending caravan .
0	“ Here are some animals , ” added <NAME> .
0	In the selenographical maps where , on account of the reversing of the objects by the glasses , the south is above and the north below , it would seem natural that , on account of that inversion , the east should be to the left hand , and the west to the right .
0	It was evident that he was no longer sustained by his moral energy , which had lost the power of reaction against his physical weakness .
0	We then entered the audience-chamber , and after a conversation of a quarter of an hour , I took my leave , and was conducted back with the same ceremonies . ''
0	But I could not move .
0	The mass was compact , and of an extremely close grain .
0	We have seen what an important geographical discovery rewarded the perseverance of the explorers who had completed the examination of the whole of the district north of the <NAME> , between <NAME> and the mountains of <NAME> Guiana .
0	<NAME> with the Indians soon commenced , and the most rigorous honesty prevailed .
0	The doctor , astonished , almost frightened , gazed at him silently .
0	After a few days ' stay their number increased rapidly , and they became , if not dangerous , at least a nuisance .
0	for eleven years , the survivors of the <NAME> schooner had been cast away there without any hope of succour .
0	`` If you are cold , I will take off my coat and lend it to you . ''
0	We observed this astonishing phenomenon from the vessel , and the illusion was so great that those on board believed the <NAME> had fire-arms , and we ourselves should have imagined they fired guns , but that our ship was so close that in such a case we must have heard the explosion . ''
0	Are you going by sea ? ” “ Neither by sea , nor by land , nor by air ! ” said <NAME> sweetly .
0	<NAME> can not fail to see us , and his eyes will be constantly on the lookout in that direction .
0	But the next day being Sunday , and also <NAME> Sunday , all agreed to sanctify the day by rest .
0	According to the latest news obtained by the <NAME> ’ s courier , <NAME> could not be yet in the hands of the invaders .
0	The child shook its head and made no reply .
0	Two saddles hung from stakes driven into the wall ; a large straw hat , a drum only used in war-time , a few lances , a bow , a quiver , and some arrows , were the only ornaments .
0	In reality , the great volcanic movement of the island , and all its attendant phenomena , are concentrated in the interior of the island ; there , horizontal layers or strata of rocks , piled one upon the other , eruptions of basaltic origin , and streams of lava , have given this country a kind of supernatural reputation .
0	In spite of their losses , the <NAME> called this island , in memory of the refreshment they had enjoyed there , <NAME> .
0	all was explained , everything -- except the presence of the torpedo in the waters of the channel !
0	“ And you would have done better to have accepted my offer ; it would have allowed you to have waited for our departure , rested from you fatigues , and descended with us to the frontier ; so many days of walking saved. ” “ To be sure ! ” answered <NAME> .
0	I passed a terrible night .
0	Leaving these people with gilded teeth , <NAME> took the great road which conveys all the traffic between <NAME> and <NAME> , and passed by <NAME> , where a market is held three times a week , which attracts merchants from the most distant countries .
0	The surveillance to which he was subjected hastened <NAME> 's departure , and upon the 7th of September he started for <NAME> .
0	Let us keep our minds free from every other consideration .
0	It rises in the southwest , and measures nearly five thousand feet across at its junction with the main river .
0	<NAME> , then , need never be wanting , and the daily round of labor could go on in orderly routine .
0	There they had regularly installed themselves , awaiting the moment to put their abominable schemes into execution .
0	a truce to your suppositions ; they ’ re any thing but pleasant. ” “ Ah !
0	No one now spoke , even in a low voice .
0	Trees were selected , cut down , stripped of their branches , and cut into beams , joists , and planks .
0	He much feared that his anticipations would again be disappointed .
0	A Throng of People on the Horizon. -- A Troop of Arabs. -- The Pursuit. -- It is He. -- Fall from Horseback. -- The <NAME> Arab. -- A Ball from Kennedy. -- <NAME> Manoeuvres. -- Caught up flying. -- <NAME> saved at last .
0	`` Much obliged ; it is all very clear , no doubt . ''
0	replied the engineer quickly , `` yes , even if I have to penetrate into the bowels of this island ! ''
0	<NAME> ’ t you see ? ” “ No. ” “ It was a monkey , a sapajou , an orangoutang , a baboon , a gorilla , a sagoin .
0	I would have fled from him , but it was impossible , so narrowly did he watch me .
0	<NAME> coasting along this shore no sign of habitation had been perceived -- not a pirogue left the shore .
0	As the glasses had been returned to the watches of the engineer and reporter , <NAME> burned a little linen to serve as tinder .
0	`` I know it , <NAME> , '' answered the doctor , `` and I only speak of it on account of its connection with the search for <NAME> .
0	But for <NAME> this danger is not to be feared .
0	It is a question of time .
0	`` Are these cetaceans as large as those of the northern seas ? ''
0	`` Very well then , '' said <NAME> quietly ; `` as we are safe , let us have breakfast . ''
0	The wrists of the drummers were hung with bells and curiously-shaped pieces of iron , which jingled loudly as they were beating .
0	It was all clear now .
0	He had to wait for his turn .
0	“ There they are , little father !
0	“ If he had quitted the island he would have taken away his weapons and his tools , ” replied <NAME> .
0	The horses were so well rested that they were quite fresh again , and kept up a canter almost constantly .
0	“ We have , ” he said , “ neither investigated the northern shore from the site of <NAME> Antibes to the strait that brought us to <NAME> , nor have we followed the southern shore that stretches from the strait to the Gulf of <NAME> .
0	`` They are seals and morses . ''
0	As to the others , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , they openly meditated mutiny ; they wanted to bring their companions over and compel the <NAME> to return to <NAME> .
0	They are trimmed with velvet or some other ornament .
0	“ Indeed , ” said he , “ the fact of anyone endeavoring to influence my resolution , shows that <NAME> ’ s communication must be of great importance .
0	“ Yes , <NAME> , and the waters of the Forth are as rough as the sea. ” “ Well , <NAME> , here it never rains .
0	When I reflected that this marvellous electric agent , after having afforded motion , heat , and light to the <NAME> , still protected her from outward attack , and transformed her into an ark of safety which no profane hand might touch without being thunderstricken , my admiration was unbounded , and from the structure it extended to the engineer who had called it into existence .
0	But certain local causes may considerably modify this figure .
0	<NAME> came in at last , and began to excuse himself for having kept them waiting ; but he had to approve a plan for the gasometer , rectify some of the machinery -- But everything was going on well !
0	The sweet potatoes , cooked in the burning soil , were excellent .
0	The chamberlain , the gold horn blower , the captain of the messengers , the captain for royal executions , the captain of the market , the keeper of the royal burying-ground , and the master of the bands , sat surrounded by a retinue and splendour which bespoke the dignity and importance of their offices .
0	On his return to <NAME> Petersburg he was invested with all the honours of the <NAME> ; and a little later , at the suggestion of <NAME> , he was appointed to the command of an historical , archæological , and geographical expedition to the <NAME> .
0	They crossed successively mountains and valleys , where often the pick-axe had to be used to clear a way over these still virgin lands ; at last the <NAME> arrived at <NAME> .
0	He recovered , however , and the expedition set sail again on November 25th .
0	Scarcely had he caught a glimpse of the hunter , when he bounded through the air ; but he had not touched the ground ere a bullet pierced his heart , and he fell to the earth dead .
0	On the 13th of October , 1866 , an <NAME> traveller and three of his guides were buried under a mass of ice that fell from <NAME> .
0	An <NAME> well versed in geography .
0	Besides , the moon disappeared then , and left us in total darkness .
0	asked <NAME> , after some minutes ' silence .
0	He dug his heels into the sides of his steed , and made for the shore .
0	Whether it was a passage or no , it mattered little ; it was at least a refuge ; and , driven by wind and wave , the <NAME> , under the dexterous guidance of the lieutenant , dashed in between its perpendicular walls .
0	Some moments after his continued bass supported the captain 's baritone .
0	<NAME> <NAME> went hurriedly up to the Major .
0	At a height of a hundred feet rose the vaulted roof , supported on basalt shafts .
0	I can then judge whether or not <NAME> diverges from the straight line . ''
0	It would take about half an hour 's walking to get from one to the other .
0	<NAME> <NAME> had till now thought only of doing a kind action ; but now another idea flashed into his brain ; the question presented itself under quite a new aspect .
0	`` Well , your head , except that you have one or two contusions , is exactly where it ought to be -- on your shoulders , '' said my uncle , laughing .
0	Since that time to our days the <NAME> work has been suspended .
0	“ I do not see anything , ” said <NAME> , after having for perhaps the hundredth time read through the document .
0	No sign of the buoy could yet be seen in any direction ; it had probably been drifted southward by the <NAME> coast current which slowly glides along these shores from December to April .
0	`` I do n't know , officer , '' replied the <NAME> , listening attentively to a confused murmur which came through the thick branches .
0	The two bodies lay stretched side by side .
0	`` Well , <NAME> , we left more than a thousand tons there ; so you can feel easy about that . ''
0	He took back with him eighty men , with whom and with those who remained to them , they went as far as the country called <NAME> , a country moderately peopled and where they found abundance of provisions .
0	The <NAME> , on his feet in one instant and on the top of the ladder in another , attempted to shut the lid of a half open box , speaking in an angry but suppressed voice : `` Stop this hullabaloo , wo n't you ?
0	They formed an insuperable barrier , recalling , but with more wildness , the fiords of <NAME> .
0	Many of them appeared to be ten miles wide and hundreds of miles in length .
0	<NAME> <NAME> left <NAME> , where he had obtained food by writing saphics or talismans for the natives , upon the 21st of <NAME> , and reached <NAME> , where a large salt-market is held .
0	If the operation was effected , the terrestrial axis would be undoubtedly changed , and then the catastrophes foreseen would be accomplished in all their plenitude .
0	And if there is coal on the surface , is it not reasonable to suppose that there is coal underneath ? ” The Major was right .
0	It occupies the great focus of disruption , whence it sends out great streaks thousands of miles in length ; and it gives the most unmistakable evidence of the terribly eruptive nature of those forces that once shattered the <NAME> 's solidified shell in this portion of the lunar surface .
0	<NAME> , have you seen the coal-bunkers lately ? ''
0	With the egotism of madness , he believed himself the owner of a treasure he must conceal and defend .
0	Apart , in separate compartments , were spread out chaplets of pearls of the greatest beauty , which reflected the electric light in little sparks of fire ; pink pearls , torn from the pinna-marina of the <NAME> ; green pearls of the haliotyde iris ; yellow , blue and black pearls , the curious productions of the divers molluscs of every ocean , and certain mussels of the water-courses of the <NAME> ; lastly , several specimens of inestimable value which had been gathered from the rarest pintadines .
0	There was a perfect mania .
0	They were ingots of gold .
0	At first their empire was limited to the neighbourhood of <NAME> , but under their successors it rapidly increased , and extended from the Tropic of <NAME> to the <NAME> , a length of thirty degrees .
0	exclaimed <NAME> , falling into a chair .
0	After prostrating themselves , and offering various marks of repentance , the natives appeared anxious to commence friendly and honest business with the <NAME> , but fortunately <NAME> , who was detained on board by severe illness , perceived preparations for a simultaneous attack by land and sea upon the men sent to find water .
0	`` Friend <NAME> , you say we 're moving ? ''
0	It was certain that the bridge had been crossed , that the shore had been invaded by animals , and that whatever they might be they could by ascending the left bank of the <NAME> reach Prospect Heights .
0	On the 21st of February , at six o'clock in the morning , the boat , with us all ( we numbered thirteen ) in it , left the little creek and doubled the point of <NAME> .
0	`` I myself have some pretensions to playing a good game .
0	Both have dense fogs , and , in spring and autumn , winds so fierce that the very vegetables in the fields are frequently rooted up .
0	The long twilight imparted a coolness to the atmosphere eagerly enjoyed by the passengers after the stifling heat of the day .
0	Besides , the men always slept with one eye open .
0	<NAME> was of opinion that <NAME> was an island , and that <NAME> , Oku-Jesso , and <NAME> existed only in imagination ; whilst <NAME> insisted that <NAME> and Oku-Jesso were merely an island , ending at <NAME> ; and lastly , <NAME> , in his `` Considérations Géographiques , '' page 105 , says , `` <NAME> , after being placed first in the east , then in the south , and finally in the west , was at last found to be in the north . ''
0	There was so much uncertainty in their enterprise !
0	The departure was fixed for the 16th of April , and the “ Bonadventure , ” anchored in <NAME> , was provisioned for a voyage which might be of some duration .
0	Another minute and the boat was ready .
0	The sailors were all so eager to join the expedition that <NAME> found the only way to prevent jealousy among them was to draw lots who should go .
0	It was nine o'clock in the morning when we were quite ready .
0	This great mass seemed to hold itself in equilibrium .
0	<NAME> first crossed the <NAME> districts already explored by <NAME> , where he met with vast herds of zebras , antelopes , and ostriches , arriving in due course at <NAME> , where he bought some oxen , a cart , and a cock -- the last serving as an alarm-clock throughout the journey .
0	The formalities by which the Cochin-Chinese envoys were , so to speak , hemmed in , reminded <NAME> of the anecdote of the envoy and the governor of <NAME> , who , rivalling each other in their gravity and diplomatic prudence , remained together for twenty-four hours without exchanging a word .
0	`` Now , '' said the doctor , `` we have only to cross this , and reach <NAME> , at the entrance of <NAME> . ''
0	I felt ready to choke .
0	Under these circumstances , it was not surprising that <NAME> should not have confided to the count a project which , wild as it was , could scarcely have failed to widen the unacknowledged breach that was opening in their friendship .
0	But the corvette had no proper machinery , which must be both fixed and powerful ; so it was resolved that they should put in at the nearest port , and give information to the <NAME> of the projectile 's fall .
0	Indeed , he would have asked for nothing better , but for lack of wind , the thing had become impossible .
0	In the woods are found black and brown bears , the lynx , ermine , weasel , minever , squirrel , marmot , beaver , fox , elk , and the wild goat .
0	They felt that they would be no friends of <NAME> 's if they were discouraged by impossibilities .
0	Seventy-nine parts of azote and twenty-one of oxygen , carbonic acid and steam in a variable quantity .
0	Unless he was saved by a miracle , <NAME> might now be considered as irrevocably lost .
0	It was not the iceberg itself , as yet , but vast fields cemented by the cold .
0	There can be no doubt about the matter . ''
0	A malignant fever does not declare itself spontaneously ; its germ must previously have existed . ''
0	Several officers went up the Sedger in a yawl till they were stopped by the shallowness of the water .
0	It was a vast , four-sided room , thirty feet long , eighteen wide , and fifteen high .
0	<NAME> <NAME> did not return .
0	When answers of this kind did not lead to blows , the case was an exceptional one indeed .
0	To this question there could be no answer .
0	Soon after a rumour was spread of the discovery of a large river flowing in a north-westerly direction .
0	It was not without careful search that <NAME> managed to discover this tarantass , and there was probably not a second to be found in all Perm .
0	The land on which man lives is henceforth familiar to him , and he has now only to turn to account the vast resources of the countries to which access has recently become easy , or of which he can without difficulty possess himself .
0	But we must consider that delicate question with the <NAME> .
0	On the 13th June , 1597 , the <NAME> abandoned the ship , which had not stirred from her icy prison , and commending themselves to the protection of <NAME> , the two open boats put to sea .
0	He knew that the shores of the lake were frequented by huge alligators , and was well aware of the voracity of those monsters .
0	All the carpenter ’ s work that was needed was to clear some trees of their branches : this was a business of some days .
0	On reaching the narrow gorge leading to the village preceded and followed by the numerous warriors of <NAME> , the little company divided , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> ( the sailor ) entering a cleft in the hill-side with the intention of crossing it to the other side .
0	As he had no certainty , however , of any immediate danger , he did not wake his companions , who were sleeping soundly after their fatigue , and after a little dozed off himself , and slumbered heavily for some hours .
0	The long festoon of the liana curled round its higher branches , moving away to the other side of the clearing , and disappeared again into the forest .
0	There they intended to be guided by circumstances as to their route across the invaded country , either together or separately , according as their news-hunting instinct set them on one track or another .
0	“ Will you tell me where <NAME> is ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> , overlook the men . ''
0	These penguins are the real inhabitants of these dismal solitudes , and nature could not have created a type more suited to the desolation of the glacial zone .
0	<NAME> , swelling in his heart , like mercury in the thermometer , had attained the height of transcendent folly .
0	No doubt because he feared that his name would inspire horror .
0	But the making of a new axis was possible—it may be said easy—if the engineers only had the fulcrum dreamt of by <NAME> and the lever imagined by <NAME> .
0	Here , as at <NAME> and <NAME> , were mixed crowds of all races , <NAME> and <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> , mostly merchants ready to buy or sell anything .
0	The rich freight of the <NAME> , decided the Emperor to send a second fleet to the <NAME> .
0	This grand crater is deservedly considered one of the greatest of the lunar wonders .
0	There seemed every prospect of the ships being imprisoned for many weeks , `` hemmed in , '' to use the expression of whalers , if indeed they did not run the risk of being crushed at once .
0	It is a reservoir of about 135 feet square , built of brick , and in the centre is a pretty temple dedicated to <NAME> .
0	I accepted our trying lot composedly , always thinking , however , of my dear ones , remembering them every day in my prayers , though never hoping to see them again .
0	I shall not be installed ten minutes in the square at <NAME> , with my cup and ball in hand -- the cup and ball I have brought on board , and which I can manage with pretty pleasantly -- before a circle of braves and squaws will have formed around me .
0	At this moment a guard entered the room , and handed a sealed packet to the magistrate .
0	`` Yes , if we were near enough to the bank , and if the vessel was floating at the time .
0	Until it descended between the banks of the larger stream it would not be out of keeping with the picturesque landscape which stretched away on each side of it .
0	Two magnificent flights of steps , several hundred feet long , all of granite , exceedingly well finished , and still in their places , are the only remains of a magnificent temple .
0	On the other side there is a small platform , four feet square , and furnished with a roof , under which they are accustomed to keep their provisions .
0	The narrative says , -- `` He soon proved the truth of the proverb , that a man is never a prophet in his own country .
0	He then retired , and closed the door .
0	`` Here is another indisputable example .
0	Fortunately , <NAME> discovered a bustard ’ s nest with a dozen of large eggs in it , which <NAME> cooked on hot cinders .
0	In less than twenty minutes , the <NAME> , carried along by the torrent , had passed through the <NAME> of <NAME> .
0	The night passed without any important change .
0	; the , varying colour changing with great rapidity , according to the irritation of the animal , passed successively from livid grey to reddish brown .
0	They are so numerous as to render the interior plateau quite rugged , and were formerly so many openings giving vent to fire and volcanic matter .
0	`` Or , '' continued <NAME> , `` its speed will be sufficient , and it will continue its elliptical course , to gravitate forever around the orb of night . ''
0	This profusion of winged beings enlivened the scene .
0	`` Why , what are you saying ?
0	When , therefore , <NAME> was about to press his inquiries in a more categorical form , <NAME> , thinking it advisable not prematurely to press the little _savant_ too far , interrupted him by asking the professor how he accounted for the earth having suffered so little from such a formidable concussion .
0	I woke then , and every time in a very bad humour with <NAME> .
0	When you have bought the property it will remain indivisible among you , and then for adequate compensation you can transfer it to one of the syndicates we represent ; but the <NAME> company will be out of it. ” It was a good proposal , at least for the moment , for in the future the delegates could quarrel among themselves for the final settlement .
0	She seems to me not only unpropitious to the development of the animal kingdom but actually incapable of sustaining life at all -- that is , in the sense that we usually attach to such a term . ''
0	“ Go then , <NAME> , ” said he , “ go for God , for <NAME> , for my brother , and for myself ! ” The courier , having saluted his sovereign , immediately left the imperial cabinet , and , in a few minutes , the <NAME> .
0	Consequently , he called together such of his colleagues as were at the moment in <NAME> , and without any expression of his own opinions simply read to them the laconic text itself .
0	The best thing to do now was to get to the <NAME> as quick as possible at the appointed rendezvous .
0	After having walked for a quarter of an hour , the sailor and the boy arrived at the angle which the river made in turning towards the left .
0	The fishing-boats were ornamented at the prow and the poop by the face of a grinning man with hideous features , lolling tongue and eyes made of white shells .
0	Where did this sea end -- to what did it lead ?
0	<NAME> and his friends took the <NAME> 's gig .
0	There were seventeen superiors , arrayed in large cloaks of white satin , richly trimmed with spangled embroidery ; their shirts and trousers were of silk ; and a very large turban of white muslin was studded with a border of different coloured stones ; their attendants wore red caps and turbans , and long white shirts , which hung over their trousers ; those of the inferiors were of dark blue cloth .
0	<NAME> <NAME> found himself twenty hours behind time .
0	We have , therefore , twenty-six minutes more to remain on earth . ''
0	“ It is a catastrophe that may have very serious consequences .
0	“ Yes , <NAME> , quite that number. ” “ Farther still , Paganel. ” “ If you doubt me , I can give you the names. ” “ Oh , oh , ” said the Major , coolly .
0	But his successors in this country , more especially D'Entrecasteaux , discovered to their detriment that they did not preserve this quality .
0	The sun rising above a clear horizon , announced a magnificent day , one of those beautiful autumn days which are like the last farewells of the warm season .
0	Thus we are not surprised to learn that eight days after the landing of the King of <NAME> , <NAME> was forced to resign his office and his pension , both of which had been bestowed upon him for life by <NAME> .
0	In these seas it is fishing we ought to be at , not -- '' Then , stopping short , he swore a few oaths , and cried out , `` And that other whale ! ''
0	An irresistible attraction glued me to the glass !
0	`` What a pity I ca n't find room in there , '' said <NAME> , regretting that his height did not allow of his trying the adventure .
0	The <NAME> easily avoided the breakers of <NAME> to port and the <NAME> reefs to starboard , placed at 130° long .
0	`` With this we could go round -- '' `` The world ? ''
0	But this cipher <NAME> did not know .
0	Elm or fir , both of which abounded in the island ?
0	The weather grew colder ; the thermometer fell to 32° , the freezing-point .
0	When <NAME> set out to discover <NAME> , he ascended more to the eastward in a straight line above Kazeh. ” “ Shall we keep on long in this way ? ” inquired the <NAME> .
0	“ These will be good ! ” cried <NAME> , going to the sailor ’ s aid .
0	About ten men mounted the sides of the <NAME> , armed with pickaxes to break the ice around the vessel , which was soon free .
0	While he was speaking I had caught sight of the portrait of my cousin <NAME> , and was wondering when she would return .
0	Unfortunately , to reach them would necessitate a march of one hundred and thirty miles south ; and this was why <NAME> thought it best to go first to <NAME> , as it was not only much nearer , but also on the direct line of route .
0	<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> went to take their share of the breakfast , leaving Top to watch under the windows .
0	The audience , panting , all in a heat , gesticulates and howls .
0	It was supposed that <NAME> had slept on shore , to be ready to visit the workshops in the morning .
0	It was the 1st of April , a Sunday , <NAME> Day , which <NAME> and his companions sanctified by rest and prayer .
0	It was with these almost miserable means , which , however , had given <NAME> much trouble to collect , that he prepared to wage war with a sovereign whose dominions were of greater extent than those appertaining to the King of <NAME> -- an enterprise from which he would have turned back if he had foreseen half its difficulties .
0	His eyes wandered from where the tail of the <NAME> , now a zodiacal constellation , was scarcely visible above the waters , to where the stars of the southern hemisphere were just breaking on his view .
0	Do you not think , <NAME> , that that is a sufficient motive for a ship , finding herself unexpectedly in sight of new land , to try and visit rather than avoid it ? ''
0	`` Cast iron is very brittle , though , '' replied <NAME> .
0	He is “ one sent by God. ” On arriving that evening <NAME> instinctively asked the postmaster how many hours ago the carriage which preceded them had passed that stage .
0	The <NAME> , signalling danger , tacked about , but <NAME> , annoyed by this action , which was likely to affect the confidence of the crews , crowded sail on the <NAME> , and , by passing the <NAME> , showed his determination to maintain his southern course .
0	With him , a thing promised was a thing done .
0	Look around you and see if these three mountains piled one upon the other do not resemble a staircase built up by giants , on which to climb to heaven .
0	Now , what was the use of these two maneuvers , unless the vessel had been employed in some expedition ?
0	According to him they do not belong to the same race as those of <NAME> , but resemble rather the <NAME> , the nearest of whom are those of <NAME> , seven hundred miles away .
0	Here they obtained an ample supply of penguins for the crews of the five vessels -- a bird which did not make a very delicious meal .
0	The most simple preparations for the great experiment , the questions of figures which it involved , the mechanical difficulties to be resolved -- in one word , the entire plan of work -- roused the popular excitement to the highest pitch .
0	He accordingly resolved to manufacture and employ pyroxyle , although it has some inconveniences , that is to say , a great inequality of effect , an excessive inflammability , since it takes fire at one hundred and seventy degrees instead of two hundred and forty , and lastly , an instantaneous deflagration which might damage the firearms .
0	By what means , by the exercise of what acuteness had these two ordinary mortals ascertained that which so many persons of the highest rank and importance scarcely even suspected ?
0	Do you know my past ? ... .
0	went on <NAME> , not giving his indignant friends time to utter a syllable ; `` I do n't want any recrimination !
0	so be it ! ” answered <NAME> .
0	But there was more that he had in store for him .
0	`` This scene , '' adds Laing , `` both by its nature and the sentiment which it inspired , formed an agreeable contrast with the noise , confusion , and the dissipation which pervaded a Timmannee town at the same hour ; but one must not trust too much to appearances , and I regret to add , that the subsequent conduct of the <NAME> natives did not confirm the good opinion which I had formed of them . ''
0	‘ <NAME> my word I never saw anything to come up to it. ” Just then a crashing clap of thunder re-echoed through the defile , and then died away among the distant peaks .
0	The question , though a very natural one , now appeared to have presented itself to their consideration absolutely for the first time .
0	Well , you know , <NAME> , that to please me you planned a pleasure trip ; but what could give us such genuine pleasure , or be so useful , as to save those unfortunate fellows , cast off by their country ? ” “ Helena ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
0	Spends his time in scanning the horizon , at every point of the compass .
0	The object , however , of supreme interest was the great expanse of the terrestrial disc , which was rapidly drawing down obliquely towards them .
0	Upon the evening of the 27th a sudden squall was followed by a rising wind , which carried the vessel straight to the Cape .
0	It is the depôt and market for the richest productions of <NAME> , such as pearls and precious stones , and merchants come from long distances round to purchase them .
0	There , on a square tablet of granite , which had been smoothed by rubbing it with another stone , we could see two mysterious , and much worn letters , the two initials of the bold and extraordinary traveler who had preceded us on our adventurous journey .
0	The hurricane seemed to have respected this part of the Polar Ocean .
0	Destitute of human inhabitants , <NAME> was now left to the tenancy of such birds and beasts as had escaped the recent promiscuous slaughter .
0	Was the captain 's tone of security feigned ?
0	<NAME> arms , and a general air of decision gave him the appearance of a hardy , jolly , companion .
0	But <NAME> , less confident , advised them to confine themselves to fact , and more especially so with regard to the building of a vessel -- a really urgent work , since it was for the purpose of depositing , as soon as possible , at <NAME> a document indicating <NAME> ’ s new residence .
0	At midnight , grandly illuminated , it would shine with the greatest glory .
0	Up to this period the <NAME> Company had been unable to add to the narrow strip of territory which they possessed at the ports , but it was now to benefit by the conflict between the nabobs and rajahs of <NAME> .
0	These could not hinder the progress of the raft , which offered little resistance to the wind .
0	Just a minute ago , when I was trying to sleep , several facts occurred to my memory , that make me hope it will , for we are in the region of great electrical tempests .
0	I invited some of the principal personages on board my frigate , and loaded them with presents ; and the very men I distinguished in this manner did not scruple to steal a nail or an old pair of trousers .
0	The <NAME> and the negroes ran into their huts and cabins .
0	No incident marked the voyage to <NAME> .
0	<NAME> was neither surprised nor vexed at the reply ; indeed , his object in asking was rather to establish the fact that <NAME> had not been there than that he had .
0	Thereupon the doctor wrapped himself up as well as he could , and , staff in hand , walked away towards the sledge in the midst of a fog which the moonlight made almost bright .
0	He alone besides can tell us , if he has more than a hope , a certainty , of returning some day to his country , but I doubt it ! ” “ And why ? ” asked the reporter .
0	The worthy Professor never spoke a word .
0	Also a building made of reeds , so closely interlaced as to be impenetrable to water ; it was a sort of movable kiosk that the great khan inhabited during the fine months of June , July , and August .
0	But on this evening a looker-on might have observed that , even before the curtain rose , there was unusual animation among the audience .
0	We are still going up . ''
0	“ Done at the <NAME> of <NAME> , on the 24th of May , 1862 .
0	<NAME> Heaven that I may arrive at <NAME> before them ! ” The firing became gradually louder , and soon to the left of <NAME> a mist collected -- not smoke , but those great white clouds produced by discharges of artillery .
0	<NAME> not the raft progressing with the most marvelous rapidity ?
0	; but a dense fog , lasting no less than twelve hours , continued rain , and cold , which was severe and trying to lightly-clad men , made any approach nearer than six or seven leagues impossible .
0	They employed the day in interring the dead , who were dragged to the forest of the <NAME> , and there buried deep .
0	I cried , rising in astonishment , `` did you say the tide , <NAME> ? ''
0	Here and there were opal shades of wonderful softness , running through bright spots like diamonds of fire , the brilliancy of which the eye could not bear .
0	The belts all parallel to <NAME> ’ s equator were very distinct in their markings .
0	In narrating the career of a distinguished man , it is well to neglect none of those details which may appear of but slight importance .
0	`` But since the half-breed 's revelations about <NAME> -- '' `` Ah !
0	At these words the four men started after <NAME> , in the midst of blinding cinders ; they reached the end of the fiord , a little place ten feet broad , where the waves were gently breaking .
0	The brilliant focus of light , pointed out by the engineer , touched every point of rocks , and flooded the walls with light .
0	`` No -- except when he is setting a halyard .
0	It is difficult for the traveller , who turns in despair from the inhospitable islands of this forsaken coast , where dangers of every sort assail him , and no provisions are to be had , to reflect that this barren country adjoins groups of <NAME> islands upon which nature has lavished her treasures and delights with a liberal hand .
0	This proud old man remained motionless , as insensible and silent as a stone statue ; and even at the solemn moment when the bell announced the miracle of transubstantiation , he did not bow his head , but gazed directly at the sacred host which the priest raised above the heads of the faithful .
0	said <NAME> , with a puzzled air .
0	A frightful tempest -- for it was not a thaw -- was raging , whirlwinds of snow careered around , and it was so exceedingly cold that the helmsman felt his hands rapidly freezing .
0	Would they not , on the contrary , by employing the cart leave every arm free ?
0	<NAME> ? ” continued <NAME> eagerly .
0	I tried to look unconcerned .
0	I ’ m ready to begin over again , if it would be of any service to you .
0	In the more interior galleries there was still a certain degree of warmth , and hither <NAME> and his companions were glad enough to retreat .
0	In that case , '' said <NAME> , `` the thing can be arranged .
0	“ I was afraid you would , ” replied <NAME> , looking intently at the chess-board .
0	They could now look back at the lunar mountains that they had been just sailing over -- a view somewhat like that enjoyed by a tourist standing on the summit of <NAME> .
0	In that part of <NAME> lying between <NAME> and <NAME> , nature would seem to have collected and set forth specimens of every one of these terrestrial beauties .
0	At this instant a kind of bouquet of flames shot forth from the crater , the brilliancy of which was visible even through the vapors .
0	Arriving upon the shores of an irregular lake , of vast extent , the whole party embarked in yachts , and proceeded to a bridge which is thrown across the narrowest part of the lake , and beyond which it appeared to stretch away indefinitely .
0	They were not injured in the slightest respect , thanks to the means taken to counteract the shock .
0	They , no doubt , would wish to see the unfortunate man again .
0	Some 600 priests are attached to its service , and comfortable dwellings are provided for them out of the voluntary contributions of the devotees who visit the temple .
0	If I have no faults now , I shall soon get like everybody else .
0	And so , if the document could be read , if the key had been found , if the cipher on which the system hung were known , no doubt of its truth could be entertained .
0	After looking keenly I found a small town of that name on the borders of the <NAME> , about four miles from <NAME> .
0	if we only had the <NAME> ! ''
0	`` Over my shirt '' he relates , `` I wore an old kambas , or dressing-gown , and above that a woman 's ragged chemise ; my head was covered with rags , and my feet with old sandals .
0	`` I hope so , <NAME> .
0	The ground trembled , while these molten waves , launching into the sky their wreaths of smoke , evaporated the moisture of the mould and hurled it upward through the vent-holes of the stone lining in the form of dense vapor-clouds .
0	<NAME> handed it to him .
0	Constant skirmishes ensued , with heavy loss to the blacks , until we reached <NAME> , where we remained for a day .
0	Several times already had the crests of the enormous billows licked the bottom of the net , making it still heavier , and the balloon only half rose , like a bird with a wounded wing .
0	He felt that <NAME> ’ s arrival contradicted his conjectures .
0	A dense grove of calmadores was descried on the horizon , about three miles away , on the north of the prairie .
0	“ And now , corporal , what is your business with me ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	`` No , uncle , for I am strong . ''
0	The pigeon-house was twice unroofed and the paling blown down .
0	A railway train from <NAME> Francisco to <NAME> , and a transatlantic steamer from <NAME> to <NAME> , would doubtless bring them to the end of this impossible journey round the world within the period agreed upon .
0	<NAME> indigenous plants were discovered , and those fit for immediate use , contributed to vary the vegetable stores of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> <NAME> would not pronounce upon this ; he desired to postpone the decision for twenty-four or forty-eight hours .
0	Just as they entered the <NAME> they encountered an immense number of whales , and the sailors were so terrified by their size and number , that they wished to fly ; it was not without much difficulty that <NAME> at last prevailed upon them to advance boldly , and they soon scattered their formidable enemies .
0	This return to light , if not to heat , rejoiced them all .
0	`` Well , where are you going to put the mine ? ''
0	I had imagined that , the chance gone , I should have time to reflect and discuss the matter .
0	I could feel his hot and fetid breath on my neck ; and with a horrid jump -- awoke from my nightmare sleep .
0	The mystery was about to be unveiled .
0	On the whole , this month of October , the first of the southern spring , was not ushered in by satisfactory tokens , and the wind had a tendency to shift from one point of the compass to another , which rendered it impossible to count upon settled weather .
0	<NAME> <NAME> had previously conveyed to the island several cases of preserved food , besides clothing , and tools and firearms , and a supply of powder and shot .
0	The captain had double rations served out to all hands , and well they merited this extra supply of spirits ; they had indeed worked hard during the week .
0	The Major and <NAME> went five miles up the river in search of a favorable passage , but everywhere they found the same roaring , rushing , impetuous torrent .
0	Was it a confession of remorse which thus escaped from this man 's conscience ?
0	The weather , which had hitherto been fine , broke up , and , the wind becoming violent , it was necessary to continue the course following the forty-sixth parallel .
0	At the exact minute he had indicated , we were again launched on high with extreme rapidity .
0	After leaving <NAME> , <NAME> set sail on the 3rd of January , for the south-east , to explore the only part of the ocean which had hitherto escaped him .
0	We would fight to the death , of course , but after that !
0	“ If you would like to accompany us there , <NAME> , you will be hospitably received. ” “ I do not know that I can , ” said <NAME> , who , surprised by this unexpected meeting , hesitated to make a start .
0	`` Captain , '' said <NAME> , turning with a smile to M'Nicholl ; `` no use in trying to catch <NAME> ; slippery as an eel , he has an answer for everything .
0	But see those piles there , with fragments of a tent hanging to them . ''
0	At that moment I was leaning forward on the starboard netting .
0	`` I came to ask you , sir , '' replied <NAME> .
0	The sight of the <NAME> enchanted him .
0	<NAME> and Co. evidently suffered from chronic attacks of aggravated “ cannonism ” !
0	[ 3 ] So that , in spite of the many reasons for economizing , <NAME> , after having begged light from the gas , was also obliged to beg for heat .
0	We shall start in a minute or two .
0	Their shortest way was to cross the <NAME> on the ice , which then covered it .
0	They built a church in two centuries , a painter painted but few pictures in the course of his life , a poet only composed one great work ; but these were so many masterpieces for after-ages to appreciate .
0	What is the meaning of this name `` <NAME> man 's land '' ?
0	But the emergency was great , and it was accordingly soon decided that the little colony should forthwith take up its quarters in the cave .
0	At first sight the ocean seemed lactified .
0	It would be impossible for us to tell the series of invectives in which he indulged .
0	It is a perfect type of the lunar crater .
0	Entered by gates which are shut at night , it is defended by two parallel walls , and three dry moats , one inside , one out , and the third between the two walls which are twenty feet high , and ten feet wide at the base .
0	It was to be feared that a terrible climax would occur on the summit of the tower , which rose three hundred and fifty-seven feet above the pavement .
0	A river was there called the <NAME> , a mountain took the name of <NAME> , a small lake was named <NAME> , and the forests became the forests of the <NAME> .
0	<NAME> did not hesitate to affirm that some animal of the feline species had passed there , which justified the engineer ’ s opinion that dangerous beasts existed in <NAME> .
0	They perceived by the tranquillity of the sea , in which no shallows troubled the waters , by its uniform color , which was stained by no yellow shades , by the absence of even a reef , that the coast was steep and that the ocean there covered a deep abyss .
0	`` It 's past belief , '' said <NAME> .
0	They even go so far as to poison the fountains that the birds generally drink from .
0	At length he accosted <NAME> once more , and said -- “ And this DUNCAN -- where is she going ? ” “ To <NAME> , <NAME> , ” was the reply .
0	Besides , on this level , so well chosen , the cable is never so deeply submerged as to cause it to break .
0	After their departure , <NAME> and <NAME> went down to examine the state of the water by looking at the notches they had made on the tree , and <NAME> and <NAME> replenished the fire .
0	The intensity of the solar light and heat , too , was very seriously diminishing , although <NAME> ( being on the equator of an orb which had its axes always perpendicular to the plane in which it revolved ) enjoyed a position that gave it a permanent summer .
0	The good child knelt down , exclaiming , “ Oh Lord God !
0	His arduous and perilous journey had extended over no less than nine months ; and although he had not attained its main object , it was not without scientific results .
0	And indeed the table was laid .
0	How contradict those bold ones whom the chances of their enterprise had borne over that invisible face of the disc , which no human eye until then had ever seen ?
0	Underneath this bullet is piled a charge of 400 thousand pounds of gun-cotton , equivalent to 1600 thousand pounds of ordinary gunpowder !
0	`` I know it ; when placed under the pressure of seven hundred and ten atmospheres , '' cried my uncle with imperturbable gravity .
0	253 He traced the coast of Tartary .
0	The ambassador and his suite were therefore to go up by water as far as <NAME> , about a dozen miles from <NAME> , and thence proceed by land to <NAME> , where the emperor awaited them .
0	`` So as to do here , '' replied <NAME> , `` that which <NAME> did the very first thing on <NAME> , by climbing <NAME> . ''
0	I wish we were there now !
0	<NAME> to their meli-melonite their shell will describe the half of a hyperbola and never come back to beg pardon for having given that kick to the terrestrial ball ! ” And <NAME> threw his arms about like the semaphore at <NAME> , at the risk of breaking everything within a radius of six feet of him .
0	They were compelled to believe so , and <NAME> could not help one day making this observation , -- `` If he does not speak it is because he has , I fear , things too serious to be told ! ''
0	We can reach the <NAME> only by a fall , and we do n't fall .
0	The wretch who had betrayed his country now threatened to torture his mother .
0	This immense circle is one mass of glittering whiteness .
0	`` I saw -- -- '' murmured he ; `` I saw -- but do not talk -- reserve all your strength ! ''
0	And <NAME> , swelling out his cheeks , blew so much and so well into the tube-taking care to twirl it round at the same time -- that his breath dilated the glassy mass .
0	But , to bring this rapid sketch to a close , I will only add that a certain Hans Pfaal , of <NAME> , launching himself in a balloon filled with a gas extracted from nitrogen , thirty-seven times lighter than hydrogen , reached the moon after a passage of nineteen hours .
0	Soon she was within two miles of the sand-banks , which were still veiled from time to time in thick mist .
0	Since then , he always called him Dr. Spilett .
0	`` Good , '' replied <NAME> ; `` your projectiles would have no effect on the sun ; they would fall back upon the earth after some minutes . ''
0	`` He 's a spy sent to keep us in view !
0	<NAME> <NAME> , leaving to his son everything that referred to the commercial side of the expedition , kept himself principally to his room , thinking and writing .
0	See , they ’ ve sent us a nice little southeast breeze , that will put us on the right track again. ” In fact , the <NAME> was resuming a more northerly route , and on the morning of the 20th she was passing over an inextricable network of channels , torrents , and streams , in fine , the whole complicated tangle of the <NAME> ’ s tributaries .
0	Those in the rear pushed on the foremost assailants , and it was an incessant struggle with revolvers and hatchets .
0	<NAME> was not more successful than his masters .
0	Opening a cupboard and taking out a bottle and a few glasses , he placed them on a tray .
0	Four barrels of the revolver were still undischarged .
0	At seven o'clock in the morning , the thermometer stood at 8° above zero .
0	It was , perhaps , only natural that this clustered mass of birds , as representing the whole of the feathered tribe upon the surface of <NAME> , should resort to <NAME> , of which the meadows seemed to be the only spot from which they could get sustenance at all ; but as this sustenance would be obtained at the expense , and probably to the serious detriment , of the human population , it was absolutely necessary that every possible resistance should be made to the devastation that was threatened .
0	This coast was inhabited , and three boats approached the vessels .
0	`` And what do you conclude from this ? ''
0	`` Not a president elected by the nation , '' replied <NAME> .
0	<NAME> <NAME> , with clenched teeth and knitted brow , stood sternly , almost fiercely , regarding the boundless waste of water .
0	But to the great surprise of the natives and the stupefaction of <NAME> , the captain refused .
0	A rugged cavern of small extent appeared to offer a halting place to our weary bodies .
0	`` Captain , '' said <NAME> , following him , `` from there we ought to see the stores . ''
0	An officer was at once deputed to go and ascertain from the captain what succour he could render to the <NAME> travellers .
0	`` But , then , '' said <NAME> , `` in order to maintain that combustion , there must be air .
0	He therefore wished , without even returning to <NAME> and the colonies already settled , to direct his course at once to the <NAME> .
0	`` The sea is bad , the wind violent , but twenty miles in that light boat of the <NAME> does not frighten me .
0	`` And why , my dear <NAME> , '' answered <NAME> , `` should it not follow the road naturally traced out for it ? ''
0	His forces , united to those of <NAME> , had as yet been unsuccessful before <NAME> , and nothing gave the prisoners any hope of a speedy deliverance .
0	The shore at this place was composed of fine sand interspersed here and there with little sandy hillocks , behind which were scattered `` groves and very thick forests which were wonderfully pleasant to look upon . ''
0	It was not easy to get information from the natives , who were avaricious , untrustworthy , insolent , and deceitful .
0	But <NAME> said no word to his companions ; that evening they made their accustomed halt , and their supper consisted only of coffee .
0	At all events , we shall get there some day . ''
0	I say seventy-five fathoms , though I had no instrument by which to judge the distance .
0	Thus ended the vicissitudes of the <NAME> 's journey .
0	The colonists divided their work , and their arms never tired .
0	You must aid me with your advice , your experience ! ''
0	<NAME> 's wounds , covered with compresses and lint , were pressed neither too much nor too little , so as to cause their cicatrisation without determining on inflammatory reaction .
0	A moderate breeze , which passes over twenty-four feet to the second , will give sixteen turns to the sails during a minute , and there is no need of more. ” “ Exactly ! ” cried <NAME> , “ a fine breeze is blowing from the northeast , which will soon do our business for us. ” There was no reason for delaying the inauguration of the mill , for the settlers were eager to taste the first piece of bread in <NAME> .
0	It was impossible to stand upright in the interior of the <NAME> .
0	O blessed refuge , unassailable by aught of human ills !
0	<NAME> did with him whatever he pleased .
0	<NAME> describes <NAME> as a man of short stature , about fifty years old , wearing a beard , painted of a most delicate azure blue .
0	Fortunately the tide carried our frigates into the bay , and we escaped the rocks on the east by half a pistol 's range .
0	`` Now , '' thought <NAME> , `` we 've got him .
0	In the north of <NAME> the rainy season is in <NAME> ; in the south it occurs in March .
0	The landlord of the “ <NAME> , ” as it was called , was a coarse man with an ill-tempered face , who must have considered himself his principal customer for the gin , brandy and whisky he had to sell .
0	“ We are not making progress , ” said the doctor .
0	<NAME> is but the motion of atoms , a simple oscillation of the particles of a body .
0	The noise was truly awful .
0	He was one of the most noticeable members of the <NAME> , though he seemed always to avoid attracting attention ; an enigmatical personage , about whom little was known , except that he was a polished man of the world .
0	According to the signal-man , it was in a ruinous condition , several of the iron wires being broken ; and it was impossible to risk the passage .
0	`` For what purpose , sir , when nature has provided us with such a bay as this , where there is shelter from gales , and it is easy to lie snug right up against the rocks ?
0	<NAME> has proved this incontestably .
0	The two vessels chosen , the <NAME> and <NAME> , under <NAME> and <NAME> , were carefully equipped , and stocked with everything necessary for so long a voyage , the famous Dampier , who had acquired a great reputation by his daring adventures and piracies , did not disdain to accept the title of chief pilot , and although this trip was richer in material results than in geographical discoveries , the account of it contains a few curious particulars worthy of preservation .
0	They have dispersed , some are gone into their huts .
0	`` Nevertheless , <NAME> , you possess an extreme rapidity of movement , which does not agree well with the power of electricity .
0	<NAME> was with his master ; <NAME> was there ready to sacrifice himself for all ; <NAME> was more a farmer than he had even been a sailor ; <NAME> , who completed his studies under the superintendence of <NAME> ; and <NAME> , who founded the <NAME> , the best-informed journal in the world .
0	The <NAME> had dragged his companion towards the entrance of the <NAME> , and showed him the prairie , making him understand that now was the time when it was clear from the wolves ; but that not a moment was to be lost , for should this maneuver not succeed , it would only render the situation of those left behind more desperate , and that he knew his horse well enough to be able to trust his wonderful lightness and swiftness to save them all .
0	The plants themselves were infected by a similar strange metamorphosis .
0	“ Let her sleep ! ” said the engineer .
0	Once when he landed , he had a slight skirmish with some of the inhabitants , who seemed to be very thinly scattered over the country .
0	He did so , too , with all his might , and soon had collected more than a thousand pieces of quartz , which contained gold enclosed as though in an extremely hard crystal casket .
0	It had landed on a sand-bank , twenty-five fathoms from the coast .
0	The sailors <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> zealously obeyed <NAME> 's orders ; and he admonished them not to accustom themselves to woollen garments , though the temperature in this latitude , situated just beyond the polar circle , was very low .
0	said the doctor ; `` nothing yet !
0	`` Yes , a rebel , perhaps an outlaw against humanity ! ''
0	There was no doubt that the flock would prosper , and that at no distant time not only wool but hides would be abundant .
0	At any rate , for humanity ’ s sake alone , it would be right to wait .
0	Then , since <NAME> is 77deg 3 ’ 11 ” as much as to say seventy-seven degrees counted from the meridian of <NAME> which the Americans take for their starting-point for longitudes concurrently with the <NAME> -- it followed that the island must be situated seventy-seven and seventy-five degrees west of the meridian of <NAME> , that is to say , on the hundred and fifty-second degree of west longitude .
0	There was certainly something wrong .
0	With his natural buoyancy of spirits , he began to hope again .
0	`` We can try , '' said <NAME> .
0	`` On my word , <NAME> , I am your man , '' answered <NAME> ; `` and although I think your plan a very bold one , you can count on me to the end . ''
0	It was certainly on the way , but as certainly it could not now reach <NAME> for several days ; and , this being the last English territory on <NAME> 's route , the robber would escape , unless he could manage to detain him .
0	<NAME> watched him , while <NAME> nursed a growing headache with both hands .
0	The massive walking-beam rose and fell above the deck ; at one end a piston-rod worked up and down ; and at the other was a connecting-rod which , in changing the rectilinear motion to a circular one , was directly connected with the shaft of the paddles .
0	On the other side , however , there are numerous peaks of barren aspect , rising from a lofty table-land , the approach to which is barred by a series of rugged and inaccessible islands , known as <NAME> , the coral-beds and treacherous currents about which must be carefully avoided .
0	Now , if we turn our efforts in that direction , we ought to arrive , with the progress on science , at ten times the weight of the shot of <NAME> .
0	there are only strangers here , ” said the young mulatto , clapping her hands .
0	He recognized afterwards that the <NAME> only formed an <NAME> , but , nevertheless , his belief that a polar continent farther south exists , remained firm and unchanged . ''
0	`` Then what were you doing here ? ''
0	The vessel could get under weigh at once .
0	We are launched ; we have no obstacle before us , no stones in the way ; the road is open , more so than that of a ship battling with the sea ; more open than that of a balloon battling with the wind ; and if a ship can reach its destination , a balloon go where it pleases , why can not our projectile attain its end and aim ? ''
0	Destitute of the necessaries of life , without clothes , without efficient shelter from the almost perpetual severity of this glacial latitude , unarmed , and unlearned in any industrial art which would enable them to construct the more necessary utensils , they passed a miserable life , and could only exist with difficulty .
0	<NAME> will represent <NAME> or <NAME> ; the <NAME> , <NAME> or <NAME> ; while I , as <NAME> , the newly born goddess of <NAME> , floating gracefully over you both , extend my hands so , fondly patronizing the one , but grandly ordering off the other , to the regions of eternal night !
0	<NAME> was thrust forward by his guards to the foot of the terrace , and <NAME> said to him , “ You came to see our goings out and comings in , <NAME> spy .
0	Owing to the defective construction of the <NAME> , however , unusual precautions became necessary in unfavourable weather ; but the loss of time which resulted from this cause , while it nearly drove Passepartout out of his senses , did not seem to affect his master in the least .
0	He had been to the <NAME> , to <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , and had succeeded in finding an important point on the western coast of <NAME> , where the establishment of a <NAME> colony seemed to him easy , and its prosperity certain .
0	The half-breed had , in fact , reached the boat and raised himself alongside half out of the water .
0	The most abrupt declivity of these mountains confronts the <NAME> coast , but the western slopes are merely inclined planes .
0	The oyster-bed among the rocks was frequently renewed , and furnished excellent molluscs .
0	With this fecula was mingled a mucilaginous juice of disagreeable flavour , but which it would be easy to get rid of by pressure .
0	“ Are you sure , <NAME> ? ” said <NAME> .
0	The monster did exist , and he had sworn to rid the seas of it .
0	There is wood in the forest , and eggs in nests ; we have only to find a house. ” “ Very well , ” returned <NAME> , “ I will look for a cave among the rocks , and I shall be sure to discover some hole into which we can creep. ” “ All right , ” said <NAME> ; “ go on , my boy. ” They both walked to the foot of the enormous wall over the beach , far from which the tide had now retreated ; but instead of going towards the north , they went southward .
0	When night fell , the shore was illuminated by a thousand fires , to which the crew responded by throwing rockets .
0	He said to himself that he , <NAME> , was the principal cause of so many disasters , since his old companion , <NAME> , had but realised his own plans , and a feeling of horror took possession of him .
0	He wanted to know exactly how long the storm was going to last ; whereupon he was referred to the barometer , which seemed to have no intention of rising .
0	Then suddenly a faint rim of the solar orb reveals itself on the edge of the opposite sky .
0	But see , the curtain is going to rise. ” Alcide <NAME> spoke as if he had been at the <NAME> , and taking his glass from its case , he prepared , with the air of a connoisseur , “ to examine the first act of <NAME> ’ s company. ” A painful ceremony was to precede the sports .
0	The route followed in this first voyage having had no result towards the north , <NAME> would try another , and accordingly set sail on April 21st in the following year , and advanced between <NAME> and <NAME> ; but he could only follow for a certain distance the coast of that vast land , without being able to attain as high an elevation as he had wished .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> then drove their sticks underneath the animal , and by their united efforts managed without difficulty to turn it on its back .
0	`` Well , then , that probability will be enough for me , and since you offer me your services , get <NAME> to accept me as a passenger . ''
0	Their motto was ever `` onward ! ''
0	But the first thing to do , when the weather is so cold , is to build a snow-house . ''
0	“ We shall have hard work to get over , ” said <NAME> , looking at the chain of mountains , the outlines of which were fast fading away in the deepening darkness .
0	<NAME> endeavoured to find it , but , to his great regret , the illness on board the <NAME> shortened his cruise .
0	It was between three and four thousand feet high , but nowhere presented any very salient features .
0	He eagerly fastened the cord round his waist , stuck on his lamp , clasped the child to his breast with his left arm , and , keeping his right hand free to hold the knife , he gave the signal agreed on , to have the rope pulled up .
0	A strong buoy , strengthened by a couple of spars , was thrown into the ocean .
0	Forever deprived of the vivifying warmth of the sun , they were vapid and colorless .
0	<NAME> , armed with a gun , lightly crossed the ledge which sheltered them .
0	<NAME> found himself at the pole of cold , beyond the countries seen by his predecessors ; he consequently expected a terrible winter , on a ship lost amid the ice , with a turbulent crew .
0	The difficulties will not increase , for , on our way thither , we leave behind us the coldest spots on the globe .
0	Twelve hundred melting-troughs were simultaneously opened and twelve hundred fiery serpents crept toward the central well , unrolling their incandescent curves .
0	This method , stated roughly , was that followed by <NAME> , and , in our own day , by <NAME> and <NAME> , with extraordinary success . ''
0	But this peaceful condition of affairs did not last long .
0	How are we to know whither chance will carry us ?
0	It was the body of a sailor about thirty years old , in a perfect state of preservation ; he wore the usual dress of <NAME> sailors ; the doctor could not say how long he had been dead .
0	It was , of course , too early at this period for the critics to pass a decided opinion on the nature of the information furnished by our travellers .
0	Their turbans are not large , but are very high and flattened in front .
0	The old watchmaker was buried in the midst of the peaks of <NAME> .
0	I merely had the armoury , generally kept jealously closed , opened , and with a severe look I pointed to it with one hand , whilst with the other I motioned the savages to the canoes .
0	said <NAME> , who intended to fire after his companions .
0	He caught a glimpse of that mysterious gentleman once or twice ; but <NAME> usually confined himself to the cabin , where he kept <NAME> company , or , according to his inveterate habit , took a hand at whist .
0	I let the worthy fellow chatter as he pleased , without caring to answer him .
0	When their cargo was completed , they set sail .
0	J. P. When <NAME> had finished reading this article , <NAME> turned to the geographer and said , “ You see , <NAME> , there can be convicts in Australia. ” “ Escaped convicts , that is evident , ” replied <NAME> , “ but not regularly transported criminals .
0	Now the last storm had brought down a number of large birch trees , the bark of which would be perfectly suited for their purpose .
0	During the whole evening the bands of the Preobra-jensky and <NAME> regiments had played without cessation polkas , mazurkas , schottisches , and waltzes from among the choicest of their repertoires .
0	Let us have supper and then get some sleep. ” “ Supper by all means , ” said <NAME> , “ but no fire ; nothing but biscuit and dried meat .
0	returned <NAME> , with so piteous an emotion that the old man seemed to return to the world of the living .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> played together , while <NAME> had <NAME> for his partner .
0	Was not his sadness only the result of his seclusion ?
0	She waited -- <NAME> waited also .
0	If one or more malevolent beings were concealed in the coal-pit , and there concocted mischief , <NAME> surely could have warned them of it , yet she said nothing .
0	`` It would have blown once or twice since we have been looking at it . ''
0	I remarked that my uncle , the Professor , had a strong tendency to resume his old impatient character , and I could not but make a note of this disagreeable circumstance in my journal .
0	It roared ; it yelled ; it shrieked with glee as of demons let loose .
0	`` I say that , at the time I threw myself into the sea , I heard the men at the wheel say , ` The screw and the rudder are broken . '
0	“ Now , ” said <NAME> , “ take two guns , friend <NAME> -- one for yourself and one for <NAME> -- and both of you try to bring back some nice cuts of antelope-meat ; they will make us a good dinner. ” “ Off to the hunt ! ” exclaimed <NAME> , joyously .
0	The houses , built of fir-wood , blazed like torches -- a hundred and fifty flaming at once .
0	They had no news from <NAME> , but were not uneasy on that account .
0	He was unwilling to leave her while they were still on dangerous ground .
0	The colonists were desirous of reaching the plain upon which the superior cone of <NAME> had fallen , but the lava arrested their progress .
0	He took a dozen of the whale ’ s bones , cut them into six equal parts , and sharpened their ends .
0	In fact , quite the reverse .
0	The current was so rapid that the boat went at the rate of four or five miles an hour .
0	A negative shake of the head from the young man was the only reply .
0	Here , as in <NAME> , the doors were of basalt . ''
0	With a favorable wind she would certainly have made eleven knots an hour had not the high waves somewhat impeded her progress .
0	In 11 degrees 30 minutes he discovers land , which he imagines must be the commencement of <NAME> .
0	A hailstorm of extreme violence assailed the travelers , and obliged them to seek a shelter among the rocks .
0	In addition to the crew of 1460 , a reinforcement of 470 marines was added to the fleet .
0	what stress the worthy man had laid on the verb `` float ! ''
0	The flaring torches began to grow dim .
0	But no Satellite appeared and , what was worse , not the slightest sound indicated his presence .
0	<NAME> <NAME> would soon have jumped at it , and he would not have hesitated to do as I did , for nothing ’ s more natural than for one man to give himself up to save two others .
0	`` Yes , they are gaining ground gradually , '' said <NAME> ; `` it is evident that they are going to attack us . ''
0	cried <NAME> , twirling his glass in his despair .
0	“ Swear to me that nothing will make thee acknowledge who thou art , nor whither thou art going. ” “ I swear it. ” “ <NAME> , ” continued the <NAME> , giving the letter to the young courier , “ take this letter ; on it depends the safety of all <NAME> , and perhaps the life of my brother the <NAME> Duke. ” “ This letter shall be delivered to his Highness the <NAME> Duke. ” “ Then thou wilt pass whatever happens ? ” “ I shall pass , or they shall kill me. ” “ I want thee to live. ” “ I shall live , and I shall pass , ” answered <NAME> .
0	How they must have been startled by the wild cheers that suddenly rang around their ocean-prison !
0	We will see if it applies to our situation . ''
0	At <NAME> ’ s request , she had cheerfully consented to put several hundreds of thousands of dollars at the disposal of the <NAME> Practical Association , without even knowing what it was all about .
0	I should have thought an assassination would have better suited an assassin ’ s son ! ” “ Torres ! ” exclaimed <NAME> , “ defend yourself , or I will kill you like a mad dog ! ” “ Mad !
0	The <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> visited the posts , strengthened by their orders .
0	Thus the subscribers not only hear the news but see the occurrences .
0	In fact , these projectiles knocked his best metal plate to shivers .
0	Whether these excuses were true or not , <NAME> had to submit .
0	He avowed over and over again his intention of never quitting the nucleus of his comet .
0	It was the rainy season , “ _le tempo das aguas_ , ” as the <NAME> call it , a trying season to travelers , but useful to the inhabitants of the <NAME> , who lack trees and consequently water .
0	It was instantly answered by another voice , shriller , louder , quicker , more joyous and triumphant in tone , but slightly tinged with a foreign accent : `` King !
0	`` Besides , if our guesses are right , '' said <NAME> , `` it must be said that we start with a fair chance of success .
0	Looking carefully over the <NAME> and catching occasional glimpses of semi-circular formations and half domes , he concluded that the chain must have formerly been a succession of vast craters .
0	How could we both be deceived ?
0	As for the traces which <NAME> ought to have left of his passage through the wood , there was not a vestige of them visible : so they followed the barely perceptible paths along which <NAME> had tracked some enemy , and which the dense foliage darkly overshadowed .
0	The third arm , on the contrary , stretched right out in a horizontal position above the roaring waters , into which the lower leaves dipped .
0	The nearest of these millions of stars , whose rays can reach us , is <NAME> , that star in <NAME> which you observe near the zenith , and that is fifty thousand millions of leagues distant .
0	`` The famous Djezar-Pasha caused a bath to be erected above the principal spring .
0	The <NAME> was a vessel of one hundred and seventy tons , rigged as a brig , and carrying a screw and a steam-engine of one hundred and twenty horse-power .
0	<NAME> <NAME> thought for a brief space .
0	As night approached , the snow fell less plentifully , but it became intensely cold .
0	He must risk his life even to afford to all he might meet the proof of his want of sight .
0	These two chains are the only ones met with in this region of circles .
0	`` Well , no , we sha ' n't let -- '' The doctor had not finished the sentence before <NAME> , by a violent effort , sprang over the stream of lava and was out of their reach .
0	This explains why the islands discovered by the <NAME> -- <NAME> , <NAME> , & c. -- are much too near the <NAME> coast , and also the non-existence of the group called by the <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , which there is every reason to suppose was none other than the <NAME> archipelago , as <NAME> in <NAME> means `` table , '' and <NAME> compares the mountain called <NAME> to a plateau or table-land .
0	I owe you -- -- ” “ <NAME> ! ” answered <NAME> , “ you owe me nothing !
0	At the fifty-fifth , a loud cry was heard in the street , followed by applause , hurrahs , and some fierce growls .
0	The further he penetrated into the strait which separates <NAME> from the continent , the more the depth diminished .
0	He overwhelmed the captain , officers , and sailors , who could not help laughing at his impatience , with all sorts of questions .
0	Have you made this trip before ? ''
0	No coverings , no hammocks , no clothing , were found ; evidently the fire had destroyed all .
0	<NAME> was then very little known , its capital <NAME> , contained no less than 15,000 inhabitants .
0	But to what phenomenon do we owe this alteration in the needle ? ''
0	“ You are going away ? ” “ Yes , ” replied the <NAME> , understanding his gesture .
0	It was the <NAME> steamer , leaving for <NAME> at the appointed time .
0	An hour later , I met the innkeeper on the port , and told him what had occurred .
0	My article was warmly discussed , which procured it a high reputation .
0	The scheme seems tenable ; and I shall be ready to co-operate with you , to the best of my power , in putting it into execution. ” “ Only , remember , ” continued <NAME> , “ there are many chances to one against our success .

0	“ And you , <NAME> , ” resumed <NAME> enthusiastically , “ you will be still the governor of the island !
0	A few years later <NAME> d'Urville gave the name of <NAME> to the group .
0	The stay of the <NAME> at the <NAME> of <NAME> had not , however , been sufficiently long to allow <NAME> to investigate many subjects of much interest , but this omission was remedied by the polite readiness shown by some of the leading residents in supplying him with valuable papers on the agriculture of the island , its commerce , its financial position , the industrial pursuits , and the social condition of the people , the correct appreciation of which demanded a more careful and minute examination than a mere passing traveller could possibly give to them .
0	“ The writing is in a safe place , ” replied <NAME> , “ and you will not have it until your daughter has become my wife .
0	The `` Froöern '' had indeed been driven to a place forty miles from where <NAME> had taken up his winter quarters .
0	Proved as it was by the incident of the bullet , it was hereafter an unquestionable fact , and such a discovery could not but cause great uneasiness among the colonists .
0	A great part of the copper sheathing had been torn from the hull , which every day sank lower .
0	The names of the villages entered by the travellers , and the incidents of the journey through <NAME> , are of no special interest .
0	“ No , <NAME> , ” said the engineer , restraining his courageous servant .
0	“ To-morrow , ” resumed the doctor , “ we shall bury him in the <NAME> soil which he has besprinkled with his blood. ” During the rest of the night the body was watched , turn by turn , by the three travellers , and not a word disturbed the solemn silence .
0	<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> on one side , <NAME> and <NAME> on the other , going along by the palisade , surveyed the absolutely dark and deserted corral .
0	President <NAME> , the originator of the enterprise , was strongly encouraged in its feasibility by the astronomers of <NAME> , and took upon himself to provide all the means necessary to secure its success .
0	We do not imagine that any navigator had hitherto displayed such perseverance .
0	In 1585 we meet with him again as vice-admiral , under <NAME> ; in 1588 he distinguished himself against the <NAME> ; in 1590 he was with <NAME> 's fleet on the coast of <NAME> ; finally in a descent on the coast of <NAME> , he was so seriously wounded that he had only time to bring his squadron back to <NAME> before he died .
0	They saw few or no churches , but the prophet 's mansion , the court-house , and the arsenal , blue-brick houses with verandas and porches , surrounded by gardens bordered with acacias , palms , and locusts .
0	The engineer ’ s curiosity was excited to the highest pitch .
0	<NAME> is more dangerous in these desolate latitudes .
0	<NAME> <NAME> came to meet them , and , as a stranger , announced his name and rank .
0	`` Still , <NAME> , '' said the young sailor , `` I can tell you that there 's some one on board , some one who was spoken of in the letter in which <NAME> was offered the place of mate . ''
0	`` A man who was bound to you by no tie , <NAME> , and who , consequently , can not be accused of treachery . ''
0	“ How grand it is ! ” said he , “ and how infinite is the power of God even in its most terrible manifestations ! ” This overflow of blazing lava wrapped the sides of the mountain with a veritable drapery of flame ; the lower half of the balloon glowed redly in the upper night ; a torrid heat ascended to the car , and Dr. <NAME> made all possible haste to escape from this perilous situation .
0	I did honour to the repast .
0	How had <NAME> & Co. been able to build their foundries and collect their staff ?
0	I showed these stones to several inhabitants of <NAME> , who have assured me that there exists an entire mountain of them . ''
0	Now-a-days they are better known by the native name of <NAME> .
0	Naturally enough , we were all deeply impressed by the fearfulness of our position , which may be summed up in a few words .
0	‘ And beside , ’ said he , ‘ it must be so nasty ! ’ ‘ Oh , father , ’ said the savage , looking greedily at the missionary , ‘ say that <NAME> forbids it !
0	cried <NAME> as enthusiastically as his companions ; `` all 's not over yet by a long shot ! ''
0	it ’ s natural enough that they should be astonished , ” said the doctor .
0	He was clothed in a robe of sombre-coloured silk , and wore a velvet cap , very similar in shape to that of <NAME> mountaineers .
0	The only explanation which can be given , he says , seems to me to result from the experience known to all the world .
0	I became intoxicated with a sense of lofty sublimity , without thought of the abysses into which my daring was soon about to plunge me .
0	Sailors at the commencement of the century could not possibly foresee the radical changes which the introduction of this agent would produce .
0	The naval watches proved of great assistance upon this occasion , and justified the opinion entertained of them .
0	<NAME> ran forward , seized the paper , and read : -- `` Altam ... , <NAME> , December 13 , 1860 , longitude 12..° , latitude `` The <NAME> ? ''
0	`` I shall have been there three years , come <NAME> . ''
0	Evidently that was his trade , as they could plainly see from the way he set about repairing the forepart of the wagon .
0	Moreover , the narrative of the voyage was written not by <NAME> , but by a <NAME> named <NAME> .
0	When the high temperature of the oven had reduced it to a liquid , or rather a pasty state , <NAME> collected with the tube a quantity of the paste : he turned it about on a metal plate , previously arranged , so as to give it a form suitable for blowing , then he passed the tube to <NAME> , telling him to blow at the other extremity .
0	It was a canoe seventy feet long , five broad , and three deep ; the prow raised like that of a <NAME> gondola , and the whole hollowed out of a trunk of a kahikatea .
0	Then I understood it all .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> rushed towards the jaguar .
0	Some well-intentioned , but rather obstinate persons , could not at first comprehend how , if the moon displays invariably the same face to the earth during her revolution , she can describe one turn round herself .
0	I must say she has arrived very opportunely. ” “ Our boat ? ” murmured the engineer .
0	246 <NAME> , in the <NAME> .
0	`` And without the delay of a single day , '' added <NAME> .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> especially hoped to end their days there .
0	The needle remained steady , and might be trusted .
0	It is very likely that he would have declared himself ready to put up with any amount of discomfort to be able to gratify his love of investigation ; but all were far too disheartened and distressed to care to banter him upon the subject on which he was so sensitive .
0	There must have been a wreck , since there is a castaway .
0	“ No , sir ; I should much rather lay to and wait till daylight .
0	From this point , by following the right bank of the watercourse , they would arrive at the spurs of <NAME> , among which they would naturally seek a retreat , and they could not have been long in discovering the corral , then uninhabited .
0	The chief of police appeared on the threshold .
0	<NAME> <NAME> recovered his senses , and fell into his old comrade 's arms .
0	After a halt at <NAME> , on the coast of <NAME> , he resumed his voyage ; sighted the desert island of <NAME> of <NAME> , on the 26th March , and steered towards <NAME> , where he hoped to meet with the same friendly reception as <NAME> and <NAME> had done before him .
0	As to the damage caused by the storm in the forest , that could not as yet be ascertained ; they would have to wait till the snowy covering was dissipated .
0	Leaving <NAME> on the 15th of September , 1763 , he rested at <NAME> 's <NAME> , on the coast of <NAME> , and at <NAME> , where he took horses and cattle , and landed at the <NAME> in a large bay , which appeared to him wholly suited to his purpose , but he was not long in discovering that what had been taken by preceding navigators for woods of moderate height , were only reeds .
0	His works do not , however , bear upon geography or political economy , but treat only of inscriptions , coins , manuscripts , and literature -- in a word , of everything connected with the intellectual and material history of the country .
0	MY uncle was walking about the bottom of the crater like a wild beast in a cage .
0	The curtains are made of reindeer-skins , sewn into the shape of a bell .
0	One stole a sailor 's waistcoat , another put out his hand for the quarter-master 's cocked hat , but not knowing how to deal with it , pulled it towards him , instead of lifting it up , which gave the quarter-master an opportunity of interfering with his intention .
0	`` Ever since we have been at <NAME> , my mind has been almost solely occupied with the grave question which has been submitted to me by yourself -- for nothing would be unwiser and more inconsistent than to act with imprudence . ''
0	Have the convicts appeared in the neighborhood ?
0	`` They measured no fewer than a thousand and ninety-five lunar mountains and crater summits with a perfect success .
0	`` See , <NAME> , '' said <NAME> bluntly , `` help us get breakfast ready .
0	And by the traitor ’ s suggestion , and in order that the event might be explained apart from him , as if by political hate , this small guard had been chosen from the little band of exiles .
0	If it is decreed that we die to-morrow , let us die bravely , like <NAME> men , ready to appear without terror before the <NAME> Judge .
0	“ Why , for my part , on the contrary , I should have taken special care to preserve megatheriums and pterodactyles , and all the antediluvian species of which we are unfortunately deprived by his neglect. ” “ And I say , ” returned <NAME> , “ that <NAME> did a very good thing when he abandoned them to their fate -- that is , if they lived in his day. ” “ And I say he did a very bad thing , ” retorted <NAME> , “ and he has justly merited the malediction of <NAME> to the end of time ! ” The rest of the party could not help laughing at hearing the two friends disputing over old Noah .
0	The work had begun immediately and carried on with indefatigable energy .
0	After some moments of silence , which not one of us dreamed of breaking , `` Gentlemen , '' said he , in a calm and penetrating voice , `` I speak <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> equally well .
0	He is brave ; he has the heart of a bull. ” “ The heart of a bull ! ” said <NAME> .
0	To the surprise of all , and especially of <NAME> , the line indicated a bottom at a nearly uniform depth of from four to five fathoms ; and although the sounding was persevered with continuously for more than two hours over a considerable area , the differences of level were insignificant , not corresponding in any degree to what would be expected over the site of a city that had been terraced like the seats of an amphitheater .
0	Soon the top of the sledge appeared , then the harnessed dogs , and then about thirty other animals , then great objects moving confusedly , and <NAME> leaping about with his head alternately rising and sinking in the frozen mist .
0	“ I account for it in this way , ” answered <NAME> : “ the earth was traveling at the rate of 28,000 leagues an hour , and <NAME> at the rate of 57,000 leagues an hour , therefore the result was the same as though a train rushing along at a speed of about 86,000 leagues an hour had suddenly encountered some obstacle .
0	<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> and I must examine her !
0	`` It is an impossible supposition , '' said the practical <NAME> ; `` unless that impulsive force had failed ; but even then its speed would diminish by degrees , and it would not have stopped suddenly . ''
0	Besides , the leaders of the expedition no longer acted in concert , so after repairing the largest of the vessels in the <NAME> , where <NAME> boasts of having sown the first orange-pips which were ever brought to <NAME> , the <NAME> set out for <NAME> in <NAME> , where they arrived on the 15th of November , after a cruise of seven months , not forty-five days , as M. Ferdinand <NAME> asserts in the <NAME> , and as M. Ed .
0	A quarter of an hour later he stopped before a large cabin , adorned with several clusters of streamers , the exterior walls of which were designed to represent , in violent colours and without perspective , a company of jugglers .
0	The old boatman crouched down forward among his men , solely occupied in keeping off the ice blocks , a maneuver which was performed without noise .
0	What wood should be employed ?
0	He thought his master gone beyond all prospect of return .
0	Only two yards remained to be raised from the surface .
0	It was the same with the “ cockyleeky , ” a cock stewed with leeks , which merited high praise .
0	_Venex a leur_ secours , ou ils sont <NAME> ! ” ( On the 27th of June , 1865 , the three-mast vessel <NAME> , of <NAME> , has foundered after a long <NAME> in the <NAME> , on the coast of <NAME> .
0	This material , which consists of the ramicles of a certain palm-tree growing very abundantly on the river banks , is in universal use in the district .
0	After looking for a site upon which to build a town , he laid the foundation of <NAME> in a spot at the mouth of a river which formed a harbour , and at a distance of thirty miles east from <NAME> .
0	The passengers resumed their places in the cars .
0	Nails and pieces of iron were much sought after by these people , whom <NAME> likens to the natives of Noukha-Hiva .
0	<NAME> , because the overturned block , having slid by degrees , had found a resting-place on the lateral walls , which kept it in that position .
0	At the same instant the snow-house was shaken as if by an earthquake .
0	There is a reason for everything unaccountable which has happened here , and that reason I shall discover .
0	The pride of success soon dissipated our fatigue .
0	`` Well , Dr. Clawbonny , what do you think of that ? ''
0	`` I would not trust you , '' replied <NAME> .
0	They could hear the tempest raging in <NAME> , which would surely suffer from it .
0	`` Besides , '' continued the doctor , `` if the captain is on board he will know better than we what is to be done , and so much the better because we are perfectly ignorant ; for his singularly brief letter gives us no clew to the probable aim of the voyage . ''
0	if , as we supposed , <NAME> employed the <NAME> in works of vengeance .
0	Another consequence of the error of <NAME> must be noticed here , one which , according to <NAME> , changed the whole series of his discoveries .
0	<NAME> was there , and gave the benefit of his experience .
0	`` Not at present ; because the solar rays , beating directly upon our thermometer , would give , on the contrary , a very high temperature .
0	Though there was sufficient depth of water to allow a light craft to pass the bar , there was not enough for the “ Nautilus , ” whose draught of water was considerable .
0	<NAME> <NAME> replied that the honour would be his ; and the detective -- who was determined not to lose sight of him -- begged permission to accompany them in their walk about <NAME> -- a request which <NAME> readily granted .
0	exclaimed <NAME> , `` that this vessel will be difficult to get afloat again . ''
0	No other coast but the western coast of <NAME> could possibly , we thought , have been the scene of the shipwreck .
0	When they take observations , they turn their backs to the north , the reverse position to that which they occupy when they study a terrestrial map .
0	“ My friends , except from cold , we have nothing to fear .
0	As far as the eye could reach on the white plain behind , red trails were visible .
0	We must absolutely bring down some game to satisfy this cannibal , or else one of these fine mornings , master will find only pieces of his servant to serve him . ''
0	The noise redoubling , sometimes producing a continual shower , I soon understood the cause .
0	The mists , which are frequent , moisten the soil and make it especially favourable for the cultivation of corn and the vine .
0	It would be sufficient , I said , for five or six of us to reconnoitre further south for twelve or fifteen miles .
0	The air could not be renewed in the interior of the <NAME> .
0	Here a good anchorage was found .
0	Did he hope , by arousing the wrath and vengeance of <NAME> , to detach the sailing-master from his allegiance and induce him to become an accomplice in <NAME> 's own designs ?
0	<NAME> had actively assisted his father in the work , which was on the point of completion .
0	He acquitted his task with characteristic serenity , and invariably replied to the remonstrances of his fair companion , who was confused by his patience and generosity : `` It is in the interest of my journey -- a part of my programme . ''
0	That was a place which they were the first to set foot in .
0	`` Yes , dear <NAME> , '' he continued , `` that pointed arrow of yours has by no means missed its mark , but I ca n't deny that my faith is beginning to be what you call a little 'shaky ' in the existence of my friends the <NAME> .
0	He appeared in the streets of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> <NAME> and his companions , before returning to <NAME> , desired to ascertain the probable direction this inundation of lava was about to take .
0	Among these savages four Europeans were observed , who had a long time before deserted from the whale-ship _Rochester_ .
0	[ Illustration : `` This drifting floe was covered with white bears , crowded together . '' ]
0	At these words we leaped from our beds , and hurried to make our toilet .
0	Besides , the son of the old overman was there , waiting at the appointed rendezvous .
0	After dressing the unfortunate man 's wounds , I readjusted the bandages on his head , and turned to <NAME> .
0	The doctor reacted against the gloominess of the situation and retained all the coolness and self-possession of a disciplined heart .
0	“ Follow me , Kennedy. ” “ What do you wish , sir ? ” “ Let us alight .
0	`` Before beginning the work , let us examine the hull and see what the damage is , and whether it can be repaired .
0	to betray our colleagues and you ?
0	The layers of ice melted as if by enchantment ; and immediately , for economy 's sake , the gas was put out , the air apparatus alone consuming its usual quantity .
0	They saw his eyes wander over all the marvels of this saloon , lighted by the electric rays which fell from the arabesques of the luminous ceiling .
0	<NAME> could recognize perfectly its chief features .
0	Neb brought this piece of metal to his master , who was then occupied with his companions in the workshop of the <NAME> .
0	A grateful glance from <NAME> repaid <NAME> for the imprudence of her tongue .
0	It was not much , but it was very refreshing for a crew accustomed to little but salt meat .
0	Climbing down the crater , they went round the cone and reached their encampment of the previous night .
0	When <NAME> had in his cruel irony held the <NAME> letter before the eyes which he believed were destroyed , <NAME> had been able to read , and had read the letter which disclosed the odious plans of the traitor .
0	[ Illustration ] From this moment the land grew lower , whence the doctor concluded that it did not extend very far to the north .
0	But his good humour soon reconciled them to his appearance , and they became accustomed to look upon him without fear or displeasure .
0	Had the sealing-master been crushed to death in the narrow part of the hold where he was shut up ?
0	“ Excuse me , your majesty , ” stammered the chief of police , for that was really the idea suggested to him by his uneasy and suspicious mind .
0	But if it is justifiable to reproach <NAME> with having held cheaply the political rights of the <NAME> , it must be conceded that he manifested the most laudable solicitude for their spiritual well-being .
0	The prison was an old missionary convent , situated on the bank of one of the principal iguarapes of the town .
0	The whole city , high and low , the quays bordering the <NAME> , the ships lying in the basins , disgorged a crowd drunk with joy , gin , and whisky .
0	What was his dismay , when he found nothing left of the fortress but a few ashes !
0	<NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , will gradually be abandoned , as well as <NAME> and the lower parts of <NAME> .
0	`` Not in the very least . ''
0	I crept through the opening , which had already admitted my two companions .
0	The <NAME> disc struck the travellers as glittering with a splendor and purity of light that they had never witnessed before .
0	Before reaching it he had to cross the <NAME> , a tributary of the <NAME> , and to pass through Wow-wow , a district of <NAME> , the capital of which , also called Wow-wow , contained some 18,000 inhabitants .
0	Ten years later a captain of <NAME> , named <NAME> , born on the 21st of December , 1484 , conceived the project of establishing a colony in the northern part of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> with the resemblance of the language and habits of the Indians of these parts to those of the <NAME> , <NAME> was very soon persuaded that he was not far distant from that river , and made several excursions in order to approach it .
0	<NAME> <NAME> , seeing the clump of bamboos , cut a quantity , which he mingled with the other fuel .
0	`` But why , '' said <NAME> , `` should not these rays be simply spurs of mountains which reflect more vividly the light of the sun ? ''
0	The <NAME> Alps are of no great thickness , and the base is not more than eight miles wide .
0	But to what nation did she belong ?
0	“ No , my Lord , ” replied <NAME> .
0	<NAME> himself met with no better success in 1536 in the <NAME> ( Gulf of <NAME> ) .
0	Now , this wall is seamed with fissures and clefts which already allow the sulphureous gases generated in the interior of the volcano to escape . ''
0	I should have a violent attack of the cramp if I were not to have some sort of exercise .
0	cried at this moment one of the men at the forewheel , who was superintending the operation .
0	His manifestly evil designs called for the utmost vigilance on the part of <NAME> .
0	A whole ration was set aside for the four dogs which should draw it .
0	<NAME> was at the helm .
0	His crews , embittered and fatigued , caused him great uneasiness , and in his narrative of the voyage , this great man , superior though he were to all human weaknesses , and a being whom adverse fate could not humble , bemoans himself bitterly over this trial .
0	This confessor , prior of the monastery of <NAME> , was deep in the confidence of <NAME> and <NAME> ; but he did not approve of the projects of the <NAME> navigator , and he rendered him no service whatever with his royal penitent .
0	The somber region she had loved as a child , and in which her wedded life would be spent , was as dear to her as ever .
0	From this point the pass began to be difficult , and even dangerous .
0	Gum-trees growing here and there were covered with enormous ants ' nests , and soon deprived of gum by those insects .
0	Stretched on the benches , they inhaled with delight the slight breeze caused by the speed of the steamer .
0	“ Have you a father and mother ? ” said <NAME> .
0	<NAME> did not reply , but pointed upwards .
0	In a quarter of an hour he had obtained the following table : _a_ = 3 times _b_ = 4 -- _c_ = 3 -- _e_ = 9 -- _i_ = 4 -- _j_ = 8 -- _k_ = 9 -- _l_ = 9 -- _m_ = 9 -- _n_ = 9 -- _t_ = 8 -- Total ... 276 times .
0	You would not go down , on the steeples , '' said the unknown , with a chuckle .
0	To judge by his appearance this miserable being had no longer anything human about him , and yet Harding , as had the reporter already , observed in his look an indefinable trace of intelligence .

0	The calculated time of impact was 2 hours 47 minutes 35.6 seconds .
0	One of the boats which was towed behind the _Saint-Jean <NAME> was carried away by the waves .
0	`` Those are mountains of ice , the first we have met with .
0	The launch was unloaded ; <NAME> and <NAME> put the sledge together ; all its parts were in good condition .
0	I had no idea which side he would take .
0	It was from here that he organized his sledge and canoe expeditions ; he discovered <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
0	The doctor took his bearings , by means of lunar observations , and consulted the excellent map that he had with him for his guidance .
0	And then he had the curiosity to examine this flaw with a strong magnifier which he unscrewed from one of the telescopes .
0	He would no longer be looked upon as the rescuer of the sailing-master ; and the latter , learning that his brother -- Luckily , <NAME> and myself were the only two acquainted with the fact .
0	I cried ; `` what wood is it ? ''
0	Our navigation of the 'Passe des <NAME> ' had definitively settled the insular character of the whole of the district terminating in the 'Cape <NAME> ' of <NAME> .
0	`` Let me show you how thoroughly .
0	A quarter of an hour afterward <NAME> was on board the jangada .
0	May reflection and repentance bring him to a better mind ! ” But before <NAME> was transferred , <NAME> wished to do the honors of his rock to his friends .
0	The sea became gradually calmer .
0	It occurred to me then that <NAME> was the name of the captain of the <NAME> , an <NAME> ship ; but what of that ?
0	“ Yes , ” replied the old <NAME> calmly .
0	“ But how did they come to think so ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	“ Come , <NAME> , come , ” said <NAME> .
0	He was like a body without a soul .
0	In consequence , the attempts at finding a north-west passage were abandoned by the <NAME> for a somewhat long period .
0	answered <NAME> , without manifesting the slightest irritation .
0	“ What distance have we traversed to-day ? ” asked <NAME> , disposing of some alarming mouthfuls .
0	His business affairs could not afford a sufficient reason .
0	Down at the bottom of it all there is some appearance of truth ; and you see that they were right about the sources of the Nile. ” “ Nothing could be more correct , ” said <NAME> .
0	A few moments after , <NAME> pressed the young woman 's hand , and , having confided to her his precious carpet-bag , went off with the sergeant and his little squad .
0	Taking every possible difficulty into account , and allowing for the minutest precautions , the captain hoped that it would be completed before the close of the day .
0	Why should it sink into craters ?
0	The eastern horizon was gradually assuming a most stormy aspect .
0	This latter plan met with the approval of <NAME> , and a decision once come to , not a moment was wasted .
0	In the afternoon we sighted masses , islets they might be called , of ice , drifting slowly southward , but these were not yet of considerable extent or altitude .
0	A few lightning flashes were reflected in the water ; summer lightning , without thunder .
0	His imagination is a perfect volcano , and to make discoveries in the interests of geology he would sacrifice his life .
0	Let him prepare to receive us ! ” The clamor , the songs and demonstrations of all kinds increased twofold , and the whole immense ants ’ nest of black heads was again in motion .
0	The worthy magistrate recalled to his mind all the incidents of the incomprehensible performance .
0	On this day for several hours I used my pickaxe vigorously .
0	This incident reminded me that other animals more to be feared might haunt these obscure depths , against whose attacks my diving-dress would not protect me .
0	The important notice had been generally understood .
0	<NAME> was my servant , a true , devoted <NAME> boy , who had accompanied me in all my travels .
0	He was a much-esteemed physician at <NAME> .
0	Perhaps it was rapidly leaving the disc , so that it would soon quit the pure shadow .
0	but without offering any solution of them .
0	Strings of amulets , made of shells or cut stones , hung from one part to another .
0	The title of <NAME> was conferred on him , and an important command in the <NAME> was entrusted to him .
0	“ The ‘ Nautilus ’ is imprisoned in this grotto , the entrance of which is blocked up ; but , although egress is impossible , the vessel may at least sink in the abyss , and there bury my remains. ” The colonists listened reverently to the words of the dying man .
0	On the <NAME> men 's hearts never fail them .
0	He was said to be of <NAME> descent , but no trace of it was observable in his name , his character , or his appearance .
0	But at the moment when <NAME> and the sailor were preparing to leave <NAME> , the vessel suddenly altered her course , and stood directly for <NAME> .
0	The grief of <NAME> and his companions , who were all strongly attached to the intrepid Harding , can be better pictured than described .
0	Speechless with amazement , they stood still for some moments .
0	The <NAME> had never found a more picturesque and attractive country in any of their voyages .
0	The hope of acquiring wealth in this pursuit , and zeal for propagating their religion , have filled this extensive city with <NAME> .
0	The next morning at four o'clock I was awakened by the steward whom <NAME> had placed at my service .
0	The engineer , aided by his companions , including <NAME> , who was once more obliged to leave his boat , commenced the preliminary operations , the object of which was to rid the wool of that fat and oily substance with which it is impregnated , and which is called grease .
0	A few icebergs were visible in the distance , while some drifts and packs were still going east .
0	The luminous spores of the cryptograms shone in the darkness with intensity .
0	It shows _à priori_ that each letter is modified in virtue of the ciphers of the number and according to the place which it occupies. ” “ And why ? ” “ Because in no language will you find words with three consecutive repetitions of the letter _h. ” _ <NAME> was struck with the argument ; he thought about it , and , in short , had no reply to make .
0	As to the next two words , <NAME> and <NAME> , it is only <NAME> that has any meaning to us. ” “ But that is a valuable scrap of information , ” said <NAME> .
0	`` And it was here , you say , that it took place ? ''
0	<NAME> could go no farther , and old <NAME> felt ready to die .
0	<NAME> <NAME> raised its white peaks towards the sky ; the snow and mist exaggerated its size so that it appeared colossal ; the temperature remained a few degrees above the freezing-point ; cascades and cataracts appeared on the sides of the mountain ; avalanches kept falling with a roar like that of artillery .
0	Besides , we are six also. ” “ Well , well ! ” replied <NAME> , whom no reasoning could have convinced .
0	[ 2 ] The declination is the variation of the needle from the true meridian of a place .
0	The volcanic substances are no longer in a state of ebullition , they have caught fire , and we are undoubtedly menaced by an approaching eruption . ''
0	[ Illustration ] `` I suppose that when he left the shelter , the wind drove him into the crevasse , and that , being thickly clad , he could not swim to the surface .
0	It remained to select the men who should compose the party .
0	That evening the balloon halted about forty miles from <NAME> , and ahead of it , but in the distance , rose the two sharp cones of <NAME> .
0	The doctor made a sign to the old boatswain to keep silent .
0	One flake arose into the air under the form of vapor from some river in <NAME> , it helped make a cloud , and finally came here to be condensed ; it is not impossible that we who drink it may be quenching our thirst at the rivers of our own country . ''
0	`` But if the vegetable and animal productions of this country , '' says <NAME> , `` are similar to those of many others , its aspect can not be compared with them , and I doubt whether the deep valleys of the <NAME> and <NAME> offer so terrible , and at the same time so picturesque , a prospect .
0	The first words he uttered were : `` <NAME> , your orders ? ''
0	The presence of humanity , even of the lowest type , would have revealed itself in some form or other , by boundaries , by buildings , even by ruins .
0	<NAME> with his right hand signalled to the man at the wheel what direction he was to take , and with his left hand he indicated to <NAME> the orders for the engines .
0	In the rapid flash of the lantern , he had recognised his former accomplice , <NAME> , who could not have known him , as he must have thought <NAME> long since dead .
0	The flora will retreat towards the Equator at the same time as the fauna .
0	“ Do you think that you can hold one hundred and fifty pounds of ballast in your arms ? ” “ Ay , more than that ! ” “ No !
0	Give up just as we are on the verge of success ? ''
0	“ If a ball can do anything for you , you shall not have long to wait for it .
0	“ I should like you , therefore , ” continued the Major , “ before we actually start for <NAME> , to make one more examination of the documents .
0	Here they form a ring , surrounding a little inland lake , that communicates with the sea by means of gaps .
0	“ Pray , gentlemen , do not interrupt me , ” said the professor , authoritatively , as if _ex cathedra_ .
0	“ The torches will soon go out. ” “ Forward ! ” replied <NAME> .
0	my poor father ! ” cried <NAME> , throwing herself on her knees before <NAME> , who exclaimed in amazement : “ Your father ?
0	But in addition to this there were certain facts which were undeniable .
0	<NAME> took the best possible care of her .
0	`` Yes , '' said <NAME> , `` but his reserve does him honour , and it is right to respect the feeling which he has about his sad past . ''
0	Would you have acted differently , captain ? ” “ <NAME> , <NAME> , ” replied <NAME> .
0	<NAME> to the left , near the men 's side , is <NAME> , the <NAME> of <NAME> , into which , though it is rather small , and full of sunken rocks , she sometimes allows herself to wander , moody , and pouting , and not exactly knowing where she wants to go or what she wants to do .
0	<NAME> had thought , not perhaps without reason , that the handling of such formidable quantities of pyroxyle would , in all probability , involve a grave catastrophe ; and at any rate , that this immense mass of eminently inflammable matter would inevitably ignite when submitted to the pressure of the projectile .
0	The back one was intended for the provisions and luggage , and M. <NAME> ’ s portable kitchen .
0	I know he has had no appetite , because his words stick in his inside , and it would take a very clever devil to drag even one out of him . ''
0	`` No , but I have some quicksilver . ''
0	The steward stood behind her chair , and waited to clear away , but she saved him the trouble by appropriating the plate and napkin .
0	The chief hastened to claim his belongings , and to protest his innocence .
0	He could not land , as all the harbours were blocked up with ice , and he was obliged to make for <NAME> del Fuego .
0	The ship will be built in the stocks of <NAME> & Co. , who will arrange everything with you .
0	Fishes are , of course , unable to live in it , and those which descend through the <NAME> , the Weber , and other streams soon perish .
0	Thus they die in the open air ; and at the end of ten days they are in a forward state of decomposition .
0	Still , they could not doubt that they were nearing land .
0	“ Ah , this magnificent <NAME> language .
0	asked <NAME> , triumphantly , `` It would have enabled us to exchange telegrams with the <NAME> ! ''
0	The <NAME> just touched a rock , and stayed immovable , laying lightly to port side .
0	[ 5 ] [ Footnote 5 : The aim being to give up the slaves as property , it was a matter of indifference whether they were killed or set at liberty. -- _Trans._ ] Suspicious and crafty , cruel and vindictive , the Kaloches are neither better nor worse than the neighbouring tribes .
0	The captain , whose duty would have kept him on board to the last , had been the first to quit the ship .
0	It is a short time after his return to <NAME> that he falls into disgrace with his royal mistress , and after his release from prison , while he is confined to his princely mansion of <NAME> , he conceives the project of his voyage to <NAME> .
0	The steamer was very well arranged , and the passengers , according to their condition or resources , occupied three distinct classes on board .
0	The < i > <NAME> < /i > kept off the coast , steering to the westward .
0	`` Sir , '' replied the <NAME> , `` I am ready to do anything for the general safety . ''
0	The clocks had been stopped on board .
0	The inhabitants of this part of the country are well aware of this , and so take measures to guard against it .
0	The stakes , sharpened at their upper end and hardened by fire , had been fixed by means of cross-bars , and at regular distances props assured the solidity of the whole .
0	`` In half an hour we shall be certain about that , '' answered the reporter .
0	One of his assailants , in a spirit of self-devotion , attracted to himself the blows of <NAME> .
0	“ At any rate , since we must leave <NAME> for a long expedition , I think the ‘ Bonadventure ’ will be safer here during our absence , and we shall do best to leave her here until the island is rid of these blackguards. ” “ That is exactly my opinion , ” said the reporter .
0	However , we could distinguish each other at about twelve feet apart .
0	Nevertheless the vast hall presented a curious spectacle .
0	They prove that the moon 's formation , by means of cooling , is due to violent causes ; for while , under the pressure of internal fires the reliefs rise to considerable height , the depths withdraw far below the lunar level . ''
0	Both these alternatives were equally impossible , as in either case the caravan would have to travel among fanatic tribes .
0	As for his photographs , they were sold of all size , and his portrait taken in every imaginable posture .
0	He had either to inquire nor to rule ; he had not even to regulate a discussion nor to obtain a verdict , neither to apply the articles of the penal code nor to pronounce a sentence .
0	The charts and drawings relating to his last voyage were engraved at the expense of the government , and the proceeds of their sale divided among <NAME> 's family , and the heirs of <NAME> Clerke and <NAME> .
0	But the colonists were yet able to follow its descent through the waves .
0	it shan ’ t be said that a <NAME> officer can not cope with a piece of poetry .
0	`` Well , what do you think of that ? ''
0	`` Yes , <NAME> ; but , instead of being rolled from right to left , this olive turns from left to right . ''
0	<NAME> 's instructions were now to spend the winter in the exploration of the <NAME> .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> had gone shooting in the neighborhood , and brought back some feathered game , which was well received in the larder .
0	All cases of the <NAME> ?
0	<NAME> gives the following account of the interview : `` When we arrived we saw a large assembly of dukes and princes who had come from all parts with their attendants , who were on horseback in the neighbouring fields and on the hills .
0	Perhaps I was never to know who he was , from whence he came , or where he was going to , but I saw the man move , and apart from the _savant_ .
0	In a moment more , <NAME> and <NAME> were seated in the kibitka .
0	As to provisions , if they found them insufficient , his men might add to their rations the produce of their fishing or hunting .
0	After all , these Papuans are poor creatures , and I am unwilling that my visit to the island should cost the life of a single one of these wretches . ''
0	<NAME> <NAME> went himself to cut from the trunk of a species of black willow , a few pieces of bark ; he brought them back to <NAME> , and reduced them to a powder , which was administered that same evening to <NAME> .
0	I estimated its value at L500,000 at least .
0	The `` kiwi '' is about the size of a small turkey , and , like the ostrich , has not the power of flying .
0	He had , at least , one resource , -- to call on the <NAME> and <NAME> consuls at <NAME> for assistance .
0	As to <NAME> and <NAME> , they shoved off in the boat , and prepared to cross the channel and to take up two separate stations on the islet .
0	So <NAME> , cold and resolute , <NAME> , with wrath in his eyes , and two or three of his companions , such as he could induce to accompany him , walked towards <NAME> .
0	“ If the clay dries , it will make our task still more difficult. ” “ Let us be quick , then , ” replied <NAME> .
0	At a sign from the chief of the police <NAME> and <NAME> were taken away .
0	No <NAME> power had thought of taking possession of this archipelago , which commands the whole <NAME> .
0	Sometimes profound obscurity thickened around him , and then he could see nothing , so feeble was the light ; but this was a purely passing phenomenon , and due to the raft , which , floating above his head , intercepted the solar rays and made the night replace the day .
0	`` He breathes though , '' said <NAME> , putting his ear to the chest of the wounded man .
0	That was where our picks tore out the last bit of coal in the seam .
0	We might -- we will try -- but no !
0	The pennant hung motionless from the maintop-gallant- mast truck .
0	`` He appears young , and will be easy to educate , and we shall not be obliged to use force to subdue him , nor draw his teeth , as is sometimes done .
0	`` We were thus enabled , '' says D'Urville , `` to gaze at our leisure upon the wonderful spectacle spread out before our eyes .
0	The wind grew decidedly calmer , and happily the sea fell with it .
0	No boat had put off from the island , nor had a native shown himself upon the beach .
0	The fierce and ambitious Feofar now governed this corner of Tartary .
0	To give these poor Indians an adequate idea of his power , <NAME> called out his soldiers , and put them through their drill , he also ordered the discharge of some pieces of artillery , the noise of which froze the hearts of the savages with terror .
0	What recollections of the past these names brought back to him !
0	`` What are you doing here ? ''
0	Lieutenant Procope , who had sedulously inserted the outline of the newly revealed shore upon the maps , announced that it had ceased to run east and west , and had taken a turn due north , thus forming a barrier to their continuing their previous direction .
0	they can ’ t be made like us , eh ? ” “ But they ARE just like us , Jack. ” “ Oh , no !
0	The <NAME> de <NAME> had the frigate _Aurora_ built at his own cost for this experiment .
0	The frigates were so placed as to protect the boats as they neared the land , in the event of any attack by the savages , for our recollection of the treachery of the natives of the islands south of the <NAME> made us distrustful . ''
0	Herds of agile gazelles were seen skipping about , their curling horns mingling with the tall herbage , within which the alligator , half concealed , lay silently in wait for them with watchful eyes .
0	All we can state positively at present regarding this wonderful formation , is what I have just recorded in my note-book : the <NAME> of the <NAME> is about 5 mile wide and 70 or 80 long : it is remarkably flat and free from _debris_ , though the mountains on each side rise like walls to the height of at least 10,000 feet. -- Over the whole surface of our Earth I know of no natural phenomenon that can be at all compared with it . ''
0	<NAME> <NAME> seemed to be rather more grave than usual , and it may be acknowledged that his gravity was justified by the circumstances .
0	What he effected in this direction we shall ascertain by following him step by step .
0	This was soon determined by taking the position of the ship , and it was found that she had scarcely deviated two degrees from the route .
0	Arrived at the headquarters of the <NAME> , as most of the kings of this part of <NAME> are called , the expedition was detained for a long time , and only obtained permission to depart on payment of a large sum .
0	The remainder was left with the wagon and the tent .
0	<NAME> here rose , and her presence , which inspired <NAME> with despair , imparted some courage to <NAME> .
0	They readily recognized the amiable <NAME> , but they could not allure the shivering , whining animal from her retreat without a good deal of coaxing .
0	A great crowd was collected in <NAME> and the neighbouring streets on Saturday evening ; it seemed like a multitude of brokers permanently established around the <NAME> .
0	After pondering one day , he said : “ It seems to me , captain , that you have turned into <NAME> , and that I am your man Friday .
0	He remained there a year , devoting himself to the practical study of the <NAME> tongue , making extracts from <NAME> historians and geographers , verifying the astronomical position of <NAME> , prosecuting his investigations into natural history , collecting manuscripts , and translating many of those popular songs and legends which are such valuable aids to the knowledge of a nation .
0	Arriving there on the 5th of July in such gloomy , rainy weather , that it was with no small difficulty that the entrance of the harbour of <NAME> , where D'Entrecasteaux made a stay of eight days , was made out ; whilst there the travellers received several visits from the score of natives , who seem to make up the total population of the place .
0	The walls , which were of cut marble , are entirely crumbled away , but their length over three quarters of a league , is still discernible .
0	The last ranks of the herd were now passing over the rails , while the first had already disappeared below the southern horizon .
0	<NAME> <NAME> ventured to go out with his gun in search of some game .
0	`` That is all very well , my friends , '' said the president , `` but the insoluble question still remains .
0	You and your companions will not , perhaps , have so much to complain of in the chance which has bound you to my fate .
0	Suddenly , without being able to account for it , he smelt an odour of boiling fat .
0	As to <NAME> , he was roaming about the shore .
0	The keel , of good oak , measured 110 feet in length , this allowing a width of five-and-twenty feet to the midship beam .
0	Many had chilblains on the hands and feet .
0	At his shout two or three pirates awoke , jumped up , and , rushing on <NAME> , endeavored to throw him down .
0	`` Yet from such a death you would suffer no more than your friends the Selenites are exposed to every day of their lives , '' said the <NAME> , evidently determined on getting up an argument .
0	This was said in a tone which quenched <NAME> 's last hope .
0	They raised such a whirlwind of water in their course that it was impossible to distinguish them clearly .
0	Since the rise of the great fisheries , this <NAME> has been frequented by numerous whalemen , who here find a safe port at all seasons , plenty of wood and water , turtles for six months of the year , fish , and immense quantities of anti-scorbutic plants , including the delicious savoy cabbage .
0	`` <NAME> has no other pleasure than that of the palate , and I am only too glad to be able to reward his services in this way ! ''
0	What voluptuousness to float amid this radiant ether , to bathe oneself in it , to wrap oneself in the sun 's pure rays .
0	Here the voyage of the giant raft , so tragically interrupted , had just come to a pause in the midst of its long journey , and here will be unfolded the further vicissitudes of the mysterious history of the fazender of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> looked at his companions one after the other .
0	The pirates had evidently destroyed everything that concerned either the captain or the owners of the <NAME> , and , as the name of her port was not painted on her counter , there was nothing which would tell them her nationality .
0	No part of the windows appeared over the water , but the trap hole had been thrown open , and through it came the pole that bore the <NAME> flag .
0	“ Meanwhile , the ‘ <NAME> ’ had been sent to <NAME> for repairs .
0	“ Good for that ! ” said the excited hunter ; “ we ’ ll fight him .
0	By this time , however , an important dispatch was flying east , bearing four different addresses : To the Secretary of the <NAME> , <NAME> ; To <NAME> , Vice-President _pro tem._ , <NAME> , <NAME> ; To J.T .
0	My uncle , on the other hand , considered the event of sublime importance .
0	This archipelago was discovered by <NAME> , an <NAME> , and <NAME> , an Englishman , jointly , in 1821-22 .
0	Here is the book I use daily , to practice myself in the difficulties of the <NAME> language .
0	But this state of things was before long to come to an end .
0	Since it was your intention to live alone , why did you throw into the sea the document which put us on your track ? ” “ A document ? ” repeated <NAME> , who did not appear to know what he meant .
0	Harding also reminded his companions of the singular behavior of <NAME> and Jup when they prowled round the mouth of the well , which placed <NAME> in communication with the sea , and he told them that he had explored the well , without discovering anything suspicious .
0	The unfortunate <NAME> had caught hold of the cord of the loaded gun .
0	<NAME> <NAME> had the clay watered to loosen it , but it was of no use .
0	On the seventh day of the month he caused a solemn mass to be celebrated on the shore : during the service an old cacique arrived , who , the ceremony being over , offered the admiral some fruits , and then this native sovereign pronounced some words which the interpreters thus translated : -- `` It hath been told us after what manner thou hast invested and enveloped with thy power these lands , which were to you unknown , and how thy presence has caused great terror to the people and the inhabitants .
0	Most probably he was standing bravely at his post on the <NAME> , his eye glued to the great <NAME> , his whole soul peering through its tube .
0	`` The valves are not sufficiently charged ! ''
0	`` Yes and no ; for the Governor has promised to help me . ''
0	The whole country groaned under the yoke of the <NAME> , who were descendants of the commander of the <NAME> , and paid only a small annual tribute to <NAME> , which , however , was sufficient to serve as a pretext for oppressing the unfortunate fellaheen .
0	“ I thought I was gone , ” said he , “ and as you came right into my mind , I made a hard fight for it .
0	<NAME> <NAME> climbed the slopes , supported , not to say carried , by <NAME> , and <NAME> leaned on the arm of <NAME> ; <NAME> , radiant with joy , triumphant at his success , led the march , and the two sailors brought up the rear .
0	The whole of the coast-line of <NAME> was now accurately laid down , but at the cost of what struggles , devotion , privations , and sufferings ?
0	<NAME> and creepers were uninjured , and they had even to cut them away with the axe , as they had done in the deepest recesses of the forest .
0	He must by this time have given me up !
0	We disembarked on a stony coast .
0	Under the names of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and other titles besides , it traverses an immense extent of country , and almost competes in length with the Nile .
0	On the 16th of June the jangada , after fortunately clearing several shallows in approaching the banks , arrived near the large island of <NAME> , and the following evening she stopped at the village of <NAME> , which is situated on the left side of the <NAME> .
0	Thus it may be that , contemporary with the later geological epochs , they are due to the expansion of natural forces .
0	<NAME> tried to stop its course .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> conformed strictly with the recommendation about the health of the crew ; they all looked hardy and possessed enough animal heat to run the engines of the <NAME> ; their elastic limbs , their clear and ruddy skin , showed that they were fit to encounter intense cold .
0	Thus , highly excited , <NAME> 's moral energy triumphed over physical weakness , and he rose to his feet .
0	One would love her as the sweetest realization of a poet 's dream .
0	292 Eucalyptus forest of <NAME> .
0	asked M'Nicholl and <NAME> in some astonishment .
0	Like the immense majority of his fellow beings , he had looked at the <NAME> , heard her talked of , written poetry about her , but , in the strict sense of the term , he had probably never seen her -- that is -- scanned her , examined her , surveyed her , inspected her , reconnoitred her -- even with an opera glass !
0	The direction of the route was determined by the mariner 's needle or compass .
0	A few horses were also killed which had relapsed into a wild state since the departure of the colony founded by <NAME> .
0	Use me like a staff. ” “ A good solid staff , <NAME> , ” answered <NAME> .
0	`` Come , a good long day , your Honor !
0	It is fifty-five minutes past ten ; we have been gone about eight minutes ; and if our initiatory speed has not been checked by the friction , six seconds would be enough for us to pass through the forty miles of atmosphere which surrounds the globe . ''
0	And that was generally felt .
0	J. T. <NAME> was requested to appear before the <NAME> .
0	`` They will keep them at the hotel . ''
0	<NAME> was found in large quantities in the houses , made up into the form of tents , one of these containing as much as 11,000 pounds of the material .
0	The wound bled profusely , but <NAME> could use his fingers and forearm ; and consequently there was no occasion for any uneasiness about the issue .
0	<NAME> lovingly watched its flight , when he heard these words pronounced by a voice full of emotion : `` You are indeed a brave man . ''
0	Was he weary of this return to a civilized mode of existence ?
0	Soldiers , armed with bows and arrows , were drawn up in line of battle ; but by this time the balloon was expanding , and rising quietly beyond their reach .
0	The small <NAME> establishment , <NAME> or <NAME> , suited him perfectly , all the more that provisions were easily obtained there .
0	Once , in action , he was leading a detachment of infantry through an intrenchment .
0	This was my one idea .
0	<NAME> , uneasy at the projects formed by <NAME> with a view of attacking her possessions in <NAME> , and at the offers of alliance made by him through <NAME> to the <NAME> of <NAME> , resolved to send an embassy to the court of <NAME> , hoping to gain the king over to the interests of the <NAME> Company .
0	`` For you have shown what stuff you are made of , and I know all you 've done .
0	<NAME> as I had been to the steam ferry boats of the <NAME> , I found the long oars of the boatmen but sorry means of locomotion .
0	“ This man , whom I received with hospitality , only came to me to propose that I should purchase his silence to offer me an odious bargain that I shall never regret having refused , whatever may be the consequences of his denunciation ! ” “ Always this method ! ” thought Judge <NAME> ; “ accusing others to clear himself. ” But he none the less listened with extreme attention to <NAME> ’ s recital of his relations with the adventurer up to the moment when <NAME> let him know that he knew and could reveal the name of the true author of the crime of <NAME> .
0	`` No , '' answered <NAME> ; `` it is an avalanche detached from a lunar mountain . ''
0	A bend of the cliff prevented them from being seen by those in the brig ; but two or three reports , and the crash of bullets on the rock , told them that the <NAME> was at no great distance .
0	`` This is what <NAME> feared , '' murmured <NAME> , changing countenance .
0	<NAME> <NAME> and the sailor were not men to draw back , but they knew that any imprudence on their part , of which they would be the first victims , would fall afterwards on their companions .
0	Well , at the rate of two hundred and forty miles every twelve hours , which does not come near the rapidity of our railroad trains , by travelling day and night , it would take only seven days to cross <NAME> ! ” “ But then you could see nothing , make no geographical observations , or reconnoitre the face of the country. ” “ Ah ! ” replied the doctor , “ if I am master of my balloon -- if I can ascend and descend at will , I shall stop when I please , especially when too violent currents of air threaten to carry me out of my way with them. ” “ And you will encounter such , ” said <NAME> .
0	`` You have a good stock of names for them anyhow , '' observed <NAME> , `` if that does any good . ''
0	Who could tell whether a fratricidal struggle might not ensue ?
0	“ Would you believe it that there is not a chart on board ? ” “ Is that so ? ” “ It is indeed .
0	In a few days the schooner would reach <NAME> d'Acunha , and I should part with her and her captain for good and all .
0	The Professor , who was looking on , held his chronometer in his hand .
0	I have always fancied that the end of the earth will be when some enormous boiler , heated to three thousand millions of atmospheric pressure , shall explode and blow up our Globe ! ” “ And I add that the <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ will not have been the last to work at the machine ! ” “ In fact , ” assented the doctor , “ they are great boiler-makers !
0	<NAME> begged him to tell them all again .
0	`` Yes , I have no doubt of that , friend <NAME> , '' pursued <NAME> ; `` but to see the eclipse it would not be necessary to quit the dark hemisphere altogether .
0	`` With the <NAME> apparatus , M. Aronnax ; one is carried on the back , the other is fastened to the waist .
0	Passepartout rushed out of the car .
0	No more crescent , no more cloudy light !
0	It is represented in the cryptogram by this queer succession of letters , _ncuvktygc_ .
0	Without expecting game , some useful plant might be met with , and the young naturalist was delighted with discovering a sort of wild spinach , belonging to the order of chenopodiaceae , and numerous specimens of cruciferae , belonging to the cabbage tribe , which it would certainly be possible to cultivate by transplanting .
0	The doctor , when he saw all the signs of winter 's approach , became very uneasy ; he knew the difficulties <NAME> had found in getting to <NAME> 's <NAME> , after leaving his ship ; and indeed , having once tried to pass the ice , he was obliged to return to his ship , and go into winter-quarters for the fourth year ; but he had at least a shelter against the weather , food , and fuel .
0	<NAME> , now perceiving that the projectile was steadily approaching the lunar disc , did not despair ; if not of reaching her , at least of discovering the secrets of her configuration .
0	He believed he could bear removal to <NAME> .
0	As soon as he had obtained satisfaction the captain started for <NAME> with <NAME> who was to settle on that island .
0	The colonists waited , therefore , for <NAME> to appear on Prospect Heights .
0	She was a pretty <NAME> girl , with some <NAME> blood in her veins .
0	That he did not find it is not very wonderful , as during the last eight years many ships have passed over the spot assigned to it upon the maps .
0	`` I see a vast lake black as pitch and round as a crater ; it is surrounded by such lofty mountains that their shadows reach clear across , rendering the interior quite invisible ! ''
0	These might be safely recomputed without doing > violence to the spirit of the original work .
0	`` Seven hundred and seven miles from <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> , with imperturbable calmness .
0	But time marched on ; weeks went by like days , days like hours , hours like minutes .
0	I had taken my place with <NAME> in the saloon ; through the open window we could see the lower beds of the <NAME> .
0	`` You have found the castaway ? ''
0	Hence this immense river system is under the same climatic conditions during the whole of its course .
0	The khan has established a mint here for the benefit of trade , and it is an inexhaustible source of revenue to him .
0	I took a malicious delight in watching the thousand little cascades that flowed down the side of the cone , carrying with them at times a stream of stones into the `` vasty deep '' below .
0	That evening they halted early , unable to set one foot before the other , and , although their way was lighted by a brilliant aurora , they could not go on .
0	The lift once raised , this sure and comfortable retreat would be safe from any surprise .
0	At about half-past eleven the reservoirs were emptied , and our vessel rose to the surface of the ocean .
0	The crossing of <NAME> among hostile natives was terribly arduous .
0	But , I do n't know if I am right or not , there seems to be a sea breeze ! ''
0	About half past twelve o'clock , <NAME> broke the dead silence by saying that after a careful calculation they were now only about 875 miles from the <NAME> 's surface , a distance two hundred miles less in length than the lunar radius , and which was still to be diminished as they advanced further north .
0	Can there be a doubt from their shape that the bite is the bite of a crocodile ?
0	The study of natural history , the publication of his diary , and his correspondence , occupied him until 1817 , at which time he expected to go with a caravan to <NAME> .
0	It had been decided that a military fete should mark the inauguration of the <NAME> headquarters in this important city .
0	Certainly if <NAME> had any important matter to communicate to his master he could not employ a more sure or more rapid messenger , who could pass where neither the colonists could , nor even Top himself .
0	That is the substance of what I told <NAME> .
0	But at this time , during a storm , the flagship became separated from the fleet , and although search was made several times , no tidings of her were obtained .
0	In a few days , sundry indications of an island or a continent appeared , such as floating weeds , land-birds , & c. On the 5th of October the colour of the sea changed , and on the morning of the 6th , a coast running west by north-west was perceived .
0	<NAME> , he 's a wise fellow is <NAME> . ''
0	They consisted principally of casuarinas and eucalypti , some of which next year would yield a sweet manna , similar to the manna of the <NAME> .
0	His attitude could only signify one of two things -- either my proposal had been communicated to him , and he did not intend to accede to it ; or neither Hurliguerly nor <NAME> had spoken to him since the previous day .
0	“ Humph ! ” said <NAME> , “ these pirates !
0	As with the first line so did he with the second , and the third , and the fourth , until he reached the end of the paragraph .
0	Now , at any rate , it is well to go on towards the north .
0	His face , usually so stolid , showed that something disturbed him .
0	<NAME> here ; look there ! ” And as <NAME> spoke , he pointed to some scythes , and sickles , and other implements of husbandry that had been left upon the ground .
0	`` Which is the highest in the lot ? ''
0	`` But these travellers must have been imprudent , '' said I to <NAME> .
0	On the next day , therefore , by means of the sextant , the engineer made the necessary observations to verify the position which he had already obtained , and this was the result of his operation .
0	[ Illustration ] During that day the <NAME> made easy progress through the loose ice ; the breeze was in a good quarter , but the temperature was very low ; the wind coming across the ice-fields was thoroughly chilled .
0	I looked at the last rays crowning the peak , and the shadows mounting by degrees up its slopes .
0	The <NAME> soldiers were almost immediately under arms .
0	I have none ! ” “ You are in the midst of friends. ” “ Friends ! -- for me !
0	We will now put on our dresses , and begin our walk . ''
0	`` No , '' said <NAME> , `` let us stretch ourselves on our sides ; we shall resist the shock better that way .
0	There was a very steep winding path on the left , which the mules never would have attempted .
0	On the sidewalks , tables had been laid , often miles and miles long , at the public expense ; these were to be covered with every kind of eatables , exquisitely cooked , in the greatest profusion , and free to everyone for twelve hours before the arrival of the illustrious guests and also for twelve hours after their departure .
0	I must say this for my uncle , that he stuck as close to me as possible .
0	`` You are right , <NAME> , '' answered <NAME> ; `` you are always thinking of the fuel . ''
0	he kept saying to himself ; `` what ship is that ?
0	He showed it by an observation natural enough , for that matter , to a mind unaccustomed to long stretches of careful thought : `` This darkness is absolutely killing !
0	I hastened to dress myself , and my companions followed my example .
0	In <NAME> 's rooms at <NAME> the commander was shown , together with a number of weapons , shells , animals , fish , & c. , a complete mummy of a <NAME> , said to be that of a woman .
0	`` Their food is chiefly shell-fish .
0	`` We obey your orders , <NAME> . ''
0	It was evident that the natives had meditated treason .
0	<NAME> ’ s life hung on a thread , and this thread might break at any moment .
0	When they did happen to venture out of the region of facts , they never went so far as to attempt to divine the intentions of the <NAME> government , or even to criticize them .
0	The moon , now in her last quarter , had not yet risen .
0	They had removed all difficulties .
0	No atmosphere here interposed its layers of humidity or of unequal density to interrupt the stately majesty of their effulgence .
0	It must first be invented , then made .
0	| In very | In | In cloth | | handsome | plainer | binding , | <NAME> .
0	After nearly perishing for want of water , they would , at last , have to starve to death !
0	In the children the upper jaw projects , but in adults it is about even with the lower .
0	In others , obstructed by rocks , there was only a narrow path , in which two persons could not walk abreast .
0	Miners , though belonging to different pits , often met , when going to or returning from their work .
0	Da <NAME> had already taken on board 1000 hundredweights of pepper , 50 of ginger , and 450 of cinnamon , when he received warning that a considerable fleet , coming apparently from <NAME> , was advancing with hostile intentions .
0	There were also some panopyres , slightly luminous ; and lastly , some oculines , like magnificent fans , forming one of the richest vegetations of these seas .
0	The workmen of Quiquendone are as efficient as those of any other town in the world , you must know ; and we shall go neither to <NAME> nor <NAME> for our models !
0	<NAME> , old dog ! ” The magnificent animal bounded barking to his master , and caresses were lavished on him .
0	When <NAME> and myself met on the quay , we took no notice of each other ; nevertheless , I fancied there was some hesitation in his manner ; as though he would have liked to speak to me .
0	<NAME> <NAME> gave orders for the lowering of the ship 's largest boat , in a voice which betrayed his impatience .
0	At the second of these fêtes , on the first day of the year , the whole population , men and women alike , appeared dressed in white , following the tradition that white brings good fortune , and every one brought gifts to the king of great value .
0	<NAME> ’ s first concern was the wagon ; this was the main thing in his eyes .
0	The island was from eight to ten miles in circumference , no more ; and , according to their calculation , it was very near the Pole , if indeed the axis of the world did not pass exactly through it .
0	Indeed , it was produced in vacuo , which insured both its steadiness and its intensity .
0	the moon ’ s come back ! ” And , sure enough , what was apparently the moon was rising above the mists of evening .
0	Now , there is nothing of the kind , and it was found in a perfect state of preservation . ''
0	It was so important for the <NAME> government to proceed rapidly to reconnoitre the vast territories between the <NAME> and the <NAME> , that another expedition was speedily sent out .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> skinned them , and only brought back to <NAME> their fat and skin , this skin being intended for the manufacture of boots .
0	His brother <NAME> , who had acted as his secretary , published a brief narrative of the journey , containing several curious details respecting the antiquities of <NAME> , which have been , however , largely supplemented by works brought out by Englishmen .
0	The settlers , having become potters , made nothing but pottery .
0	`` My friend , '' said <NAME> in a firmer voice , `` look at me , I wish it ! ''
0	But the dog continued to bark more furiously than ever .
0	He thought of the lad standing there , and of his companions and those left behind , whom he loved so dearly .
0	To-morrow Captain Nemo might take us far from all land .
0	“ Considerable importance , ” replied the engineer ; “ for if it flows through the cliff there is probably some cavity , which it would be easy to render habitable after turning away the water. ” “ But is it not possible , captain , that the water flows away at the bottom of the lake , ” said <NAME> , “ and that it reaches the sea by some subterranean passage ? ” “ That might be , ” replied the engineer , “ and should it be so we shall be obliged to build our house ourselves , since nature has not done it for us. ” The colonists were about to begin to traverse the plateau to return to the <NAME> , when <NAME> gave new signs of agitation .
0	But at that moment a cry was heard , and a great orang , who had hidden himself in the passage , rushed into the room , pursued by <NAME> .
0	And who knows what will become of the survivor of us after a long solitude on this island ?
0	<NAME> ’ s arrangements were made , and on this evening a note fell from the top of the earthworks into <NAME> ’ s hands .
0	<NAME> came back , and stared at his companions .
0	At that moment , a noise was heard on the road , about half a verst distant .
0	Then the overmen of the different pits came forward to shake hands with him , whilst the miners waved their caps , shouting , “ Farewell , <NAME> , our master and our friend ! ” This farewell would leave a lasting remembrance in all these honest hearts .
0	During a fortnight they hunted a great deal ; fresh food was abundant ; they shot partridges , ptarmigans , and snow-birds , which were delicious eating .
0	`` Who does n't know all about him ? ''
0	“ The earth would have passed to the last bit into the furnaces of engines , machines , steamers , gas factories ; certainly , that would have been the end of our world one fine day ! ” “ There is no fear of that now , <NAME> .
0	four and a half little minutes ! ''
0	I am neither an orator nor a man of science , and I had no idea of addressing you in public ; but my friend <NAME> has told me that you would like to hear me , and I am quite at your service .
0	Entranced by the harmony , forgetful of the hour , <NAME> did not notice that it was growing dark .
0	It might be imagined that this realization of his true position would have led him to a better mind , and that , in some degree at least , he would have been induced to regard the few fellow-creatures with whom his lot had been so strangely cast , otherwise than as mere instruments to be turned to his own personal and pecuniary advantage ; but no -- the desire of gain was too thoroughly ingrained into his hard nature ever to be eradicated , and secure in his knowledge that he was under the protection of a <NAME> officer , who , except under the most urgent necessity , would not permit him to be molested in retaining his property , he determined to wait for some emergency to arise which should enable him to use his present situation for his own profit .
0	<NAME> with terror , the natives hastened to appease their terrible visitors by offering them all they possessed .
0	And <NAME> , swelling out his cheeks , blew so much and so well into the tube -- taking care to twirl it round at the same time -- that his breath dilated the glassy mass .
0	My office would be no longer a sinecure , and the council would be obliged to double my salary -- unless it should arrest me myself , for disturbing the public peace ! ''
0	Approaching the window , <NAME> saw with much surprise a sort of flattened bag floating in space and only a few yards off .
0	But the industry of these people was especially shown in the construction of their pirogues .
0	Then arrived <NAME> and the others .
0	<NAME> seemed to be vanquished by <NAME> 's coolness , for he quietly followed him , and they sat down aside from the rest of the passengers .
0	But desolate as the country appeared , <NAME> was on his guard against surprises , and gave orders to his party to form themselves in a close platoon .
0	They then , having eaten , returned to their post .
0	said my uncle , more exasperated than ever .
0	Was I to meet in these depths companions and friends of <NAME> Nemo whom he was going to visit , and who , like him , led this strange existence ?
0	Long before he had spoken his last words , they had once more become mute as statues , and now were both eagerly watching , pencil in hand , spyglass to eye , the northern lunar hemisphere towards which they were rapidly but indirectly approaching .
0	It was not even now quite dark , the light filtering down in a most extraordinary manner .
0	<NAME> <NAME> moved his arm again , then his head , and a few incomprehensible words escaped him .
0	My uncle played a regular accompaniment to my gestures and words .
0	If <NAME> 's <NAME> is closed , <NAME> is not , to the west of <NAME> 's <NAME> ; in my opinion , we ought to go up this sound as far as <NAME> , and thence to <NAME> .
0	It was not the engineer who had invented this way of causing loud explosions , for , according to <NAME> , the Tartars have employed it for many centuries to drive away from their encampments the formidable wild beasts of <NAME> .
0	It was the men of commerce who were the leaders in this movement , and who first undertook to cross the <NAME> .
0	Lights flitting to and fro in the <NAME> camp , showed that a considerable movement was taking place .
0	They were so well suited to this life , and were , besides , so accustomed to the island , that they could not have left its hospitable soil without regret !
0	<NAME> or forty passengers had already descended , amongst them <NAME> Proctor .
0	`` You know they are not there , as you have stolen them ! ''
0	But , each of the party , in his turn , vainly scanned the space around him during that long wearisome day .
0	[ Illustration : It was <NAME> . ]
0	They were therefore under the necessity of traveling six hundred miles before they could tread a free soil .
0	The following episode may suffice , in a certain degree , to illustrate his character .
0	`` Well , listen to this , <NAME> ; it results very clearly from geographical facts , and from the study of isothermal lines , that the coldest spot on the globe is not on the Pole itself ; like the magnetic pole , it lies a few degrees distant .
0	Several thousand <NAME> rushed to the assault of the earth-works .
0	But before proceeding to the narrative of the adventures of <NAME> and <NAME> , we will devote a small space to the record of the work done by the <NAME> naturalist , <NAME> .
0	If we are well informed , the point of departure for this surprising journey is to be the island of <NAME> , upon the eastern coast .
0	`` Sir , '' said I , `` no doubt you are ignorant of the discussions which have taken place concerning you in <NAME> and <NAME> .
0	[ Illustration ] `` They were never buried , '' cried the doctor ; `` these poor men were surprised by death as we find them . ''
0	“ There is no one here , ” said the reporter .
0	<NAME> is extinct. ” “ I am sadly afraid , however , ” continued the count , “ that an Englishman will be an Englishman ever. ” “ Yes , ” said the captain , “ that is always their failing. ” And thus all further thought of making their way again to the little garrison of <NAME> was abandoned .
0	He selected Yves-Joseph de <NAME> .
0	This would have been contrary to <NAME> ’ s instructions .
0	`` Each in turn , '' replied <NAME> .
0	<NAME> took measures to intercept them ; one escaped by rapid paddling , the other was caught , and although <NAME> assured the natives that the <NAME> came as friends , they seized their weapons , and commenced attacking them .
0	By a supreme instinct of self-preservation <NAME> uttered a cry .
0	The act of fidelity and homage was accompanied , as may be easily imagined , with presents both rich and numerous , as well as by a heavy tax which was levied without much difficulty .
0	`` And do you speak thus to _me_ ? ''
0	The distress of the commander can be imagined .
0	It was the most precious thing the geographer possessed .
0	But on the morning of the 24th of <NAME> ’ s arms were extended toward a point in the horizon ; he raised himself , at first on his knees , then upright , and his hand seemed to make a signal .
0	“ In 1854 the <NAME> , <NAME> , and his lieutenant , <NAME> , went in search of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> had become very skilful carpenters , and had nothing to do but to copy the models provided by the engineer .
0	Returning to <NAME> , <NAME> began to study <NAME> languages , and more especially the <NAME> , which at that time was known only through the imperfect works of <NAME> .
0	He came and worked near him , and occupied himself in different things , so as to fix his attention .
0	The bonds were quoted , no longer at a hundred below par , but at twenty , at ten , and at five ; and paralytic old <NAME> <NAME> bet even in his favour .
0	<NAME> skirted it until he reached <NAME> , where he landed with the armed detachments of the <NAME> and <NAME> .
0	We have contracted a debt , and I hope that we shall one day pay it. ” “ You are right in speaking thus , my dear <NAME> , ” replied <NAME> .
0	My body was subtilized , or rather became volatile , and commingled in a state of atomic vapor , with the prodigious clouds , which rushed forward like a mighty comet into infinite space !
0	<NAME> and <NAME> , and , indeed , the whole party , gave themselves up for lost , as the horses were fast getting out of their depth , and six feet of water would be enough to drown them .
0	“ Yes , ” said <NAME> , “ and in that way we shall reach <NAME> without danger or fatigue. ” “ And during the stoppages we can have some hunting in the forests which line the banks , ” added <NAME> .
0	But after some few miles of tract the nature of the soil gradually changes and the country shows itself worthy of the name .
0	The emigrants after sighting <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , landed in an island , upon which they constructed some barracks and began the work of cultivation .
0	But it would be difficult to hinder their destruction .
0	To my great surprise , it showed a depth of more than 180 fathoms .
0	The effect of the apparition was prodigious .
0	Thus , though it had been so troublesome a matter to find horses and vehicles when going to <NAME> , there was no difficulty in leaving it ; for under present circumstances few travelers cared to venture on the <NAME> roads .
0	You must mean the <NAME> , surely. ” “ How ? ” demanded <NAME> .
0	“ And what does his Excellency say ? ” inquired Hakkabut .
0	His bleeding arms , his body covered with cuts and bruises , told what his sufferings had been .
0	I shortly stated what I required , and the chatib seconded me , though not with the zeal that I might have wished .
0	`` Yes , joker , '' said <NAME> .
0	It is some cavalry exercise that they are going through .
0	The darkness of the night added to the horrors of the situation , without hiding the ice which glowed in the last light of the evening .
0	But the settlers were all attached to each other by a cord , as is frequently done in ascending mountains .
0	He also thanked God for having brought about this meeting with <NAME> , which at the same time enabled him to do a good action , and afforded him additional means for concealing his true character .
0	According to his observations , this meteorite will accomplish its revolution around the earth in three hours and twenty minutes , which implies a wonderful rate of speed . ''
0	The Niger here , in its widest part , is not more than a stone's-throw across at present .
0	After winding beneath the shade of ficuses , tahuaris , nipa palms , and cecropias , it enters the <NAME> by five mouths .
0	really with you , captain , everything becomes easy. ” “ Yes , my brave <NAME> , ” answered the engineer , “ but on condition , however , that you help me , for you do as much as three men in all our work. ” <NAME> and the sailor then re-embarked on board the “ Bonadventure , ” the anchor was weighed , the sail hoisted , and the wind drove her rapidly towards <NAME> .
0	Several of the <NAME> pointed out to Cook the chief who had directed the carnage , and urged <NAME> to kill him .
0	<NAME> there , the two friends had installed themselves at once , never quitting the summit of their enormous telescope .
0	<NAME> had only a nominal authority , and the association of merchants who had defrayed the expenses of the equipment not accepting him willingly as chief , had found means to oppose all the plans of the <NAME> sailor .
0	Two of the settlers were to watch together , and every two hours it was agreed that they should be relieved by their comrades .
0	I looked at the <NAME> .
0	The course was continued to the south , and <NAME> 's perseverance was soon rewarded by the appearance of land , to which he gave the name of <NAME> Circumcision .
0	“ The Tartars have burnt out his eyes ! ” replied <NAME> , extending her hands , as if imploring pity .
0	Was it another capsize of the iceberg ?
0	The two travellers reached <NAME> and <NAME> , where they were much gratified at meeting with some <NAME> traders from <NAME> and <NAME> , who conducted them to Tor -- the ancient Ezion-geber -- at the foot of <NAME> , where they were able to procure some valuable information upon the trade of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> throws no light upon this incident .
0	At daybreak the next morning , the 15th of October , the change of weather predicted by <NAME> occurred .
0	`` Extraordinarily vivid coruscations of aurora australis ( were seen ) , at times rolling , '' says <NAME> , `` as it were , over our heads in the form of beautiful columns , then as suddenly changing like the fringe of a curtain , and again shooting across the hemisphere like a serpent ; frequently appearing not many yards above our heads , and decidedly within our atmosphere . ''
0	Was it not with the help of his old defender that he had hoped to strive for his rehabilitation ?
0	That which play had robbed him of , he resolved to recover from the <NAME> .
0	“ You think that they will march on to <NAME> ? ” “ I fear so , ” replied <NAME> .
0	<NAME> avez confirmé dans ces lieux pleins d'ennui Ce que <NAME> connut sans sortir de lui .
0	His plan was bold , but it might succeed , thanks to the darkness of the night .
0	<NAME> seemed equally annoyed ; <NAME> and <NAME> muttered threatening words between their teeth .
0	It would have been to expose herself to a categorical refusal .
0	Arrived in the open sea , the <NAME> discovered the <NAME> of <NAME> situated to the north-east of <NAME> , and then , more to the north , the <NAME> of <NAME> , now known as <NAME> .
0	Even this would be some compensation for all their trouble , courage , and intelligence .
0	I was far more willing to allow that this chimney of an extinct volcano was covered by lava of a kind refractory to heat -- in fact a bad conductor -- which did not allow the great increase of temperature to percolate through its sides .
0	<NAME> remained in <NAME> with <NAME> and <NAME> , while <NAME> , accompanied by <NAME> , proceeded to judge for himself of the extent of the disaster .
0	A semicircular screen of trees still hid it .
0	They were gradually sinking down .
0	Several thermometers , barometers , and telescopes were packed in the instrument case .
0	This was the dwelling-place of those races well known to us in <NAME> history ; the <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
0	Much more learned men than his nephew would have found it rather hard to refute his facts and arguments .
0	On the 25th of December , <NAME> Day , the country of <NAME> was discovered .
0	“ But I don ’ t want to bother myself about whether it will be cold or not .
0	At 1152 feet , the <NAME> positively refused to go a single inch further .
0	This they enclosed with palisades ; and in respect of energy and activity , it might have been mistaken for one of the great cities of the <NAME> .
0	He seemed even more downhearted than his companions .
0	This was nothing less than a pretty sharp cold , at first somewhat endurable , but which soon covered the inside surface of the window panes with a thick coating of ice .
0	said <NAME> , `` there is that unlucky land ! ''
0	He drew forth a metal case , with the cover screwed on , and which seemed to have suffered in no way from its sojourn in the water .
0	how many of these valuable evidences of the bravery and spirit of enterprise of the <NAME> race are for ever buried under the glaciers !
0	They could not succeed in killing any sort of game , and their only nourishment was a species of samphire , containing a quantity of carbonate of soda and acid juice .
0	The _Saint-Jean <NAME> was made ready for sea at <NAME> , and provisioned for three years , with every requisite for a distant expedition .
0	We must here make one important remark with regard to the map by which they were taking observations .
0	`` So did I , madam , and I am excessively disappointed .
0	There was only the longitude to be obtained , and the position of the island would be determined , The engineer hoped to attempt this the same day , at twelve o ’ clock , at which moment the sun would pass the meridian .
0	Now , on the 17th of this month of October , towards three o ’ clock in the afternoon , <NAME> , enticed by the charms of the sky , thought of reproducing <NAME> , which was opposite to <NAME> , from <NAME> to <NAME> .
0	At last , their situation was absolutely intolerable .
0	No one interrupted the <NAME> , but all things come to an end , and at last he was silent , but not till he had made his guests enter his dwelling , and be presented to <NAME> .
0	“ You know as well as I do that there are no rocks in the channel. ” “ But suppose she had run against this piece of iron ? ” said the engineer , showing the broken cylinder .
0	Nothing more common in connection with an eruption . ''
0	<NAME> <NAME> then added that he had obtained a special podorojna for <NAME> , and that the <NAME> authorities could in no way hinder his progress .
0	It was true , however , that fifty-five thousand pounds had been stolen from the <NAME> .
0	The government was in the hands of three chiefs , called <NAME> , who had shared all authority between them since the banishment of the <NAME> , or spiritual chief , who had enjoyed immense influence .
0	<NAME> winds , heavy weather , and a running sea , caused much damage to the <NAME> .
0	The population appeared considerable , and was estimated at 30,000 in <NAME> alone .
0	Would Feofar-Khan , satisfied with his first success , wait some time before marching on <NAME> ?
0	to crystallize this liquor , only an extremely easy operation is required .
0	The main question before the navigators of the fifteenth century was the opening up of an easier communication with the shores of <NAME> .
0	Undoubtedly the travelers would still have to encounter a violent recoil after the complete escapement of the water ; but the first shock would be almost entirely destroyed by this powerful spring .
0	Thus far hidden by clouds or by the lofty mountains surrounding it , the peak at last stands forth distinctly , the incline becomes less steep , and those vast plains of intensely melancholy appearance , called <NAME> by the <NAME> , on account of their bareness , are crossed .
0	One studies ten years to become an engineer or physician , an advocate or attorney , and should less time be spent in acquiring the knowledge to make a good husband ?
0	He handled him with the most exquisite delicacy , and his treatment so revived the lad ’ s strength , that it was soon evident that a few hours ’ rest would set him all right .
0	The incessant flashes of lightning took various forms .
0	The lieutenant had taken up the glass and examined the horizon steadfastly , going and coming , stamping his foot and showing more nervous agitation than his superior officer .
0	“ I was going to tell you that he is traveling with all his family -- and jolly people they are , I assure you .
0	However , after traveling for two hours , fatigue overcame him , and he slept .
0	On the earth , houses , towns , cottages , and country feel every shock given to the exterior of the globe .
0	There could be no further doubt ; a man , a stranger , had been there .
0	The brig obeyed at once , turning to the point directed ; the screw churned the water , and the <NAME> plunged under a full head of steam between two swiftly running ice-streams .
0	“ Should the slightest accident happen , waken me , ” said <NAME> , “ and , above all things , don ’ t lose sight of the barometer .
0	Our fate appears certain , fearful and terrible .
0	The wind gave signs only too threatening of the breeze rising to a gale ; but , fortunately , the waves did not culminate in breakers , but rather in a long swell which ran in the same direction as the vessel .
0	The point is to know if we may count among our chances of being rescued , the return of the <NAME> vessel .
0	All that <NAME> said of the hygienic qualities of the climate was realized .
0	At first the passengers were much frightened , but <NAME> hastened to reassure them .
0	“ After a good rest , and a little more food , she will be stronger .
0	He next visited <NAME> and took advantage of the information gathered on the spot , to write a short history of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
0	`` We could defend it , '' cried <NAME> .
0	One might really say that the honest <NAME> did not feel at his ease in those enormous jaws .
0	they are firing at us ! ''
0	Spoons , forks , and knives are unknown in <NAME> ; soup is eaten from the bowl , meat is taken in the hands , and torn with the fingers into pieces the size of a mouthful .
0	On the 10th February , when not far from <NAME> , the corvette was caught in a violent storm , which lasted for thirty-six hours , and she was more than once on the point of foundering .
0	In this drenching , shivering state , and worn out with fatigue , they came toward evening to a miserable <NAME> , which could only have been called a shelter by people not very fastidious , and certainly only travelers in extremity would even have entered it ; but <NAME> and his companions had no choice , and were glad enough to burrow in this wretched hovel , though it would have been despised by even a poor Indian of the <NAME> .
0	But we have no interest in the latter part of his life , which ended in 1786 , and to that , therefore , we need not allude .
0	The inventory of the articles possessed by these castaways from the clouds , thrown upon a coast which appeared to be uninhabited , was soon made out .
0	This seemed a proper place for a solid building , and it could be easily fortified ; nature had adapted it for the purpose ; it was only necessary to make use of the place .
0	But they were mostly sailing vessels , of which , of course , <NAME> could make no use .
0	These relics , with those collected by <NAME> , are now in the <NAME> at the <NAME> .
0	This friendly reception encouraged the naturalists to land and penetrate to the interior , in search of new plants and unknown productions .
0	<NAME> streets ! ” “ My dear Manoel ! ” said <NAME> , “ do protect us against my brother !
0	Then , when his glance fell from the wonders of the air to the calm surface of the ocean , he saw no less astonishing productions of the animal kingdom , among others , medusæ thirty feet broad ; they served as food for the other fish , and they floated like islands amid the sea-weed .
0	`` What a brute I am ! ''
0	It is doomed to more or less speedy destruction , the cause of which it bears within itself , and from which nothing can save it. ” The colonists looked at each other , then at the engineer .
0	“ Gentlemen , ” said <NAME> , “ if you like , I am ready to follow you to the landing-place. ” “ Come , then , ” answered <NAME> .
0	Moreover , it was unnecessary to manufacture rigging , that of the “ Speedy ” having been saved entire , so that the hull only of the vessel needed to be constructed .
0	`` The outlying islands with which the <NAME> abounds between the tropics , '' he says , `` are on a level with the waves in the low parts , and raised only a rood or two above them in the others .
0	Now <NAME> had more than once seen <NAME> vessels , and he persuaded his friends to go and meet the strangers , and to receive them kindly .
0	Perhaps it was not altogether surprising that he had almost forgotten him ; he had never seen him since the days of his youth , that time of life which , with a certain show of justice , has been termed the age of ingratitude ; for , in point of fact , the astronomer was none other than Professor <NAME> , <NAME> ’ s old science-master at the <NAME> Charlemagne .
0	<NAME> found that he could not avoid telling his master what had occurred , and , with hanging head , he was turning towards the car , when the engineer , a true <NAME> , named <NAME> called out , `` Gentlemen , perhaps there is a way , after all , to get over . ''
0	But will it do you any good to devour it with your eyes ?
0	According to the daily custom on board the <NAME> , its air should have been renewed four hours ago ; but I did not suffer much , although <NAME> had not yet made any demand upon his reserve of oxygen .
0	In fact , the canoe probably would not have been able to contain the articles possibly enclosed in the chest , which doubtless was heavy , since two empty barrels were required to buoy it up .
0	The ships were surrounded by a crowd of pirogues , and every variety of fruit was exchanged for glass beads .
0	The idea of ending one ’ s life in the maw of a savage !
0	the <NAME> ! ” He could find no others in his vocabulary .
0	`` While we are about it , it will certainly be only proper to discover all the secrets of this extraordinary region . ''
0	`` The natives of the country , '' says <NAME> , `` came forward willingly .
0	I can see the zigzags after a rapid dart strike the arched roof of this mightiest of mighty vaults .
0	So it was named <NAME> .
0	Such a shot , the honour of which belonged to his dear boy .
0	<NAME> had thought of all this ; but he intended to act prudently and without pushing things to extremes .
0	The disposition of these volcanic strata absolutely confirms the theories of <NAME> .
0	Passing before the lantern , he smashed it with a blow from the butt of his revolver .
0	`` No , not quite , <NAME> , but , during her voyage , the schooner , it seems , did clear the polar circle , and pass the ice-wall .
0	`` Such a fall , '' answered <NAME> , `` according to the calculations of <NAME> and <NAME> , would develop an amount of heat equal to that produced by sixteen hundred globes of burning coal , each globe equal in size to the earth itself .
0	`` They have a herb , '' he says , `` of which they collect great quantities during the summer for the winter ; they esteem it highly , and the men alone use it in the following manner : they dry it in the sun and carry it on their necks in a small skin of an animal in the shape of a bag , with a horn of stone or of wood , then constantly they make the said herb into powder , and put it into one of the ends of the said horn ; they then place a live coal upon it and blow through the other end , and so fill their body with smoke that it issues from the mouth and nostrils , as if from the shaft of a chimney .
0	In this difficult task he was seconded by <NAME> , and by his entire staff , who invariably showed the greatest zeal in their efforts for the advancement of science .
0	`` However , '' returned the engineer , `` your search has been unsuccessful , since you are only three just as you went ! ''
0	They hardly allowed themselves a moment 's repose , and the glare of the flames which shot from the crater enabled them to work night and day .
0	At the outset it is quite possible that material wants and the very necessities of existence may engross the poor shipwrecked fellow , just snatched from the waves ; but afterward , when he feels himself alone , far from his fellow men , without any hope of seeing country and friends again , what must he think , what must he suffer ?
0	Yet , according to the accounts of <NAME> and <NAME> , this whole sea was open in the summer months .
0	I soon felt that strange and mysterious sensation which is awakened in the mind when looking down from lofty hilltops , and now I was able to do so without any feeling of nervousness , having fortunately hardened myself to that kind of sublime contemplation .
0	Yes , indeed , the recruits from the Falklands demanding that we should turn back , although <NAME> was not there to fan the flame of insubordination , and I must acknowledge that the greater part of the old tars seemed to agree with them .
0	He appeared before <NAME> , not as the accused , but as himself the accuser ; then , his fortitude giving way under the remembrance of the unworthy treatment he had experienced , this unfortunate great man wept , and caused those around to weep with him .
0	It would seem that life is so precious to them that they are impelled to worship all that can prolong it !
0	`` No doubt , <NAME> , '' cried the old watchmaker , `` and it will be no slight honour for me to have been able to cut and shape the crystal to the durability of a diamond !
0	A second flash of lightning rent the darkness , and was followed by a score of others in quick succession .
0	“ The fair is to be closed , ” said one .
0	After leaving <NAME> , upon the 10th of April , <NAME> followed much the same route as <NAME> had done in 1777 , when he sailed from <NAME> to the <NAME> coast ; but he was a hundred leagues farther west .
0	Seven or eight leagues south-west lay Ulietea .
0	`` If it is only ` much the same thing , ' I may cheer up , '' said <NAME> .
0	<NAME> must therefore have provided some place for the escape of the overplus .
0	The horses and the cattle here are of incomparable docility .
0	Nothing could be easier than to execute this project , and this is how the engineer intended to set to work .
0	<NAME> held the tiller firm amid the waves lashed into foam by the tempest .
0	There they seated themselves in the stern , and without preamble , <NAME> , lowering her voice to be heard by him alone , began : “ <NAME> , I am the daughter of an exile .
0	On October 24th there was an earthquake of such violence that the governor , troops , and a portion of the people were compelled hastily to leave the town , and the loss was estimated at 120,000_l_ .
0	A better translation is _A Journey into the <NAME> of the <NAME> translated by <NAME> .
0	<NAME> that , the <NAME> was lost in the brushwood , where it was fed from some hidden source .
0	<NAME> penetrations into the interior proved the capacious windings of the river ; the valley narrowed , the hills were succeeded by mountains , at every step the way became more difficult .
0	He rang for the landlord , and , on his appearance , said , fixing his clear eyes upon him , `` Is this rabbit , sir ? ''
0	<NAME> will bring provisions , and there will be no lack of fire to cook the food. ” “ No , ” replied the reporter ; “ but if there is a lack of food for want of instruments for the chase ? ” “ Ah , if we only had a knife ! ” cried the sailor .
0	Who can say the cause , the reason , the motive force of these cataclysms ? ''
0	It was always rabbit , but <NAME> knew how to vary his sauces and the settlers did not think of complaining .
0	The two preaching friars were so discouraged at this outset of the expedition that they gave up all idea of going to <NAME> , and left the two Venetians and <NAME> to prosecute the journey together as best they could .
0	`` I hear the lowing plainly , '' I said ; `` there are , then , seals and walrus also in the sea at the base . ''
0	The <NAME> measured but fifty fathoms in width at this point , and the natives were in great excitement , rushing to and fro , tumultuously , in the villages that lined the banks of the stream .
0	<NAME> , like his master , kept coming and going , enduring every fatigue , always alert , finding out by himself the best path ; they had perfect confidence in his wonderful instinct .
0	`` It is very simple , '' responded the gentleman .
0	“ Fifteen feet at the most , ” replied <NAME> .
0	The sea remained fast ; still a few traces of seals announced the beginning of their visit , and that they were already come to breathe at the surface of the ice-field .
0	I reckoned then we should have eight hours to swim before sunrise , an operation quite practicable if we relieved each other .
0	Stop your talk , and answer me a few questions .
0	`` I have found it , my friend , I have found it ! ''
0	The first of December had arrived !
0	“ What did you do with them ? ” “ The convicts ? ” replied <NAME> , with the air of a man who does not in the least understand what he is being asked .
0	`` Well , perhaps the Selenites have carried the integral calculus farther than you have ; and , by the bye , what is this ` integral calculus ? ' ''
0	`` It will be six times less dangerous than a sudden fall upon the earth , because the weight will be only one-sixth as great on the surface of the moon . ''
0	“ What is the matter ? ” cried the captain , rushing on the bridge .
0	<NAME> knew all these details .
0	And , gentlemen , what do you think ? ''
0	The tempest had been as brief as terrific .
0	Three days ' march from hence , the traveller came to the town of Lin-tsing , standing at the mouth of the Yu-ho canal , the principal rendezvous for the innumerable boats that carry so much merchandise to the provinces of <NAME> and <NAME> .
0	<NAME> <NAME> had made no remark about this .
0	A party of <NAME> led the explorers to their settlement on an island in the river .
0	The natives called it the tablecloth , probably from some such reason as the dwellers in the Cape of <NAME> call their mountain <NAME> , and their roads <NAME> .
0	For the public , when they pay .
0	A bullet without a gun ! ''
0	he would exclaim as he patted them gently , `` you must not forget the noble part you are to play up there .
0	The trees met like a bower overhead , and caused a half-darkness .
0	With a little garden clay , I could raise you a splendid crop of peas in twenty-four hours .
0	The boat flew over the waves .
0	The equilibrium of the balloon had been calculated at the level of the sea ; and , as the country was continually ascending , and had reached an elevation of from six to seven hundred feet , the balloon would have had a tendency to go lower than the surface of the soil itself .
0	It was , therefore , fixed that the average journey every day should not be more than from twenty-five to thirty miles .
0	I cried , `` certainly a small sturgeon . ''
0	But as every additional glass is an additional obstruction to the light , the object glass of a Lunar telescope is employed without a corrector ; light is thereby saved , and in viewing the <NAME> , as in viewing a map , it evidently makes very little difference whether we see her inverted or not .
0	The walls of <NAME> , once so sure a retreat , might at any moment fall in upon them .
0	Two of the vessels , the <NAME> and the <NAME> , were engulfed , and four others were lost sight of .
0	But soon the flow completely failed them either the tide was going down , and it was about the hour , or it could no longer be felt at this distance from the mouth of the <NAME> .
0	So soon as <NAME> was in sight , <NAME> wisely decided to conduct all his trade on board .
0	`` But it is very easy to set up a graphic communication with the earth . ''
0	`` And what is that , Mr .
0	But <NAME> had not all this time been forgetful of her children , and had sent an expedition in search of them every year .
0	And so it seemed to <NAME> .
0	He was unwilling to leave the young <NAME> girl alone on board , as she had not yet reappeared on deck .
0	“ I will accompany you , ” said <NAME> .
0	The ascensional movement suddenly ceased .
0	He also promised the sailor that he would study that part of the channel situated between the islet and the coast , so as to ascertain if it would not be possible to make an artificial harbor there by means of dams .
0	Of these two men , the one was <NAME> , the other <NAME> ; both were tall and thin , but the latter was sallow as are the southern Provencals , while the former was ruddy like a <NAME> gentleman .
0	“ <NAME> ’ t go too far , ” said the Major , gravely , to the two hunters .
0	Thus badgered , he secluded himself more than ever in his dismal hole , never venturing , except when absolutely obliged , to face the other members of the community .
0	<NAME> might have cudgelled his brain for a century without hitting upon the real object which the detective had in view .
0	“ Must the poor man be left there ? ” “ He must , <NAME> , ” replied <NAME> .
0	In consequence , I was always free to do as I liked on a Wednesday .
0	If they could do this without observation , under cover of night , they might possibly reach the deep valleys of the <NAME> and put the <NAME> off the scent .
0	<NAME> could scarcely be otherwise than an object of terror to the inhabitants of the earth , who could by no means be certain that a second collision would be comparatively so harmless as the first .
0	But <NAME> , having already mapped out the whole journey with some care and forethought , was ready for almost every emergency .
0	<NAME> ran distracted through the passages , calling her companion , and asking to be taken to the <NAME> .
0	It was on the 3rd of October , after a last and long conference , that <NAME> took leave of his colleagues to devote himself to his task .
0	Soon recalled by the friendly signs and demonstrations of the <NAME> , they showed great surprise at their clothes , their faces , and the whiteness of their skin .
0	But , seeing that <NAME> let me speak without saying too much himself , I pressed him more closely .
0	No words could express the horror of our situation !
0	<NAME> <NAME> , the officers , and engineers consulted together , and had it posted up that , if the offender was surprised on board , he would be thrown without further trial into the sea .
0	“ Perhaps , ” said <NAME> , while he and <NAME> were working , “ our companions have found a superior place to ours. ” “ Very likely , ” replied the seaman ; “ but , as we don ’ t know , we must work all the same .
0	`` A greater reason for making their acquaintance , '' said <NAME> .
0	When we have got by them , it 'll be time to grumble .
0	inquired the counsellor the same morning of the burgomaster .
0	I think the form and also the nature of this island strange .
0	Never would they abandon this colony , founded with so much labor and with such success , and to which a communication with <NAME> would afford a fresh impetus .
0	This is the place to give some details about the <NAME> of the <NAME> , drawn from <NAME> 's narrative , which we are following step by step in the version that M. Ed .
0	Fortunately for the sake of peace , <NAME> , who at length was beginning to realize something of the true condition of things , came forward at this moment , and in a voice trembling with eagerness , implored the professor to tell him when they would all be back again upon the earth .
0	Harding often talked over this project with <NAME> , and he found him strangely bent upon undertaking this voyage , for which determination he himself could give no sufficient reason .
0	`` Too hard for me , '' said <NAME> .
0	The boatswain had just struck six bells .
0	And they could be sure that the faithful dog would not allow them to be surprised , but would bark at the least appearance of danger .
0	<NAME> or in <NAME> a terrestrial paradise in comparison to either .
0	Thus around the <NAME> , above and below , was an impenetrable wall of ice .
0	“ What a pity ! ” said <NAME> , “ such a useful tree , and which has such beautiful nuts ! ” As to the birds , they swarmed among the scanty branches of the eucalypti and casuarinas , which did not hinder the display of their wings .
0	This water at first spread a smell like soup , which soon changed into a strong odor of sulphur .
0	<NAME> was upon it in a bound , and kept it from plunging again .
0	The Projectile still pursued its curving but otherwise unknown path over the <NAME> 's invisible face .
0	`` What about those six convicts who disembarked on the right bank of the <NAME> ? ''
0	`` As a whaler I have followed many a cetacean , harpooned a great number , and killed several ; but , however strong or well-armed they may have been , neither their tails nor their weapons would have been able even to scratch the iron plates of a steamer . ''
0	This is by no means the only point upon which the <NAME> navigator differs from <NAME> .
0	<NAME> convoyed his prize to the <NAME> , where he sold it much below its value , for 6000 piastres .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> were informed of the condition of affairs , and they resolved to keep a strict watch .
0	During the last week of the month of August the weather moderated again .
0	Their tunics were close-fitting , and confined at the waist by a leathern belt braided with red .
0	He filled it himself , lighted it with a glowing coal , and appeared to be the happiest of quadrumana .
0	“ At his age it is quite natural , ” replied <NAME> .
0	And lastly , were I a theologian , I would tell him that the scheme of the <NAME> , according to <NAME> , seems to be applicable , not merely to the earth , but to all the celestial worlds .
0	At this exclamation <NAME> opened his eyes , and , gazing at <NAME> , then at the others -- `` You ! ''
0	That great planet gravitates beyond <NAME> at the mean distance of 11,400,799,642 miles from the sun , and to traverse its vast orbit takes 1311 years , 294 days , 12 hours , 43 minutes , 9 seconds . ''
0	The words `` blockhead '' and `` booby '' were the mildest which they now applied to each other .
0	She saw him draw himself towards his mother , bend over her , kiss her forehead , then rise and grope his way in flight .
0	`` You must know , <NAME> , that my master is an honest man , and that , when he makes a wager , he tries to win it fairly ! ''
0	From the description , these would appear to have been the inhabitants of the <NAME> .
0	At this time there were more than one hundred ships , large and small , in this roadstead , so flourishing was the trade of the <NAME> Company at this epoch .
0	The colonists halted near the lake , about half a mile from the mouth of <NAME> .
0	And , now , what is the extent of what we have seen ourselves ?
0	<NAME> congratulations were already being exchanged on the happy termination of the dangerous struggle , and on the fortunate escape from any serious accident during so hazardous a trip .
0	`` Do as he bids , '' replied <NAME> , who was always a strict disciplinarian .
0	Owing to the precaution that had been taken on the previous day , when the cargo was stowed away in the clefts , it had been only slightly damaged .
0	But for some minutes I involuntarily confounded the genera , taking animals for plants ; and who would not have been mistaken ?
0	He had a passionate taste for that noble profession , and his intention was to enter the army , toward which he felt himself attracted .
0	“ Oh for some wings , or else a balloon ! ” cried <NAME> , as he gazed around him ; and then , looking down to the rock upon which they were standing , he added , “ We seem to have been transplanted to a soil strange enough in its chemical character to bewilder the _savants_ at a museum. ” “ And do you observe , captain , ” asked the count , “ how the convexity of our little world curtails our view ?
0	<NAME> first-rate pictures , uniformly framed , separated by bright drapery , ornamented the walls , which were hung with tapestry of severe design .
0	The ascent became very perilous .
0	It required immense courage to rise by means of those frail envelopes which only contained heated air .
0	He passed <NAME> and <NAME> and <NAME> 's <NAME> , opening out of <NAME> 's <NAME> , without examining them , the last named at so great a distance that he did not even recognize it .
0	Feofar-Khan ’ s <NAME> have invaded the whole province of <NAME> , and for some days , by forced marches , have been descending the <NAME> .
0	Our drift , which had been south , down to the pole , was now north , and , if that direction should continue , perhaps we might be favoured with such good fortune as would make up for all the evil that had befallen us !
0	`` Besides , '' <NAME> went on , `` let us consider the result .
0	Can it be another projectile ? ''
0	He landed on the <NAME> of <NAME> .
0	It did not follow the routes of the <NAME> and the <NAME> exactly , for they proved fatal to <NAME> d'Urville .
0	But , for your life , don ’ t do so until I give the word ! ” “ Be easy on that point. ” “ Otherwise , we should miss <NAME> , and he would be lost. ” “ Count upon me ! ” The <NAME> at that moment almost commanded the troop of horsemen who were still desperately urging their steeds at <NAME> ’ s heels .
0	`` I never heard of a ship of this name in these seas . ''
0	He found it would be no easy task to leave it , and that in any case he must give up the idea of prosecuting his exploration ; he says , -- `` On the 11th of December , 1795 , ( after a delay of three months ) I accompanied the chatib ( one of the principal officers of the country ) to the monarch 's presence .
0	Top and <NAME> accompanied them .
0	“ Who ? ” answered <NAME> , “ but he -- ” The sailor ’ s sentence was cut short by a new tinkle of the bell .
0	He had stated that he would reach the <NAME> !
0	The men are rather less ill-favoured , though they are stunted and lean , and covered with ulcers and leprosy scars .
0	<NAME> recoiled , and , in spite of the assertions of the pilot , the thought recurred to him that some living cayman might even then be met with in the deeps near the <NAME> of <NAME> !
0	The <NAME> sank to the breast in a crevasse , and we found to our horror that we were walking on a bridge of frozen snow , for a little in advance of us there were some holes through which we could see the light .
0	All the cone trembled as if it was about to plunge into a fathomless gulf .
0	I saluted him , and talked to him , but he made no reply , and paid no attention to me .
0	`` The sun warms our projectile , which absorbs its rays ; but it does not warm the vacuum in which we are floating at this moment .
0	One day <NAME> half jestingly proposed to him an exploration of the sources of the Nile .
0	Another respondent grunt was uttered by the ape .
0	`` Soon , however , he saw breakers ahead of his boat , and found himself in the open sea .
0	He knew where <NAME> had taken refuge , and under what name the innocent man had again begun a new life .
0	He would see me , perhaps speak to me .
0	She seized <NAME> 's arm and gently pulled him back .
0	He had received warning that three <NAME> ships awaited him in the open sea , with the intention of barring his passage ; however , without taking any heed of this news , he put to sea , cleverly avoided meeting his enemies , and steering directly westward , he lost all sight of land .
0	He made a sign to the officer to follow him , and the two walked away at a rapid pace .
0	The cold , although not keen , increased towards daybreak , but they were well covered , and slept soundly under the watch of the peaceful animals .
0	At last the <NAME> said , addressing <NAME> : “ Then you have no hope whatever ? ” “ None , ” was the reply .
0	The Earth when nearest to the <NAME> , is in her _perihelion_ ; when most distant , in her _aphelion_ .
0	“ <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ pull yourself together !
0	By <NAME> Day everything was in readiness for immediate departure .
0	It was gradually getting dark when the little party entered the wide streets of <NAME> , under <NAME> ’ s guidance , who seemed always to know what he had never seen ; but his instinct led him right , and he walked straight to <NAME> ’ s <NAME> <NAME> .
0	About two o ’ clock they came to an immense barren plain , without a sign of vegetation .
0	The news of a message from the captain was immediately whispered throughout the ship .
0	The captain concluded the narrative of his life .
0	326 a <NAME> traveller made his name famous .
0	The prisoners naturally gave no credence to these lying declarations , but profiting by the comparative liberty which was henceforth granted to them , they cleverly succeeded in conveying to <NAME> some valuable information upon the position and strength of the town .
0	How , then , could we decide whether we had reached the pole ?
0	“ And in order to cure it , ” said <NAME> to <NAME> , “ we need a febrifuge. ” “ A febrifuge -- ” answered the engineer .
0	On the next day but one the weather grew calmer ; observations were taken , and as they proved the vessel to have run a great distance from the <NAME> of <NAME> , the commander had to choose between a detention off the coast of <NAME> , or off the <NAME> .
0	“ Why , then , we ’ d have to invent one ! ” replied a facetious member of this grave Society .
0	If the animals of <NAME> origin , if works due to a human hand , showed incontestably that men had already visited the island , several specimens of the vegetable kingdom did not prove it less .
0	<NAME> , much moved by these tokens of friendship , formed the design of founding an establishment on this island .
0	Upon the 1st of December , 1799 , he returned to <NAME> , and left it finally with a caravan upon the 7th of April , 1800 .
0	They all recognized <NAME> by those words .
0	“ He ’ s a wag , ” said the Jew to the <NAME> .
0	<NAME> , with radiant face , had assumed her wedding-dress .
0	It could not well be otherwise .
0	Nevertheless , the telescopes revealed no distinctive features -- even after three hours ' navigation .
0	Some days afterwards <NAME> da <NAME> and two other captains , jealous of the successes of <NAME> , and trampling in the dust every sentiment of honour , discipline , and patriotism , left him to go to the <NAME> ; while <NAME> was obliged by this cowardly desertion to withdraw without being able even to guard the fortress which he had been at so much pains to construct .
0	I was wearing the long shirt of a <NAME> , and a pair of trousers which had once been white , but which in the six weeks I had worn them had become brown , and were all but in rags ; in addition to this I had on a blue turban , a piece of rope served me as a girdle , and I carried in my hand a thick stick , which had assisted me greatly in my walking , and protected me from dogs . ''
0	But they reckoned without an accident which they were powerless to prevent , and neither their zeal nor their skill-fulness could , under the circumstances , have done more .
0	“ I would give a month of my life , ” he cried , impetuously , “ for every hour that the old fellow goes sleeping on. ” “ You might be making a bad bargain , ” said <NAME> , smiling .
0	`` Yes , your honour ; a pilot-boat -- No .
0	During the ensuing days the distance between the two planets continued to decrease , and it became more and more obvious that the earth , on her new orbit , was about to cross the orbit of <NAME> .
0	“ Yes , master , ” replied <NAME> ; “ here , at the entrance , at the back of the mound , in a place sheltered from the rain and wind .
0	The settlers listened and they thought they heard a sort of chuckling laugh , of which they could not guess the origin .
0	The excitement produced by the return of this man alone was intense ; who , after this , would accompany <NAME> in his bold attempts ?
0	Nevertheless , and notwithstanding these considerations , <NAME> 's mode of life may well astonish one .
0	[ Illustration : `` It was hollowed out of a single tree-trunk . '' ]
0	He knew that he had not an hour to lose , and that was why on this very morning , at about eight o ’ clock , he arrived , exhausted with fatigue , within half a mile of <NAME> .
0	But , I must repeat that we had not before our eyes that fabulous land which <NAME> described .
0	Would it not be best to let <NAME> judge of what he ought to do , and to warn him , at least , of the danger which threatened him ?
0	He was so young to die !
0	It lasted only part of the night of the 31st October , and the next day , when the sun rose , it might have been looked upon as a mere nightmare had not the melancholy sight of fields laid waste , and of the harbour with six ships lying on their sides , and all the others at anchor , almost entirely disabled , testified to the reality of the disaster .
0	`` It is , then , the bread-tree ? ''
0	Were they asleep or dead ?
0	A frigate called the <NAME> was placed at his disposal , and he was left free to choose his own route both going and returning .
0	The real truth was that <NAME> had taken the lead with the view of being the first to reach the pretended island of <NAME> , of which the riches had been described in glowing colours by the natives .
0	The little island proved to be nothing more than an arid rock rising abruptly about forty feet above the water .
0	Her powerful machinery was brought to bear upon the hauling-chains .
0	I had no heart for this bad fortune .
0	He had visited <NAME> and the coast of <NAME> , when this far greater project occurred to him , one which was only accomplished sixteen hundred years later by <NAME> da Gama .
0	“ After breakfast , <NAME> , ” replied <NAME> , “ we ’ ll discuss the program of our new expedition _en famille_. ” M. <NAME> ’ s breakfast seemed quite a <NAME> to the hungry guests .
0	We were two hours getting to the summit of this peak , which was half porphyry and half basalt .
0	The light of our <NAME> 's coil , increased tenfold by the myriad of prismatic masses of rock , sent its jets of fire in every direction , and I could fancy myself traveling through a huge hollow diamond , the rays of which produced myriads of extraordinary effects .
0	At any rate , it produced an abundance of useful plants , and a naturalist would have had a good opportunity of studying many specimens of the vegetable kingdom .
0	Fortunately the mistake of the measure taken was immediately ascertained , and the crew were so overjoyed that they fancied all danger over .
0	Then Harding raised his voice , and to the extreme surprise of his companions , he uttered these words , -- “ <NAME> , you asked for us !
0	In this cold atmosphere , to open the mouth was painful ; sharp crystals of ice suddenly formed between the lips , and the heat of the breath could not melt them .
0	Here expecting to be able to gain a few hours time by signalling to the outer telegraph station on <NAME> , he had caused to be painted on a sail in large black letters : `` THE <NAME> ARE BACK ! ''
0	My uncle enjoyed during his lifetime all the glory he deserved ; and he was even offered a large sum of money , by <NAME> , to exhibit himself in the <NAME> ; while I am credibly informed by a traveler that he is to be seen in waxwork at <NAME> 's !
0	The polar circle was soon passed , and the course shaped for <NAME> .
0	What did these groups signify ?
0	HOWEVER , if <NAME> , to avoid giving rise to a violent scene on board , said nothing on the subject of <NAME> , he resolved to have an explanation with <NAME> .
0	In 1787 , <NAME> discovered the now famous ruins of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> V. had no means of judging fairly on which side the justice of the case lay , for he had only heard of it from the interested parties ; he could only discern the deplorable consequences to his own government of the civil war .
0	answered the doctor ; `` what is the use of dressing warmly if one ca n't produce heat within himself ?
0	A young <NAME> , of about fifteen years of age , then advanced .
0	During that night , <NAME> was twenty times on the point of looking for and joining his mother ; but he knew that he must resist the longing he felt to take her in his arms , and once more press the hand of his young companion .
0	In fact , it was a huge bear ; lost in the fog , it came and went with great danger to the men , whose presence it certainly did not suspect .
0	He sought to read hope in their eyes , but they did not venture to meet his gaze .
0	You can not reason with pride , the principal of all the vices , since , by its very nature , the proud man refuses to listen to it .
0	On the contrary this was a uniform mass of verdure , out of which rose two or three hills of no great height .
0	They advanced some way into the wood , but to their great disappointment , they as yet saw no signs of any human being having passed that way .
0	When <NAME> had finished , he found himself relieved and comforted .
0	`` Well , sir , you will only get your deserts . ''
0	`` We require only fresh victuals and fresh water , Mr .
0	The battle was raging nearer , and the firing was incessant .
0	Again you are right , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> .
0	Tall grass blocked them up , and they were involved in the peril before they were aware .
0	There was not a shadow of doubt on that point .
0	`` Calm yourself , my dear boy , and endeavor to use your reason .
0	Many died , amongst them <NAME> , the surgeon , <NAME> , and little Tayeto .
0	`` The letter was genuine , '' answered <NAME> ; `` it is perfectly true that some unknown person has equipped the <NAME> for an expedition in the ice ; but the ship once off , no one will come on board . ''
0	They found neither wood nor water .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> dragged the bellows on a hurdle ; also a quantity of vegetables and animals , which they besides could renew on the way .
0	The two new friends felt themselves drawn closer together by the friendship this worthy man had for them both .
0	It now appeared clear that we were walking upon a kind of sedimentary soil , formed like all the soils of that period , so frequent on the surface of the globe , by the subsidence of the waters .
0	A quantity of relics belonging to the great navigator , his charts , <NAME> 's magnificent water-colours , and the instruments and weapons of the <NAME> islanders decorated the walls .
0	The vessels were soon surrounded by pirogues , but not a single native ventured to go on board , they were so fully persuaded that the <NAME> had come to avenge their murdered comrades .
0	There was a meeting of the <NAME> , and Mrs. <NAME> was authorized to visit the prisoner as often as she thought fit .
0	But we have nothing , nothing ! ''
0	Still , the eyes of all were fixed upon us , but there was no response .
0	It will be remembered that the obstinate fellow had insisted on keeping his famous family watch at <NAME> time , and on regarding that of the countries he had passed through as quite false and unreliable .
0	The curiosity of the inhabitants had been so much excited that the magistrates sent a message to the <NAME> begging them to march through the town .
0	There was a strong east wind .
0	It was probable that they would find a little of everything , and they agreed that it was exactly what was necessary for the colony of <NAME> .
0	The explorers who have succeeded him in the same countries unanimously testify to his exactness , and agree in praising his fidelity , knowledge , and sagacity .
0	We were in open sea ; but at a distance of about ten yards , on either side of the <NAME> , rose a dazzling wall of ice .
0	Thus , on several occasions , junks were seized upon , and their crews forced by their <NAME> captors to pay large ransoms .
0	On board of a pirogue , with two companions only , <NAME> penetrated , with some Algonquins , to the <NAME> , and remained conqueror in a great battle fought on the borders of a lake which has received his name ; he then descended the river <NAME> , as far as the <NAME> .
0	“ She is very pretty , ” said <NAME> .
0	Their teeth appeared to have been filed , and the cartilage of the nose pierced .
0	He wished to ascertain his position and see if the ice-field had not been drifting again .
0	But will his warriors consent ? ” “ Yes !
0	Among them were a few isolated cones , revealing the mark of the eternal snows .
0	The longer he gazed upon them , the more absorbing became their attraction .
0	The <NAME> offered me a cup of the milk , which was still warm .
0	This apparently astounding acoustic mystery is easily explainable by simple natural laws ; it arose from the conductibility of the rock .
0	This strange teacher of morality , who in his youth had set all laws at defiance , and to whom no obligation was sacred , now preached pity , love , and sympathy , arranged regular marriages between the children of different parents , his little community thriving lustily under the mild yet firm control of one who had but lately turned from his own evil ways .
0	He deducted , however , from <NAME> 's share the cost of the gas which had burned in his room for nineteen hundred and twenty hours , for the sake of regularity .
0	Their hair , divided into a great number of small tresses , fell over their shoulders , and by means of black-and-blue incisions they had tattooed their cheeks from the temples to the mouth .
0	`` Breakfast , '' answered the cool , audacious <NAME> , who always brought up this solution at the most difficult juncture .
0	The courageous <NAME> tried to rise , but could not stand .
0	The canoe was hauled up on the beach near the <NAME> , and all proceeded towards the ladder of <NAME> .
0	His mind is at the top of the volcano !
0	Now they slid over the slippery rock ; then they struggled to their feet and scrambled on .
0	The coast on the west reappeared -- a rocky coast , without a mountainous background ; the <NAME> was following its line .
0	For a long time I would not give credit to these accounts , considering them as exaggerated ; but they rest upon the authority of two different persons , who had not only been witnesses for several years to these atrocities , but had also borne a share in them : of two persons who lived in a state of mortal enmity , and took particular pains by their mutual recriminations to obtain with us credit for themselves , but yet on this point never contradicted each other .
0	Most of the natives of <NAME> who accompanied the embassy suffered from low fever and dysentery .
0	<NAME> imprecations burst from the boat , which immediately continued its way .
0	It costs less for fodder , and is more reliable. ” “ Well , you may have your choice , master , but I stick to my idea. ” It now was noon .
0	It was the intention of the <NAME> government to lay the country desert before the invaders .
0	The <NAME> flag hung from the top of the staff in the bow , and the breeze was scarcely strong enough to lift the bunting .
0	“ Close the door , <NAME> ! ” said <NAME> .
0	The fuci and llianas grew in rigid perpendicular lines , due to the density of the element which had produced them .
0	On the 12th October , they began to sleep in the house , although it was not completed .
0	At the end of this gulf <NAME> hoped to find a channel through which he could reach the <NAME> , but he was disappointed .
0	The chiefs themselves could not withhold that mark of respect .
0	The colony consisted at first of only twenty-nine persons , for whom huts were built and also a provision warehouse .
0	Of this Bougainville gives the following curious illustration : -- In 1828 the Suluans seized 3000 of the inhabitants upon the coast of <NAME> , and an expedition sent against them cost 140,000 piastres , and resulted in the killing of six men !
0	The day began to fade , and with the day the breeze fell also .
0	His servant , <NAME> , who had now joined him , tried in vain to be all things at once .
0	If the right time is known on board , that is to say , the correct time by which the meridian could be computed at the moment of any given observation , and if at the same time , the exact time at the port from which the ship had started , or that if any known meridian could be ascertained , the difference of time would evidently give that of the meridians , at the rate of fifteen degrees per hour , or one degree per four minutes .
0	A too common instance this of ingratitude , but one which it is never _mal à propos_ to stigmatize as it deserves .
0	They had been in the place for three days in much perplexity , when the raft arrived .
0	At the end of the library a large door , also shut , was opened by the engineer .
0	to <NAME> 's River in 61 degrees N. lat .
0	`` I do not think he would , but he would not taste them . ''
0	But suddenly , at about two o'clock , these words were shouted from aloft , -- `` Head to the west , and put on all steam . ''
0	The poop of the vessel was crowded on a moment .
0	`` Since it is so , '' he said , `` we shall follow you . ''
0	<NAME> made no reply , but went out and returned a few minutes later with a raw steak , seasoned with pepper and salt , in the <NAME> style .
0	Top particularly was enchanted with this improvement , for he had not , and never could have possessed <NAME> ’ s skill in climbing ladders , and often it was on <NAME> ’ s back , or even on that of the orang that he had been obliged to make the ascent to <NAME> .
0	<NAME> for <NAME> ! ” At this moment the ascensional force of the balloon increased prodigiously , and <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , waved a last good-by to their friends .
0	His companions were still ignorant of this , for he had not informed them of the result at which he aimed .
0	The inspector read the permit with attention .
0	Our legs refused to carry us ; and I then understood the picturesque expression of <NAME> , when , in narrating his first ascent , he said that `` his legs seemed only to be kept up by his trousers ! ''
0	<NAME> stags and graceful roebucks scampered off beneath the bushes , and a well-aimed bullet would assuredly have stopped them .
0	In fact there are but two chains of moderate elevation , between which runs the magnificent Mississippi , the `` king of rivers '' as these <NAME> <NAME> delight to call it .
0	“ No , ” replied <NAME> , “ since he has webbed feet , and is almost an amphibious animal .
0	The rich blue of the iris was darker than formerly .
0	They hastened their gait , and in about half an hour they were climbing up the steps of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> , looking him straight in the face , continued : “ Yesterday , after the interview you had with <NAME> , my husband , you came to me and called me -- mother !
0	<NAME> ’ s and <NAME> ’ s rifles then spoke , and no doubt imparted some very disagreeable intelligence to two of the convicts , for they fell backwards .
0	They had manufactured a great number of snares , into which fell numbers of blue foxes , the valuable fur of which served as a protection against cold , while their flesh enabled the sailors to economize their provisions .
0	After a walk of a mile and a half , the shore presented no curve which would permit them to return to the north .
0	`` It would be prudent for us to retire , '' said <NAME> , who was anxious that <NAME> should not receive any injury , at least until they got back to <NAME> .
0	<NAME> yourself caught on a narrow railroad bridge at midnight with an express train approaching at full speed , its reflector already dazzling you with its light , the roar of the cars rattling in your ears , and you may conceive the feelings of the travellers .
0	They had not dared to pursue him through the river .
0	From on high I shall still participate in your enterprises , and I fear not but that they will prosper . ''
0	What if he should never again behold his <NAME> fatherland ?
0	<NAME> positively talked to the beast , and <NAME> understood perfectly , though unable to reply , for , after a great deal of arguing , the noble creature yielded , though he still champed the bit .
0	It has been found impossible to determine with certainty either the name or the nationality of <NAME> , and still less to settle the period of his birth .
0	At ten paces not an object was visible .
0	Instead of following the track of <NAME> , we have fallen on that of young Guinnard. ” This announcement was heard with profound silence .
0	It required two persons to eat a strawberry , and four to consume a pear .
0	“ Then , if my memory serves me right , we must be eighty miles from it , for the peak of <NAME> , seven thousand feet high , is visible at that distance. ” “ That ’ s it , precisely. ” Some hours later , the sharp , lofty crags of the group of islands stood out clearly on the horizon .
0	“ I am a poet , ” said <NAME> .
0	They might have been a herd of enormous whales , suddenly turned to stone .
0	`` At last , her influence prevailed , and <NAME> , in exchange for what he could tell , proposed that <NAME> should leave him on some island in the <NAME> , instead of giving him up to the <NAME> authorities .
0	At last they had arrived in those rich and wonderful countries .
0	`` <NAME> himself , at his own request . ''
0	`` We are going where our <NAME> 's fancy takes us , <NAME> . ''
0	However , with the fine days work had been continued .
0	Three hours of terrible fatigue , walking incessantly , had only brought us to the foot of the great mountain .
0	Thus perished this great navigator , assuredly the most illustrious produced by <NAME> .
0	Giving but few minutes to my meals , but a few hours to sleep , indifferent to either rain or sunshine , I did not leave the poop of the vessel .
0	Commissary Passauf flung himself into the antechamber .
0	`` Did you hear the detonation , which certainly ought to be loud ? ''
0	Could there indeed be a better place than a dark and deep coal mine for the freaks of fairies , elves , goblins , and other actors in the fantastical dramas ?
0	Could you marry me , <NAME> ? ” “ Yes , <NAME> , I could , if you are sure that I am able to make you happy , ” answered the maiden , raising her innocent eyes to his .
0	The wave had torn him from the balloon net .
0	The bodies of the three bears were carried forward .
0	As to <NAME> , he was swimming bravely .
0	“ I , dear <NAME> ! ” “ And what does Mrs. Scorbitt want with me ? ” “ To tell you that there is a storm coming your way. ” “ Well , I can not stop it— ” “ No , but I wanted to ask if you had taken care to shut your window— ” Mrs. <NAME> had hardly ended before a tremendous clap of thunder filled the air .
0	I did not attempt to controvert this singular and astounding assertion .
0	It was needful to hurry as fast as possible from the gulf where the ships had so incautiously involved themselves .
0	The first sentiment which the colonists felt was that of profound sorrow .
0	Where formerly sprang up that charming verdure , the soil was now nothing but a savage mass of volcanic tufa .
0	There 's an iceberg we can cut into !
0	Some of their words are nine or ten syllables long , and yet they can only count up to three .
0	Her instinctive kindness had doubly inspired her .
0	In fact , on the night of the 23rd , the hull entirely broke up , and some of the wreck was cast up on the beach .
0	On the second of the month , at two in the morning , our precious cargo of luggage was taken on board the good ship < i > <NAME> < /i > .
0	In that case the entire excavation , vast as it was , would be completely flooded .
0	`` Twelve o'clock , sir , '' said he .
0	118 degrees 6 minutes , he built on the banks of Winter River a wooden house , which he called <NAME> .
0	Then the <NAME> regions were purchased under the auctioneer ’ s hammer .
0	<NAME> ! ” <NAME> rushed toward him , and with the assistance of the Major , dragged him up again on the tree .
0	They therefore refused to go beyond that point , and formally demanded that the ship should be steered northward so as to clear the icebergs at the most favourable period of the season .
0	The unfortunate <NAME> was lost in the storm !
0	He fully experienced the intellectual gratification -- much greater than , perhaps , would be thought -- of the man who , after hours of obstinate endeavor , saw the impatiently sought-for sense of the logogryph coming into view .
0	The public awaited with interest its final decision .
0	He evidently heard and understood , but no less evidently was he strangely determined not to speak to the colonists ; for one evening , <NAME> , listening at the door of his room , heard these words escape from his lips : -- `` No !
0	Are you sure of it , my daughter ? ” “ Why should he have deceived me in this , ” replied <NAME> , “ when he deceived me in no other way ? ” <NAME> , however , by a kind of presentiment , <NAME> put questions upon questions to <NAME> .
0	D'Urville received his appointment in December , 1825 , and was permitted himself to choose all who were to accompany him .
0	And now the pieces were as brilliant as if they had been on board a frigate of the <NAME> .
0	A few days after the ceremony , <NAME> and <NAME> , accompanied by <NAME> , took the route to <NAME> .
0	But it did not last long .
0	After all , they were but making a voyage -- a strange , yet a transient , excursion through solar regions hitherto untraversed ; but if the professor ’ s calculations were correct -- and why should they be doubted ? -- their little vessel was destined , after a two years ’ absence , once more to return “ to port. ” The landing , indeed , might be a matter of difficulty ; but with the good prospect before them of once again standing on terrestrial shores , they had nothing to do at present except to make themselves as comfortable as they could in their present quarters .
0	But how much do you agree to give me for the hire -- the hire , one day ? ” “ You shall have twenty francs , ” said <NAME> .
0	And still the jangada continued its journey down the river .
0	A lantern was lighted at the foot of the mainmast , round which was hung a gun-rack , furnished with weapons of all sorts .
0	They returned along the north coast of <NAME> , and passed through the <NAME> , between <NAME> and <NAME> .
0	When men have worked together , they must never be stranger to each other again .
0	It skirted at some distance the summits of <NAME> , and at about half-past seven in the evening reached the circle of <NAME> .
0	We had to seek repose at more than twenty-five fathoms in the bowels of the deep .
0	The examination was obviously satisfactory , for he entered the loja .
0	Thousands of luminous sheets and barbed tongues of fire were cast in various directions .
0	“ <NAME> , ” continued <NAME> , “ Torres never gave a hint to put us on the track of his past life .
0	It is part of an <NAME> education . ''
0	But scarcely had he done so , when <NAME> noticed that his waist was encompassed by an enormous girdle that bulged out to a very extraordinary extent .
0	On a sign from the engineer , <NAME> and <NAME> examined the bodies , already stiffened by the cold .
0	What could be passing in his mind ?
0	“ Even should it be only a wildgoose chase , ” said <NAME> to himself , “ it may be worth powder and shot. ” The two correspondents therefore began by cautiously sounding each other .
0	Three hours later at low tide , the greater part of the sand forming the bed of the channel was uncovered .
0	<NAME> <NAME> was kept acquainted with all that was going on in the very heart of the invaded provinces .
0	If my life is still useful to my people , and a miracle is necessary to save me , that miracle will be performed ; if not , I shall die !
0	The <NAME> steamer was announced to leave that very evening , and it became necessary to find <NAME> , if possible , without delay .
0	he exclaimed , `` it 's a fearful staircase ! ''
0	The fish had a flat head , round body , and the lower extremities covered with bony scales ; its mouth was wholly without teeth , the pectoral fins , which were highly developed , sprouted direct from the body , which properly speaking had no tail .
0	Our fishermen frequently see some that are more than four feet long .
0	They were all <NAME> majos , agricultural laborers , and naturally as careless and apathetic as men of their class usually are , but they could not help being very considerably embarrassed when they discovered that they were left in solitude upon a detached and isolated rock .
0	<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> were able to come on deck at daybreak , where they found <NAME> , <NAME> and the captain .
0	By the God of <NAME> !
0	The wood appeared as deserted as on the day when the colonists first landed on the island .
0	<NAME> to his well-known liberality , as much as to his reputation for courage , he gathered together 570 men , of about equal numbers of cavalry and infantry , with which he set out by land for <NAME> .
0	This had a prodigious effect on <NAME> .
0	I have the honor , my brave colleagues , to propose a trial of this little experiment . ''
0	“ Because the ‘ <NAME> ’ is a steam-yacht , and I can not perceive any trace of smoke either above or near that vessel. ” “ Perhaps she is simply sailing , ” observed <NAME> .
0	“ But , ” said the doctor , “ are you not aware that my journey is to compete with the success of the expeditions now on foot ?
0	To the hurrahs which greeted him he replied by a graceful bow ; then , waving his hands to request silence , he spoke in perfectly correct English as follows : `` Gentlemen , despite the very hot weather I request your patience for a short time while I offer some explanations regarding the projects which seem to have so interested you .
0	The moon and the earth were nothing but gaseous masses originally .
0	<NAME> <NAME> was not even ambitious of a higher rise ; he did not want to make a fortune ; he did not concern himself with the buying or selling of cargoes ; but everything connected with that admirable instrument a sailing ship , <NAME> understood to perfection .
0	The conversation , beginning with a few disconnected phrases , soon gave place to loud and steady snores .
0	`` Do n't be afraid , '' cried the boatswain .
0	He who is mistaken in an action which he sincerely believes to be right may be an enemy , but retains our esteem .
0	`` And why this powerful organisation ? ''
0	It would have been vain to try and convince him that the Fire-Maidens did not exist , and that the flame , so suddenly appearing among the ruins , was but a natural phenomenon .
0	We stopped to take the hand of every caboceer , ( which , as their household suites occupied several spaces in advance , delayed us long enough to distinguish some of the ornaments in the general blaze of splendour and ostentation ) .
0	Thus it had been agreed that <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> should remain at <NAME> , but an objection was raised , and <NAME> , who had not forgotten his business as reporter to the <NAME> , having declared that he would go by swimming rather than lose such an opportunity , he was admitted to take a part in the voyage .
0	Somehow or other , this avowal of <NAME> , and surrender of himself , so to speak , unconditionally , singularly touched his auditors , especially when the quartermaster added : “ So I tell you beforehand , the bargain will be more to my profit than yours. ” “ It does not signify , ” replied <NAME> .
0	“ Can you explain this ? ” asked the count .
0	But taking the different densities into consideration , it was easy to reckon that this point would be situated at 47/60ths of the whole journey , _i.e._ , at 78,514 leagues from the earth .
0	When you look at any map of the <NAME> , you are struck first of all with one peculiarity .
0	Every kind of provision may be obtained here , particularly the best kinds of garden stuffs , and in two or three days a ship may be provided with everything . ''
0	At noon , <NAME> himself came to work the ship 's log .
0	A Struggle of Generosity. -- The Last Sacrifice. -- The <NAME> Apparatus. -- <NAME> ’ s Adroitness. -- Midnight. -- The <NAME> ’ s Watch. -- <NAME> ’ s Watch. -- The <NAME> falls asleep at his Post. -- The Fire. -- The <NAME> of the Natives. -- Out of <NAME> .
0	In a single engagement seventy of <NAME> 's companions fell under the arrows of the savages , fearful weapons steeped in `` curare , '' so fatal a poison that the slightest wound was followed by death .
0	It was to be regretted that the brig ’ s two boats had not been saved ; but one , as has been said , had gone to pieces at the mouth of the <NAME> , and was absolutely useless ; the other had disappeared when the brig went down , and had not again been seen , having doubtless been crushed .
0	The corral , with its clumps of trees , the little stream which watered it , its wide carpet of grass , was suddenly illuminated .

0	By dint of close economy , combined with tact and prudence , she managed to support and educate him , working day and night , denying herself everything , that she might give him all he needed , watching over him and caring for him like a mother .
0	The bait he used was a small piece of meat , by means of which he concealed his hook .
0	But the populace , seeing in that title an allusion damaging to <NAME> 's project , broke into the auditorium , smashed the benches , and compelled the unlucky director to alter his playbill .
0	Little <NAME> flung himself on his neck in such tumultuous delight that he nearly threw the worthy secretary down , and made him say , “ <NAME> _petit bonhomme_ .
0	It spread equally among all classes of citizens -- men of science , shopkeepers , merchants , porters , chair-men , as well as `` greenhorns , '' were stirred in their innermost fibres .
0	Was it his proxim ity to <NAME> shores ?
0	It was all very well for an Englishman like <NAME> to make the tour of the world with a carpet-bag ; a lady could not be expected to travel comfortably under such conditions .
0	The climate , you know , <NAME> , the regenerative climate -- ” Here the poor <NAME> stuck fast , unable to get further , like the wagon in the mud .
0	`` Yes , '' he replied , and tears stood in his eyes , `` yes , it may be so .

0	Just as <NAME> dismounted to discover the exact direction of the road , he heard a confused murmuring sound from the west .
0	Some of these large birds measured twenty feet from tip to tip ; they covered the whole launch with their expanded wings ; and there were legions of these birds , of which the names had never appeared in the <NAME> `` Index Ornithologus . ''
0	This man had considered him an assassin , but <NAME> did not quail before the accusation .
0	All was stowed away , and happily there was no want of room in <NAME> , in which they might have housed all the treasures of the island .
0	His pulse beat fast as he recalled the friends and comrades with whom he had spent the last few years in that vanished city .
0	My first emotions having subsided , I found that the scene before me by no means came up to my expectations .
0	I could hope for nothing from one so infatuated with and devoted to his master .
0	The detonations as of artillery are incessant .
0	The wind , should it rise , would blow there as it did here , only less strongly at this point , if it came from the east .
0	The blackboard was placed in an angle of the room on an easel of polished oak , well in the light of one of the windows which opened on to the garden .
0	At the same time , historical geography was more studied ; it began to take for its foundation the study of inscriptions , and archæology was about to become one of the most useful instruments of comparative geography .

0	What this incomparable mountain really is , with all the projections converging toward it , and the interior excrescences of its crater , photography itself could never represent .
0	Our love of `` Science '' rests upon our admiration of intellect , only unfortunately the intellect is too often that of other people , not our own .
0	On the contrary , I professed considerable interest in the subject , and asked him what it was about .
0	Here I am the representative of my country , and here , on neutral ground -- ” “ Neutral ground ? ” objected <NAME> ; “ I beg your pardon .
0	To dwell upon it ourselves would be to exceed the limits we laid down for our work .
0	The mineral kingdom reigned supreme .
0	The town itself was menaced by the <NAME> vanguard ; and two days before the authorities had been obliged to retreat to <NAME> .
0	The volcano rocked and trembled with the convulsions of internal disturbance , and <NAME> and his companions , convinced that the mountain was doomed to some sudden disruption , rushed into the open air .
0	Perhaps some day we may have the honor of being registered among the minor planets. ” “ No chance of that , ” quickly rejoined <NAME> .
0	I morally press the hand you refuse me .

0	What could it avail to sow , to reap , to hunt , to increase the stores of <NAME> ?
0	They then jumped back , but almost at the same instant they rushed together , and with their left hands seized each other by the shoulder -- never to leave go again .
0	`` Was it not good to have proved by experience the possibility of rising in the air ? ''
0	Whenever they assumed a particularly lively and pleasant air , I was convinced that they had committed a theft , and I often pretended not to see it . ''

0	The crater was again boiling with lava which overflowed the back of the volcano .
0	`` Thus , my friends , '' said <NAME> , `` all motion suddenly stopped produces heat .
0	On the 4th December , <NAME> sighted an island completely overgrown with vegetation .
0	<NAME> <NAME> must , we calculated , be very much to the westward .
0	Had I felt the need of talking to somebody very strongly , I might have resorted to the boatswain , who was always disposed to chatter ; but what had he to say that could interest me ?
0	`` I am sorry , '' said the conductor ; `` but we shall be off at once .
0	The soundings , surveys , plans , and astronomical observations were completed ; but , before finally leaving the island , <NAME> wished thoroughly to explore the depths of the bay .

0	The inhabitants , having driven off their flocks of sheep , their camels , and their horses , were taking refuge in the plains of the north .
0	Some men brought a living pig in a procession , and some scarlet cloth in which it was wrapped .
0	Up to the morning of the 30th of June there had been nothing particular to distinguish the voyage .
0	The murmur began again ; I listened , and it seemed to me that a voice -- a voice which I did not know -- whispered these words : -- `` Pym .
0	“ A convict vessel is not disciplined like a man-of-war !
0	“ <NAME> has lost its chance of getting back to the earth .
0	On a nearer approach <NAME> found himself in view of a low , flat country of somewhat barren aspect .
0	Moreover , he would not , in any event , abandon <NAME> , but would escort her to <NAME> .
0	By an ingenious device he sets before the rescuers a search which compels their circumnavigation of the globe around a certain parallel of the southern hemisphere .
0	The chiefs and sorcerers seemed to be highly excited .
0	It has been said that in the morning of the 2d of July the jangada had arrived at <NAME> d ’ Olivença , where they turn out in thousands those long strings of beads which are made from the scales of the _ “ coco de piassaba. ” _ This trade is here extensively followed .
0	No progress can be accomplished without detriment to the indigenous races .
0	<NAME> was anxious , though she said nothing .
0	Bending over his work-table , he had not heard me .
0	<NAME> hardly knew what he was about , with delight .
0	It is evident that he received with favour the project which <NAME> and <NAME> had just submitted to him ; and though <NAME> , in the fragment which we have just quoted , attributes to himself alone all the honour of the project , it is not less true that his father was the promoter of the enterprise , as the following charter shows , which we translate in an abridged form .
0	The frightened horses reared , and their driver could not manage to quiet them .
0	<NAME> , he recognized <NAME> , the sister of the man who was no longer <NAME> , but <NAME> , Courier of the Czar .
0	“ It is shocking ! ” replied <NAME> .
0	It is the boat. ” “ The ship ’ s boat ? ” exclaimed <NAME> .
0	<NAME> held <NAME> in his arms .
0	`` An age , a cycle , according to the use you make of them .

0	Not one of the brave Scots who set out at the summons of their chief , but could answer to their names ; all were returning to their old <NAME> .
0	Stringent orders were given , and all thieves caught in the act were flogged in the presence of their fellow-countrymen , who , however , as well as the culprits themselves , treated the affair only as a joke .
0	<NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and the two sailors , had just time to throw themselves flat on the ground before they swept past like a whirlwind , only a few paces distant .
0	What vessel could resist the shock of his submarine monitor ?
0	The crew then landed and pursued the natives , who made no attempt to resist them .
0	“ We have left the road , ” said <NAME> , feeling that he was treading no longer on powdery soil but on short grass .
0	Near <NAME> are some mines of auriferous quartz , of which the commander was able to obtain a specimen , and in the interior is the lake of <NAME> , said to be of immense depth , and which is the source of the torrent of the same name that dashes in the form of a magnificent waterfall over a basalt rock eighty feet high , barring its progress to the sea .
0	[ Illustration ] Hatteras could not depend on his blasting-cylinders of eight or ten pounds of powder , whose action would have been insignificant against such large masses ; they were only of use to break the field-ice ; hence he placed in the opening a thousand pounds of powder , carefully laying it where it should be of the utmost service .
0	in her arms , and beside her walked his sister , a pretty child of ten years old .
0	It was a meadow land , dotted here and there with clumps of trees , and watered by a little stream , which sprung from the slopes which closed it in on one side .
0	And when may we expect the operation to come off ? ” “ In a month , <NAME> , ” replied <NAME> .
0	There was the intensest interest awakened to determine whether no vestige could be traced of <NAME> , <NAME> , or any of the group , and it was during a deviation from the direct course for the purpose of a more thorough scrutiny , that one of the sailors raised a thrill of general excitement by shouting , “ A bottle in the sea ! ” Here , then , at length was a communication from the outer world .
0	We were exceedingly well received , and without taking too much advantage of the goodness of these worthy people , I should have liked very much to have rested with them after the fatigues of the journey .
0	It was fortunate for him , for there is nothing more repulsive than the sight of that crowd of living and dead objects , of seal 's bodies and Esquimaux-flesh , decayed fish and unclean clothing , which fill a <NAME> hut ; there is no window to renew that suffocating air ; there is only a hole at the top of the cabin which lets the smoke out , but gives no relief to the stench .
0	“ You are very stout , <NAME> , ” replied <NAME> , “ and it ’ s something too , you see , to live all one ’ s life in the mine. ” “ Right , <NAME> .
0	A frightful death was in store for them , since they must either be devoured by the fire or by the caimans .
0	Now it happens that it is during the winter of the southern countries that it is at its most distant point from the sun , and consequently , in a situation for those regions to feel the greatest cold .
0	As <NAME> had done , <NAME> and <NAME> passed without perceiving them amongst the principal <NAME> archipelagos , and cast anchor on the 10th April , at the <NAME> of <NAME> , where it was only possible to procure a little fresh water and some herbs .
0	repeated the captain , with clinched fists and sparkling eyes .
0	<NAME> numbered 1981 in 1750 .
0	the giant is playing at cup and ball ; he is a conjurer. ” In fact , the substances thrown up fell back again in to the abyss , and it did not seem that the lava , though swollen by the internal pressure , had yet risen to the orifice of the crater .
0	Hence every man went back to his place .
0	We were now convinced that this subterranean sea contained only fish known to us as fossil specimens -- and fish and reptiles alike were all the more perfect the farther back they dated their origin .
0	The dazzling glitter did not deceive _him_ .
0	But when my uncle came to understand that they were <NAME> miles , of eight thousand yards each , he was obliged to be more moderate in his ideas , and , considering the horrible roads we had to follow , to allow eight or ten days for the journey .
0	My first sensation was perhaps a natural one .
0	“ Come , ” said <NAME> , “ the blackguards have not been there yet .
0	<NAME> <NAME> knew Dr. <NAME> personally , and guaranteed the intrepidity of his dauntless friend .
0	Five minutes after leaving the cart , <NAME> and <NAME> arrived at the edge of the wood before the clearing beyond which rose the palisade .
0	A chapel , dedicated to <NAME> , overlooked it from the top of a huge rock , whose foot was laved by the waters of the subterranean sea .
0	`` Ah , <NAME> , '' shouted the old sailor , `` that 's a real miracle !
0	The ascent of the <NAME> is one of the most interesting trips that can be made from <NAME> .
0	<NAME> was the first apprentice whom <NAME> had ever admitted to the intimacy of his labours , for he appreciated his intelligence , discretion , and goodness of heart ; and this young man had attached himself to <NAME> with the earnest devotion natural to a noble nature .
0	“ You had much better buy a full cargo of fine cod than throw your money into the <NAME> Sea. ” “ That ’ s not the question , ” said the Major .
0	However , as the wind was blowing from the north-east , in all probability the vessel was sailing on the starboard tack .
0	About the 7th of December , twenty days after the discovery of the castaways , they perceived the bay where the `` Jeune-Hardie '' was lying .
0	Here is the flag of our country .
0	There was none of the wild disorder and deafening tumult that usually accompany the discharge of volcanic matter , but the heated lava , rising with a uniform gentleness , quietly overran the limits of the crater , like the flow of water from the bosom of a peaceful lake .
0	It was now confessedly the privilege and the right of these men to set limits to that selenographic science which had till now been making itself so very busy in reconstructing the lunar world .
0	“ It is only a question of quantity. ” “ Then could you not use this nitro-glycerine for loading firearms ? ” asked the sailor .
0	The cries of the terrified musmons and goats indicated the alarm which possessed them .
0	Sometimes I heard the melancholy tones of his organ ; but only at night , in the midst of the deepest obscurity , when the <NAME> slept upon the deserted ocean .
0	I shall not soon forget that. ” “ But , <NAME> , how can we be sure that these two hands do not belong to the same body ? ” “ What can put such a notion in your head , <NAME> ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	Some took sides with <NAME> , but the large majority shook their heads and declared against him ; it was absurd , impossible , they declared , that the tour of the world could be made , except theoretically and on paper , in this minimum of time , and with the existing means of travelling .
0	I was on the point of fainting .
0	I soon threw myself on an ottoman , and took a book , which my eyes overran mechanically .
0	In spite of all he could do , he felt excited .
0	The personal danger of <NAME> at this moment was great ; the troops sent by <NAME> were more numerous and better furnished with arms and ammunition than were his own , but his deepest cause of anxiety was not the possibility of his own condemnation and death , it was the fear lest all fruit of his efforts might be lost , and the knowledge of the hurtfulness of these dissensions to his country 's cause .
0	They hastened in great numbers towards the reefs , within six feet of which the boats must necessarily pass .
0	What if the atmosphere had really withdrawn to this dark face ?
0	This was a sign of friendship ; harmony followed , and war and bloodshed were thought of no more .
0	But that distant echo was the only response produced by <NAME> ’ s shouts , while a heavy gloom hung over all the part east of the island .
0	“ We are not moving an inch !
0	Before leaving the capital of <NAME> , the <NAME> commander entered into various details of the beauty of the port , and the picturesque nature of its surroundings , and finished by a very curious digression upon the prodigious riches of the country , of which the port was the emporium .
0	The adventurer , seated opposite to <NAME> , who was always taciturn , listened to all that was said , but took no part in the conversation .
0	The balloon clung to a tree , and his lamp again set it on fire .
0	The brig now sailed in a sea which was almost entirely open .
0	They consisted of notes of captains who had passed through the Straits of <NAME> , stating the time of their visits , the incidents of their passage , with advice to those who should come after them , and letters for <NAME> or the <NAME> .
0	I do not understand why <NAME> was not one of the greatest poets of the world . ''
0	“ Two ; my friend <NAME> , and my servant Neb. ” “ That will be three , ” replied <NAME> ; “ and with <NAME> and me five .
0	The package of notes not being found when five o'clock sounded from the ponderous clock in the `` drawing office , '' the amount was passed to the account of profit and loss .
0	I feel like a starving prisoner , '' he said , rubbing his yellow and shivering hands together .
0	After seeing the vessels made secure in the frozen creek .
0	I ’ m ready. ” While he spoke he was mechanically getting paper from his note-book .
0	cried <NAME> , who could not repress his indignation .
0	Insults were showered upon the governor , and <NAME> cried , `` I should like <NAME> de la <NAME> to know that if he were as young as I , I would kill him , but as he is not , I will spare him .
0	She bowed her head , and was silent .
0	`` True , '' said <NAME> ; `` <NAME> talks sense .
0	“ Perhaps he would walk if his feet were unfastened , ” said <NAME> .
0	Returning to the <NAME> , whose small , sharp eyes , glistening with avarice , betrayed that with him it was only a question of how great a price he could obtain .
0	<NAME> , throw out the anchors ! ” The balloon , gradually losing its ascensional force , approached the ground ; the anchors ran along until , at last , one of them caught in the fissure of a rock , and the balloon remained motionless .
0	But <NAME> had reserved them for a strange destiny , and after having , on the 20th of March , escaped from <NAME> , besieged by the troops of <NAME> , they found themselves seven thousand miles from the capital of <NAME> , which was the principal stronghold of the <NAME> , during the terrible War of Secession .
0	On the forecastle lay the perfection of a breech-loading gun , very thick at the breech , and very narrow in the bore , the model of which had been in the <NAME> of 1867 .
0	Such being the case , it can be easily understood how a sudden jerk would separate the front from the hinder part .
0	But <NAME> would not own herself vanquished .
0	Corresponding to this in the southern hemisphere lies the <NAME> , or <NAME> , whose surface , as it extends along the western rim , is rather difficult to calculate .
0	said the doctor , gazing at the chart .
0	The pilot alone , standing in the bow , showed his tall stature , scarcely defined in the earlier shadows .
0	They were offered by packages , at first of five , then of ten , until at last nobody would take less than twenty , fifty , a hundred !
0	Having wandered over vast continents , your eye is attracted by the `` seas '' of dimensions still vaster .
0	Possibly he would not have done this had he been aware that <NAME> was sufficiently acquainted with his history to address him by the name of <NAME> .
0	Even these petty ills of life could not ruffle the <NAME> ’ s equanimity ; but <NAME> , on the contrary , was perfectly exasperated by such trifling annoyances .
0	The worn-out horses had stretched themselves full length on the ground , except <NAME> , who slept standing , true to his high blood , proud in repose as in action , and ready to start at his master ’ s call .
0	The <NAME> had again become more habitable , not only because the passages were warmed by the fire , but because the partitions of wood and mud had been re-established .
0	From time to time <NAME> said , “ Speak to me , Nadia. ” “ Why should I , <NAME> ?
0	Thus , some time after the return of the travelers , the public received with marked favor the announcement of a company , limited , with a capital of a hundred million of dollars , divided into a hundred thousand shares of a thousand dollars each , under the name of the `` <NAME> of <NAME> . ''
0	For some minutes he had seen the man at the foot of the tree , but the sleeper did not move , and this doubtless induced him to come and look at him a little nearer .
0	But talking of oysters , let me remind you again that breakfast is ready . ''
0	`` Have you nothing to say either , <NAME> ? ''
0	`` We propose to construct a vessel , '' said <NAME> , `` sufficiently large to convey us to the nearest land ; but if we should succeed , sooner or later we shall return to <NAME> .
0	This would be utter folly , and it was hard to admit that <NAME> was such a fool .
0	Then the vessel being clear , he descended to his cabin without having uttered a word .
0	“ Yes , ” answered the <NAME> , “ there are some things even a plain merchant can not receive without returning. ” “ <NAME> ? ” “ Blows , young man .
0	It followed day by day the discussion of the committee .
0	They were severe , and the average observations of the thermometer did not give more than eight degrees of <NAME> .
0	“ This is the reason the yacht at this time lay off the coast of <NAME> .
0	But in <NAME> he was not appreciated according to his worth. ” “ He was a sturdy fellow ! ” said <NAME> , “ but what became of him ? ” “ He died at the age of thirty-nine , from the consequences of his long fatigues .
0	remarked my uncle as we sat down to a late breakfast ; `` refresh yourself , my boy , and we will take a run through the town . ''
0	What crowds must be flocking to the churches !
0	But there , what quiet , what silence , what peace !
0	The weather was cold , the heavens grey , but it was not snowing .
0	While these events were taking place , another boat , laden with fifteen armed men , came alongside the <NAME> , and took possession of her without any resistance from the sailors , surprised by the rapidity of the action .
0	Now , we already knew this land was not more than fifty miles from <NAME> .
0	Always on the look-out for fresh water and provisions , <NAME> in vain looked for the bay which <NAME> had spoken of as abounding in game .
0	The question was continually being asked , “ What does the professor really think ? ” “ Our friend the professor , ” said <NAME> , “ is not likely to tell us very much ; but we may feel pretty certain of one thing : he wouldn ’ t keep us long in the dark , if he thought we were not going back to the earth again .
0	“ Yes , and a famous one , ” replied <NAME> .

0	They rocked under the shark 's movements , which beat them with indescribable fury .
0	He seized it and rapidly turned over its leaves , and his emaciated finger fixed itself on one of the pages .
0	<NAME> vapour , forming a kind of crown of smoke , is emitted from it , whilst the atmosphere at the bottom is perfectly cool .
0	The captain imagined the island to be uninhabited , but to his very great surprise a canoe presently approached his ship manned by three young men of colour , who spoke <NAME> very well .
0	The southern coast of the island still remained to be explored .
0	<NAME> gave him his directions as a commander to his steersman , and <NAME> never allowed the “ Bonadventure ” to swerve even a point .
0	`` I do n't know about that , '' was the <NAME> 's reply , `` but I do know that this formula is wonderfully come at . ''
0	“ To-day or never we shall see the Nile !
0	That was true , speaking exactly .
0	“ These vampires have a particular instinct which leads them to bleed you in the places where the blood most easily comes , and principally behind the ear .
0	`` No , sir , '' replied <NAME> ; `` because we shall not take that beast easily . ''
0	Falling from the summit of <NAME> 's , it strikes the earth at the rate of 300 miles an hour , or five times quicker than the rapidest express train .
0	<NAME> was about to invade the sanctity of the “ oudoupa , ” when he reeled backward .
0	At this moment we were ascending the slope which leads to the Grand-Plateau , which we soon safely reached .
0	“ Poor orphans , ” said <NAME> .
0	Covering a great portion of that part of the southern hemisphere which lies east of the centre , it occupied a space of about 270 thousand square miles , its central point lying in 15° south latitude and 20° east longitude .
0	He began to collect his sense , which he found a difficult task ; but at last he recalled the events of the evening before , <NAME> 's revelation , and the opium-house .
0	By the death of <NAME> the number of the passengers was reduced to twelve .
0	The <NAME> undertook to pay all the expenses of the expedition on condition that the greater part of the profits should belong to him .
0	“ Where are you , <NAME> ? ” he shouted .
0	While these interesting birds were cooking , <NAME> prepared the fruit of the bread-tree .
0	The knowledge of <NAME> , and the investigation of <NAME> literature , had inaugurated a scientific movement which has gone on ever since with increasing energy .
0	`` Your thoughts are with your country , gentlemen , '' continued the captain ; `` your toils are for her prosperity and glory .
0	What energy , what strength of mind were requisite in one of the greatest travellers of whom <NAME> has reason to be proud , to succeed in such an enterprise !
0	“ The death of the sacrilegious , my friends , ” replied <NAME> .
0	`` I can well believe it , '' said <NAME> .
0	Here , with what delight we can easily imagine , he found letters from <NAME> awaiting him .
0	A second edition , illustrated with engravings which were meritorious rather from their fidelity to nature than their artistic merit , was issued in 1705 , and in 1785 the remaining copies of this issue were collected , and appeared under a new title .
0	`` He asked me , '' replied <NAME> , `` did I not remember <NAME> of the <NAME> , and whether he had perished in the fight with the mutineers or in the shipwreck ; whether he was one of the men who had been abandoned with <NAME> ; in short , he asked me if I could tell him how his brother died .
0	It seems as if the ship had rather foundered than blown up. ” “ Does that astonish you , my boy ? ” asked the engineer .
0	This replacing of the disc was at least an hour 's work .
0	The victory of <NAME> had been very dearly bought .
0	Of this , however , there was now no trace ; the <NAME> of <NAME> had been replaced by a vast expanse of water , which had at first all the appearance of being utterly desert ; but on the following morning the explorers unexpectedly sighted a little island , which , unless it should prove , as was only too likely , to be of recent origin they concluded , from its situation , must be a portion of the northernmost territory of <NAME> .
0	The cacique dined at the admiral 's table , apparently enjoying the repast ; after he had himself tasted of the different viands and beverages , he sent the dishes and goblets to the members of his suite ; he had good manners , spoke little , but showed great politeness .
0	`` My dear <NAME> , I thought you would be the first to cry out against this mad enterprise . ''
0	If I could have bought it even at the price of all my fortune , if these men had been my slaves to drive by the lash , the <NAME> should never have given up this voyage , even if it led her so far as the point above which flames the <NAME> .

0	Thanks indeed to him , nearly the whole of the industrial population of <NAME> had been killed , sold into slavery , or had fled the country .

0	THE HALF-MILE square of forest was cleared .

0	Top and <NAME> were to remain with the engineer , <NAME> , and <NAME> , for a bark or a cry at a wrong moment would give the alarm .
0	I felt like the lamb led to the slaughter .
0	The lift was put in motion , and <NAME> was soon stretched on his bed in <NAME> .
0	<NAME> revised his figures : they were exact .
0	“ A little -- some fifty feet , ” replied the doctor , who kept his eyes fixed on the barometer .
0	But , inasmuch as it is equally necessary to take into account the deviation which the rotary motion of the earth will impart to the shot , and as the shot can not reach the moon until after a deviation equal to 16 radii of the earth , which , calculated upon the moon 's orbit , are equal to about eleven degrees , it becomes necessary to add these eleven degrees to those which express the retardation of the moon just mentioned : that is to say , in round numbers , about sixty-four degrees .
0	<NAME> immediately ordered the sails which were aiding the engine to be reefed ; but before this could be done his main-topsail was carried away .
0	The entire vegetation which could thrive on this mass of lava consisted of two or three kinds of rugose grass , which grew on the rocks , scanty bushes , especially the paper-mulberry , the 'hibiscus , ' and the mimosa , and some plantains .
0	Its motion has been turned into heat .
0	`` You are in a great hurry , then ? ''
0	We were in the centre of four cross paths -- somber and narrow tunnels .
0	The hull would be safe for some hours yet .
0	<NAME> turned into <NAME> and would no longer be counted .
0	It had appeared necessary to enlarge their dimensions , for the feathered population had increased considerably .
0	The sledge , shortening this route , took a chord of the arc described by the railway .
0	The huge volcano which was the first stage of our daring experiment is above five thousand feet high .
0	<NAME> <NAME> was leaning over me , saying , in a low voice , `` We are going to fly . ''
0	It had been so much talked of , even through the <NAME> cable , that jesters pretended that this slender fly had stopped a telegram on its passage and was making the most of it .
0	“ <NAME> me , <NAME> , I say , ” repeated <NAME> .
0	“ All that remains of our stock of pemmican ; that will be thirty pounds less weight to carry. ” “ Out it goes , sir ! ” said <NAME> , obeying orders .
0	“ Can you cook , then , <NAME> ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	I should be as glad as any one else to have a glass of whiskey , especially on such a cold day ; but if in the long run it does more harm than good , why , I 'm very willing to get along without it . ''
0	<NAME> and <NAME> were ahead , choosing the way and looking out for game .
0	`` Well then , '' he resumed , `` seeing that these bright streaks invariably start from a certain point to radiate in all directions , why not suppose them to be streams of lava issuing from the crater and flowing down the mountain side until they cooled ? ''
0	cried I , in the height of my exasperation , `` we are on the way to an eruption , are we ?
0	You will see that is worth all the machinery in the world . ''
0	<NAME> , as we have seen , had traced the course of that river past the valley of <NAME> , to <NAME> , near <NAME> .
0	In the evening , after a journey of only five miles , they camped under the gum-trees .
0	Imagine the waters of the lake aroused by a hurricane , then suddenly solidified by an intense frost , and some conception may be formed of the aspect of the lake three hours after the irruption of this irresistible torrent of lava .
0	“ At length ! ” he said , over and over again , “ water !
0	I did require a good night 's rest , and I went off reflecting at the last moment that my perilous adventure in the interior of the earth , in total darkness , had lasted four days !
0	They slid rather than walked down the spur , that their figures might be lost in the dark mass of the mountain .
0	“ If I am not mistaken , we have accomplished nearly half of our journey in ten days ; but , at the rate at which we are going , it would take months to end it ; and that is all the more vexatious , that we are threatened with a lack of water. ” “ But we ’ ll find some , ” said <NAME> .
0	“ I snatched it from Kara-Tete when he fell at your feet .
0	The upper part of our dress terminated in a copper collar upon which was screwed the metal helmet .
0	<NAME> <NAME> was painfully dazzled , and his sight sensibly changed .
0	But a degree of intelligence appeared in his face that showed some educational influences must have been at work on his savage , untamed nature .
0	What cares were lavished on him to bring him back to life !
0	Why not ? ” “ Are you hurt ? ” inquired <NAME> of <NAME> .
0	He came to the conclusion that there must be an open sea beyond , and he founded this opinion on the immense quantity of warm water which flows into the <NAME> from the great rivers of <NAME> .
0	That the captain was to receive the sum of 97,740 francs within ten days of their arrival at <NAME> .
0	interrupted <NAME> ; `` it seems to me the <NAME> should not be forgotten , unless indeed it came by land , '' he added jestingly .
0	After taking him aside they made him understand that there was no time to be lost -- that they must make up their minds to act .
0	`` _Less_ than _unity_ , you mean !
0	The same evening <NAME> and <NAME> disappeared in the mists of the horizon .
0	She holds the adventurer in horror !
0	In the depths of the forests , moreover , the conquerors of the islands had created artificial glades , in order that the herds of horned cattle which they had introduced might find food and also enjoy shelter from the sun .
0	The black showed the greatest patience and even extreme zeal in instructing his pupil , and the pupil exhibited remarkable intelligence in profiting by the lessons he received from his master .
0	`` This island , '' says the traveller in his narrative , `` was once much larger , for according to the map of the world that the pilots of these seas carry , it was once 3600 miles in circumference but the north wind blows with such force in these parts that it caused a part of the island to be submerged . ''
0	The road was as deserted as all that part of the <NAME> which lay between the <NAME> and the lake .
0	“ At any rate , we must make haste , ” said <NAME> .
0	Finding it impossible to see a particle of the <NAME> surface , he gave it up for good , and tried to console himself by gazing at the stars , which now fairly blazed in the spangled heavens .
0	The different stock were kept apart , for wild sheep and bullocks would not have got on together at all .
0	He gave the lunar mountains a height of about 26,000 feet -- an altitude cut down by <NAME> , but almost doubled by <NAME> .
0	There exists amongst the Indians a legend similar to that connected with <NAME> 's <NAME> in the <NAME> , telling how one of their heroes split open the rocks and drained dry the valley of <NAME> , after which , content with his exploit , he retired to the sacred town of <NAME> , where he did penance for 2000 years , inflicting upon himself the greatest torture .
0	It was that of a lofty mountain , capped with snow .
0	You understand that we have nothing to do here with projectiles weighing at most but half a ton . ''
0	A general altercation had arisen from a disagreement between the sailor <NAME> and <NAME> .
0	There a Lascar came alongside in a canoe , sold him the handle of a sword in silver that bore the print of characters engraved on the hilt .
0	Both of them were about forty years of age ; both of them were tall and fair , with bushy whiskers and mustaches ; both of them were phlegmatic in temperament , and both much addicted to the wearing of their uniforms .
0	These savages had poisoned arrows , the poison being contained in the tip ; amongst them was a woman whom all the others obeyed , bowing before her .
0	One day , after having admitted that , with an overwhelming run of good-luck , there MIGHT be one chance of success in a thousand , he pretended to yield entirely to the doctor ’ s wishes ; but , in order to still put off the journey , he opened the most varied series of subterfuges .
0	Now nothing could prevent the success of their enterprise , and <NAME> and <NAME> shared <NAME> 's joy .
0	“ Let go the anchor , ” said he .
0	What she has done for <NAME> and so many others , she will do to-day for these poor shipwrecked fellows of the BRITANNIA. ” “ Most likely the unfortunate men have families who mourn their loss .
0	He thought he had found “ the <NAME> Continent. ” “ But , ” said <NAME> to himself , “ what a seventeenth century sailor might call a ‘ continent ’ would never stand for one with a nineteenth century man .
0	`` True , '' replied the president ; `` but we will overcome that , for the force of impulsion will depend on the length of the engine and the powder employed , the latter being limited only by the resisting power of the former .
0	`` Quite possible , on the contrary , '' returned <NAME> .
0	<NAME> is a large and populous town on the skirts of a desert of sand .
0	The events which had happened during the last few days -- the struggle between <NAME> and <NAME> ; the search for the corpse , which had reappeared under such extraordinary circumstances ; the finding of the “ indecipherable ” document , if we can so call it ; the information it concealed , the assurance that it contained , or rather the wish that it contained , the material proof of the guiltlessness of <NAME> ; and the hope that it was written by the real culprit -- all these things had contributed to work the change in public opinion .
0	While they were digging the house , the doctor happened to stumble upon a small stove which had not been injured by the explosion , and with a piece of chimney that could be easily repaired : the doctor carried it away in triumph .
0	It is quite motionless and presents the appearance of sleep .
0	The anchors caught in a low tree and the sportsman fastened it securely .
0	Unfortunately the interesting account of this crossing of <NAME> , never before accomplished by a <NAME> , has not been separately published , but is buried in a book which it is almost impossible to obtain , `` The Transactions of the <NAME> of <NAME> . ''
0	The <NAME> placed obstacles in the way of the sale of the merchandise by depreciating its value ; <NAME> sent his agent <NAME> to the <NAME> to complain of the perfidy of the <NAME> and of the bad treatment to which he had been subjected , requesting at the same time permission to move his place of sale to <NAME> , where he hoped that the goods would be more easily disposed of .
0	But we were not in any great danger , and he might have been saved , since the rest of us were saved . ''
0	`` My dear uncle , '' I exclaimed , and the big tears rolled down my hot and feverish cheeks .
0	There remained no doubt of the intentions of the natives .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> ’ s interest was , therefore , contrary to that of <NAME> .
0	They were anxious to reach <NAME> to eat and sleep , and if the bridge had been constructed , in a quarter of an hour they would have been at home .
0	> There are also inconsistent spellings , for example `` aluminum '' and > '' aluminium '' .
0	In sheer desperation , he endeavored to increase the intensity of his vision by applying to his eyes some belladonna which he found in the <NAME> ’ s_ medicine chest ; with heroic fortitude he endured the tortures of the experiment , and gazed up into the sky until he was nearly blind .
0	The two young men carried in addition , in their belts , a sort of dagger-knife , which is known in <NAME> as a _ “ foca , ” _ and which hunters do not hesitate to use when attacking the ounce and other wild animals which , if not very formidable , are pretty numerous in these forests .
0	The horn of retreat for him had sounded ; he was about to be replaced at <NAME> by a younger missionary , and he was preparing to return to <NAME> , to end his days in one of those convents which are reserved for the old servants of God .
0	The sound , therefore , takes twenty seconds to ascend .
0	He decided , therefore , to send a commissioner to the country , to whom he gave most extensive powers , and who , after having inquired into all that had taken place , should establish whatever form of government he thought most advisable .
0	As I spoke , I looked keenly around , examining with care every point of the horizon ; but nothing alive appeared to exist on these deserted shores .
0	On the fifth day the invalid found himself quite cured and got up .
0	Shortly after passing the <NAME> , the corvette sighted <NAME> , which the inhabitants call <NAME> .
0	no -- I tell you he is not the master of our lives ; we must fly !
0	As M. Levchine says , “ a firm front or a square of good infantry could repel ten times the number of <NAME> ; and a single cannon might destroy a frightful number. ” That may be ; but to do this it is necessary for the square of good infantry to reach the rebellious country , and the cannon to leave the arsenals of the <NAME> provinces , perhaps two or three thousand versts distant .
0	They had been lying hardly a quarter of an hour , when <NAME> started up with a cry so loud and sudden as instantly to awaken his companions .
0	At all events , there was one thing to be thankful for ; <NAME> was not with his master ; and it was above all important , after the confidences <NAME> had imparted to him , that the servant should never have speech with his master .
0	Five hundred of the natives confronted them , but apparently with no hostile intentions ; they gave them some fish-hooks and old iron in exchange for some of the natural productions of the island , such as figs , and dragon 's blood , a resinous substance taken from the dragon-tree , which has a very pleasant balsamic odour .
0	“ And after that , why not golden wedding number two ? ” “ You would like a couple of fifties , would you , <NAME> ? ” said <NAME> .
0	<NAME> had procured in the town some morsels of “ tchornekhleb , ” a sort of barley bread , and a little mead , called “ meod ” in <NAME> .
0	`` To-morrow , '' added the <NAME> , rising , `` to-morrow , at twenty minutes to three p.m. , the <NAME> shall float , and leave the <NAME> of <NAME> uninjured . ''
0	They slipped , they fell , they got up again .
0	Did he regret the words which he had just spoken in <NAME> ?
0	After having carefully inspected everything of interest in <NAME> , <NAME> went into <NAME> , little thinking that the continent he was exploring , extended thence to the tropic of <NAME> .
0	Here is the engine which was taken out and left here , and the furnace which warmed the crew of the <NAME> in 1851 ; everything remains as it was left , and one might fancy that <NAME> , her captain , had sailed away from here yesterday .
0	After a thousand scenes of pillage , of vexation , and attacks by armed forces , their caravan arrived , in October , at the vast oasis of <NAME> .
0	The colonists , not having any pressing work out of doors , profited by the bad weather to work at the interior of <NAME> , the arrangement of which was becoming more complete from day to day .
0	With my spiral I have subjected it inside to as much as one hundred and fifty-eight degrees sometimes , and the covering does not appear to have suffered. ” “ A cloud !
0	`` Exactly , my observant nephew , '' exclaimed my uncle , elated and delighted , `` and it is quite probable that if we succeed in getting toward the polar regions -- somewhere near the seventy-third degree of latitude , where <NAME> discovered the magnetic pole , we shall behold the needle point directly upward .
0	<NAME> placed his hand upon <NAME> 's arm , and , lowering his voice , said , `` You have guessed who I am ? ''
0	Judge <NAME> had worked himself into such a state of exasperation that there really was some fear that his mental faculties would lose their balance .
0	It must be confessed that this gave some anxiety to the secretary of the <NAME> , who had never sought happiness in such close approximations .
0	This man had apparently not been induced to take service by the bribe of high wages or prize money .
0	“ You will get used to the outer world , and most likely forget all about our dark coal pit. ” “ No , <NAME> , never ! ” said <NAME> , and she put her hand over her eyes , as though she would recall the remembrance of everything she had lately quitted .
0	<NAME> wanted to find out from the <NAME> what he was doing in these high latitudes .
0	Their speeches were not so long , and they did not declaim so vehemently .
0	“ My dear doctor , ” said <NAME> , “ if we continue to produce such a sensation as this , we shall find some difficulty in establishing commercial relations with the people hereabouts. ” “ There ’ s one kind of trade that we might carry on , though , easily enough , ” said <NAME> ; “ and that would be to go down there quietly , and walk off with the best of the goods , without troubling our heads about the merchants ; we ’ d get rich that way ! ” “ Ah ! ” said the doctor , “ these natives are a little scared at first ; but they won ’ t be long in coming back , either through suspicion or through curiosity. ” “ Do you really think so , doctor ? ” “ Well , we ’ ll see pretty soon .
0	there is the white line of the <NAME> where old <NAME> is watching for us with his big telescope ! '
0	Let us omit nothing on our part to give him the chance of rejoining us. ” “ May God grant it as you say , <NAME> ! ” replied the doctor , with much emotion .
0	Sometimes one of his companions , sometimes another , sometimes all joined him .
0	After coasting along a series of low and rocky islands , which were named after the principal officers , the vessels reached <NAME> , on the coast of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> is but a relative expression , and must end by being reduced to zero . ''
0	We will see about the sun by and by . ''
0	The waves ran very high ; the vessel rolled a great deal .
0	Still I wished to go forward .
0	And when his eyes fell upon the letter bearing upon it the authority of the imperial seal -- the letter which , no doubt , contained the remedy for so many evils , the safety of all this war-ravaged country -- <NAME> felt within himself a fierce desire to dash on across the steppe , to accomplish the distance which separated him from <NAME> as the crow would fly it , to be an eagle that he might overtop all obstacles , to be a hurricane that he might sweep through the air at a hundred versts an hour , and to be at last face to face with the <NAME> , and to exclaim : “ Your highness , from his Majesty the Czar ! ” On the next morning at six o ’ clock , <NAME> started off again .
0	<NAME> over , the observers returned to their post .
0	exclaimed <NAME> , `` all our plants will be frozen ! ''
0	<NAME> <NAME> , therefore , believed in the fidelity of this man and , by his advice , resolved to cross <NAME> , following the thirty-seventh parallel .
0	<NAME> <NAME> , expressing his regret that his purse contained only paper money , begged to place it at <NAME> ’ s disposal .
0	<NAME> in gold money a hundred francs , and twenty francs for the hire. ” The old man folded his hands in meek resignation .
0	The settlers then approached the ape and gazed at it attentively .
0	From this point the view of the sea was much extended , but on the right the high promontory prevented their seeing whether there was land beyond it .
0	`` Well then , talking <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> with a smile , `` the mean distance of the Moon from the Earth being sixty terrestrial radii , the length of the conic shadow , in consequence of atmospheric refraction , is reduced to less than forty-two radii .
0	<NAME> was the <NAME> country , with its villages topped with roofs turned over like <NAME> caps .
0	<NAME> had raised himself a little and gazed without seeing .
0	The next day , April 1st , when the <NAME> ascended to the surface some minutes before noon , we sighted land to the west .
0	He was followed by a detachment of the men of the <NAME> , among whom was a midshipman of a <NAME> ship , M. de <NAME> , who was a volunteer aid of <NAME> .
0	The doctor left his notes , and <NAME> his furnaces .
0	This fish was of an unknown species , having a body like a great eel , and upon the back of his head a very tenacious skin , in fashion like a purse , wherewith to take the fishes .
0	About ten of them were there , lashing the water with their powerful tails , and attacking the <NAME> with the long teeth of their lower jaw .
0	On a sign from the engineer , <NAME> and <NAME> examined the bodies , already stiffened by the cold .
0	The two Zealanders who had asked to accompany <NAME> were landed with him .
0	That man is to be pitied the most who can not wean himself from gloomy reflections by actual work , or some practical pursuit .
0	Upon their surface fell other waves , which in their turn became stone , but a step nearer the centre of the lake .
0	A light breeze blew from the south .
0	“ The very name Alps gives plenty of room for reflection. ” “ It is not quite so big as it sounds , my dear <NAME> .
0	According to <NAME> , the <NAME> have a tradition of a deluge and some fables which recall those of the <NAME> mythology .
0	During the day she skirted <NAME> , passed <NAME> , and directed her course rapidly eastward .
0	All this was a gratuitous gift to the king from his subjects .
0	It was useless to contemplate removing him to <NAME> , for he had expressed his wish to remain in the midst of those marvels of the “ Nautilus ” which millions could not have purchased , and to wait there for that death which was swiftly approaching .
0	The misfortune that had befallen his telescope was a never-ending theme of complaint ; and just now , when <NAME> was entering the narrow zone of shooting-stars , and new discoveries might have been within his reach , his loss made him more inconsolable than ever .
0	THE <NAME> TO THE <NAME> .
0	It was warm , and a bright sun darted his rays on the island .
0	And do you know how many grains one ear bears ? ” “ No , upon my word. ” “ About eighty ! ” said <NAME> .
0	It had been a hard day 's work for the men .
0	Making their progress with the unwonted rapidity which was attributable to their specific lightness , <NAME> and his companions soon found themselves near a grove of sycamores and eucalyptus massed in picturesque confusion at the base of a little hill .
0	`` After all , it does not signify to us , since our campaign will certainly be over in three weeks . ''
0	The <NAME> , in reference to the <NAME> or the Projectile , was in her last phase , or octant as it is called , and showed a sharp-horned , attenuated , but brilliant crescent strongly relieved by the black background of the sky .
0	The guests of the <NAME> immediately began to stream towards the supper-rooms .
0	The most superstitious declared they had seen these fantastic creatures with their own eyes .
0	I had returned to my room , where <NAME> and <NAME> had remained silent enough .
0	“ That ’ s just like you SAVANTS .
0	It is the wildest shore I have ever seen , and appears entirely composed of mountains and rocks , without a vestige of vegetation .
0	What monster can fill himself with such huge volumes of water , and then unceasingly spout them out in such lofty jets ?
0	This was to be regretted , for it increased the risk of collision with the floating ice .
0	They wore no vestige of clothing ; their skin was black and their hair woolly ; and the partition of the nostrils had a sharp bone thrust through by way of ornament .
0	He passed <NAME> and <NAME> ' Land of the <NAME> , where he easily recognized <NAME> and <NAME> Philip Bays , and left this archipelago after having named it <NAME> , by which appellation it is now known .
0	A cold sweat came over me .
0	Make them understand that we have time to return to the <NAME> before the end of the fine season .
0	He explored the coal-bunkers , the store-room , the powder-store , and armory , in which last he seemed to be particularly attracted by a cannon mounted on the forecastle .
0	Content yourself with winding it up very , exactly , but do not touch the hands .
0	A few lightning-flashes , reflections from a distant storm , illuminated the horizon .
0	<NAME> , his formidable jaws open , preceded the colonists , and he was followed by <NAME> , armed with a knotty cudgel , which he brandished like a club .
0	<NAME> tufts of grass bordered the shining pavement , and no one would have thought of tearing them away , for they deadened the noise made by the passers-by .
0	198 Pirogues of the <NAME> .
0	`` We found new cause for surprise in the population of the colony .
0	You will be alone , under the eye of a God who reads the depths of the heart ; but you will be neither lost nor forgotten , as was <NAME> .
0	`` Thank you , <NAME> , '' said <NAME> ; `` the cold does not injure your memory , though it is decidedly on the advance .
0	`` Well , and here we 've found one in the air ! ''
0	`` Certainly , <NAME> , '' answered <NAME> .
0	You received a letter , <NAME> ? ” “ Yes , a letter from your Honor. ” “ At <NAME> ? ” “ At <NAME> , just as our repairs were completed. ” “ And this letter ? ” “ It was not written by you , but bore your signature , my Lord. ” “ Just so ; my letter was brought by a convict called <NAME> Joyce. ” “ No , by a sailor called <NAME> , a quartermaster on the BRITANNIA. ” “ Yes , <NAME> or <NAME> , one and the same individual .
0	Suddenly a cry made him tremble , a cry which penetrated to the depths of his soul , and these two words rushed into his ear : “ My son ! ” His mother , the old woman <NAME> , was before him !
0	`` Do you think then , sir , that these riches are lost because I gather them ?
0	`` Mere cattle stop the trains , and go by in a procession , just as if they were not impeding travel !
0	I saw there in the midst of this fire that burns not the swift and elegant porpoise ( the indefatigable clown of the ocean ) , and some swordfish ten feet long , those prophetic heralds of the hurricane whose formidable sword would now and then strike the glass of the saloon .
0	His last resource was to set out across the southern steppe .
0	[ Illustration : `` Excelling in lassoing the wild mustangs . '' ]
0	Hans , the guide , who was half upset by the shock , was scarcely able to keep down a cry of pain and grief .
0	I 've changed my game , you see , and simply because it was for my interest to change it .
0	Whatever his punctuality , he could not prevent the delays which were certain to occur ; and a delay of only two or three days would be fatal to his tour . ''
0	“ That give us -- nothing ! ” And in fact the _h_ placed under the _r_ could not be expressed by a cipher , for , in alphabetical order , this letter occupies an earlier position to that of the _r._ The _p , _ the _y , _ the _j , _ arranged beneath the letters _o , t , e , _ disclosed the cipher 1 , 4 , 5 , but as for the _s_ and the _l_ at the end of the word , the interval which separated them from the _g_ and the _a_ was a dozen letters , and hence impossible to express by a single cipher , so that they corresponded to neither _g_ nor _a_ .
0	The extreme distance to which sound is carried when the temperature is low is an astonishing fact ; it is only equalled by the brilliancy of the constellations in the northern skies ; the waves of light and sound are transmitted to great distances , especially in the dry cold of the nights .
0	At the same moment the crumbling masses of the hill slid down upon them and they instantly concluded that they were doomed to be buried alive .
0	We must have seen each other somewhere ? ” “ I do not think so , ” quickly answered <NAME> .
0	While the excellent <NAME> spoke sentence after sentence , he stood with folded arms , utterly still , motionless to all my uncle 's gesticulations .
0	She was reinforced with a supplementary number of <NAME> sailors , without which it would have been impossible to regain <NAME> .
0	`` Last night , '' cried J. T. <NAME> , _ex abrupto_ , `` our president was publicly insulted during the meeting .
0	For a second or so they gazed with enraptured fascination at all they could see .
0	Indeed , half a dozen chickens and a fine cock were walking about , flapping their wings and chattering .
0	The <NAME> had lost her consort , and the world was convinced that no Antarctic continent existed .
0	`` All the better , '' replied our Frenchman , `` if it carries me up to the moon . ''
0	<NAME> and loud were the lamentations of the Jew .
0	J. T. <NAME> , <NAME> 's Peak , <NAME> ; and the fourth to the sub-director of the <NAME> , <NAME> .
0	Hans , with the lamp , examined the sides of the tunnel in every direction .
0	But that is not the question we have to settle .
0	`` Well , and have we a fair wind ? ''
0	“ Why , doctor , can you light up such darkness as this ? ” “ Who knows , <NAME> ? ” “ Ah !
0	<NAME> was informed of its situation , and expressed his willingness to live there apart from his fellows .
0	<NAME> , to avoid a collision , gave the order for the discharge from the swivel gun above the natives ' heads , but although the noise terrified them , they still continued their approach .
0	The Projectile weighs about 20 thousand pounds , or 10 tons ? ''
0	We should be taken , delivered up to the mercy of those wretches , and <NAME> has shown us that he does not stop at a crime !
0	But I declare to you that I have had enough of the <NAME> , and I will not follow him to the <NAME> . ''
0	The whole journey there and back might be performed in eight days .
0	<NAME> hesitated , the wrinkles in his forehead deepened , and at length he said in calm voice : “ I have nothing to say , my Lord .
0	It is a fort , or rather a fortified village , surrounded by high walls , in good repair , and furnished with bastions .
0	I asked with anxious interest .
0	<NAME> , who had always particularly admired it , now hailed it as an old friend , and almost exhausted breath , imagination and vocabulary in the epithets with which he greeted this cynosure of the lunar mountains .
0	This first trip resulted in the discovery of emerald mines at <NAME> , mentioned by <NAME> authors , which had been abandoned for centuries .
0	As for his antagonists , they seemed much agitated ; not so much by the value of their stake , as because they had some scruples about betting under conditions so difficult to their friend .
0	The only individual whose soul seemed unstirred by the approaching earth was <NAME> .
0	Our safety depended on this last chance .
0	“ And the ‘ <NAME> , ’ making sail , soon disappeared .

0	The kibitka was thus in the whirlpool , and the horse was nearly exhausted , when , all at once , <NAME> , throwing off such of his garments as might impede him , jumped into the water ; then , seizing with a strong hand the bridle of the terrified horse , he gave him such an impulse that he managed to struggle out of the circle , and getting again into the current , the kibitka drifted along anew .
0	Now he had noticed that if the English were in a minority with regard to the early discoveries , that if it was necessary to go back to <NAME> to make sure of <NAME> in 1774 , and of the <NAME> Islands where he was killed in 1778 , there was nevertheless one corner of the globe on which they had centred all their efforts .
0	We were mute with astonishment , overcome by a kind of feeling which was next door to apathy .

0	Fearing that some accident might have befallen his lieutenant , he had descended the course of the river for 150 miles , until he met with an unfortunate officer , who had been left behind for having addressed some remonstrances to his chief upon his perfidy .

0	Hissing and spluttering as the hot lava came in contact with it , the water was in a continual state of ebullition , and the fish that abounded in its depths defied the angler ’ s craft ; they were , as <NAME> remarked , “ too much boiled to bite. ” At the beginning of April the weather changed .

0	We have given an account of <NAME> 's first voyage , which coincides with that of <NAME> according to <NAME> , who has compared the principal incidents of the two narratives .
0	The mujik and <NAME> resumed their way and arrived at the posting-house .
0	At this noise Torres woke , and with the quickness of those who are always on the watch , with whom there is no transition from the sleeping to the waking state , was immediately on his legs .
0	They had been discovered with four others , from nine to twelve degrees further east , by the <NAME> Captains Marion-Dufresne and <NAME> , in 1772 .
0	The torches were held over the opening : nothing could be seen .
0	`` The colour of their skin is clear brown , their hair is very black , their faces are round , their nose and lips are somewhat thick but not flat , their eyes are black and bright enough , and tolerably expressive .
0	“ No , I tell you ! ” “ I must examine -- ” “ You shall not examine. ” “ You may perhaps have broken -- ” continued <NAME> .
0	They were in some danger in crossing the bar , but that was their last .
0	A price was set upon his head , but he managed to escape from his pursuers .
0	It was the hand of a woman or child , a <NAME> !
0	We can not blame their conduct greatly , for after all , from what point of view can they have judged us ?
0	But <NAME> did not look back .
0	The <NAME> of the <NAME> XXII .
0	But where a stranger would have suspected nothing , the sharpened senses of the <NAME> detected the approach of danger .
0	It was easy to give a name to these gigantic bones , in some instances as big as trunks of trees .

0	<NAME> <NAME> rejoined him , and they observed with terror that this rumbling , which awakened their companions , came from beneath them .
0	He knew that above this seam lay the <NAME> of <NAME> , that there extended <NAME> and <NAME> .
0	When I rose , I perceived <NAME> and his lieutenant on the platform .
0	The poor princess was put under the care of <NAME> , the son of <NAME> , who did not ascend the throne until 1295 , when his uncle , the usurper , was strangled .
0	He was a sailor of some sixty years , but still vigorous and sturdy , with , an open , honest countenance .

0	The good , and peaceful , and imperturbable Hans would certainly not have arisen from his sleep without some serious and grave motive .
0	There was still a height of a thousand feet to overcome .
0	It was , therefore , much better to tow it to the beach at <NAME> .

0	As a fact there was nothing to recall me to <NAME> .

0	The wheels were in a good condition and firmly fixed , but the springs had lost all elasticity .
0	I sent the <NAME> priests after him , I got you intoxicated at <NAME> , I separated you from him , and I made him miss the <NAME> steamer . ''
0	The shed was closed on all sides and only one opening left , to which the natives crowded with the wares they wished to exchange .
0	His will appeared so fixed that <NAME> was forced to consent , and he left him there , having given him at his request various seeds of fruits and vegetables .
0	The whole population were immediately set to work on the fortifications .
0	At length the vessel hove in sight of the town of <NAME> , upon the island of the same name , and , on the 15th of April , at 11 o ’ clock in the morning , she anchored in the port .
0	He brought the news that in company with <NAME> and four other persons , he had reached a great river called the <NAME> , flowing towards the south .
0	There is a want of clearness as to dates at this part of his life , which makes it difficult to give a correct narrative of these voyages in their right order .
0	Then he murmured some phrases in an undertone which none in the solitude of the <NAME> forests could hear , and which no one , had he been anywhere else , would have heard .
0	Tell us what we ought to do , and we will do it. ” “ I am at your orders , master , ” added <NAME> .
0	Will you allow me to live there with them ? ''
0	They had suffered a thousand privations and been exposed to a thousand dangers in the midst of these barbarous negro tribes .
0	“ His days , then , are shorter than ours ? ” interrupted the captain .
0	Consequently , we must not lessen her crew. ” <NAME> said nothing more , as if convinced his <NAME> was right .
0	The journey promised well , much better than the expedition begun in the dead of winter in search of coal .
0	<NAME> , that 's a sad memory !
0	It was one worthy in every way of its recipients , worthy of the <NAME> , worthy of the <NAME> , and , best of all , every man , woman , and child in the <NAME> could take part in it .
0	<NAME> Harding then thought of exploring in the half-light the large circular layer which supported the upper cone of the mountain .
0	Then , turning towards the <NAME> and <NAME> : `` A repast awaits you in your cabin , '' said he .
0	`` Sir , '' continued <NAME> , `` let us suppose an impossibility : if <NAME> should this day offer you your liberty ; would you accept it ? ''
0	It was but a brief struggle ; the seal struggled for a few seconds , and was then suffocated on the breast of his adversary , who , dragging him away easily , in spite of his size , and springing lightly from one piece of ice to another , reached land and disappeared with his prey .
0	It takes particular care that the religious customs of the <NAME> should be respected , and if your servant were caught -- '' `` Very well , <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> ; `` if he had been caught he would have been condemned and punished , and then would have quietly returned to <NAME> .
0	During this time they partook of some refreshment , and then they returned to their task .
0	[ Illustration ] The doctor remembered <NAME> 's ingenious theory about these meteors ; he supposed that certain clouds composed of prisms of ice are hanging in the air ; the sun 's rays falling on these prisms are refracted at angles of sixty and ninety degrees .
0	The thickness of the walls of the projectile prevented any sound reaching from the inside to the outside .
0	That friend , crushed , stifled , bruised by the dreadful arms of a poulp , pounded by his iron jaws , would not rest with his comrades in the peaceful coral cemetery !
0	To stop , to hide himself behind some tree trunk , to disappear under a bush , might induce the guariba to pull up and retrace his steps , and there was nothing else for <NAME> to try .
0	Latterly he had seen much , but he had reflected more .
0	The next day , March 26th , I resumed my miner 's work in beginning the fifth yard .
0	Her head and neck , shoulders , ears , arms , hands , and toes were loaded down with jewels and gems with bracelets , earrings , and rings ; while a tunic bordered with gold , and covered with a light muslin robe , betrayed the outline of her form .

0	They thought of returning to <NAME> ; the sky had become perfectly clear , and while waiting for the moon to rise , the splendor of the stars was magnificent .
0	`` Yes , my boy ; and you need not try to compute the number of these infusoria .
0	I must add that , during the night , the phosphorescent waters of the <NAME> rivalled the electric power of our watch-light , especially in the stormy weather that threatened us so frequently .
0	I thank you , nevertheless , and I consider myself as twice your debtor. ” And having said so , <NAME> saluted the young men , who in turn saluted him , and set out on their way to the farm .
0	“ Poor , unfortunate man ! ” said <NAME> .
0	<NAME> <NAME> , by this resolution , inevitably sacrificed himself ; he pronounced his own doom .
0	`` Tell us , <NAME> , '' said <NAME> , `` something about <NAME> 's theatre ; did they act new plays there ? ''
0	He laughed at difficulties , whether in the science of magnitudes , that is algebra , or in the science of numbers , that is arithmetic ; and it was a treat to see him handle the symbols , the conventional signs which form the algebraic notation , whether letters of the alphabet , representing quantities or magnitudes , or lines coupled or crossed , which indicate the relation between the quantities and the operations to which they are submitted .
0	Millions of luminous fragments streaked the sky with their blazing fires .
0	The presence of <NAME> on such an occasion would have been most valuable .
0	They applaud , call before the curtain , make loud acclamations !
0	At any rate , it was not enough to frighten away the band , and <NAME> had only just time to get up to <NAME> , where at least he was in safety .
0	`` Besides , '' added <NAME> , `` may we not find in the sound some ship that has been forced to winter there . ''
0	It was at this time falling into ruins , and every discharge of cannon did evident damage .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> were embarked in different boats .
0	`` The ` Assumption ' can not last , '' replied <NAME> .
0	This etext was done by a number of anonymous volunteers of the <NAME> , to whom we owe a great deal of thanks and to whom we dedicate this book .
0	During the night the ship might disappear and leave for ever , and , this ship gone , would another ever return to the waters of <NAME> ?
0	<NAME> , he 's a good sailor , although he 's <NAME> -- there are good people everywhere -- and he takes in his supplies at the <NAME> . ''
0	In the obscurity , then very dense , he found it difficult to see ; but it was a human body that lay there , less than ten paces off , and perfectly motionless !

0	<NAME> <NAME> , innocent , will not fly ! ” The scene which followed these words was heart-rending .
0	Still the weather grew colder , and in these high latitudes even <NAME> felt the influence of the approaching winter .
0	You will tell us , will you not , even for his own sake , all you can about his habits and his lurking-places ?
0	cried the astonished and bewildered Professor .
0	<NAME> hesitated at first to reply , and <NAME> regretted that <NAME> had so thoughtlessly put this question .

0	“ The <NAME> generally brings a tempest which lasts three days , and may be always foretold by the depression of the mercury , ” he said .
0	Not that he was uneasy about the future , but he wanted to know at any cost _why_ his projectile had deviated .
0	A diabolical noise of cymbals , trumpets , and drums , all played together , announced the approach of the white men , and <NAME> , the king , gave them a most hearty welcome , ordering <NAME> to behead every one who should molest them .
0	He was , in fact , a thorough <NAME> , adventurous , but not an adventurer ; a hare-brained fellow , a kind of <NAME> , only possessing relays of wings .
0	The expedition upon the bank of the river had been sent by the governor of <NAME> .
0	`` <NAME> , '' murmured <NAME> , `` I am thy betrothed . ''
0	The engineer wished to see if the wire still ran along the side .
0	“ It is the wind , ” said he .
0	Undoubtedly they were the same words he had before attempted to utter .
0	The sail was spread , and the frail structure commenced its progress toward the land , aided by wind and tide .
0	`` I know it , '' he said , in that calm tone which could counteract the most terrible apprehensions .
0	At every turn of the path we were following , the lake appeared in all its length and breadth .
0	de <NAME> , de <NAME> , and Boutevilliers , were sent to examine it .
0	`` You see , '' I said , after careful measurement , `` that I am not mistaken .
0	The guides and porters having distributed the provisions between them , the signal for departure was given , and we set off in the midst of profound darkness , directing ourselves according to the lantern held up at some distance ahead .
0	This tablet bore the following inscription : -- Who have suffered and perished in the cause of science and the service of their country .
0	“ But I would pay you to wake him. ” The captain had overheard the tenor of the conversation , and interposed sternly , “ Hakkabut !

0	“ We ’ re right among the breakers ! ” said <NAME> .

0	<NAME> and the <NAME> had commenced examining the floor , previous to operating on the bottom light .
0	Meanwhile , though the town resumed its habitual phlegm , and became apparently <NAME> as before , it was observable that , at bottom , the character and temperament of the people changed little by little .
0	Early next morning , this handy little craft was sufficiently freighted with coal ( of which there was still about ten tons on board the <NAME> ) , and manned by nobody except the captain , the count , and the lieutenant , left the harbor of the <NAME> , much to the bewilderment of <NAME> , who had not yet been admitted into the secret .
0	Feeling he could not long keep master of himself at this unexpected meeting , he covered his eyes with his hands and walked quickly away .
0	`` No , my friends , '' said the engineer , `` wait till night .

0	But there were many malcontents who were ready to revolt against their authority , and it was while this bad spirit was abroad that the admiral arrived at <NAME> .
0	It was built of long planks , bent at each end , and kept in position by two strong cords .
0	<NAME> Harding then busied himself in drawing the plan of the vessel and making the model .
0	A sad voyage , for the courageous searching party to come back to the port without bringing home <NAME> with them !
0	I scarcely dared to lower my eyelids , fearing to lose the last spark of this fugitive light .
0	“ The ‘ <NAME> ’ cruised about on this coast until the 3rd of March .
0	Had not <NAME> , in 1751 , sailed into the <NAME> seas ?
0	<NAME> <NAME> was right in the choice he had made , and if , as appeared probable , the gipsies should follow the second route from <NAME> to <NAME> , he had every chance of arriving before them .
0	`` None whatever , '' said <NAME> , `` and the proof is , that the moon has preserved no trace of the gaseous envelope which always accompanies comets . ''
0	“ <NAME> , indeed ! ” muttered the Jew maliciously between his teeth .
0	It was <NAME> , slightly wounded in the shoulder , and <NAME> , safe and sound , whom their friends received with open arms .
0	Each day <NAME> and <NAME> ascended the plateau of <NAME> .
0	If <NAME> was right , was not <NAME> an ass ?
0	`` They are mistaken , '' answered <NAME> ; `` if they would only reflect , and consider our condition , they would see we are simply going from one imprudence to another . ''
0	`` I have remarked that pyramidal peak myself , '' replied <NAME> ; `` but I can assure you that so far it has received no name as yet , although it is likely enough to have been distinguished by the terrestrial astronomers .
0	<NAME> <NAME> was then crossed , and on the 10th July , <NAME> arrived at <NAME> , the furthest point reached by his predecessors .
0	`` Nothing is more easy than to reduce this mass to one quarter of its bulk .
0	He felt along the vertical sides of the shaft with his hand , and some few minutes later , he would go on again in the following style : `` This is gneiss .
0	<NAME> Hans the guide mean to abandon us ?
0	“ My Lord -- <NAME> ! ” she exclaimed , clasping her hands , “ I tell you my father is there !
0	The <NAME> had been steaming on for almost two hours , when the young <NAME> , addressing herself to <NAME> , said , “ Are you going to <NAME> , brother ? ” “ Yes , sister , ” answered the young man .
0	It was here that <NAME> , in 1826 , twenty-six years before the date when our story opens , was received by the proprietor of the fazenda .
0	To all this deeply interesting information , though the fruit of observation the closest , aided and confirmed by calculation the profoundest , <NAME> listened with the utmost indifference .
0	“ The fellow knows how to make a good bargain , ” said <NAME> , as <NAME> , after casting a distrustful look around , went out of the cabin .
0	Do you see , ” he added , laughing , “ I had no confidence , for my part , in your forests and your prairies ; they were out of reason .
0	My uncle was fearful to be too ready with his supply of food .
0	<NAME> , seizing the telescope , rapidly swept the horizon , and stopping on the indicated point , that is to say , on that which had made the almost imperceptible spot on the photographic negative -- `` I 'm blessed but it is really a vessel ! ''
0	This was anything but a cheering prospect for the <NAME> , whose policy it was to maintain the system that had hitherto worked so well .
0	<NAME> also visited <NAME> , and ascertained that <NAME> , in that group , is an active volcano .
0	At the porch of the chapel the minister awaited the arrival of the wedding party .
0	Deep wounds denoted great despair .
0	“ He ! ” cried <NAME> , from whom the word escaped with a fury he could not conquer .
0	That very night , at 12 o'clock , within nineteen hours at furthest , at the very moment of <NAME> , they were to reach her resplendent surface .
0	The sail was taken in , and everything made snug for a tedious period of inaction .
0	Even at church , during the sermon , the faithful could not listen to <NAME> , the minister , in patience , and he threw himself about in the pulpit and lectured his flock with far more than his usual severity .
0	He is a great deal too indulgent to my little self. ” “ Well , then , dear Minha , ” said <NAME> , “ I shall profit by that permission to remind you -- -- ” “ Of what ? ” “ That you were very busy in the library at the fazenda , and that you promised to make me very learned about everything connected with the <NAME> .
0	Their voices sounded faintly to each other .
0	He was charged , arrested , tried , and sentenced to death .
0	Dozens of babies , who were born at the time when the works were resumed , had never yet breathed the outer air .
0	Her captain hailed them , and this was the last good-by to the crew of the <NAME> .
0	And yet in these parts , to advance is all very well , but one must also maintain his position and not run the risk of losing it .
0	“ In a moment , ” said <NAME> .
0	What time lost , what useless emotions !
0	The Major , who was always the surgeon on great occasions , began to strip the unfortunate that he might dress his wounds ; but he had scarcely put his hands on the dying man when he started up as if touched by an electrical machine .
0	Remain the extraordinary mathematician that you are .
0	“ My hand does it so naturally , and one ’ s hand is never mistaken ! ” “ Then can the convicts have been on board ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	It was to be hoped that a storm would not burst whilst they were among the mountains , for there it would be terrible .
0	Are there not people living in the Observatory who could explain all this ? ” “ <NAME> likely ; but what of that ? ” “ Let us be philosophers , and wait patiently until we can hear their explanation. ” <NAME> smiled .
0	so I suppose they drop into it. ” “ What you mean to say , <NAME> , is that the superior brilliancy of the moon eclipses that of stars of the sixth magnitude , therefore they vanish as she approaches. ” “ How beautiful all this is ! ” repeated <NAME> again and again , with her whole soul in her eyes .
0	<NAME> of <NAME> visited that part of <NAME> in <NAME> which is watered by the <NAME> and <NAME> , and saw the ruined city of <NAME> , passing by what is said to be the furnace into which <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> were thrown , and the tower of <NAME> , which he describes as follows .
0	`` But suppose a Selenite to be six times smaller than a man like us ! ''
0	With these words they returned to their companions .
0	`` I agree with you , honest <NAME> , '' returned the burgomaster , `` I agree with you .
0	Now , this note was dated six o'clock in the morning , and the active orang , accustomed to come frequently to the corral , had taken scarcely three quarters of an hour to cross the five miles which separated it from <NAME> .

0	<NAME> , after his marriage with the niece of the <NAME> de <NAME> , who belonged to one of the first families in <NAME> , accompanied the emperor , who was on his way to <NAME> , to the port of embarkation ; but the general , soon becoming tired of the frivolities of a court , so little in accordance with the active habits of his past life , set out again for <NAME> in 1530 , and landed at <NAME> .

0	Would you yield to the thirst for gold ?
0	“ It ’ s quite clear to me , from the way in which they made off , that they are unacquainted with fire-arms .
0	The admiral 's fears were but too well grounded ; <NAME> had scarcely landed before he had an interview with some of the malcontents , inciting them to a rising at <NAME> , and to a determination to expel <NAME> .
0	As the observer , however , increases his latitude either north or south , the band will gradually widen out into three detached and concentric rings , of which the innermost , dark though transparent , is 9,625 miles in breadth ; the intermediate one , which is brighter than the planet itself , being 17,605 miles broad ; and the outer , of a dusky hue , being 8,660 miles broad .
0	Arrived at this point the settlers retraced their steps , and at nightfall entered the <NAME> ; but they did not sleep before the question of knowing whether they could think of leaving <NAME> or not was definitely settled .
0	We had no longer to do with completely frozen vapour , but had to deal with the phenomenon called frost-rime , which often occurs in these high latitudes .
0	All this was strange , if not alarming , not to mention the rockets , signals , lights , and lanterns of every sort .
0	Full of spirits , the party left the Hive , and chattering and singing as they went , made their way down to the frozen shore , where they fastened on their skates .
0	<NAME> at that great chasm just below us , somewhat to the right .
0	<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> came up beside the corpse , which was already stiffened by the ice .
0	At the end of this fourth day not a single person doubted but that it contained the vindication of the doomed man .
0	Their weapons were javelins tipped with a fish-bone .
0	What a splendid thing it is !
0	It is about fifty-five leagues to the west of the <NAME> frontier .
0	The moon , then in her last quarter , was beginning to rise above the horizon .
0	In fact , what could be more tantalizing ?
0	<NAME> was only exhibited in him by movement , his senses had not as yet been restored .
0	Mary and <NAME> were the captain ’ s only children .
0	And in addition to these , there were large deposits of nitrate of soda and iron pyrites , such as were required for the manufacture of the meli-melonite .
0	He wanted to say a word further in the <NAME> ’ s interest , but <NAME> stopped him with a glance , and afterward said to him : “ No , <NAME> , we must think of those who ventured their lives .
0	It was then possible to land , and , picking up such of the enemy 's weapons as were scattered about , the victors contented themselves with towing away one of their pirogues and destroying the others . ''
0	This , however , was not admissible in the case of <NAME> .
0	The ship labored on the lumpy sea , and rolled heavily in the trough of the waves .
0	replied <NAME> , who spent the next two hours pacing backward and forward on the quarter deck , watching the hauling in of the sounding line , and occasionally casting a glance towards all quarters of the sky .
0	But he had not enjoyed one moment of repose .
0	`` Is Conseil going to risk it ? ''
0	He had scarcely been there five minutes when a hand was laid heavily on his shoulder .
0	<NAME> , forward ! ” But just as the two were about to leave the platform , a voice , as yet far distant , was heard in the depths of the shaft .
0	We had then to go up a very narrow zigzag path , which follows the edge of the <NAME> glacier , and along the base of the Aiguille-du-Midi .
0	That will not do for me .
0	It was nightfall before the promontory was doubled .
0	“ There is the pass of <NAME> , on the slope of the volcano , in latitude , 37 degrees 30 ’ , or , in other words , only half a degree out of our way. ” “ That would do , but are you acquainted with this pass of <NAME> , <NAME> ? ” said <NAME> .
0	The number of icebergs coming from the nor'-west was therefore increasing ; there were now a hundred of them , and a collision with any of these might have a most disastrous result .
0	Compelled at the end of these ten years , in consequence of the revolutions which convulsed <NAME> , to take refuge at <NAME> and other islands of the same group , their efforts were there crowned with more success .
0	Thus the journey across <NAME> was accomplished , the given line of march being scrupulously adhered to throughout .
0	The weather during that day was horrible ; the snow , caught up in dense whirls , covered the brig with an impenetrable veil ; at times , under the influence of the hurricane , the fog would rise , and their terror-stricken eyes beheld the <NAME> 's Thumb rising on the shore like a spectre .
0	There was quite a rivalry between <NAME> and the young captain about getting first to the <NAME> coast .
0	It appeared there as if the mountain was vomiting flame .
0	I appeal to the ladies .
0	Once or twice more he spoke to the colonists who stood around him , and smiled on them with that last smile which continues after death .
0	And besides there was the ironwood ; and more particularly the _ “ ibiriratea , ” _ nearly black in its skin , and so close grained that of it the Indians make their battle-axes ; _ “ jacarandas , ” _ more precious than mahogany ; _ “ cæsalpinas , ” _ only now found in the depths of the old forests which have escaped the woodman ’ s ax ; _ “ sapucaias , ” _ one hundred and fifty feet high , buttressed by natural arches , which , starting from three yards from their base , rejoin the tree some thirty feet up the stem , twining themselves round the trunk like the filatures of a twisted column , whose head expands in a bouquet of vegetable fireworks made up of the yellow , purple , and snowy white of the parasitic plants .
0	This would be our <NAME> .
0	It was here that <NAME> was obliged to leave the railway , which at the time did not go beyond that town .
0	It was there that <NAME> had agreed to meet his accomplices , and two days after gaining possession of the letter , he arrived at <NAME> .
0	His new freight represented fifty pounds , and he rated it far below the two hundred tons of cured hides which were stowed away in his hold .
0	Your head is surrounded with bandages and poultices that must not be touched .
0	And if even it was brought to the surface , how would the travelers have borne the terrible shock which 20,000 feet of water had perhaps not sufficiently broken ?
0	Whether it was science that emboldened <NAME> , his phlegmatic stoicism that propped up the <NAME> , or his enthusiastic vivacity that cheered the irrepressible <NAME> , I can not exactly say .
0	<NAME> had conveyed his portable kitchen to the oasis , and proceeded to indulge in any number of culinary combinations , using water all the time with the most profuse extravagance .
0	You can follow his plan .
0	that is the question , ” said the reporter .
0	The captain and his friends , followed at some distance by the eager Jew , soon left the glade and directed their steps towards the coast where the <NAME> was moored .
0	I remained thus until six in the morning , without <NAME> noticing me .
0	`` I wished to give you a sight of the curious spectacle of a submarine eruption . ''
0	“ There is no doubt about it now , ” repeated Harding .
0	`` Well now , '' murmured the president `` why did we not hear the detonation ? ''
0	The guide now led the elephant out of the thicket , and leaped upon his neck .
0	No news of the fleet having reached the army for twenty-one weeks , they had given up all hope of seeing it again , and great was <NAME> 's joy when <NAME> appeared before him , though the hardships he had endured had altered him almost beyond recognition .
0	To what cataclysm is this phenomenon to be attributed , so frequent in <NAME> , entire forests struck dead by some epidemic ; no one knows ; neither the oldest natives , nor their ancestors who have lain long buried in the groves of the dead , have ever seen them green .
0	Do you not see the <NAME> flag ? ” and , as he spoke , he pointed with national pride to the <NAME> standard floating over the top of the island .
0	The cart might then be driven there , and towards the end of December they tried the onagas for the first time .
0	I informed my companions of the reason why the name of <NAME> had been changed to that of <NAME> in <NAME> Pym 's narrative , and of the circumstances under which the half-breed had apprised me of the fact .
0	During the struggle , at the first blow I struck Torres in his chest , my manchetta was stopped by some hard substance under his poncho , like a plate of metal -- -- ” “ That was the case ! ” said <NAME> .
0	<NAME> as were their actual discoveries , their rectification of the errors of their predecessors were of yet greater value .
0	The ship was to follow a route parallel with that of the boat , of which it was never to lose sight for a moment ; but M. <NAME> had scarcely been gone a quarter of an hour when <NAME> .
0	<NAME> <NAME> had , it is true , exhausted fifty-two of the eighty days in which he was to complete the tour , and there were only twenty-eight left .
0	The same reception awaited the Spaniards at the <NAME> , at <NAME> , and at <NAME> , upon which ginger was found for the first time .
0	Accordingly , they were left on one of the <NAME> , <NAME> , in 12 degrees 15 minutes S. lat , and 169 degrees W. long .
0	His principal duty consisted in examining pilots , who were not allowed to go to the <NAME> until after having passed this examination .
0	Now , should they seize them with violence and master them by force ?
0	The mouth of the cave was guarded by one ferocious monster , the interior was inhabited by something too hideous to contemplate .
0	However , at that moment the engineer observed that the wire appeared to be slack , and on arriving at post Number 74 , <NAME> , who was in advance stopped , exclaiming -- `` The wire is broken ! ''
0	said <NAME> , holding his chronometer in his hand .
0	Meanwhile the natives made hostile demonstrations .
0	It was singular , to be sure , but it was really a fact .
0	In <NAME> the <NAME> , in <NAME> the <NAME> , and in <NAME> the <NAME> established counting-houses and offices , whilst missionaries endeavoured to win over to the <NAME> faith and modern ideas the unchangeable `` Empire of the <NAME> . ''
0	`` Do you want to be within a few miles of the Pole without being able to reach it ? ''
0	From the ocean their gaze returned to the island which they commanded entirely , and the first question was put by <NAME> in these terms : “ About what size is this island ? ” Truly , it did not appear large in the midst of the immense ocean .
0	“ May I ask you what is the most distant date when we may expect the relieving army ? ” “ Six days at most , sir , ” replied the <NAME> .
0	His plan was bold , but it might succeed , thanks to the darkness of the night .
0	But this extraordinary creature could transport itself from one place to another with surprising velocity ; as , in an interval of three days , the Governor <NAME> and the <NAME> had observed it at two different points of the chart , separated by a distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues .
0	should be `` the doctor loaded the gun with the last charge of powder '' to agree with the <NAME> and the sense of the paragraph .
0	They were able , however , to turn to account some empty tins which had contained soups ; the labels , although dirty and tarnished , were much admired by the natives , one of whom strutted proudly about for some days wearing an empty tin on his head , bearing four labels of `` concentrated essence of meat . ''
0	`` And , in fact , there would be nothing surprising in it . ''
0	The silence was only interrupted by the cries of <NAME> urging on his burdened team .
0	He was received by the whole troop of his majesty ’ s wives , to the harmonious accords of the “ upatu , ” a sort of cymbal made of the bottom of a copper kettle , and to the uproar of the “ kilindo , ” a drum five feet high , hollowed out from the trunk of a tree , and hammered by the ponderous , horny fists of two jet-black virtuosi .
0	A foggy veil , a sort of greyish mist still hung over the iceberg .
0	The way in which his advance was received the good orderly never divulged , but henceforward he maintained the firm conviction that there was something very much amiss up in the sky .
0	161 Natives of the <NAME> .
0	It is the depôt for all the traffic between <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , and itself produces choice merchandize , silks , saffron , horses , and asafoetida .
0	In reality , however , it was the <NAME> , which grows solitarily on the <NAME> plains .
0	I went up to him .
0	A commotion is going on there , of which we can neither estimate the importance nor the ultimate result . ''
0	This was the cause of the accumulation of ice , which became gradually soldered together , under the double influence of the increased pressure and of the cold .
0	The eloquent secretary of the <NAME> was no longer master of himself .
0	`` That 's a generous supply , '' said the carpenter .
0	But on the third day the huts opened ; all the savages , men , women , and children , in all several hundred Maories , assembled in the “ pah , ” silent and calm .
0	The escort was commanded by <NAME> .
0	At one particular instant , it was so very vivid that <NAME> , who happened to be looking downwards , cried out , as if in transport : `` Oh ! !
0	`` Shall we be able to land ? ''
0	There is a rich supply of water , and we have no fear of suffering from thirst , which in our circumstances is of the last importance .
0	But yet , the mines will be exhausted , no doubt , and more rapidly than the statistics make out ! ” “ That will happen , <NAME> ; and in my opinion <NAME> is very wrong in exchanging her fuel for the gold of other nations !
0	<NAME> seemed only to still exist on the surface of his body , like the last whiffs of smoke about a lamp just extinguished .
0	But his daughter <NAME> , standing on the threshold of the door , had heard all .
0	`` A man who has somewhere written his name with this very dagger -- a man who has endeavored once more to indicate the right road to the interior of the earth .
0	Is not _motion_ its result , no matter what may be its organization ? ''
0	`` We shall soon see , '' rejoined the sailor , `` but I would wager my head there are no rocks in the channel .
0	In the former case , they must have returned towards the corral , now without defenders , and which contained valuable stores .
0	Round these principal thoroughfares is interwoven a perfect network of unpaved alleys , intersected every now and then by four canals , which are occasionally crossed by wooden bridges .
0	“ Manoel loves your daughter , he is loved by her , and in this union they will find the happiness -- -- ” At the first words of <NAME> had risen , without being able to control a sudden start .
0	With such a balance the <NAME> might begin operations at once .
0	When he had been borne home , <NAME> lay upon his bed utterly crushed .
0	“ Not a drop ! ” was <NAME> ’ s answer .
0	As fate would have it then , <NAME> and his two companions were saved .
0	You stick at nothing. ” “ Major , will you bet your Purdy-Moore rifle against my telescope ? ” “ Why not , <NAME> , if it would give you any pleasure. ” “ Done , <NAME> ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
0	to teach them what war is , to inform them that we employ our time chiefly in devouring each other , in smashing arms and legs , and that too on a globe which is capable of supporting a hundred billions of inhabitants , and which actually does contain nearly two hundred millions ?
0	The astronomical observations , rendered possible by the calculation of the satellites of <NAME> , enabled us to rectify our maps .
0	It could be seen that there existed , in round numbers , a difference of five hours between the meridian of <NAME> and that of <NAME> , that is to say , it was midday in <NAME> when it was already five o ’ clock in the evening in <NAME> .
0	`` Can the divers readily reach such depths ? ''
0	As for me , amused and occupied by the incidents of travel , I had begun to forget the inevitable future ; but now I was once more destined to realize the actual state of affairs .
0	They consisted of salted and dried meats , smoked fish , biscuit , and flour ; mountains of coffee and tea were deposited in the store-room .
0	No train was expected from the east , neither had there been time for the succour asked for by telegraph to arrive ; the train from <NAME> to <NAME> <NAME> was not due till the next day .
0	`` I 'll tell you if I feel like it , '' cried <NAME> , folding his arms with an aspect of great dignity ; `` and I 'll not tell you if I do n't feel like it ! ''
0	In short , they assigned all the reasons that people invent who have made up their minds to refuse .
0	Since January 31st the sun had appeared above the horizon , but it gave only a pale and brief light ; fortunately the moon would rise at half past six , and with this clear sky it would make their path plain .
0	“ <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , taking the sailor ’ s arm , “ that is a wicked idea of yours , and you will distress me much if you persist in speaking thus .
0	Several had departure signals , and were preparing to put to sea at morning tide ; for in this immense and admirable port there is not one day in a hundred that vessels do not set out for every quarter of the globe .
0	Fortune again smiled upon the courageous traveller , and he had now the prospect of seeing these distant lands under exceptionally good and safe circumstances .
0	By means of the cord they would then be able to draw down the ladder to the ground , and so re-establish the communication between the beach and <NAME> .
0	“ Yes , a gold-mine , ” said the doctor , quietly .
0	A weight of four thousand pounds is represented by a displacement of the air amounting to forty-four thousand eight hundred and forty-seven cubic feet ; or , in other words , forty-four thousand eight hundred and forty-seven cubic feet of air weigh about four thousand pounds .
0	My worthy comrade , who gave me this cipher , who told me where I could find his old colleague , and the name under which he has been hiding himself for so many years , hardly suspects that he has made my fortune ! ” For the last time <NAME> glanced over the yellow paper , and then , after carefully folding it , put it away into a little copper box which he used for a purse .
0	Are you sorry that destiny has thrown us into <NAME> 's hands ? ''
0	At <NAME> , as we have seen , he met his companion , <NAME> .
0	After putting into port at <NAME> and <NAME> , at the extremity of the peninsular of <NAME> , they reached the island of <NAME> ( <NAME> ) , situated near the eastern entrance of the straits of <NAME> , and the island of <NAME> , called <NAME> .
0	Then , turning towards the orb of day , whose last rays lapped the horizon of the sea , he exclaimed : `` <NAME> , sun !

0	<NAME> <NAME> knew these fruits well .
0	<NAME> had admitted the tired dogs into the snow-house ; when the snow is falling heavily it serves as a covering to the animals , preserving their natural heat .
0	And by this reply from the engineer : -- `` We shall find one at the corral . ''
0	To him a voyage to <NAME> was merely a matter of course .
0	The head of the “ Bonadventure ” was put towards <NAME> , and a fair wind filling her sails , she ran rapidly along the coast .
0	That is a complete account of all that has been done in these regions during the last fifteen years ; and since the return of the <NAME> , no ship has ventured among these dangerous waters ! ''
0	`` It was exactly what I tell you .
0	No , the danger does not lie there ! ''
0	The explorers question whether , by a strange chance , they had not been transported into some ancient mine , of the existence of which even the oldest miners in the county had ever known .
0	How could they then prevent the pirates from landing ?
0	The extumescences on the plain became more and more marked .
0	It was <NAME> , already called <NAME> by <NAME> .
0	A richly-ornamented room , quickly traversed by the colonists , was joined to a library , over which a luminous ceiling shed a flood of light .
0	To a fresh demand for <NAME> 's papers and journals the sultan replied that he had none of them ; they were in the hands of some learned men ; but as <NAME> seemed to set such store by them , he would have them looked for .
0	It would have been an act of unpardonable rashness to leave the provisions in the storeroom of the <NAME> , her situation on the side of the iceberg being very precarious .
0	It seems , then , that if projectiles have gained in range , they have lost far more in weight .
0	The night passed quietly , for the breeze died away with the last light of day , and only rose again with the first streaks of dawn .
0	The doctor went in under the awning for a moment or two , to look at his still sleeping patient .
0	And madmen are respected on the prairies , even if they are not believed .
0	A little farther off he found a watering-place , but the hostile demonstrations of the inhabitants forced him to re-embark .
0	<NAME> , not wishing to retard him , obliged herself to walk .
0	<NAME> is logical in everything it does .
0	It is a part of my very soul that I have shut up in each of these cases of iron , silver , or gold !
0	These English or <NAME> adventurers , established in the <NAME> of <NAME> , off the coast of <NAME> , had sworn implacable hatred to <NAME> .
0	“ Something more you must lend me , ” he said , addressing the Jew .
0	“ The lake will cover us , ” said <NAME> .
0	And <NAME> carried far away from them , under we know not what conditions , they not knowing what had become of him !
0	It seemed as though no caravan had ever braved this desert expanse , or it would have left visible traces of its encampments , or the whitened bones of men and animals .
0	According to him , “ a soft and gentle breeze is constantly observable , and produces an evaporation , thanks to which the temperature is kept down , and the sun does not give out heat unchecked .
0	`` We shall have to beat the forest , '' said the engineer , `` and rid the island of these wretches .
0	`` The weather is lightening a little , '' said he .
0	But I will advance still farther on the road of inquiry and deduction , and I dare venture to say that this human sample or specimen belongs to the <NAME> family , which spread over the world from <NAME> to the uttermost limits of western <NAME> .
0	When <NAME> supported the proposition of <NAME> , he took for granted that he should accompany the expedition .
0	It was more than absurd , it was alarming .
0	“ Thanks ! ” he murmured hoarsely , but <NAME> did not hear him , for both alike had dropped fainting on the sand .
0	However , the <NAME> ’ s sleep did not last long ; for about ten o ’ clock he woke , sat up , and turned his ear toward the plain , listening intently , with half-closed eyes .
0	At the place where the magnetic meridians cross , the only phenomenon produced is the vertical position of the magnetic needle in two similar points of the terrestrial globe .
0	The travellers intended to devote to their journey the few weeks of good weather which nature allows to these northern regions .
0	If , then , this cavity was also drawn blank , he would have to suspend his researches .
0	“ Yes , captain. ” “ And it astonishes me also , <NAME> , ” replied he , “ but when we visit the hull of the brig , we shall no doubt find the explanation of the matter. ” “ Why , captain , ” said <NAME> , “ you don ’ t suppose that the ‘ Speedy ’ simply foundered like a ship which has struck on a rock ? ” “ Why not , ” observed Neb , “ if there are rocks in the channel ? ” “ <NAME> , <NAME> , ” answered <NAME> , “ you did not look at the right moment .
0	She would be well worth the trouble ! ” In fact , if the brig was still fit to navigate , the colonists ’ chances of returning to their native land were singularly increased .
0	A cannon was the engine <NAME> & Co. were to bring into action .
0	Just now let us think of something far more pressing . ''
0	“ And what distance is it to the <NAME> , captain ? ” “ About fifteen miles , ” replied the engineer .
0	She would only be safe by quitting <NAME> for ever .
0	A few minutes later a telegram was dispatched to the secretary of the underwriters at <NAME> , requesting answers to the following queries : `` About the ship <NAME> -- when did she leave <NAME> ?
0	Never did a voyage begin more prosperously , or a passenger start in better spirits .
0	Before commencing his recital , he told <NAME> about the escape of the convicts at <NAME> , and their appearance in <NAME> ; as also their complicity in the railway catastrophe .
0	Would not the millions of spectators that had thronged <NAME> to witness their departure , now rush to the other extremity of the <NAME> to welcome them back ?
0	On what does the honorable gentleman base his _most firm conviction_ ? ''
0	The surveys , the gradings , the cuttings , and the other preliminary labors in the great <NAME> , gave them incalculable aid .
0	But what has become of its motion ?
0	“ Who are you , gentlemen ? ” he asked in <NAME> , in a cold tone , but free from its usual rudeness .
0	It is decked , quite water-tight , and held together by solid bolts .
0	This terrible discussion , though they had the same idea , had produced internal spasms , and every one knows that paleness shows that anger has reached its last limits .
0	which are based upon the laws of mechanics , and it seems difficult to me to refute them .
0	<NAME> had been forgotten , the provisions were abundant and of good quality ; each vessel was provided with all kinds of scientific instruments by the best makers , a library of the most trustworthy authorities , passports couched in the most flattering terms and signed by every government in <NAME> , and unlimited credit in all the towns of <NAME> and <NAME> .
0	the soul of the little colony !
0	Fifty-five years later <NAME> and <NAME> completed the valuable work of <NAME> , and drew up the map of the Manañon as far as <NAME> .
0	“ <NAME> , stand up. ” As <NAME> was already standing , he could not get any higher , but he waited modestly for the geographer ’ s questions .
0	But what has won the greatest honor for the <NAME> government is that on the 31st of July , 1857 , after numerous frontier disputes between <NAME> and <NAME> , about the <NAME> boundary , the course of the <NAME> was declared to be free and open to all flags ; and , to make practice harmonize with theory , <NAME> entered into negotiations with the neighboring powers for the exploration of every river-road in the basin of the <NAME> .
0	What a wink it was that accompanied this sentiment !
0	Before long half the sky was overspread .
0	The three great regions form the sub-titles of the three books which compose the story .
0	The steam hissed and puffed out , the screw began to stir the waves , and by eight o ’ clock the last peaks of <NAME> disappeared in the shadows of the night .
0	On this subject , he regaled him with the most persuasive arguments , which , however , did <NAME> persuade <NAME> , and wasted his breath in pathetic entreaties , by which the latter seemed to be but slightly moved .
0	A hundred whales of the largest size could hardly have dashed up the ocean waves more violently .
0	The navy was recruited in those days by means of pressgangs .
0	<NAME> , <NAME> , how good our father was ! ” “ And so noble , so generous ! ” added <NAME> .
0	Could they go over the one hundred and twenty miles which lay between them and <NAME> ?
0	Thus then , at the end of the seventeenth century , a great part of the new world was known .
0	His hard eyes darted a piercing glance at the three men , who walked near him , but nothing denoted that he recollected being their fellow , or at least having been so .
0	`` It will doubtless attract the bears this way , for they are fond of the smell . ''
0	He returned to <NAME> , while <NAME> remained pensive .
0	Once the winter had set in , none of us could have escaped from that most terrible of fates -- dying of cold .
0	`` Is the dugong dangerous to attack ? ''
0	The two men could not live in the midst of these successive abysses , and after several attempts they let themselves slide on one of the slopes of the hill .
0	There was every reason to hope they might camp that same night on the banks of the <NAME> , an important river which throws itself into the <NAME> , south of <NAME> .
0	`` No , '' replied the engineer , `` it is our waggon of ammunition and provisions , and , if necessary , it would serve as an intrenchment . ''
0	<NAME> <NAME> became aware that the huge disc that had been looming through the clouds after the shock was the form of the retreating earth , to the proximity of which the one high tide they had experienced was also to be attributed .
0	It was the Major who was the medium of communication between these two souls , evidently made for each other .
0	The census of 1819 -- one of the strictest hitherto instituted -- gives the number of the colonists at 25,425 ; this return , it must be understood , does not take in the soldiers .
0	The next day , the 17th of April , the sailor ’ s first words were addressed to <NAME> .
0	Whatever you do will be best , when you wish me to join you in your researches , I am ready to follow you . ''
0	A glass cover , six inches thick and strengthened with upper fastenings , closed it tightly .
0	The official who accompanied the escort had perished with the greater part of the soldiers , and suspicion could not point against him .
0	The sides were everywhere entire ; but points of rock jutted out here and there , and by means of these points it would have been quite possible for an active creature to climb to the mouth of the well .
0	And so it happened that on the 29th of December Alcide Pierdeux , “ Ingénieur au <NAME> des <NAME> de <NAME> , ” was hurrying with lengthy strides through the crowded streets of <NAME> .
0	A ship intended for the search of the <NAME> and the <NAME> , and of <NAME> ?
0	THREE years after the events which have just been related , the guide-books recommended as a “ great attraction , ” to the numerous tourists who roam over the county of <NAME> , a visit of a few hours to the mines of <NAME> .
0	This town is built on the <NAME> , and the greater part of its outer walls is now in ruins .
0	`` Thanks , yes , the passport is all right . ''
0	`` Therefore , my brave boys , '' continued <NAME> , with some excitement ; `` away with melancholy !
0	These are the ordinary proportions . ''
0	The two friends -- for they were so -- no longer prowled round the opening of the inner well , nor did they bark or whine in that singular way which from the first the engineer had noticed .
0	But if you will allow me -- I have been thinking -- in place of stopping at <NAME> , I will go on to <NAME> .
0	<NAME> 's four moons , for instance , though on an average actually 2-1/2 times farther from their planet 's centre than the <NAME> is from us , are comparatively four times nearer to him on account of his radius being eleven times greater than the <NAME> 's .
0	`` No , sir ; '' was the pert reply ; `` but I think I can safely say I 've heard it spoken about . ''
0	The drops of hot blood splashed over these festive monsters , and the whole of this detestable crew groveled under a rain of blood .
0	<NAME> rejoiced in a well-sheltered harbor , which enabled her to utilize all the rich products of the <NAME> and the <NAME> .
0	We must go away -- before winter -- '' He drew himself up , and cast a last glance towards <NAME> .
0	Amongst the works of modern painters were pictures with the signatures of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , etc .
0	I think that means ‘ bark of a tree ’ in Australian. ” <NAME> nodded , and looked again at the travelers .
0	He stood motionless , watching the track of the yacht .
0	There is plenty of good birch bark and straw in the bottom ; it ’ s like a nest .

0	<NAME> is the termination of a long range of volcanic mountains , of a different character to the system of the island itself .
0	`` Yes , '' answered <NAME> ; `` but entering is not all , we have got to get out of it too . ''
0	He was a tall , vigorous , broad-shouldered , deep-chested man .
0	<NAME> is surrounded by reefs , through which , not without danger , the <NAME> found a passage , casting anchor in the same place as <NAME> had done , namely in <NAME> Bay .
0	No , it did not seem to him possible that such a man had ended in this vulgar fashion , carried away by a wave , drowned in the floods , a few hundred feet from a shore .
0	He is very crafty ; we must try to be even craftier . ''
0	`` Well then , my boy , '' he said , `` lean on my arm , and we will stroll along the beach . ''
0	`` It is enough to break one 's heart ! ''
0	He commenced operations by killing the fish with a bite near the gills , and proceeded to devour it , beginning at the head and finishing at the tail , without rejecting the bones , fins , scales , or entrails .
0	Was it to be conjectured that a fragment of the earth had been chipped off by the collision of a comet ?
0	a boat ! ” <NAME> saw it was impossible to undeceive the poor boy , but he tried once more by saying to the man at the wheel : “ Hawkins , you were at the wheel , were you not , when <NAME> was so strangely attacked ? ” “ Yes , your Honor , ” replied <NAME> .
0	He had said , `` I am <NAME> . ''
0	<NAME> Harding evidently could not resist fifty ruffians , all well-armed , who , either by penetrating by main force into <NAME> , or by starving out the besieged , could obtain from them what they wanted .
0	<NAME> <NAME> , in particular , was never wearied of telling him how on his return to the world he would be prosecuted for using false weights , and would certainly become acquainted with the inside of a prison .
0	In 1857 he worked up farther to the northward , and invested the fortification of <NAME> , built by the <NAME> on the bank of the river .
0	The major could scarcely restrain himself from cursing their destiny .
0	When in his turn he passed before his mother , <NAME> shut her eyes that she might not see him .

0	<NAME> then in a few words related the incidents of the voyage , and dwelt on the curious fact of the sort of passing gleam in the prisoner 's mind , when for an instant in the height of the storm he had become a sailor .
0	Both of them stopped before <NAME> and her people .
0	There were no mines to be opened , and no shafts to be driven thousands of feet into the crust of the earth .
0	`` Perhaps in this fact lay the explanation of their having no provisions to offer in traffic , for in other respects we found them fully alive to the hospitable instinct which more particularly commends the islanders of the southern seas to navigators . ''
0	All the greater reason why he should get out of the scrape by depending only on himself .
0	Indeed it was not an ape , it was a human being , a man .
0	said <NAME> , who seemed for an instant perplexed .
0	Was all I had heard really and truly possible ?
0	`` That is a claim I ca n't admit , '' answered <NAME> , gravely , forcibly restraining himself .
0	`` It is incomprehensible that we have not come in sight of them , '' said the captain .
0	<NAME> pars <NAME> , plate <NAME> .
0	It may readily be supposed that an event which deprived <NAME> of a large number of officers , and of thirty-two of his best sailors , was calculated to upset the plans of the expedition .
0	The atlas was a magnificent work , comprising maps of every country in the world , and several planispheres arranged upon <NAME> ’ s projection , and of which the nomenclature was in <NAME> -- but which also bore neither date nor name of publisher .
0	A moment after all four of the party had disappeared in the woods , and the elephant was bearing them away at a rapid pace .
0	<NAME> explained to her how it was that the honest and courageous <NAME> was arrested as a robber .
0	On the 14th of December , when the rainy season was drawing to a close , <NAME> and <NAME> started for <NAME> .
0	During one of these excursions , <NAME> managed to get hold of two couples of living gallinaceæ .
0	The possession of this brig , or rather all that she contained , was a perfect mine of wealth .
0	If my memory serves me , you are referring to the lighting plan of <NAME> . ''
0	<NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> had not even to stir up the Indians or to encourage them .
0	The nature of the voyage demanded vessels of peculiar construction .
0	395 Gigantic vegetation on the banks of the <NAME> .
0	“ It is worthy of remark that the ancient Pole will be immersed under more than 9000 feet of water , so that the district acquired by the <NAME> Practical Association will be flooded unless there exists at the Pole a plateau of more than that number of feet of elevation .
0	Never yet had any <NAME> wintered in these regions , in the midst of that slothful and immovable sea , which according to the very false expressions used by <NAME> , forms the girdle of the world , and in which is heard the uproar caused by the rising of the sun .
0	It was inevitably unfortunate , since <NAME> , or <NAME> , as he may be called , guided it , sometimes preceded , sometimes followed by his band of convicts , who had been told what they had to do .
0	They would have surely concluded that their present velocity would never be able to take them as far as the neutral point , not to talk of passing it .
0	<NAME> was nominated in his place .
0	<NAME> <NAME> had not passed through the many incidents by which his life had been checkered without acquiring some slight knowledge of medicine .
0	A robber does n't quite like to leave traces of his flight behind him ; and , besides , he is not obliged to have his passport countersigned . ''
0	The only quadrupeds the country produced were goats and half-wild pigs .
0	“ That is agreed , ” said <NAME> at length .
0	`` Under the circumstances , '' he said , `` I ought to neglect no precautions .
0	`` I shall try to keep in the offing until the flood , that is to say , till about seven in the evening , and if there is still light enough I will try to enter the gulf ; if not , we must stand off and on during the night , and we will enter to-morrow at sunrise . ''
0	But his services are not the less real , and are of such a nature that only a man possessed of prodigious power , could render them .
0	`` Do n't you think , <NAME> , it has always been as it is now ? ''
0	So the calculations of <NAME> , <NAME> , and other physicists prove that in our hemisphere there are two poles of extreme cold : one in <NAME> in latitude 79° 30 ' N. , and longitude 120° E. ; the other is in <NAME> , in latitude 78° N. , and longitude 97° W. This last alone concerns us , and you see , <NAME> , that it is more than twelve degrees below the Pole .
0	But if , as saith the proverb , there is no road which does not lead to <NAME> , so there is no circuit so long as not to lead to <NAME> , and of this Della <NAME> was to make proof .
0	`` Without doubt ; but do n't be proud of it , '' answered the doctor with a laugh .
0	All these and many other portions of the submarine apparatus which had been employed that very year for clearing the channel , lifting the wrecks and recovering the treasure , lay now at <NAME> , unused fortunately on account of the season of the year , and therefore they could be readily obtained for the asking .
0	The reporters ' items , just like the different stories and all the other component parts of the journal , are classified automatically according to an ingenious system , and reach the hearer in due succession .
0	It was , as I have said , almost that of a sphinx , a dusky-hued sphinx , as though the matter which composed it had been oxidized by the inclemency of the polar climate .
0	Arrived in harbour , after a prosperous voyage , <NAME> , to his no small surprise , found himself at first received with much respect , the governor <NAME> , as a shrewd man not willing to go against public opinion , doing him honour .
0	<NAME> was also the first to penetrate to the interior of <NAME> , of which the coast only was previously known .
0	Will this means of locomotion allow us to visit those suns which swarm in the firmament ?
0	Suddenly , a dreadful shock is felt , and the Projectile , shot up by the instantaneous development of 200,000 millions of cubic feet of gas , is flying into space with inconceivable rapidity !
0	“ But let us see where we are , ” he said .
0	They know they 're getting near latitude 72° , and that a thousand pounds is paid for every degree of latitude beyond which is reached . ''
0	On the north , from this breach to the sea , by the new water-course which had hollowed out a bed for itself across the plateau and shore , above and below the fall , and it would be enough to dig the bed of this creek a little deeper to make it impracticable for animals , on all the eastern border by the sea itself , from the mouth of the aforesaid creek to the mouth of the <NAME> .
0	Now , reserving for another discussion the means of producing this velocity , I will call your attention to the dimensions which it will be proper to assign to the shot .
0	It covers seven tenths of the terrestrial globe .
0	<NAME> is the strange romance conceived by the more than human genius of the greatest poet of the <NAME> .
0	These were then easily taken out , and drawn away by the lower end , which was hermetically sealed by means of a strong ligature .
0	It was only necessary to repress the marvellous dexterity of the natives in emptying pockets .
0	Toward five o ’ clock , the day began to dawn , bluish clouds marbled the upper stratum of clouds .
0	Her sobs and cries filled the air .
0	Throughout the voyage a register was at the service of the crew , in which all the incidents of the voyage were to be noted , so that the slightest errors , and the most insignificant oversights could be rectified before the facts of the case faded from memory .
0	Two days after starting , the <NAME> , having made four hundred and eighty miles , came in sight of the coast of <NAME> .
0	The submarine flora struck me as being very perfect , and richer even than it would have been in the arctic or tropical zones , where these productions are not so plentiful .
0	In this way we passed our first night in the interior of a crater .
0	<NAME> and silver pipes , and canes , dazzled the eye in every direction .
0	The <NAME> never moved a muscle of his face .
0	<NAME> <NAME> was calm , <NAME> more nervous , and <NAME> , a prey to sullen anger , walked to and fro on the rock .
0	“ Your Highness , ” answered <NAME> , “ ask me rather the name of the man who lies at your feet ! ” “ That man , I know him !
0	At the end of a month , the sheds being finished , three men were told off to remain at <NAME> .
0	`` My ship is on fire ! ''
0	All <NAME> would unite with me to save so devoted a son as he has been to her .
0	<NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> knelt down together upon the tiles of the room .
0	It would be such an earthquake as had never quaked before !
0	“ Indeed , <NAME> , ” replied <NAME> , “ I know few islands without some tale of the kind appertaining to them , and the romance of your immortal countryman , <NAME> , has been often enough realized before his day. ” “ Monsieur Paganel , ” said <NAME> , “ may I ask you a question ? ” “ Two if you like , my dear young lady , and I promise to answer them. ” “ Well , then , I want to know if you would be very much frightened at the idea of being cast away alone on a desert island. ” “ I ? ” exclaimed <NAME> .
0	This was also indicated by the second case of metal which had preserved them from damp , and which could not have been soldered in a moment of haste .
0	Four of the crew waited at the door , and conducted us to that cell where we had passed our first night on board the <NAME> .
0	No man had ever been nearer acquiring this glory for himself and his country .
0	Eight days after its departure , the <NAME> returned into the bay of <NAME> , with a whole flotilla of steamboats .
0	At 11 o ’ clock she dropped anchor off <NAME> , and at 2 P.M. the passengers arrived at <NAME> amidst the enthusiastic cheering of the <NAME> .
0	<NAME> is comprised in the series of ringed mountains of the first order , in the division of great circles .
0	It was <NAME> ; and what had happened to him was as follows : Shortly after <NAME> left the opium den , two waiters had lifted the unconscious Passepartout , and had carried him to the bed reserved for the smokers .
0	<NAME> <NAME> and his companions climbed <NAME> .
0	`` A fine lesson for princes , who thus in their lives are reminded that they are mortal , and that after their death the earth which contains their corpse will not be their own .
0	I immediately started for <NAME> , where the writer 's family lived ; the grandfather had served as quarter-master-general during the War of <NAME> .
0	At last we were about to leave our encampment and take up our stations ( some of the sailors were there already ) , when cries of amazement and fear were raised .
0	The ridge , however , had been violently ruptured , and now rose perpendicularly from the water .
0	It is more difficult than one would suppose for a captain to maintain perfect calmness and impassiveness in the midst of the worst dangers , even those he has reason to imagine likely to be fatal . ''
0	When the whole earth got cool in the first hours of the world 's morning , the diminution of the volume of the earth produced a state of dislocation in its upper crust , followed by ruptures , crevasses and fissures .
0	`` We have , '' said the Professor , who all this time was continuing his observations , `` and you may see by careful examination that these fossil fish have no identity with existing species .
0	And as for partners , if madam plays -- '' `` Certainly , sir , '' <NAME> quickly replied ; `` I understand whist .
0	<NAME> neither tried to join them nor to go near <NAME> .
0	He undertook to find all that was needed , and offered to take him to a <NAME> , not further than four miles off at most , where he could get supplies of all he wanted .
0	The <NAME> , being destined to a journey in arctic seas , contained the best arrangements for winter-quarters : the large room for the crew was well provided for ; the corners , where dampness first forms , were shut off ; in fact , when the temperature is very low , a film of ice forms on the walls , especially in the corners , and when it melts it keeps up a perpetual dampness .
0	An iron will prevented me from ever yielding to any obstacle .
0	The captain and passengers do not prepare for their departure by offering propitiatory sacrifices ; and , on their return , they no longer go ornamented with wreaths and gilt fillets to thank the gods in the neighbouring temple . ''
0	Not even the fire of a charcoal-burner was visible in the woods , not an encampment of miners near the mines , not a hut among the brushwood .
0	`` You are right , <NAME> , '' answered <NAME> , who had joined the two speakers ; `` she 's a good ship , and I must say that there was never a ship so well equipped for a voyage in the polar regions .
0	This noise was most decidedly of barking .
0	He came down without saying a word .
0	It was difficulty to persuade them to leave the vessel .
0	An immense saloon -- a sort of museum , in which were heaped up , with all the treasures of the mineral world , works of art , marvels of industry -- appeared before the eyes of the colonists , who almost thought themselves suddenly transported into a land of enchantment .
0	He told us so himself .
0	It was probable that , having seen their vessel engulfed in the channel , they had fled into the interior of the island .
0	When <NAME> rose from the table , all followed her example , and seated themselves at the door of the cottage .
0	He rushed about the room wild with delight and satisfaction .
0	The <NAME> detachment was now not more than fifty paces behind him .
0	In order to testify his gratitude to the captain he plunged his fingers into a bag at his waist , and offered to anoint his hair with the tainted oil it contained .
0	Do n't forget that it would take seventy-five moons to make the sun , and three hundred and fifty thousand earths to make up the weight of the sun . ''
0	`` Tell me , '' I asked , `` did <NAME> really come to <NAME> on board the <NAME> ? ''
0	This metal , in fact , is the most tenacious , the most ductile , and the most malleable , and consequently suitable for all moulding operations ; and when smelted with pit coal , is of superior quality for all engineering works requiring great resisting power , such as cannon , steam boilers , hydraulic presses , and the like .
0	`` You are right , '' said the doctor .
0	Hundreds of meteorites , ignited by the friction of the atmosphere , irradiated the shadow of the luminous train , and lined the cloudy parts of the disc with their fire .
0	T. <NAME> had exclaimed , “ Let us invent machines , let us find a fulcrum , and we will shift the axis of the <NAME> ! ” Many of you heard him , and will remember it .
0	<NAME> Tsing signifies `` heavenly spot , '' and the town owes this name to its agreeable climate and clear blue sky , and the fertility of its neighbourhood .
0	If there should be any land , he wanted to be the first to see it .
0	At length , at about six o'clock in the evening , a shapeless vapor appeared at a little height above the level of the sea ; it looked like a puff of smoke ; the sky was perfectly cold , so this vapor was no cloud ; it would keep appearing and disappearing , as if it were in commotion .
0	`` Certainly , '' replied <NAME> ; `` but that will render the working of the piece more difficult .
0	Perhaps ours do not reach them . ''
0	<NAME> heard the street door shut once ; it was his new master going out .
0	Behind in the west , but at a distance of four miles , rose the first trees of the forests of the <NAME> .
0	On the 24th January the two vessels started for the <NAME> , and stopped for a short time off <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
0	The sailor and his two companions returned to the shore , to the place where they had left the <NAME> .
0	If ideas did not crowd on their brains , we must despair of the <NAME> of 1853 .
0	The new revelation did not improve poor <NAME> 's fate a bit -- no matter for that !
0	<NAME> arrived , and the enthusiasm showed no signs of diminution .
0	Returning to the bright light , and examining it well , <NAME> perceived on his negative an almost imperceptible little spot on the sea horizon .
0	Here a rock , there a projection from the ground , seemed to be the much-sought-for projectile ; but their mistake was soon discovered , and then they were in despair .
0	<NAME> , <NAME> of the <NAME> .
0	His height diminished with the fantastic swiftness of objects rising in the air .
0	They soon made acquaintance with the Patagonians , and exchanged a few trifles , precious to the natives , for swansdown and gunaco skins .
0	The train will be there in an hour , and will stop there ten minutes .
0	`` A very natural one , '' answered <NAME> .
0	The <NAME> troops , who were descending the <NAME> , received every day fresh reinforcements , and , what was more serious , they were led by an officer , a traitor to his country , but a man of much note , and of an audacity equal to any emergency .
0	The atmosphere was clear , the temperature was even , and the thermometer had indeed gone up to two or three degrees above freezing-point .
0	In 1855 , Brun-Rollet , a native of <NAME> , appointed consul for <NAME> in <NAME> , to take the place of <NAME> , who had just died , set out from <NAME> , and , under the name of Yacoub the merchant , trading in gums and ivory , got as far as <NAME> , beyond the fourth degree , but had to return in ill-health to <NAME> , where he died in 1857 .
0	<NAME> had sent for a sail , and had it passed under the vessel in such a manner that the pressure of the water forcing it into the leak in a measure stopped it up .
0	He was left there to die without being put out of his suffering , and <NAME> , fastened to a <NAME> ’ s saddle , was obliged to follow the detachment on foot .
0	But every time he penetrated to any distance in the ruins , he was followed by a number of the inhabitants , who prevented him from examining anything in detail .
0	Look out for your boat-hook ! ''
0	They are a pastoral people , and have the faults and virtues of their class .
0	The movement set him thinking .
0	It was necessary , however , first to allow them to land , for with their close , short hair , and their fusiform conformation , being excellent swimmers , it is difficult to catch them in the sea , while on land their short , webbed feet prevent their having more than a slow , waddling movement .
0	They examined it under all its different aspects , physical , meteorological , economical , or moral , up to its bearings on politics or civilization .
0	“ Hurrah ! ” cried the sailor , who did not disdain to celebrate thus his own triumph .
0	The sea rolled heavily , and the wind at intervals rose almost to a storm , but happily blew from the south-west , and thus aided the steamer 's progress .
0	The sailors then closed the rings , so that the savages found themselves in fetters .
0	The fleet had neither corn nor meat , and they could not make up their minds to feed upon the tortoises that abound in that part of the coast .
0	<NAME> had been clever enough to bring down several brace of <NAME> , small green and yellow birds , which are excellent eating , and greatly in demand in the <NAME> market .
0	Did he know it before ?
0	The reef against which the corvette had run , was , therefore , not so wide as the vessel itself ; in fact , it was but the pointed summit of a rock .
0	Anyway , what else could have happened ?
0	<NAME> confirmed the <NAME> guide 's narrative of her touching history .
0	But stop -- without going out of one 's way to find a cause for war -- did not <NAME> once belong to the <NAME> ? ''
0	Nevertheless , as that which belongs to nobody belongs to all , the new society did not propose to “ take ” but to “ acquire. ” In the <NAME> there is no project so audacious for which people can not be found to guarantee the cost and find the working expenses .
0	I heard the moaning of the suddenly displaced air , and the noise of falling stones .
0	This evening we shall reach the confluence of the <NAME> and <NAME> , and after that there is not much chance of meeting natives on the way to Auckland. ” “ How far is it now , ” said <NAME> , “ to the confluence of the <NAME> and <NAME> ? ” “ Fifteen miles ; just about what we did yesterday. ” “ But we shall be terribly delayed if this interminable scrub continues to obstruct our path. ” “ No , ” said <NAME> , “ we shall follow the banks of the <NAME> , and then we shall have no obstacle , but on the contrary , a very easy road. ” “ Well , then , ” said <NAME> , seeing the ladies ready , “ let us make a start. ” During the early part of the day , the thick brushwood seriously impeded their progress .
0	there is quite a fortune here for me to realize if I am not the greatest of duffers ! ” It seemed as though the hands of <NAME> felt the enormous sum , and were already closing over the rolls of gold .
0	`` I am sure of it . ''
0	Evidently the <NAME> , who have often had much to do with <NAME> ships , had finally learned the value of these objects ; since the visit of the _Fox_ they had come frequently to this great storehouse , and had pillaged incessantly , with the intention of leaving no trace of what had been there ; and now a long drift of half-melted snow covered the ground .
0	What instinct guided this phantom with ease through passages so narrow as to appear to be impracticable ?
0	I hope you will not make me regret that I consented to give you a passage on the <NAME> . ''
0	you will soon get over that , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> .
0	This `` great attraction '' was to close the performance .
0	For three months , during which a day seemed an age , the <NAME> furrowed all the waters of the <NAME> , running at whales , making sharp deviations from her course , veering suddenly from one tack to another , stopping suddenly , putting on steam , and backing ever and anon at the risk of deranging her machinery , and not one point of the <NAME> or <NAME> coast was left unexplored .
0	But his aim had been accurate , and his bullet had hit its mark ; before the arrival of his friends he had plunged his knife into the beast 's throat , and it fell , never to rise .
0	A single feeling seemed to unite him to the outer world , his love for <NAME> , who was not separated from him .
0	<NAME> <NAME> remained for two days upon the scene of this terrible disaster , without being able to gratify the vindictive desires of his crew .
0	It had been recently done with lime , leaving on the rock a long whitish mark , badly concealed with coal dust .
0	By his marriage with <NAME> , daughter of <NAME> de <NAME> , proveditore of the fortifications of <NAME> , he had several children , and amongst them <NAME> , who first reached <NAME> by doubling the Cape of <NAME> , and <NAME> , who accompanied him in that memorable expedition .
0	You have all passed it , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , destined never to return home ; and for you this cape was well named <NAME> ! ''
0	But , who struck the first blow ?
0	It appeared to be very deep , and , as it were , puffed out .
0	`` There can be no doubt of it .
0	<NAME> <NAME> , in 38 degrees 42 minutes S .
0	The learned <NAME> pilgrim was accompanied by two friends , Dr. Erdl and <NAME> , a painter .
0	“ Six miles at least ! ” observed the one .
0	He learnt <NAME> 's adventures , and through what various trials the colonists had passed .
0	The awful and hideous storm still continues ; the lightning has increased in vividness , and pours out its fiery wrath like a brood of serpents let loose in the atmosphere .
0	Then he became more calm , regained his accustomed coldness of expression , and turning towards me : `` Now , <NAME> , '' said he , `` if you wish to go over the <NAME> , I am at your service . ''
0	To the north the disc of the sun seemed like a ball of fire , already horned by the cutting of the horizon .
0	At this place the beach was covered with little mounds , concealing perfectly spherical turtles ' eggs , with white hard shells , the albumen of which does not coagulate as that of birds ' eggs .
0	<NAME> <NAME> had not supposed that he should be attacked so soon ; he was rinsing out his mouth when the hubbub began , and did not hear my cries for help .
0	`` They have arrived , lieutenant , '' exclaimed a young midshipman , `` and they are doing what all travelers do when they arrive in a new country , taking a walk ! ''
0	And the doctor , dragging the old sailor under the tent , made him plunge his hands into a bowl of water , which the heat of the stove had kept liquid , although it was not much above the freezing-point ; but <NAME> 's hands had no sooner touched it than it froze at once .
0	They saw it as I saw it myself , and they will confirm my words . ''
0	The sudden transition from a position where all things seemed to smile on me , to that in which I found myself at that moment , weighed on my spirits like a horrible nightmare .
0	<NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and I took our places in the stern of the boat .
0	Extensive repairs were absolutely necessary , and the making of them compelled <NAME> to remain at <NAME> until the 18th of September .
0	<NAME> <NAME> was compelled , therefore , to remain .
0	But he could not make himself heard ; he dared not , could not make his friends even see him !
0	It appeared prudent to him to heighten the palisade and to flank it with a sort of blockhouse , which , if necessary , the settlers could hold against the enemy .
0	Saying which , he offered some water to the wounded dog , who swallowed it with avidity .
0	A parrot and dog which had also eaten of the fish died next day .
0	`` Yes , <NAME> , '' replied the captain .
0	It was evidently a detachment of horse advancing towards the Dinka .
0	`` Then we must remain in our car ? ''
0	At this time he sent away all his vessels to <NAME> to compel his companions to make a desperate resistance ; he recalled from Truxillo the forces under the command of <NAME> d'Alvarado , and entrusted to the latter a column of 500 men , which advanced to within several miles of the capital without having the slightest suspicion that the town was now in the hands of fellow-countrymen , who were fully determined to bar their passage .
0	The rest of the voyage of the <NAME> was in well-known waters .
0	The <NAME> indeed possessed in the highest degree what may be called “ the memory of the eye. ” The <NAME> , on the contrary , appeared especially organized to listen and to hear .
0	The entrance is narrow , and forts might easily be constructed to command vessels entering it .
0	The greater number , instead of leaves , shoot forth blades of capricious shapes , comprised within a scale of colours pink , carmine , green , olive , fawn , and brown .
0	“ <NAME> enough , but curious , and , what ’ s more , peculiar to <NAME> .
0	A great part of the population came out to meet the <NAME> , and more than one of them went as far as the middle of the bay in his kayak , fifteen feet long and two broad at the widest part .
0	Next day there were new entertainments and new exercises ; beginning with wrestling-matches for grown men and for youths , and proceeding with quail-fights , and feats performed by a camel and an elephant .
0	But she dared not , and she did well .
0	“ Huzza ! ” roared <NAME> , as the balloon -- thanks to its ascensional force -- shot up higher into the sky , with increased rapidity .
0	<NAME> was aware that by this mode of procedure , he and his companions would spare themselves needless humiliation .
0	In a corresponding part of the southern hemisphere you see <NAME> , the <NAME> , in which our poor human reason so often gets befogged .
0	<NAME> is ended -- the hours no longer strike -- the hands have stopped ! ''
0	“ But it would perhaps be a good thing to do it with this instrument , which is more perfect than that which you before used. ” “ What is the good ? ” said <NAME> .
0	The wind was fair ; the poor castaways put out to sea on this frail raft .
0	On the 24th March , the ships lost sight of each other in a dense fog a little above the western entrance to the Straits of <NAME> .
0	We have now reached the highest ridge of the <NAME> chain , and thus have merely to descend the slopes of the mountain .
0	Some cups of the infusion of elder berries , which took the place of coffee , had been served by <NAME> .
0	[ Illustration ] <NAME> took things less philosophically , so eager was he to renew his explorations .
0	The two ships at length reached D'Entrecasteaux Strait , which had escaped the notice of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> , and the discovery of which was the result of a mistake , which might have had dangerous consequences .
0	Consequently , even before the train had stopped , the doors were opened , and the panic-stricken passengers thought only of getting out of the carriages .
0	Finding it impossible to obtain the number of pigs he required at this port , the captain decided upon visiting the remaining bays of <NAME> , which he found better populated , more fertile , and more picturesque than that of Madre-de-Dios .
0	`` I have heard them talking about it , and they could make no more out of it than we can ; they imagined a thousand things which did not satisfy them in the least . ''
0	He went on without stopping , feeling no fatigue , obeying a potent instinct which allowed no room for thought .
0	But the sailors were exhausted after twenty-four hours of such terrible anxiety .
0	At last the <NAME> came into view ; and , at a quarter-past eleven in the evening of the 11th , the train stopped in the station on the right bank of the river , before the very pier of the <NAME> line .
0	It was the most important investigation he had undertaken .
0	Previously , to sail from <NAME> to <NAME> by an eastward course would have involved the passage of the <NAME> , the <NAME> , the <NAME> , the <NAME> , the <NAME> ; but what had happened now ?
0	He had scarcely touched land , when the natives assembled in a crowd upon the strand , prostrated themselves at his feet , and welcomed him with signs of the most profound respect .
0	This monster , this natural phenomenon that had puzzled the learned world , and over thrown and misled the imagination of seamen of both hemispheres , it must be owned was a still more astonishing phenomenon , inasmuch as it was a simply human construction .
0	All these wild stories were turned by him into songs , which earned him great applause in the winter evenings .
0	The drops of water were changed to sharp spikes .
0	In their excited state they would not have hesitated to do it .
0	<NAME> 's eye could take in the whole extent in an easy sweep from the <NAME> to the <NAME> , thus embracing within one glance not only the two polar stars of the present day , but also <NAME> and <NAME> , which , by reason of the _precession of the <NAME> , are to be our polar stars 12,000 years hence .
0	Nothing can be more life-like than his accounts of <NAME> customs , and the notices of their habits , their games , and their way of embalming the dead , in which the chemists of that period seem to have excelled .
0	<NAME> , who had succeeded in regaining his feet , set-out in pursuit of him , abandoning <NAME> .
0	He was always waited upon by a thousand pages and a thousand girls .
0	As to its dimensions , I could only conjecture them to be admirably proportioned .
0	Then , infested with poulps , medusae , and cuttle-fish , they would become immense centres of infection , since their waves would not possess 'these vast stomachs that <NAME> had charged to infest the surface of the seas . ' ''
0	It was much cooler , thanks to the violent and cold winds from <NAME> , which constantly agitate the atmospheric waves .
0	At five o ’ clock in the evening , <NAME> gave the signal to halt .
0	On the 18th of October , 1771 , the <NAME> , commanded by <NAME> , and the <NAME> de <NAME> , under the <NAME> , midshipman , set sail .
0	`` Yes , madam ; but circumstances have been against me .
0	They looked over the wood , but saw no signs of them , and <NAME> returned to the banks of the river , where magnificent mimosas were growing .
0	<NAME> was sleeping , then , badly enough , tossing about between the cloths which served him for sheets , and he was dreaming of making a more comfortable couch in his projectile when a frightful noise disturbed his dreams .
0	“ I foresee that they are going to make a god of me again , ” thought he , “ some son of the moon most likely .
0	They appeared to talk in several distinct dialects , which differ remarkably from <NAME> or <NAME> .
0	To this I owed my being discovered .
0	In the west of the town is a magnificent avenue of centenarian orange trees which were carefully respected by the architects who out of the old city made the new .
0	After one or two preliminary hems , I determined to inquire .
0	The truth is , that my spirits rose so rapidly , that I began to be indifferent to what had once appeared to be a terrible journey .
0	In the neighbouring woods was heard the unpleasant cry of the lyre-pheasant and of two other birds , which feebly imitate the tinkling of a hand-bell and the jarring noise of the saw .
0	`` Now , <NAME> , what do you miss now ? ''
0	She had already passed through rough experiences without seeming to suffer from them , for she was a sailor 's daughter , used from infancy to the fatigues of the sea , and even <NAME> was not dismayed to see her struggling in the midst of this severe climate , against the dangers of the polar seas .
0	The captives , still strictly guarded , saw the funeral cortege leave the inner inclosure of the “ pah ” ; then the chants and cries grew fainter .
0	He offered to arrange for me an excursion to the depths of the thick forests , which clothed the volcano up to the middle of the central cove .
0	Even <NAME> 's knowledge was lost to me , for this puzzling person did not appear once during our passage at full speed .
0	<NAME> knew all the sailors in <NAME> , and immediately set about engaging a crew .
0	Under these circumstances a terrible storm arose , and the <NAME> was mercilessly knocked about .
0	He had not time to fire all the barrels .
0	Yes , but not for everything !
0	Unfortunately the south winds had ceased , and when they re-commenced , they brought the expedition within an inch of destruction .
0	Fortunately for the intrepid student his side was victorious , and he was left free to proceed on his journey . ''
0	I was making my observations , when <NAME> and <NAME> awoke almost at the same time , under the influence of this reviving air .
0	The examination of the mine was carried on minutely .
0	Most of them were known to the captain , and <NAME> , who had accompanied <NAME> in 1767 , and Cook two years later , received a warm welcome from them .
0	Clearly , a deviation resulting from some cause .
0	“ Very well , ” said <NAME> , without speaking of the anonymous letter .
0	Having finished their repast , my two companions laid themselves down upon their rugs , and found in sleep a remedy for their fatigue and sufferings .
0	The bed was often obstructed by long weeds , and even by pointed rocks , which rendered the navigation very difficult .
0	From the windows of the palace important preparations on the opposite shore could be distinctly seen .
0	In time <NAME> became a partner .
0	There were the gigantic _ “ pria-rucus , ” _ ten and twelve feet long , cuirassed with large scales with scarlet borders , whose flesh was not much appreciated by the natives .
0	<NAME> was perfect silence ; but the thick padding was enough to intercept all sounds coming from the earth .
0	<NAME> , go and cut some resinous branches. ” Neb and <NAME> ran to the edge of the lake , shaded with pines and other green trees , and soon returned with some branches , which they made into torches .
0	The longitude at this height was of no importance , for all the meridians run together within a few hundred feet higher .
0	The gallant fellows knew that they were working for the fazender of <NAME> -- for the man whom they loved , for the chief of the excellent family who treated their servants so well .
0	`` Does it make any real difference whether it is one or the other ? ''
0	`` I should fancy it must be so , <NAME> , '' answered the carpenter .
0	The corvette advanced some minutes to westward , and the apparatus , provided with air , bore the same explorers to the depths of the ocean .
0	Before us was the steersman 's cage , and I expected that <NAME> was there directing the course of the <NAME> .
0	His companions were , if possible , more obstinate than he in their credulity .
0	Dr. <NAME> separated from his companions , made an excursion to the town of <NAME> , and rejoined the expedition , which resumed its march on the 12th of December .
0	Starting on the 3rd June , 1789 , from <NAME> , on the southern shores of the <NAME> of the <NAME> , accompanied by a few Canadians , and several Indians who had been with <NAME> , he reached 67 degrees 45 minutes N .
0	It was evident that the unlucky chance which had brought him into the presence of his mother had betrayed his incognito .
0	By looking steadily into its crater , you can see more cones than mortal eye ever lit on before .
0	`` Has he gone to work , or to rest ? ''
0	For twenty days , from January 31st to February 19th , the return was very much like the first part of the journey .
0	Their last ration of water was given them , and drunk with more avidity than satisfaction , for it was filthy , disgusting stuff .
0	The bomb was <NAME> .
0	At five o'clock in the morning the anchor was weighed .
0	The <NAME> correspondent was named <NAME> .
0	A Scotchman would have said , “ His bonnet was a thocht ajee. ” It appeared formed of bare earth , here and there pierced by reddish rocks .
0	He wanted to see it more near , perhaps at close quarters , it might be to take away some bits of it .
0	They had a famous chief , named <NAME> , a real Vercingetorix , so that you need not be astonished that the war with the <NAME> has become chronic in the <NAME> , for in it is the famous tribe of the <NAME> , who defend their lands under the leadership of <NAME> Thompson. ” “ But , ” said <NAME> , “ are not the <NAME> in possession of the principal points in <NAME> ? ” “ <NAME> , dear <NAME> , ” replied <NAME> .
0	I made no attempt to do this , being convinced that the hour would come when <NAME> would again speak to me of his brother , and of the efforts which he intended to make to save him and his companions .
0	But , on the other hand , in the eyes of disinterested or indifferent persons who were not affected by the event , what value could be assigned to this document ?
0	The street boys shouted after him , — “ Go along , old pole-shifter ! ” “ Hallo , old clock-jobber ! ” “ <NAME> ’ s the figuring tinker ? ” And a mob gathered and began to hustle him , and he had to seek refuge in the <NAME> mansion , where Mrs. <NAME> did her best to console him .
0	“ Because , I tell you , the mass of <NAME> is so inferior to that of the moon , that <NAME> would become the moon ’ s satellite ; the moon could not possibly become hers. ” “ Assuming , however , ” continued <NAME> , “ such to be the case -- ” “ I am afraid , ” said the lieutenant , interrupting him , “ that I can not assume anything of the sort even for a moment. ” <NAME> smiled good-humoredly .
0	By the way , I must buy some shoes and shirts .
0	I struggled with him and tried to force him away .
0	Few as those hours were , they seemed to those on board as if their end would never come .
0	This unfortunate beast had scarcely eaten three mouthfuls ; but the offence , the abuse , the crime -- whatever you will -- was committed and duly indicted , for the magistrates , at that time , had already begun to know how to write .
0	They are kept to the ship by the winter ; but who can say what plans they are not capable of forming ?
0	`` The deuce , '' said <NAME> , `` you have a happy temperament . ''
0	When <NAME> learned his share of the responsibility of this incident , he was not much disconcerted .
0	It was the amiable <NAME> , still very confused , who crept out of her retreat , though not without much persuasion , <NAME> encouraging her with most gracious words .
0	They wanted to be taken to a <NAME> port , and , if not to <NAME> , into <NAME> , situated on the northwest coast of <NAME> , and which was not blocked .
0	<NAME> silence reigned on board .
0	In place of accepting the breakfast of the sergeant , <NAME> invited the commandant and his wife to come and have theirs on board the jangada .
0	`` <NAME> said , my boy -- very well said ; it is indeed a mighty hothouse .
0	Birds , quadrupeds , and reptiles were resting motionless after the fatigues of the day , and the silence of the desert brooded over the far-spreading Pampas .
0	The sailors complained of it , and symptoms of scurvy appeared on board .
0	We have passed the point at which the projectile would have stopped if its speed had only been 12,000 yards at starting .
0	Nevertheless he was still sad and reserved , and joined more in the work than in the pleasures of his companions .
0	After various useless searchings , the officer in command of the sloop came upon some traces , as he landed upon the shore , near <NAME> .
0	Our lamps threw over this place a sort of clear twilight that singularly elongated the shadows on the ground .
0	It is evident that the ex-Viceroy had again become the hardy navigator of his earlier years .
0	“ Into the house ! ” said <NAME> ; “ make haste ! ” And in truth , as they could not attack them at once , the best thing they could do was to get into shelter without delay .
0	`` Well , you English will ever be the same .
0	`` Men or beasts may possibly object to our visit .
0	To think that all that might be pillaged and that the settlers would have all their work to do over again , fresh weapons and tools to make , was a serious matter .
0	It was decided that the castaway , or rather the stranger as he was thenceforth termed by his companions , should live in one of the rooms of <NAME> , from which , however , he could not escape .
0	_phyj slyd dqfd_ and that gave _o.vd rdv .
0	Dr. <NAME> was received with all the honors by the guards and favorites of the sultan ; these were men of a fine race , the <NAME> so-called , a pure type of the central <NAME> populations , strong , robust , well-made , and in splendid condition .
0	Will you promise me to do so ? ” “ On my honor , ” answered <NAME> .
0	He took the bullet , turned it over and over , rolled it between his finger and thumb ; then , turning to <NAME> , he asked , -- “ Are you sure that the peccary wounded by this bullet was not more than three months old ? ” “ Not more , captain , ” replied <NAME> .
0	The evening twilight came on .
0	`` But must it be propped up ?
0	They were discouraged by the death of <NAME> .
0	On that day they finished the bear , with some biscuits they found on the ship , and a few cups of tea ; then fatigue overcame them , and each one sank into a sound sleep .
0	But the chairman was unknown !
0	I to urge you to an act which would be the disgrace of a life consecrated to the highest speculations of the higher mechanics ? ” “ <NAME> , Mrs. Scorbitt !
0	`` The town of <NAME> , '' says the narrative , `` shut in between bare hills , can be seen from afar ; the whiteness of its buildings rendering it very conspicuous .
0	His town had just been burnt , his generals and his best soldiers had perished in a battle with the people of <NAME> , and he himself had had a narrow escape when his house and all his treasures were destroyed by fire .
0	The provisions , which <NAME> had already packed up , consisted of a store of meat and of several gallons of beer , that is to say , enough to sustain them for three days , the time which <NAME> assigned for the expedition .
0	The vast number of notes collected by <NAME> during the year he spent in <NAME> , and which led to the publication of his <NAME> on <NAME> , would , after what we have said of his previous proceedings , be enough to prove , if proof were needed , what a passion he had for knowledge , how indomitable was his energy and how immense his power of work .
0	With a greediness that could not be concealed , <NAME> grasped them all .
0	<NAME> Dr. Ferguson have used two balloons , his chances of success would have been increased ; for , should one burst in the air , he could , by throwing out ballast , keep himself up with the other .
0	I must know first , through which countries the thirty-seventh parallel of southern latitude passes ? ” “ That ’ s <NAME> ’ s business ; he will tell you that , ” said <NAME> .
0	On the 30th October <NAME> rejoined <NAME> and <NAME> at <NAME> , finding them considerably weakened by fever and the effects of the climate .
0	<NAME> 's reply to this taunt was a desperate facer , which , however , <NAME> managed to stop while on its way towards the <NAME> 's nose .
0	This placard , which was in <NAME> , read as follows : `` The <NAME> ! ''
0	of gold. ” <NAME> uttered an exclamation of surprise .
0	`` Yes , '' answered <NAME> , `` it has certainly been done quite lately . ''
0	The ships quitted this inhospitable town , on the 29th of March , and the voyage continued , a close surveillance being kept over the <NAME> pilots , whom <NAME> was obliged to cause to be flogged .
0	This temperature is only the temperature produced by the radiation of the stars ; that is to say , what the terrestrial globe would undergo if the sun disappeared one day . ''
0	But at this moment <NAME> came up , put his hand upon <NAME> 's shoulder , and , showing his warrant , said , `` You are really <NAME> ? ''
0	If free , would he attempt to fly , or would he remain ?
0	Was it owing to the habit , now become a second nature , of living on information , that their mental constitution had thus become really transformed ?
0	His first act was to possess himself of a sailor 's clothes .
0	But that was not <NAME> ’ s idea , who did not intend to give up the wicket , but have it in his power to send off the news just as the events occurred .
0	Nothing from you would vex me ! ” “ Speak , Nadia. ” “ Why , now that the <NAME> ’ s letter has been taken from you , are you so anxious to reach <NAME> ? ” <NAME> tightly pressed his companion ’ s hand , but he did not answer .
0	<NAME> was carefully carrying some black swallows ’ eggs , and a string of sparrows , which he meant to serve up later under the name of field larks .
0	One could almost fancy it the march of an army .
0	Here <NAME> came , according to his wants , to pack up those millions with which he burdened the <NAME> .
0	Mutually reserved , though ever courteous , the count and the captain were secretly drawn together by the prospect of a common danger ; and as their return to the earth appeared to them to become more and more dubious , they abandoned their views of narrow isolation , and tried to embrace the wider philosophy that acknowledges the credibility of a habitable universe .
0	`` The majestic height and the vigour of the trees , '' says <NAME> , `` the productions of the tropical and temperate zones , alternating with each other , bear witness at once to the fertility of the soil and the salubrity of the climate .
0	But he had failed to realize how it might extend to <NAME> ; and when now he was obliged with his own eyes to witness the waves of ocean rolling over what once had been the lovely shores of <NAME> , he was well-nigh frantic with desperation .
0	There was no man in <NAME> to compare in interest with this Zacharius .
0	`` Yes , '' he answered , `` when it 's too late . ''
0	`` If the current goes to the pole , we shall go there ; and if it does n't , we sha n't .
0	A <NAME> before midday , the steamboat ’ s bell drew to the wharf on the Volga an unusually large concourse of people , for not only were those about to embark who had intended to go , but the many who were compelled to go contrary to their wishes .
0	I wanted to get up , but a heavy hand held me down in my bunk !
0	The iron balustrade around the platform was lowered , and the lantern and pilot cages were pushed within the shell until they were flush with the deck .
0	No doubt he kindly remembers the world-wide sympathy with which our three famous travellers had started on their memorable trip to the <NAME> .
0	You seem to have quite a monopoly of them. ” “ What ! ” said <NAME> , pricking up his ear .
0	But was not his calm only apparent ?
0	The low coast of <NAME> , scarcely emerging from the sea , was not more than fifteen miles distant .
0	Beyond a lawn , surrounded by a wooden fence falling to pieces , was the shore , on the left of which was the mouth of the stream .
0	“ I owe you all , <NAME> .
0	<NAME> , intoxicated with joy , went forward to take possession of the clock , when a frightful roar of laughter resounded behind him .
0	or 3° below zero , but we were warmly clad with fur , at the expense of the sea-bear and seal .
0	The captain soon found out by <NAME> 's interpretation ( he understanding the <NAME> tongue ) the right cause of this terrible catastrophe .
0	As <NAME> had observed great stormy clouds formed a lowering and heavy vault , preventing any star rays .
0	With rigid fingers she pointed to the following words traced upon it during the night : “ <NAME> , you have robbed me of the last vein in our old pit .
0	At six o'clock all our preparations were completed , and M. Fridriksson shook hands heartily with us .
0	Thus had they been borne upon the unknown deep for twenty-five days , their resources were completely exhausted , and they had not eaten for forty-eight hours , when the boat , with its occupants lying inanimate at the bottom of it , was sighted from <NAME> .
0	He already saw the moment when he would be at last allowed to think of his mother , of <NAME> , of himself !
0	It bears the creature which secretes it without its adhering to it .
0	I am lost ! ” he would cry , as he ran from side to side .
0	In a word , they were little better than prisoners .
0	`` And as a proof , '' added the clerk , `` here are the desecrator 's very shoes , which he left behind him . ''
0	Harding did not appear to be much astonished at this incident , and he cited several examples of tame apes , to whom the use of tobacco had become quite familiar .
0	The interior is of pitchy blackness , but so vast is the gulf that the summits of several mountains situated in it can be made out at a depth of some 300 fathoms , so only fancy where their bases must be !
0	But the inhabitants showed themselves everywhere so hostile , and opposed such resistance to the strangers landing , that <NAME> after a long and dangerous voyage was obliged to return to <NAME> .
0	<NAME> any of these men of the abyss wandering about the deserted shores of this wondrous sea of the centre of the earth ?
0	<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> turned away their eyes more with disgust than with terror .
0	A safety-lamp hung at his belt , also a large , strong knife in a leather sheath .
0	This was the case with <NAME> , <NAME> , and that unknown orb which was moving in the orbit of the minor planets ; but <NAME> , on the other hand , had assumed splendid proportions ; <NAME> was superb in its luster , and <NAME> , which hitherto had been imperceptible without a telescope was pointed out by <NAME> , plainly visible to the naked eye .
0	Two or three others produced similar letters .
0	<NAME> , <NAME> , and Lambert. -- A Rival of Mohammed. -- The <NAME> Mountains. -- <NAME> ’ s Weapons. -- One of <NAME> ’ s Manoeuvres. -- A Halt over a Forest .
0	<NAME> <NAME> shed bitter tears , giving way to despair at the thought of having lost the only being he loved on earth .
0	However numerous it may have been , this army was quickly routed by a small detachment , composed of 200 infantry , twenty-five cavalry , and twenty-five dogs .
0	Seated gloomily on the raft , clasping the stump of the mast mechanically , I thought of all I had read as to sufferings from starvation .
0	Moreover , the vicinity of the <NAME> , and the prevailing west wind , made the climate of this district particularly damp .
0	It was natural that they should take the same means of transport , and that they should follow the same route to the <NAME> steppes .
0	This luncheon would sustain them until their supper , which they intended to take at <NAME> .
0	If the wind had risen , no one could have withstood the temperature .
0	`` That is the best plan . ''
0	The breaking up of the frozen ocean was a magnificent spectacle , and “ the great voice of the sea , ” as the whalers graphically describe it , was heard in all its solemnity .
0	<NAME> Grant may have fallen into the hands of a numerous tribe , or his captors may be but a handful .
0	With cables properly fixed , the launch , it seemed , might be effected without any mishap .
0	<NAME> and her daughter silently followed , and all felt an unaccountable impression of sadness , as if they had a presentiment of some coming calamity .
0	He says , `` There were about forty-two natives ; seven grown men , and eight women , the others appeared to be their children ; many of them were girls already arrived at maturity , who were even more lightly clad than their mothers .
0	This Joam Garral knew by experience , and he intended to profit by the phenomenon to launch the jangada , after having built it in comfort on the river bank .
0	The <NAME> and the <NAME> immediately advanced to question him .
0	Is it always to be thus ?
0	May heaven give us strength to enable us once more to revisit the light of day .
0	However , it was hoped that the next morning by break of day , if the calculation had been correct and the course true , they would sight <NAME> .
0	<NAME> <NAME> lost his wife when <NAME> was born , and during his long voyages he left his little ones in charge of his cousin , a good old lady .
0	The horse is about the same , as well as the hare , the elephant , the porpoise , the tiger ; but the cat , the squirrel , the rat , panther , sheep , ox , dog , monkey , goat , reach 103° ; and the warmest of all , the pig , goes above `` That is humiliating for us , '' said <NAME> .
0	<NAME> 's was therefore an important rectification .
0	An old <NAME> prayer-book was lying on the corner of the tomb ; the volume was open , and the page exposed to view was that which contained the office for the celebration of the 25th of August .
0	But <NAME> did not find his provisions sufficient .
0	He teaches me what I must do .
0	His clothes were powerless to protect him .
0	But we are still descending .
0	It will be remembered that the brig turned bottom upwards , and that <NAME> and <NAME> remained for several days crouching on its keel .
0	shouted <NAME> ; `` that bear has got rather too many paws ! ''
0	No fresh incident occurred in the life on board , which proceeded with almost methodical regularity .
0	“ <NAME> and save his life ! ” “ <NAME> ? ” “ That is for you to discover , ” answered the magistrate , “ and not for me to say. ” ON <NAME> FOLLOWING day , the 30th of <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> talked matters over together .
0	The feathered tribes were of most brilliant plumage , and of marvelous variety and deafening noise .
0	look ! ” “ Letters ! ” Yes ; there , indeed , could be descried , with perfect precision of outline , some letters carved on the rock .
0	<NAME> , although exceedingly anxious for news , could ascertain nothing at this place .
0	Their object being well known , they had the best wishes of every hand on the road .
0	Points of the compass reversed !
0	`` The doctor has an answer for everything , '' was his only reply .
0	Now , <NAME> was nothing but an island .
0	If there was no rotation , a mere flip would suffice , but they can ’ t put down that diurnal spin .
0	After this second misfortune he could not make up his mind to appear before the King of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> both died on the 27th December , the former soon after he left <NAME> with <NAME> , the latter at that town , to which he had returned to rest .
0	There was another serious element in their grief .
0	`` Yes , <NAME> , coal ; that is to say , our preservation ! ''
0	“ Never mind , ” said <NAME> , “ though I do not see the land , I feel it ... it is there ... there ... as sure as the fact that we are no longer at <NAME> ” But the fog was not long in rising .
0	Nor did he , but , putting his horse into a steady gallop , he took the road towards the left bank of the <NAME> , which was still forty versts distant .
0	After exploring Babylonia he went to <NAME> , and as the express purpose of his travels was to collect all the information he could relating to the lengthy wars that had taken place between the Persians and <NAME> , he was most anxious to visit the spots where the battles had been fought .
0	There can not be two roads .
0	<NAME> immediately apprised the colonists , who at once joined him in watching the summit of <NAME> .
0	Leaving <NAME> in 1813 , <NAME> visited the <NAME> , the valley of <NAME> , and the ancient port of <NAME> , districts which in our own day are traversed by parties of <NAME> , with their _Murray_ , <NAME> , or _Bædeker_ in their hands ; but which then were only to be visited at the risk of life .
0	A quarter of an hour later each one had taken his place on board of the launch , which sailed out of <NAME> under mainsail and jib .
0	Matters being thus decided , the building of a vessel large enough to sail either to the <NAME> in the north , or to <NAME> in the west , was no longer talked of , and they busied themselves in their accustomed occupations , with a view to wintering a third time in <NAME> .
0	Then the <NAME> hinted that if <NAME> were properly dealt with , <NAME> would reveal the secret .
0	And by this promise he bound both himself and his companions .
0	His eyes were strangely bright , and his thoughts were boiling within him .
0	This event gave them a proof of the severity of the climate . ''
0	On the 18th , night-fall found them entering <NAME> 's , at the further end of the pass between <NAME> and <NAME> .
0	Well , it was no use mincing the matter , I told her all .
0	M. de <NAME> had only seen this bay at high tide , and as soon as this new sight met his view his first idea was to regain the former watering-place .
0	During this day the sulphate of quinine was administered to <NAME> every three hours .
0	In reality the main river still bore the name of the <NAME> , and it is only after the junction of the <NAME> that it takes the name which has made it celebrated among the rivers of the globe .
0	It is an incontestible fact that he knew <NAME> , and also that he was quartermaster on the <NAME> .
0	`` Then how shall we be able to make our way through this atmospheric fog ? ''
0	`` He became an honest man again ! ''
0	The idea of the only simpleton in the lot having to lecture the others on propriety of deportment !
0	But a greater danger was at hand , and one that it was too late to prevent .
0	After pondering long , and as profoundly as he could , upon these figures , <NAME> came to the conclusion that , as the earth was now receiving about double the amount of light and heat that it had been receiving before the catastrophe , it was receiving about the same as the planet <NAME> ; he was driven , therefore , to the estimate of the measure in which the earth must have approximated to the sun , a deduction in which he was confirmed when the opportunity came for him to observe <NAME> herself in the splendid proportions that she now assumed .
0	<NAME> did not try to hide that he was greatly excited .
0	And when <NAME> , undaunted by his jeers , persevered in besetting him with questions , he tried to silence him by saying , “ Only wait till the governor general comes ; he is a shrewd fellow , and will tell you all about it. ” “ But will he protect my property ? ” poor Isaac would ask tremulously .
0	From the moment the envoy took the first step towards the princes , they all three rose , and remained standing until he reached the place pointed out to him -- an embroidered cloth , which distinguished him from the rest of the embassy .
0	He gave them great hope ; indeed , the young girl could not help smiling at his sanguine prediction of success , and this odd way of foreseeing future events .
0	At this moment there opened before us a large grotto dug in a picturesque heap of rocks and carpeted with all the thick warp of the submarine flora .
0	We must now say a few words on the stay at <NAME> .
0	<NAME> this singular man ill ? -- had he altered his intentions with regard to us ?
0	“ I have no longer the right to think of them ! ” <NAME> and the mujik soon arrived in the mercantile quarter of the lower town .
0	And that is why the search for this thief will be more likely to succeed . ''
0	“ When shall we get away ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	On the 21st April , <NAME> passed between the <NAME> and <NAME> , in order to avoid the <NAME> , where he might have met some <NAME> pirates , and after a good voyage he arrived at <NAME> on the 7th August , 1806 .
0	But the colonists ’ object was not simply to admire the magnificent vegetation .
0	Almost at the same moment , fresh reports resounded from the <NAME> station , to which the second boat was rapidly approaching .
0	The command of the first was entrusted to <NAME> afterwards so justly celebrated , with whom were associated Dr. <NAME> , <NAME> , then a midshipman in the royal navy , and two common seamen .
0	Every morning the men were ordered to air their berths , and carefully clean the interior walls , to get rid of the night 's dampness .
0	<NAME> is obliged to discover a planet , or a comet , or even a satellite , but , before announcing to the world that you have made such a discovery , first make sure that such is really the fact .
0	`` But the inhabitants of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , _ or <NAME> , if they bear the same proportion to their planet that we do ours , must certainly be regular Brobdignagians . ''
0	<NAME> <NAME> and the squad had gone southward ; in the south all was still vacancy .
0	<NAME> , which was reached the next day , is the last of the <NAME> missions on the <NAME> .
0	Was he wrong in declaring that it was a political discussion ? ''
0	The birds were still very numerous , and their cries were deafening ; the seals , lying lazily on the drifting ice , raised their heads without being frightened , and turned their long necks to watch the ship go by .
0	<NAME> had served under him , and was far too grand a personage to trouble himself about the grumbling of the ship 's officers .
0	“ Who would ever have expected so much from a newspaper man ! ” thought <NAME> .
0	There was not a moment to lose , as the question of time was more important than any other .
0	“ I know no more about him than you do , captain , ” said <NAME> .
0	With these intrepid men , whose names have been preserved , and amongst whom was <NAME> de <NAME> , one of the historians of the expedition , <NAME> retired to an uninhabited island at a greater distance from the coast , to which he gave the name of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> were silent , although they were no less angry than the captain at the haughty coolness of their opponent .
0	They had furnished themselves with instruments of extreme precision , which would show if the <NAME> described its curve in the plane of the Equator .
0	I can hardly say on what I found my convictions .
0	It will be understood that it is impossible to follow the details of the minute survey of the vast stretch of coast between <NAME> and <NAME> , in N. lat .
0	The presence of danger soon , however , produced indifference , and more thought was bestowed upon the sublime beauty , than upon the strife with this terrible element .
0	Now , I have supplementary reservoirs capable of holding a hundred tons .
0	How the poor omnibus horses would rejoice !
0	Singularly enough , all these transformations rest upon principles which were perfectly familiar to our remote ancestors , but which they disregarded .
0	We must get inside , and the bolts once drawn , we shall come to the surface of the water , without even the pilot , who is in the bows , perceiving our flight . ''
0	After a careful examination of <NAME> , <NAME> , who had good reason to fear the <NAME> , paid a visit by night to <NAME> , and looked down on the waters of the <NAME> .
0	`` But I do not understand . ''
0	A short-sighted , jealous policy , resulting in the putting back for half a century the progress of <NAME> .
0	Two pirogues were often coupled , and the very smallest carried only the poles needed to preserve their equilibrium .
0	In a few moments , however , my thoughts were far away , back in my <NAME> home , with <NAME> and the old cook .
0	The <NAME> of <NAME> claim a man of the name of <NAME> as the founder of their race , favoured by the protection of the raven , first cause of all things .
0	At <NAME> , as indeed elsewhere , there existed no means of transport , -- for the same reasons as at the previous villages , neither carriages nor horses were to be had .
0	asked a tall man , in a harsh voice , who , standing in the shadow , quickly threw the light of a lantern on <NAME> 's face .
0	`` But it is not a gun for powder , '' answered the <NAME> .
0	“ I found myself abandoned on a nearly desert coast , but only forty miles from the penal settlement at <NAME> , the capital of <NAME> .
0	Between the 22d and 42d degrees the <NAME> soil slopes eastward , and all the travelers had to do was to follow the slope right down to the sea .
0	The aspect of the banks was magnificent .
0	I , <NAME> , can not die , for , as I have regulated time , time would end with me !
0	`` <NAME> , <NAME> , '' replied the <NAME> ; `` <NAME> has a trick of knocking the bottom out of every weaker vessel .
0	The capture of pigs , made on the islet , was looked upon as being very profitable to <NAME> , and the animals were led to the sty , where they soon became at home .
0	It has covered our tracks . ''
0	He had excellent reasons for this , as he had just heard of the arrival of the real sovereign , named <NAME> or <NAME> .
0	It was under these circumstances that the young girl undertook her father 's conversion ; and her influence was so effective that the old watchmaker promised to attend high mass at the cathedral on the following Sunday .
0	`` What a pair of beauties you are !
0	What a menagerie we might have if we only wanted to ! ''
0	Yet emigration was even then not sufficiently rapid , and convicts were introduced .
0	He anchored there in <NAME> <NAME> , and ascertained that the country was inhabited , although he could not see a single native .
0	<NAME> breathed more freely for a moment .
0	At length one man took off his breeches , tying them together by the ends , and having put the eggs into them , they carried them on a pike between two , while the third man carried the musket .
0	<NAME> <NAME> 's opinion was that the temperature would become more mild by degrees as they approached the pole .
0	<NAME> <NAME> returned to his companions , and said simply -- `` In an hour the opening will be practicable . ''
0	Three mattresses , thick and well wadded , spread on the disc forming the false bottom of the Projectile , were arranged in lines whose parallelism was simply perfect .
0	It is vexatious that all the apparatus of the mine , deserted for ten years , must be set up anew .
0	Consequently , many millions of acres of the island had still escaped their investigations .
0	The former was the more generally received hypothesis , for the ice-islands passed were too large to have been formed in the open ocean .
0	The little ones retreated precipitately into the maternal pouch , and all the troop decamped in file .
0	J. T. <NAME> might well believe that his last hour was come .
0	He also provided means to enable MM .
0	Can not the eyes of Kai-Koumou read hearts ? ” And pointing to <NAME> : “ That is your wife ? ” he said .
0	As I was wandering there along the shore , I met a band of convicts who had just escaped , and I joined myself to them .
0	`` I congratulate you , '' replied <NAME> .
0	Outside , as the night advanced , the tempest also increased in strength , until it was equal to that which had carried the prisoners from <NAME> to this land in the <NAME> .
0	Leaving this place , the <NAME> side of the strait is amply furnished with wood .
0	A quarter of an hour afterwards <NAME> and <NAME> descended the last ladder , and set foot on the lowest floor of the pit .
0	Of course the powder-magazine was open , and as they were firing incessantly , some careless or clumsy fellow just blew up the vessel ! ''
0	`` Yes , we will search for him , '' answered <NAME> ; `` but we shall not discover this powerful being who performs such wonders , until he pleases to call us to him ! ''
0	The whole party in the <NAME> felt agitated and oppressed , and not one of them could close his eyes .
0	“ Besides , it is very evident that the intention of the captain of this ship is to land , and , consequently , if not today , to-morrow at the latest , we shall make his acquaintance. ” “ Never mind ! ” said <NAME> .
0	he said on his return to the camp , addressing the observation to me .
0	The climate is much milder than in <NAME> 's <NAME> , which is in the same latitude .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> were called into existence by the Creator probably at the same period of time .
0	This was not , however , the case with various scholars of other nationalities , such as <NAME> and <NAME> , who wrote to congratulate D'Urville on his approaching voyage and on the important results to science which might be hoped for .
0	Without that how are we to know to what distance we can send one of those pretty shot with which we are provided ? ” “ Try them , <NAME> , ” replied the engineer .
0	It was rare that any one was `` accepted '' before this lapse of time .
0	A prison-cage was established in the <NAME> , and speedily became full , night and day , of refractory offenders .
0	As soon as we were all ready , we were to sail away to some distance to avoid the consequences of the explosion , the effects of which would certainly not be concentrated in the interior of the earth .
0	`` Be so good as to sit down , '' he said .
0	“ And what will it be , then ? ” “ We shall find proofs of malevolence , but not the malefactor. ” “ But he exists !
0	<NAME> <NAME> felt the volcanic tufa with which the plain was strewn , and which was but pulverized cinders hardened into solid blocks by time , tremble beneath him , but he could discover no traces of fresh lava .
0	It is somewhat circular in shape , and it covers a space of about 300 thousand square miles .
0	Something has happened ; <NAME> and I can not both be mad ! ” The orderly , meantime , surveyed his master with the greatest equanimity ; no phenomenon , however extraordinary , would have drawn from him a single exclamation of surprise .
0	“ I only hope my husband will succeed , for the poor children ’ s sake , ” said his cousin .
0	`` _Mille noms d'un boulet ! _ '' cried <NAME> , wildly gesticulating .
0	Numbers of icebergs capsize thus on the polar seas , and form one of the greatest dangers to which approaching vessels are exposed .
0	The unhappy man was condemned to be blinded .
0	I must not omit to mention a trick played upon a sailor by a young savage .
0	Nevertheless , such as it is , this body will tell its own history . ''
0	It is thought that he went to <NAME> and to <NAME> , where his projects of transoceanic navigation were but badly received .
0	“ This is a matter that we can ’ t argue with him .
0	The native prophets called on all the <NAME> population to defend the soil , and promised the extermination of the pakekas , or white men .
0	“ Do you not hear some noise behind us ?
0	I think I see him everywhere. ” “ So this young man was not <NAME> ? ” “ It was not <NAME> Strogoff. ” “ Dost thou know , old woman , that I can torture thee until thou avowest the truth ? ” “ I have spoken the truth , and torture will not cause me to alter my words in any way. ” “ This <NAME> was not <NAME> ? ” asked a second time <NAME> .
0	They have abundance of goats and fowls , but few sheep are to be seen , and no bullocks .
0	Harding and his companions mounted on the platform .
0	<NAME> was at first restless , but his breathing gradually became more regular , and he was left sleeping quietly .
0	On the 27th , in the morning , in the presence of the authorities of the <NAME> , the _Halbrane's_ anchor was lifted , the last good wishes and the final adieus were exchanged , and the schooner took the sea .
0	The shades of night were drawing on .
0	But all the other sailors were silent .
0	And they walked off together , Passepartout chatting volubly as they went along .
0	But soon the bushes contract , and the arborisations increase .
0	These people lead a miserable life .
0	Every one had worked at the construction of the mill , and on the 1st of December it was finished .
0	I lay in a stupor , a half dream , during which I saw visions of astounding character .
0	I gazed for some time upon the void above .
0	<NAME> Manasarowar lies at the foot of immense sloping prairies , to the south of the gigantic mountains .
0	<NAME> and he had now reached the shop , where <NAME> left his companion to make his purchases , after recommending him not to miss the steamer , and hurried back to the consulate .
0	There was another half-hour to wait , another half-hour of a nightmare , which might drive me mad .
0	Had he not himself said from the beginning , in the firmest manner , that the secret of his life exacted from him our lasting imprisonment on board the <NAME> ?
0	`` It must then be admitted that the document has already a distant date ? ''
0	As males and females were indiscriminately slaughtered , however , the new fields were soon exhausted .
0	He was careful to have a large quantity of wheat , barley , millet , and rice , stored up in years of abundant harvest , so as to keep the price of grain at a uniform rate when the harvest failed .
0	In nineteen months , notwithstanding one hundred and eighty days ’ sickness , he had traversed <NAME> from west to north .
0	All clamoured for a return to the north .
0	They now gave open demonstration of their joy by making the towns of Nossa-Senhora-del-Desterro , <NAME> , and <NAME> one blaze of light with their illuminations , and marching through the streets singing verses in honour of <NAME> . ''
0	By him he was made <NAME> on the 22nd of March , 1508 .
0	`` Your captain is in a remarkable hurry ! ''
0	The latter are proud and haughty , too vain to be civil , and too shrewd to be honest ; yet they appear to understand somewhat of the nature of love and the social affections , are warm in their attachments , and keen in their resentments . ''
0	And now , even although the industrious colonists had provided themselves with tools , these treasures would find their use .
0	The supper must necessarily be very meager .
0	There was a shrill shriek of the projectile which traversed the air under the impetus from milliards of milliards of litres of gas developed by the instantaneous deflagration of two thousand tons of meli-melonite .
0	Its houses are empty , containing not so much as a mat .
0	There was certainly a chance that they might be able to pass under cover of the night , and penetrate into <NAME> .
0	But even these undertakings , <NAME> 's computation of the <NAME> arc , the calculations which determined the latitude and longitude of certain large cities in <NAME> , and a map which gave the environs of <NAME> in detail with geometrical exactitude , were still insufficient data for a map of <NAME> .
0	May it not rather have been that King <NAME> was jealous of the fame of <NAME> , and did not wish to give him the opportunity of increasing his renown ?
0	<NAME> had his long boat lowered , and got into it with <NAME> and <NAME> , the comptroller <NAME> , the secretary <NAME> , and some others .
0	At this depth I could still see the rays of the sun , though feebly ; to their intense brilliancy had succeeded a reddish twilight , the lowest state between day and night ; but we could still see well enough ; it was not necessary to resort to the <NAME> apparatus as yet .
0	The manufacture of a hand-saw cost infinite trouble , but at last an instrument was obtained which , when vigorously handled , could divide the ligneous fibers of the wood .
0	The boatswain then set to work on the former contents of the <NAME> , furniture , bedding , sails , clothing , instruments , and utensils .
0	<NAME> , then aged seventy , was a man of great worth , full of evangelical fervor , charitable and good , and in countries where the representatives of religion are not always examples of the virtues , he stood out as the accomplished type of those great missionaries who have done so much for civilization in the interior of the most savage regions of the world .
0	After having wintered at <NAME> , <NAME> landed three ambassadors at <NAME> , who were to reach <NAME> by travelling overland , then he anchored at <NAME> , which <NAME> , one of his lieutenants had been unable to subjugate .
0	When it was within five or six cables ' lengths , and the eddy was helping it on , <NAME> let go the paddles , stooped towards the after-part of the boat , and then raised himself , holding up an inert body .
0	The natives in reply to the questions put to them , asserted that they were in the habit of eating their enemies .
0	We took it at first , as <NAME> had done , for a sailing vessel .
0	I noticed in this part several small mounds of ice in such a liquefying condition that the slightest touch would suffice to break it and convert the mound into a round slough .
0	As they are not whitewashed , and the stone is brown in colour , the streets , which are very narrow , have usually a sombre appearance .
0	“ Oh , <NAME> , she is charming , ” exclaimed <NAME> , “ a thousand times too charming , and if I must tell you all , she would please me better if she were less so .
0	`` Friend <NAME> , this is my answer .
0	He contented himself , therefore , with keeping the balloon at one hundred feet from the ground , and , at that elevation , a feeble current drove it toward the western horizon .
0	The document contained a hundred lines , which were divided into half a dozen paragraphs .
0	The explorers proceeded towards the south , disturbing numerous flocks of sea-birds and herds of seals , which threw themselves into the sea as soon as they saw the strangers at a distance .
0	As yet they had not met with any of the aboriginal tribes living in the savage state .
0	<NAME> had swung himself down from branch to branch , and was waiting for him below , stretching his limbs in the mean time .
0	The engineer and his two companions threw themselves between the sea and the seals .
0	Here , he knows that fellow-men are awaiting him !
0	Nothing can be worse for wounds in the shoulder -- unless it was to put you to sleep. ” “ Let us , then , talk of what we ought to do , ” replied Blount .
0	As soon as ever <NAME> invented a new shot , <NAME> invented a new plate ; each followed a current of ideas essentially opposed to the other .
0	What was the <NAME> going to do with the <NAME> ?
0	`` You are right , '' said the doctor , `` and it 's certain they came last night . ''
0	But for the strong favourable winds which now blew , it seems probable that the vessels would never have issued in safety from amongst the formidable ice masses through which they finally worked their way at the cost of incredible exertions and fatigues , and in face of incessant danger .
0	The natives carried off their wounded , leaving thirty or forty dead upon the field of battle .
0	After having crossed the tropic of <NAME> in 135° longitude , it sailed W.N.W. , making again for the tropical zone .
0	This was accordingly done , and fortune favored the chief officer , <NAME> , <NAME> , a strong , jovial young fellow , and <NAME> , so good a boxer that he might have entered the lists with <NAME> himself .
0	It would appear that progress is not possible to these savages , so nearly allied to brutes .
0	Here were four sheds sacred to the building of large war-canoes , and others containing <NAME> boats .
0	as <NAME> whispered to those around him ; otherwise how could they have ever run up that flag ?
0	What was the matter with him ?
0	row hard ! ” Not one of the rowers turned his head -- not an oar-stroke must be lost .
0	Two stout arms , an iron constitution , a powerful frame , and an indomitable courage were all loyally devoted to his master ’ s service , and fairly entitled him to his _soi-disant_ designation of “ The <NAME> of Montmartre. ” Unlike his master , he made no pretension to any gift of poetic power , but his inexhaustible memory made him a living encyclopaedia ; and for his stock of anecdotes and trooper ’ s tales he was matchless .
0	I communicated my fears and observations to <NAME> .
0	`` Well , <NAME> , '' said the captain , `` do you recognize this place ? ''
0	A scornful smile passed over her face .
0	I thought we were not following the same road to return to the <NAME> .
0	At the end of this barbarous ceremony , which was a blot in the memoirs of so peaceable a people , a king-fisher alighted in the foliage .
0	Each bottle , therefore , produced as many currents as united would be sufficient to produce all the phenomena of the electric telegraph .
0	In an instant , with electrical rapidity , as if the current had been of alcohol , the whole river was in a blaze above and below the town .
0	Then his presentiments returned in greater strength than before , and he listened anxiously to the sounds outside the hut .
0	No greater distance north has ever been attained since <NAME> 's time , except on the <NAME> coast -- where <NAME> and <NAME> Islands were discovered , and where at this moment , as we write , <NAME> is exploring .
0	`` That is the fate in store for our Earth ? ''
0	The <NAME> never left him , continually seeking to prove to him the necessity of bringing the ships nearer to the land ; and when the admiral positively refused to consent to this , he declared him to be his prisoner .
0	Their eyes could not pierce through the thick mist which had gathered beneath the car .
0	`` Whales have been known to go thousands of miles with a harpoon in the side , and this one might even have been struck in the north of the <NAME> and come to die in the south of the <NAME> , and it would be nothing astonishing . ''
0	“ Decidedly we have only one way , ” said <NAME> , “ one single way for leaving <NAME> , and that is , to build a vessel large enough to sail several hundred miles .
0	The expedition took the route followed by <NAME> and soon reached <NAME> , which is the most southerly town of <NAME> , and the last before the traveller enters the desert of <NAME> .
0	`` So , <NAME> , it is not the first time you have overrun the <NAME> on board the <NAME> ? ''
0	`` Does that astonish you , my boy ? ''
0	He was on his way to be sacrificed in honour of the white men !
0	His powder-case , his cartridge-pouch , his lead , and his bullets , did not exceed a certain weight prescribed by the doctor .
0	It takes eleven days to go from <NAME> to <NAME> , but water is not so scarce on this journey , which is generally made upon oxen .
0	No , <NAME> ; you must taste a little of the torture of <NAME> just now .
0	He embarks at <NAME> in 1614 , passes thirteen months at <NAME> , reaches <NAME> by sea , afterwards <NAME> , and joins a caravan which at length brings him to <NAME> .
0	He always added that they must fight to the last man , and blow up the town rather than yield !
0	The inhabitants of this island , who as a rule wear scarce any clothing , are tall and well-made , and the women , who wear leathern great-coats reaching to the ground , are very good-looking and honest .
0	And here <NAME> , followed by her daughter and <NAME> , came out of the house .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> were soon saddled , and in twenty minutes had carried their riders to the western extremity of the island , where they both dismounted and began to explore the coast .
0	The only liquid provided by my uncle was <NAME> .
0	Majestically the panorama of both banks moved along without a pause , as though some ingenious mechanism necessitated its unrolling in the opposite direction to that of the stream .
0	We are bound to make the best of our new lodgings , and make ourselves comfortable .
0	`` Let us follow him again , '' resumed the doctor .
0	I am , with the rest of the world , ignorant of the motives which induced you to adopt this strange mode of existence , and I can not judge of effects without knowing their causes ; but what I _do_ know is , that a beneficent hand has constantly protected us since our arrival on <NAME> , that we all owe our lives to a good , generous , and powerful being , and that this being so powerful , good and generous , <NAME> , is yourself ! ''
0	In a few minutes the engineer was made acquainted with the state of affairs .
0	The enormous mass as it passed grazed his chest , taking away his breath as though it had been a cannon-ball , then crushing to powder the flints on the road , it bounded into the abyss below .
0	On the 12th of December , 1769 , <NAME> descried land in 35 degrees 37 minutes S .
0	He listened without opening his mouth .
0	He had come , he urged , bringing Bello a letter and presents from the King of <NAME> , relying upon the confidence inspired by the sultan 's letter of the previous year , and he hoped his host would not forfeit that confidence by tampering with another person 's letter .
0	He had not much difficulty even in explaining the matter to his friends .
0	Some fleshy parts still remained which bore the impress of the cannibal 's teeth .
0	Beyond this bank the country was dotted with large and small lakes , much as those of <NAME> , <NAME> , and other black-watered lagoons .
0	Having travelled through <NAME> , <NAME> reached <NAME> in May , 1802 .
0	All the fires must be extinguished , so that nothing may betray the presence of men on the island . ''
0	This ill success had cost the loss of a ship ’ s crew .
0	The air was filled with sulphurous suffocating vapor , and a clump of huge pines , struck by the electric fluid , scarcely twenty feet from the tarantass , flared up like a gigantic torch .
0	But what could these two expect , in this wild region , if it was not to die of exhaustion and famine ?
0	At all events , the engineer only communicated his impressions to <NAME> , for he thought it useless to explain to his companions the suspicions which arose from what perhaps was only Top ’ s fancy .
0	`` Without doubt , and here it is , '' answered <NAME> , producing a paper which indicated the longitude and latitude of <NAME> , `` the present residence of <NAME> and five <NAME> colonists . ''
0	<NAME> sold his wares , and then , worn out by the persecutions of the <NAME> merchants who were his companions , he joined the caravan at <NAME> , intending to traverse the unknown district between that town and <NAME> .
0	As for <NAME> , he did not seem to mind the inclement cold .
0	In all probability , and such was also <NAME> ’ s opinion , some had been left by formidable wild beasts which doubtless would give them some trouble ; but nowhere did they observe the mark of an axe on the trees , nor the ashes of a fire , nor the impression of a human foot .
0	This was a fertile tract of country inhabited by a civilized , upright people , who loved all philosophic researches .
0	His first mate would not delay the execution of an order for ten days .
0	`` And the labourers going to the fields !
0	All these detached masses , covered with enamel , polished by the action of the subterraneous fires , shone resplendent by the light of our electric lantern .
0	The inspection ended , the doors of the carriages were then opened , but , before <NAME> could move towards her , the young <NAME> , who had been the first to descend , had disappeared in the crowd which thronged the platforms of the railway station .
0	So I shall not be in the least surprised to see him coming out of his cabin some fine morning and taking command in the least supernatural way in the world . ''
0	“ We must pass them though ! ” urged the doctor .
0	He succeeded in stopping the hemorrhage .
0	<NAME> had a cask fixed at the head of the foremast -- what is called a crow's-nest -- and from thence an unremitting watch was kept .
0	The scene , as here depicted , took place upon the extremity of a little cape on the <NAME> coast , between <NAME> and <NAME> , about two miles from the mouth of the <NAME> .
0	“ Just because <NAME> , who was by no means a timid man , was so afraid in 1802 , of the croaking of the <NAME> frogs , that he raised his anchor with all possible speed , and quitted the coast , never to return. ” “ What ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
0	The corral was enlarged , for the flock of musmons and goats had been increased by a number of young ones , who had to be housed and fed .
0	“ The attempt has often been made , gentlemen , ” said the doctor , “ to rise and descend at will , without losing ballast or gas from the balloon .
0	`` That Pen is a worthless fellow , '' the doctor said to him .
0	After pondering for a few moments , the captain spoke again .
0	`` I do n't ask the question with any idea of backing out , '' observed the Captain quietly ; `` as a matter of purely scientific inquiry , I repeat my question : how are we to return ? ''
0	<NAME> had scarcely set his foot on shore when three thousand of the inhabitants of <NAME> came forth to meet him , an honor due to the president who had signalized their country by his choice .
0	`` Then , '' said <NAME> , `` I do n't see -- '' `` As for me , '' answered <NAME> , `` since the bullet of mercury , the ice lens , the building of <NAME> , I believe Dr. Clawbonny is capable of anything . ''
0	If you fail , it won ’ t matter much .
0	He would be all that they liked , “ even a professor of dancing and deportment , ” said he to <NAME> , if that was ever necessary .
0	From <NAME> , the main district of the merchants of that country , he descried , at length , on the horizon , the lake so much desired and so long sought for , of which <NAME> caught a glimpse on the 3d of <NAME> felt real emotion : he was almost in contact with one of the principal points of his expedition , and , with his spy-glass constantly raised , he kept every nook and corner of the mysterious region in sight .
0	My head was now wholly lost .
0	But might not a time come when all their science would be at fault ?
0	The poor dog had died after he had done his fell work , in a corner on the beach , where <NAME> found his skeleton and the collar bearing the name of <NAME> .
0	<NAME> 's presentiments were not mistaken , when he wished to hunt them as wild beasts .
0	The prison was still a prison -- the prisoners , prisoners .
0	On the 5th January the <NAME> once more put to sea , surveyed <NAME> on the 20th , <NAME> six days later , <NAME> on the 28th , and the little <NAME> on the 8th February , arriving the next day off <NAME> , a small island three or four miles in circumference with one rather pointed peak covered with vegetation .
0	During the whole day , I was haunted by uncomfortable suspicions , and at night I slept badly , and between my broken dreams I fancied I heard distant sighs like the notes of a funeral psalm .
0	Besides , the frequent rains of <NAME> visit <NAME> 's region in like abundance .
0	They admitted Surville to their schemes , and sent him to <NAME> to obtain the needful authority from the <NAME> , and to superintend the equipment of the vessel .
0	always you ! ” And <NAME> ’ s voice died away in a prolonged “ <NAME> ! ” <NAME> , after this , applied himself diligently , during all his spare time , to the work of <NAME> ’ s education .
0	The new road was very steep , and consequently very painful .
0	During the night the ship might disappear and leave for ever , and , this ship gone , would another ever return to the waters of <NAME> ?
0	`` They 're not furrows , dear friend , '' said <NAME> , `` and ca n't be , either , simply on account of their immense size .
0	<NAME> first made for <NAME> , a small town situated at about twenty days ' march from the coast .
0	`` Which I shall take advantage of , '' exclaimed the <NAME> .
0	It was on a narrow platform placed above the telescope that the two savants passed their existence , execrating the day which hid the moon from their eyes , and the clouds which obstinately veiled her during the night .
0	What can he be doing ? ''
0	They soon reached a narrow space , at the bottom of a deep ravine , and there a terrible sight met their eyes .
0	<NAME> <NAME> , bending low closed the eyes of him who had once been the <NAME> , and was now not even <NAME> .
0	<NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , all ask this favor , that we should accompany them .
0	`` Do n't be alarmed at the heat , my boy . ''
0	Who could have believed it possible ? ” “ Let us get on , ” was the engineer ’ s invariable reply .
0	One would have thought that <NAME> was courting a death worthy of himself , a death by lightning .
0	His calm temperament seemed to indicate an interior fire , kept well under control .
0	It was determined , then , that this coast should be followed as closely as possible , so as to recognize any traces of them that might appear .
0	Moreover , what was likely to take place , since , notwithstanding their losses , the followers of the sealing-master were still a majority of the ship 's company ?
0	They had no doubt that the civil war was at an end , and to them it appeared impossible that the just cause of the <NAME> had not triumphed .
0	This was the cart entering the circle of light , and <NAME> could hear the noise made by the door , as his companions shut it and fastened the interior bars .
0	`` Let us look for it , '' replied <NAME> .
0	`` A mere matter of detail , a bagatelle , '' said <NAME> .
0	When the <NAME> reached King <NAME> 's Harbour upon the 6th of February , the <NAME> had already arrived there , but in such a damaged condition that her captain had been obliged to run her aground .
0	<NAME> <NAME> and my companions were also dressing .
0	He soon perceived that the travelers whose shouts he had heard were at no great distance .
0	It produces water-cresses , purslain , sorrels , turnips , and <NAME> radishes in abundance , as well as oats and clover .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> even watched at the bridge so as to be ready to lower it the moment their companion presented himself .
0	Yes , if we could only succeed in getting the schooner afloat again .
0	He awaited them calmly , aimed at the nearest , and fired ; but the bullet struck the animal in the middle of his forehead , without penetrating the skull .
0	A huge cloud of dust swept along the road from <NAME> .
0	How I regret not having seen once more <NAME> la Chaise and the circus in the <NAME> ! ''
0	`` If , '' he adds , `` the superiority of a civilized to a savage life could ever be called in question , a single glance at one of these Indians would be sufficient to settle the question .
0	`` I say that this war is necessary , '' replied <NAME> , firmly , `` and that the time has come to avenge this insult . ''
0	<NAME> <NAME> and his companions then went off to some distance .
0	A few days after came the 26th of March , the day on which , two years before , the castaways from the air had been thrown upon <NAME> .
0	The Indians who , assembled in arms on the surrounding mountains , had reckoned upon falling on the conqueror , had need instead to fly in all haste .
0	Finding the winds favourable , he decided not to remain in <NAME> <NAME> at this advanced season of the year , but immediately to double <NAME> , in the hope of avoiding a possible delay that would have exposed his ships to injury and his crew to useless fatigue .
0	I passed the whole of the following night with a nightmare on my chest !
0	Every now and then I paused to discover if any loud appeal was made to me , well knowing that in that dense and intensified atmosphere I should hear it a long way off .
0	But he hid his joy so well that the doctor did not even suspect it ; he asked himself why <NAME> 's eye shone with so unusual a lustre ; but that was all , and the natural reply to this question did not enter his head .
0	The reason of such considerable retardation was , that by this time the Projectile had reached such a great distance from the Earth that it had hardly any weight .
0	`` Yes , my friend ; it deceived us with respect to its size as well as the distance !
0	<NAME> , meeting with so decided a will , consented , but the poor <NAME> , who had received the name of <NAME> , soon faded away and died at <NAME> .
0	<NAME> ! ” cried the doctor , “ the water-tank ! ” <NAME> caught his friend ’ s idea on the instant , and , snatching up with desperate strength one of the water-tanks weighing about one hundred pounds , he tossed it overboard .
0	I cried , dragging my uncle along ; and , for the first time , he made no resistance to my wishes .
0	“ With this we could go round -- ” “ The world ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	`` Unaccountable indeed , '' answered the engineer , who did not appear desirous to prolong the conversation .
0	One thousand miles still separated him from <NAME> .
0	Still , to all appearances , the Projectile seemed to be quite as deeply immersed in the shadow as ever , and there was apparently not the slightest sign of such a state of things coming soon to an end .
0	The islets surrounding this coast were reconnoitred by the navigators .
0	Gradually fields covered with cereals came in sight , whole acres covered with bristling ears of corn , hay-ricks in the shape of large bee-hives , blooming orchards , a fine garden worthy of <NAME> , in which the useful and agreeable were blended ; then came sheds ; commons wisely distributed , and last of all , a plain comfortable dwelling-house , crowned by a joyous-sounding mill , and fanned and shaded by its long sails as they kept constantly moving round .
0	The doors and the pillars of the verandahs are adorned with fairly well executed carvings , representing such scenes as a boa killing an antelope , or a pig , or a group of warriors and drummers .
0	The gravest questions of morals and politics may be discussed , and even solved .
0	The <NAME> in the <NAME> Telegraph. -- War between the <NAME> Journals. -- Mr .
0	Chance at last favored them , and it was <NAME> who put them on the right track .
0	When an incident is described that is already past , photographs of its main features are transmitted with the narrative .
0	With two ships and one light vessel , <NAME> set out from <NAME> on the 21st December , 1605 .
0	But his desire to wait till the very last moment , so as to get the very best price for the document he possessed , the recollection of the young man ’ s insulting words , and the hate which he bore to all that belonged to him , made him forget his own interest .
0	Thus we still have twenty-seven minutes to remain on the earth . ''
0	His equipment this time consisted of thirty oxen -- ten for each of his two waggons , and ten as reserve -- three horses , nine dogs , and five Hottentots .
0	Every hour of our expedition on the raft had been so much lost time !
0	But his tastes were more for travelling than a life at court ; he resolved to make himself a still more illustrious name by further conquests , and soon an opportunity offered for him to carry out his plans .
0	Then passed rafts of wood interminably long , and barges loaded to the gunwale , and nearly sinking under water .
0	<NAME> had but few steps to go ; and , rushing upon the plank , he crossed it , and fell unconscious on the deck , just as the <NAME> was moving off .
0	I therefore think you have reason to hope still. ” The young squatter ’ s words caused great joy to his auditors .
0	The harbor was free from the ice which is generally forced there by the east-wind ; the sharp peaks , covered with snow , looked like a number of white waves .
0	But one thing _I_ know .
0	He was , in fact , the only person that I did thoroughly understand during the whole period of my residence in this benighted island .
0	So for the most part the five men remained in complete idleness .
0	<NAME> silence reigned in the corral .
0	it can not be the <NAME> ! ''
0	`` Granted , '' replied <NAME> , `` but why should not these two motions have been equal , as they are really so ? ''
0	My uncle came out of his cabin pale , haggard , thin , but full of enthusiasm , his eyes dilated with pleasure and satisfaction .
0	If light was thus obtained , so would a means of access , for it would be as easy to pierce a door as windows , and to establish an exterior ladder .
0	It seemed as if the returning was to be accomplished as easily as the going , when an unexpected accident occurred which rendered the situation of the explorers very serious .
0	Just then the locomotive gave a sharp screech , and the train passed out into the darkness of the night .
0	“ Yes. ” “ Do you know that man who took my horses ? ” “ No. ” “ Had you never seen him before ? ” “ Never. ” “ Who do you think he was ? ” “ A man who knows how to make himself obeyed. ” <NAME> fixed his piercing gaze upon the <NAME> , but the other did not quail before it .
0	On the morning of the 3rd of September the `` Jeune-Hardie '' reached the head of Gaël-Hamkes Bay .
0	I think that <NAME> , our natural leader ; the Major , who would not yield his place to anybody ; and your humble servant , <NAME> Paganel. ” “ And me , ” interrupted <NAME> .
0	It ran as follows : `` After examining one by one the different theories , rejecting all other suggestions , it becomes necessary to admit the existence of a marine animal of enormous power .
0	It is the general law of nature which makes those countries in which we do not live unhealthy and sterile , like those out of which life has died .
0	And this was what might have been expected of these folks from the different points of view , though time passed pleasantly enough with them all the same .
0	`` But how have they endeavored to explain these lines of light ? ''
0	<NAME> is one of the largest islands in <NAME> .
0	The ice , which was drifting down behind it , pressed it still closer , and kept it motionless , as though it had been stranded .
0	He confined himself to the bare proposition , adding that the voyage to <NAME> was only five or six days -- the distance , in fact , being only about a thousand miles .
0	About three in the afternoon the prince passed sentence upon those who had been convicted .
0	The <NAME> obtained ready permission to disembark his sick , and found every facility for revictualling .
0	The passage till then impracticable , became all at once possible .
0	Two large pirogues , each manned by thirty paddlers , showed an intention of attacking the vessels , but the latter immediately chased them .
0	Therefore , he awaited the next day with the greatest anxiety .
0	The atmosphere , violently agitated by the electric commotions , could not recover its former purity , and there was almost invariably rain and fog , except for three or four fine days on which several excursions were made .
0	The latter , knowing well that without special tools it would be nearly impossible for him to manufacture a gun which would be of any use , still drew back and put off the operation to some future time , observing in his usual dry way , that <NAME> and <NAME> had become very skilful archers , so that many sorts of excellent animals , agouties , kangaroos , capybaras , pigeons , bustards , wild ducks , snipes , in short , game both with fur and feathers , fell victims to their arrows , and that , consequently , they could wait .
0	Between the <NAME> and <NAME> there is a distance of 2,900 miles , but with a good sea and favoring breeze , this was only a ten day ’ s voyage .
0	Suddenly the projectile passed the line of demarcation between intense light and absolute darkness , and was plunged in profound night !
0	Nothing worthy of notice occurred on the voyage from <NAME> to <NAME> .
0	But they had to be careful with the spirits , the latter being more likely to produce than to quench thirst .
0	Whoever it was , the only thing practicable was to do as the engineer proposed , to go to the <NAME> and there wait for day .
0	In the meantime the greater part of the prisoners were passing before the <NAME> , and as they passed each was obliged to prostrate himself , with his forehead in the dust , in token of servitude .
0	`` Here are the nine thousand dollars , '' said the captain , drawing a roll of paper dollars from his pocket .
0	<NAME> <NAME> now watched the captain with extreme care .
0	`` Chance will perhaps give us the key to this mystery ! ''
0	On board no preparations for departure were visible .
0	The <NAME> was more fortunate , and returned to <NAME> , but she had not been able to get higher than the seventy-seventh parallel .
0	These natural accidents naturally excited the imaginations of these terrestrial astronomers .
0	The young captain was very much annoyed , however , at the prospect of emptying his coal-bunkers , for he had covered his ship with canvas , intending to take advantage of the slightest breeze .
0	After coasting along the <NAME> shores as far as 52 degrees , <NAME> set out for <NAME> , which he reached on the 15th of September .
0	<NAME> and nearer it came , but without noise , without sparks , without a trail , though its lower part was brighter than ever .
0	not agreeable ! ” exclaimed <NAME> , jumping at the word as likely to give a new turn to the conversation .
0	“ Things must indeed change should it ever be brought to a conclusion !
0	The view was very extensive , but beyond the cape it ended in <NAME> .
0	Further on here is the word _ypo_ .
0	When they reached the spot the bird was dead , and the body of <NAME> was quite concealed beneath his mighty wings .
0	“ <NAME> to me , friends , ” said <NAME> after a few minutes ’ reflection ; “ and remember , <NAME> , this is a grave discussion .
0	What profound reflections it suggested to their understandings !
0	In the meantime M. de Chastes having died , his privilege was transferred to M. de <NAME> , with the title of Vice-admiral and Governor of <NAME> .
0	The massive rocks were rent with impenetrable fractures , deep grottos , and unfathomable holes , at the bottom of which formidable creatures might be heard moving .
0	The sun had absorbed all the vapours .
0	About eleven o'clock in the morning , the first range of mountains that form the centre of the island was traversed , and we had killed nothing .
0	If they ate a good deal , they talked more .
0	The migrations of the <NAME> tribes are thoroughly understood in these days , thanks to the wider knowledge of languages and anthropology , but they were scarcely suspected in the time of <NAME> , who , indeed , was one of the first to collect legends on the subject .
0	But the investigation , though decided upon by the municipal council , produced no result .
0	`` From ocean to ocean '' -- so say the <NAME> ; and these four words compose the general designation of the `` great trunk line '' which crosses the entire width of the <NAME> .
0	If the Projectile itself were floating in it , as was possible , would not such a good conductor of sound convey to their ears the reflexion of some lunar echo , the roar of some storm raging among the mountains , the rattling of some plunging avalanche , or the detonations of some eructating volcano ?
0	“ Yes , my boy , ” replied the engineer , “ that may have been the case .
0	To certain beaches which the decrease of the waters has left uncovered , and which have the privilege of attracting the greater number of turtles , there has been given the name of “ royal beaches. ” When the harvest is gathered it is a holiday for the <NAME> , who give themselves up to games , dancing , and drinking ; and it is also a holiday for the alligators of the river , who hold high revelry on the remains of the amphibians .
0	<NAME> alone had done it .
0	<NAME> furnishes some details respecting the women of <NAME> .
0	Forster , animated by an ardour for botanical research , missed none of them .
0	In 1776 an extract from the most important native codes , then for the first time translated under the title of the <NAME> of the <NAME> [ 1 ] was published in <NAME> .
0	It was necessary , therefore , to cut from it a piece equal in extent to the waterline of the <NAME> .
0	Not a particle , however , could he see of the disc that had glittered so resplendently before his eyes a few moments ago .
0	The cable strained violently , and every half hour <NAME> had to take in a fathom to ease it .
0	Is it the product of the melting of these snows ?
0	There was nothing disagreeable in their features , and their eyes struck us as beautiful , so did their teeth , but they were very dirty .
0	“ Because those men were <NAME> , my father , and myself , <NAME> ! ” <NAME> looked up hastily , seized the young man ’ s hand , and gazed so fixedly into his eyes that his feelings were stirred to their depths .
0	The fugitives lay flat on the platform , so that the raft was scarcely above the level of the water .
0	From nothing they must supply themselves with everything .
0	The unhealthiness of the climate was fatal to young Toole , who died at <NAME> , on the 26th of February , at the early age of twenty-two .
0	`` Is there any news about the captain ? ''
0	The following fact will give an idea of the hospitality of these people .
0	Although the facts that reached the <NAME> Government allowed no room for doubt as to the fate of the traveller , a rumour that white men had been seen in the interior of <NAME> induced the Governor of <NAME> to fit out an expedition .
0	“ You wanted to speak to me , <NAME> ? ” said <NAME> .
0	Then anger would prevail over grief .
0	The moment had arrived , but my travelling companions did not appear .
0	“ <NAME> off steam ! ” cried the Major , running to close the hole with the loose drift , while <NAME> pondering on the singular phenomenon muttered to himself : “ Let me see !
0	During the month of July the cold was intense , but there was no lack of either wood or coal .
0	I should very much like to see how they teach geography in the <NAME> of Melbourne. ” “ And suppose Toline trips you up , <NAME> ! ” said <NAME> .
0	“ And what do you say is your surmise as to your present position ? ” he asked .
0	cried <NAME> , with a shout of laughter ; `` and you 'll undertake the job , no doubt ? ''
0	“ Every Englishman is an enemy .
0	“ In 1741 , at the time of the expedition of the two Frenchmen , <NAME> and <NAME> , who were sent to measure a terrestrial degree on the equator , they were accompanied by a very distinguished astronomer , <NAME> des <NAME> .
0	The breeze was light , and as the current had then lost much of its force , <NAME> had absolute command over his vessel .
0	The channel was easily traversed , and the boat touched the opposite shore of the islet .
0	“ We will not ask more from it , ” replied the sailor .
0	`` At any rate , it makes very little difference to us , '' said <NAME> .
0	If the hood had not been securely fastened , it would have been blown away long before .
0	When the bottles were empty , however , he rose to go and tell his master of the change in the time of the sailing of the <NAME> .
0	After a few seconds a faint rumbling was heard , which grew louder and louder .
0	It was not until the 2nd of January in the present year ( 1840 ) that they sighted land -- east of the <NAME> .
0	It was the only portion of the globe which had escaped the indefatigable activity of <NAME> ; and perhaps we owe the small advantage of having first landed there to the sad event which ended his days .
0	There could be no doubt about it !
0	It was useless attempting to conceal from ourselves the fatal truth .
0	“ Do not be afraid , <NAME> ! ” cried <NAME> .
0	Not having been able to leave the town before the first operations of the siege , he found himself shut up , to his great disgust ; but , not accustomed to succumb to difficulties , he resolved to escape by some means or other .
0	The speed of the <NAME> was considerably abated , and with irregular course she sometimes swam in the bosom of the waters , sometimes floated on their surface .
0	<NAME> , a <NAME> historian , born A.D. 105 , wrote an account of the navigation of the <NAME> or <NAME> , and pointed out as nearly as possible , the countries that had been discovered by explorers who had lived before his time ; and Ptolemy the <NAME> , about A.D. 175 , making use of the writings of his predecessors , published a celebrated geography , in which , for the first time , places and cities were marked in their relative latitude and longitude on a mathematical plan .
0	<NAME> continued to sail between the 15th and 16th degrees , and was not long in finding himself `` all of a sudden '' in the midst of islands which were half submerged .
0	“ But we shall see. ” The blacksmith set to work .
0	On coming down from the slight eminence <NAME> went on in front , as it had been agreed that he was to be our guide .
0	All at once , the lad , who had strolled by the river , came running back , and , pointing up the <NAME> , exclaimed , -- `` What is floating there ? ''
0	`` Professor , I am sorry for one of the best vessels in the <NAME> navy ; but they attacked me , and I was bound to defend myself .
0	said the doctor ; `` the fact is certain , we need give it no more thought . ''
0	`` They are already laying the pipes , and the works are entirely completed . ''
0	The <NAME> who was taken was recognized by the surgeon as the chief who had so generously assisted them during the storm .
0	<NAME> ! ” “ <NAME> ! ” interrupted <NAME> .
0	<NAME> <NAME> hastened towards him .
0	`` More than that , '' replied <NAME> ; `` we should have been burned to death . ''
0	But my eye was no sooner applied to the glass than it was quickly snatched out of my hands .
0	It was only natural under these circumstances that the population rapidly decreased , and the day was not far off when it would be wholly exterminated .
0	<NAME> , I wish to speak with you -- alone ! ” The engineer ’ s companions , respecting the wish , retired .
0	The approaching marriage created great excitement in <NAME> .
0	“ And I hope the inundation will have gone down in twenty-four hours , ” said <NAME> .
0	The clock was striking twelve , the hour of breakfast .
0	The <NAME> could never be reached , but was it not possible that her surface could be carefully observed ?
0	Besides , <NAME> would never consent to leave his vessel .
0	“ Ah , my brave boy ! ” thought <NAME> .
0	A lighted brand was also presented to them , and fully persuaded that it was a peaceful ceremony , they did not hesitate to light the pile which was prepared .
0	He was perfectly contented and satisfied .
0	I knew that in time he must hit upon the right phrase .
0	There was another silence of nearly a quarter of an hour .
0	While these cares kept <NAME> far from his capital , small bodies of troops , sent in different directions , penetrated into the most distant provinces of the empire , with the object of extinguishing the last smouldering embers of resistance ; so many of the soldiers were employed in this way , that there remained in <NAME> itself but a very small body of troops .
0	But having no taste for his father 's profession , he devoted himself to the sciences , and published a Treatise on the <NAME> , whilst he obtained a commission in the <NAME> .
0	There , hospitable as he was , like all the <NAME> of the old race , <NAME> lived with his daughter <NAME> , who after the death of her mother had taken charge of his household .
0	In the color of the water , the shape of the waves , the direction of the wind , he tried to find traces of neighboring land .
0	They placed them over our outer clothing , and so loaded us that we could scarcely move . ''
0	Regarding her formation , her origin , her inhabitability , they could easily tell what system _should_ be rejected and what _might_ be admitted .
0	<NAME> seized his hands and stopped him .
0	“ Do you want me to eat with a good appetite ? ” “ It will be doing us all possible honor , <NAME> , ” answered Ford .
0	Besides , for many months the <NAME> had been attracting the public attention ; the singularity of its build , the mystery which enshrouded it , the incognito maintained by the captain , the manner in which <NAME> received the proposition of superintending its outfit , the careful selection of the crew , its unknown destination , scarcely conjectured by any , -- all combined to give this brig a reputation of something more than strangeness .
0	[ Illustration ] After they had followed these footprints for a short time , the doctor said , -- `` Well , that is clear enough . ''
0	The atmosphere was less buoyant than that of the earth , but no difficulty in ascending was to be apprehended .
0	How ridiculous , yet how natural , is this vanity !
0	Do you , or do you not , think that the <NAME> resembles the <NAME> in being the abode of animals and intelligent beings ?
0	`` Well , we must go straight for him , '' said <NAME> ; `` it is dangerous , but what does it matter ?
0	The bears had crossed the blocks , and were mounting to the assault of the ship .
0	<NAME> nothing more about that , or rather , say nothing more at all .
0	I only hope the ventilation will hold out. ” There was , however , nothing to fear on the score of ventilation .
0	The expeditions of <NAME> were followed by those of <NAME> and of <NAME> , to whom we owe , if not new discoveries , important observations on the tides , the variation of the weather and the temperature , and on a number of natural phenomena .
0	resumed <NAME> with emotion ; `` to you as much as to me !
0	Kai-Koumou was the only one of all the chiefs that obeyed the call of <NAME> , who had returned to the lake district , and he was the first to announce to his tribe the defeat of the national insurrection , beaten on the plains of the lower <NAME> .
0	So they had a chance of salvation , and the case was not quite so desperate .
0	Meanwhile <NAME> strode rapidly on .
0	“ Yes , but we are assured on one point , ” answered <NAME> .
0	`` I shall save him , '' said the doctor ; `` I 'll answer for it , and we shall find out the explanation of this puzzle . ''
0	It was evident that there , in the depths of these narrow gorges , perhaps even in the interior of <NAME> itself , was the proper place to pursue their researches .
0	Other navigators of the <NAME> seas had all halted below it .
0	Moreover , a sultry heat oppressed the plain .
0	<NAME> <NAME> affirms that <NAME> is only united to <NAME> by the <NAME> of <NAME> , and he visits <NAME> .
0	Lastly , he went to <NAME> by way of <NAME> and <NAME> .
0	The smoking crater presented the appearance of a hollow sulphurous semi-circle about 1200 feet wide and 300 feet deep , covered with the débris of pumice and other stones .
0	Where could it be hidden ? ''
0	the veins of coal are still considerable , and the hundred thousand miners who annually extract from them a hundred millions of hundredweights have not nearly exhausted them. ” “ With the increasing consumption of coal , ” replied <NAME> , “ it can be foreseen that the hundred thousand workmen will soon become two hundred thousand , and that the rate of extraction will be doubled. ” “ Doubtless ; but after the <NAME> mines , which will be soon worked more thoroughly with new machines , the <NAME> and <NAME> mines will for a long time yet provide for the consumption in trade. ” “ For how long a time ? ” asked the reporter .
0	There were hundreds , perhaps thousands , of these animals , and in spite of the rarefied atmosphere , their noise was deafening .
0	The aspect of the land is flat and monotonous , so that a journey of one or two miles will give as fair an impression of the country as a complete tour of the island .
0	The five convicts had evidently camped on this spot ; but , -- and this was the object of so minute an examination , -- a sixth footprint could not be discovered , which in that case would have been that of <NAME> .
0	Fragments of mountains fell into the <NAME> , and , in a few minutes , the ocean rolled over the spot where <NAME> once stood .
0	When they perceived us , they hurried up eagerly to congratulate us on our success .
0	answered Altamont in great alarm , indicating a point in the horizon .
0	`` I conclude that we have twenty-six minutes left , '' replied <NAME> .
0	continued <NAME> , `` they 've got into a good place . ''
0	“ No , your Lordship , ” said the captain in a firm tone , “ I must be alone with my men .
0	This time , thanks to the power of their arms as well as to the richness of the presents offered to the <NAME> , the reception was different , and the versatile prince agreed to all the demands of <NAME> : namely , a monopoly of the trade in aromatics and spicery , and the right of seizure upon all vessels which should infringe this privilege .
0	The general route of the <NAME> Indian <NAME> is as follows : Leaving <NAME> , it passes through <NAME> , crossing to the continent opposite <NAME> , goes over the chain of the <NAME> , runs thence north-east as far as <NAME> , skirts the nearly independent territory of <NAME> , ascends to <NAME> , turns thence eastwardly , meeting the <NAME> at <NAME> , then departs from the river a little , and , descending south-eastward by <NAME> and the <NAME> town of <NAME> , has its terminus at <NAME> .
0	<NAME> <NAME> was now on board the ‘ Duncan , ’ but <NAME> was there also .
0	Before leaving the <NAME> , however , the naturalist , <NAME> , planted its destitute shores with several sorts of vegetables , which he thought likely to be of service to future voyagers who might be detained there .
0	The next morning I went on to the bridge .
0	Well now , the man at the helm has only to give a turn at the wheel , and the <NAME> will sail as easily to <NAME> as to <NAME> ; and since it is only a pleasure trip that you are -- ” His proposal was met by such grave , disapproving shakes of the head , that he stopped short before the sentence was completed ; and <NAME> said : “ <NAME> , if we were only on a pleasure trip , I should reply , ‘ Let us all go to <NAME> together , ’ and I am sure <NAME> would not object ; but the <NAME> is going to bring back shipwrecked mariners who were cast away on the shores of <NAME> , and we could not alter such a destination. ” The <NAME> was soon put in possession of all the circumstances of the case .
0	Who can prove that , without the denunciation which had brought about your arrest , you would have given yourself up ? ” “ This memoir , in the first place. ” “ That memoir was in your possession , and there is nothing to show that had you not been arrested , you would have put it to the use you say you intended. ” “ At the least , sir , there was one thing that was not in my possession , and of the authenticity of which there can be no doubt. ” “ What ? ” “ The letter I wrote to your predecessor , Judge <NAME> , the letter which gave him notice of my early arrival. ” “ Ah !
0	They went from one prairie to another , always finding a well-spread table for their four-footed guests .
0	`` Yes , but I ought to have expected it , '' said the doctor ; `` and I should not have thrown the seed away so stupidly , especially since I might have started them near the kitchen stove . ''
0	The guariba noiselessly approached , brandishing a study cudgel , which , wielded by his muscular arm , would have proved a formidable weapon .
0	“ <NAME> , ” said <NAME> ; “ we have come to ask a favor. ” Imagining that at least half his property was to be confiscated , the Jew began to break out into his usual formula about being a poor man and having nothing to spare ; but <NAME> , without heeding his complainings , went on : “ We are not going to ruin you , you know. ” <NAME> looked keenly into the captain ’ s face .
0	On this island pigs were to be found , but no `` _pounamon_ '' the green jade which the <NAME> use in the manufacture of their most valuable tools ; strange to say , however , jade is to be found on the southern island , but there are no pigs .
0	`` We accept , '' replied Messrs. Stuart , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , after consulting each other .
0	For a long while this thought haunted my mind , and I had a kind of presentiment that before long chance would betray the captain 's secrets .
0	when the happy company thought they had lost their guiding thread !
0	As heroic as they had before been credulous , fastening ropes round their waists , they rushed into the waves to the aid of those on the wreck .
0	This <NAME> was then a captain of the woods .
0	Perhaps the bears , if they caught sight of nothing , might be thrown off the track ; or , if they were met singly , they might be attacked successfully .
0	`` Long may he wave , and may his shadow never grow less ! ''
0	Let us camp here , where we have provisions , and let one of us take your orders to <NAME> to go on to <NAME> Bay. ” This unexpected proposition was greeted with astonishment , and by <NAME> with openly-expressed opposition .
0	From <NAME> to Forty-Seven Minutes Past Ten P. M. II .
0	With the fall of the capital was involved , properly speaking , that of the <NAME> empire ; if there were still some resistance , as notably there was in the province of <NAME> , it was of an isolated character , and a few detachments of troops sufficed to reduce to submission the last remaining opponents of the <NAME> , terrified as the Mexicans were by the punishments which had been dealt out to the people of <NAME> , who had revolted .
0	Ice or vapor will do , but water wo n't ! ''
0	I undo the bolts , and the little boat goes up to the surface of the sea with prodigious rapidity .
0	These suckling-pigs were really delicious , and <NAME> was devouring his share with great gusto , when all at once a cry and an oath escaped him .
0	Exactly two hundred feet behind the angle formed by the river , the wall , terminated by a fall of rocks , died away in a gentle slope to the edge of the forest .
0	As to <NAME> , he did not speak ; he simply gazed , and by the mistrust which his look expressed , it appeared that he was examining some strange country .
0	Will <NAME> took two or three turns on the poop , making it resound with iron-heeled boots , and then he turned abruptly to <NAME> .
0	And if one of these creatures went from Behring to <NAME> , it must be simply because there is a passage from one sea to the other , either on the <NAME> or the <NAME> side . ''
0	`` We are now , '' continued the Professor , `` exactly thirty-five leagues -- above a hundred miles -- down into the interior of the earth . ''
0	This vessel was especially equipped for a voyage of discovery upon the <NAME> coast .
0	For himself , not content with all that he had done hitherto , and wishing to execute the mission which death had prevented <NAME> from accomplishing , he went into <NAME> , where the `` negus '' or king , known by the name of Prester <NAME> , flattered by seeing his alliance sought by one of the most powerful sovereigns of <NAME> , received him with the greatest kindness , and gave him a high position at his court , but to make sure of retaining his services , he constantly refused him permission to leave the country .
0	“ That is not surprising , ” answered the reporter .
0	`` Do you know , my friends , '' said <NAME> , `` that if one of us had succumbed to the shock consequent on departure , we should have had a great deal of trouble to bury him ?
0	However , I do n't fancy seeing them so much together .
0	The large cave was lighted by the <NAME> ’ s_ lamps , while several lanterns , suspended at intervals along the acclivity that led to their deserted quarters above , gave a weird picturesqueness to the scene , that might vie with any of the graphic descriptions of the “ <NAME> ’ Entertainments. ” “ How do you like this , <NAME> ? ” said <NAME> .
0	cried <NAME> , half rising from his bed , notwithstanding his weakness .
0	This token was a grey and yellow garment worn and patched , an ill-omened rag thrown down at the foot of a tree .
0	“ He hides it very well , but he is a poet himself when his time comes , and he admires as much as we do all these beauties of nature .
0	By-the-way , the moon did come up , too , and all red , as if she was in a rage. ” While the three friends went on chatting of this and other things , and <NAME> examined the luminary of night from an entirely novel point of view , the heavens became covered with heavy clouds to the northward , and the lowering masses assumed a most sinister and threatening look .
0	“ Perhaps tomorrow the river may be practicable. ” “ And will that save my unhappy men ? ” cried <NAME> .
0	They took the articles as they came , intending to sort them afterwards .
0	At length , looking at me and shaking his head , he answered , -- `` No , not both .
0	He had been at work exactly an hour .
0	At this time <NAME> was a large community , of some thousand Indians capable of bearing arms , who recognized the authority of the missionaries of the different tribes .
0	And one day , on the 22nd November , they found themselves in conference at the <NAME> , in the rooms of <NAME> and <NAME> , the meeting being due to the diplomatic efforts of <NAME> .
0	When he left Armenia he took a north-easterly course towards <NAME> , a kingdom lying on the south side of the <NAME> , whose ancient kings , says the legend , `` were born with an eagle traced on their right shoulders . ''
0	`` <NAME> , '' according to his narrative , `` is by far the largest sheet of water known in these regions .
0	You are always harking back on that subject , like brave <NAME> . ''
0	My uncle , who already belonged to nearly every literary and scientific institution in <NAME> , immediately yielded to the amiable wishes of good `` And now , '' he said , after many expressions of gratitude and good will , `` if you will tell me what books you expected to find , perhaps I may be of some assistance to you . ''
0	Now let us say that it signifies _a_ or _o. ” _ After this was done , the judge found out the letter which recurred most frequently after _h , _ and so on , and he formed the following table : _h_ = 23 times _d p q_ = 16 -- _g v_ = 13 -- _o r x z_ = 12 -- _f s_ = 10 -- _e k l m n_ = 9 -- _j t_ = 8 -- _b i_ = 8 -- _a c_ = 8 -- “ Now the letter _a_ only occurs thrice ! ” exclaimed the judge , “ and it ought to occur the oftenest .
0	It recalled to Pencroft the day on which he lighted his only match , and all the anxiety of the operation .
0	I forgot all -- fatigue , friends and collections -- and accepted without hesitation the offer of the <NAME> Government .
0	“ <NAME> , -- is it <NAME> where they have been shipwrecked ?
0	<NAME> to his word , the captain next morning arrived at the tartan .
0	What do you think about it , <NAME> ? ''
0	An <NAME> and a <NAME> both together in the midst of the wilderness ! ” “ And the whole of it is to remain useless ! ” “ Perhaps !
0	<NAME> sent several times to inquire after the unfortunate servant 's health , but he was not deceived by these demonstrations of interest , for he knew they were only dictated by a wish to get possession of the traveller 's baggage , which was supposed to be full of gold and silver .
0	Their faces were as red as if they were standing before a hot fire ; their breathing was loud , and their lungs heaved like a smith 's bellows ; their eyes blazed like burning coals ; their voices sounded as loud and harsh as that of a stump speaker trying to make himself heard by an inattentive or hostile crowd ; their words popped from their lips like corks from <NAME> bottles ; their gesticulating became wilder and in fact more alarming -- considering the little room left in the Projectile for muscular displays of any kind .
0	On every side he was met with embarrassed silence or such replies as , `` The affair happened so long ago , I ca n't remember it , '' or , `` I was not witness to it . ''
0	There was but one way of working .

0	He resolved to send a fleet to explore them , for <NAME> had enough to do in <NAME> to restrain the trembling <NAME> , and the <NAME> -- Moors as they were then called -- who were always ready to shake off the yoke .
0	answered <NAME> , trembling with excitement .
0	`` It may be so , sir , '' I timidly observed , `` but why conceal it from posterity , if it be a useful , a worthy discovery ? ''
0	After coasting <NAME> , he discovered several islands or islets in succession , upon which he did not touch .
0	<NAME> <NAME> was only rounded on the 26th .
0	<NAME> <NAME> , for instance , was not more than about 2068 feet high , <NAME> 2121 feet , and <NAME> , the loftiest of them all , about 3047 feet .
0	Perhaps we may have to fire ; so we have one shot in the rifle ; four for the two muskets ; twelve in the two revolvers ; or seventeen in all , which might be fired in a quarter of a minute .
0	By way of precaution , <NAME> went first to the office of the steam-packet company , and there made sure that the <NAME> would start at the appointed hour .
0	These wise words of <NAME> , in his <NAME> la <NAME> , might have been used by <NAME> , so exactly do they correspond with and express his sentiments .
0	Upon the 15th of July , a tall woman , apparently some forty-five years of age , of majestic appearance , and who seemed to be much respected by the natives , came on board the <NAME> .
0	They were pursuing the high road to <NAME> .
0	Had the proposition now been made to go back to the summit of <NAME> , I should have declined the offer in a most indignant manner .
0	`` And you pretend , <NAME> , '' asked <NAME> , `` that by means of these hieroglyphics , more incomprehensible than the <NAME> , you can find what initiatory speed it was necessary to give the projectile ? ''
0	It would be cruel -- too cruel .
0	It took four days to go up this canal , and it was so wide that two triremes could go abreast .
0	The multitude , half deceived , showed not a little ill-humour .
0	<NAME> feet above this bridge is a second , fifty feet long by forty wide , and not more than eight feet thick in the middle .
0	The <NAME> des <NAME> , which is situated in 58 degrees 37 minutes N .
0	But before they sat down to table , the doctor said in a voice of triumph , as he pointed to his two companions , -- `` <NAME> , I carried away with me an Englishman and an <NAME> , did I not ? ''
0	But <NAME> was blind and obstinate , and determined to sacrifice himself at all hazards , when suddenly he felt himself violently pushed back .
0	But if he could in no respect reckon on chance , was it impossible to proceed by reasoning ?
0	The bank-notes , sealed with the emperor 's seal , are made of a kind of card-board manufactured from the bark of the mulberry-tree .
0	Another line of reasoning partially decided me .
0	They would find some one there to speak to , at all events .
0	Inside the palace or mosque are gold and silver houses , large enough to hold two or three persons at a time , if they wish to wash or bathe in them . ''
0	`` I hope the ship will not arrive before we are ready ! ''
0	<NAME> begged him to repeat the word until he could pronounce it .
0	Meanwhile the terrors of this winter 's night had increased .
0	“ Just there , sir , ” returned Ford , “ and I was able to light it only by bringing my lamp near to the cracks in the rock .
0	What terror then could have driven them among the precipices of the Andes ?
0	It might have been fancied that she had weighed anchor , thinking that she had to deal with her match , and had left the coast .
0	But <NAME> clung to him only the more fiercely , and they had been contending thus without the doctor seeing them for many seconds , when , suddenly the rifle went off .
0	For three days the weather caused the working of the ship to be unusually laborious , and the new crew behaved very well ; thereupon the boatswain congratulated them .
0	`` Because generally there is a periodic frost in the month of May , and the greatest fall of temperature takes place from the 11th to the 13th of this month .
0	He caught at it at once , and , placing his two hands upright at a distance of three inches one from the other , he made us understand that he meant to indicate the width of the little river which formed our watering place ; and then , holding them wider apart , he indicated that the second width was to represent that of the river <NAME> ; and , separating them still more , he gave the breadth of the strait which divides his country from <NAME> .
0	They heaved the log a second time .
0	To the merchants succeed the missionaries .
0	Besides , in his present position , the manoeuvre had become a very perilous one , for the <NAME> threatened to break away before he should be able to get into the car again .
0	But I thought it best not to urge this argument .
0	and no war in prospect ! ''
0	[ Illustration : Discovery of <NAME> . ]
0	`` You have your chronometer at hand ? ''
0	<NAME> did not insist , and was fain to resign himself to await the arrival of the important document ; but he was determined not to lose sight of the mysterious rogue as long as he stayed in <NAME> .
0	<NAME> <NAME> was of the same opinion .
0	Thus a remarkably brilliant flame would be obtained , whose light would rival the electric light , which , as everybody knows , is , according to <NAME> 's experiments , equal to that of eleven hundred and seventy-one wax candles , -- not one more , nor one less .
0	the unfortunate man had wept !
0	Here <NAME> , accompanied by <NAME> Maston—a very good portrait—and <NAME> , descended in a balloon on the point in question , and , after unheard-of dangers , succeeded in capturing a lump of coal weighing half a pound , which was all the circumpolar deposit contained .
0	He maintained that it was absolutely impossible to impress upon any body whatever a velocity of 12,000 yards per second ; that even with such a velocity a projectile of such a weight could not transcend the limits of the earth 's atmosphere .
0	In spite of all the learned theories of <NAME> , a fierce and vehement fire certainly burned within the entrails of the great spheroid .
0	This meadow was to be surrounded by a palisade , high enough to prevent even the most agile animals from leaping over .
0	As they pronounced these words with a menacing air , the two notables , with folded arms and bristling air , confronted <NAME> , ready to do him some violence , if by a gesture , or even the expression of his eye , he manifested any intention of contradicting them .
0	They were a large kind of `` chaluts , '' like those on the <NAME> coasts , great pockets that the waves and a chain fixed in the smaller meshes kept open .
0	`` Shall I ever realize the absurdity of my entering into an argument with a scientist ! ''
0	`` Who is his own brother , sir . ''
0	<NAME> , as may be believed , was all eagerness to carry out his new enterprise , and would not leave his work for an instant .
0	“ <NAME> , one would have thought that <NAME> and <NAME> had given the word to fire together ! ” “ Gentlemen , ” said <NAME> , as he reloaded his gun , “ this is becoming more serious .
0	“ Very well ; let us get on to the town , for our fair travelers , with all their courage , will not be sorry , I fancy , to have a good night ’ s rest. ” “ My dear <NAME> , <NAME> and I will accept it gladly , but only on the condition that it will cause no delay , or take us the least out of the road. ” “ It will do neither , ” replied <NAME> .
0	`` Well , at noon we shall see the point . ''
0	However , about eleven o ’ clock , the wind fell , the sea went down , and the speed of the vessel , as she labored less , greatly increased .
0	It is to the Maories what the <NAME> is to the <NAME> , and the <NAME> to the <NAME> .
0	<NAME> spurted from my nose and mouth !
0	During this stay the map of this archipelago was rectified and an opportunity was taken to visit <NAME> , where the <NAME> excited as much curiosity as they felt themselves at the sight of the many things which were new to them .
0	`` And yet men have dared to come into these seas under sail alone !
0	It was evidently a court-room , and a crowd of <NAME> and natives already occupied the rear of the apartment .
0	A hundred paces away from the prison , however , the waste land was crossed by one of those canals which flow through the town into the <NAME> .
0	It was six o'clock in the morning when the settlers , after a hasty breakfast , set out to reach by the shortest way the western coast of the island .
0	As my uncle spoke , we reached the sandy shore , and saw and heard the waves breaking monotonously on the beach .
0	Near its centre , on the south-east , are the islands inhabited by the <NAME> , a race who live by pillaging the people of the mainland .
0	These mutual compliments were interrupted by the arrival of the seven horses , saddled and ready .
0	But he 's a good fellow , you may depend on it . ''
0	The pressure of the water had evidently now become too enormous to allow further descent .
0	In many places , hollows here and hillocks there attested great dislocations at some other period of the terrestrial mass .
0	From this communication it appeared that two <NAME> captains , from <NAME> , had stated that <NAME> , in command of the <NAME> frigate <NAME> , had seen , `` near the <NAME> , in the <NAME> , men dressed in the <NAME> style , and in what he took to be <NAME> uniforms . ''
0	It was only necessary to demolish a piece of wall in order to allow it to flow out in a vast stream .
0	I sent them off by hundreds .

0	Now I have a chance offered me to complete , or , rather , to make over my knowledge of medicine , surgery , history , geography , botany , mineralogy , conchology , geodesy , chemistry , physics , mechanics , hydrography ; well , I accept it , and I assure you , I did n't have to be asked twice . ''
0	But I can also make the <NAME> rise and sink , and sink and rise , by a vertical movement by means of two inclined planes fastened to its sides , opposite the centre of flotation , planes that move in every direction , and that are worked by powerful levers from the interior .
0	Judging by appearances , we of the present day know much more on this subject than did the fellow-countrymen and contemporaries of <NAME> .
0	“ It ’ s mighty easy to manage it ; you turn a cock , and the thing ’ s done. ” “ Ah !
0	`` Whatever <NAME> thinks of , attempts , or tries , what does it matter to me ?
0	It was at this time that a rich merchant of <NAME> , <NAME> , in concert with a skilful mariner , named <NAME> , conceived a project for reaching the Indies by a new route .
0	`` That was well said , captain , '' replied the sailor ; `` but , all the same , it is my opinion that we shall not find that gentleman until he pleases . ''
0	Among the sources of wealth in Tafilet we may name very fine sheep , whose beautifully white wool makes very pretty coverlets , oxen , first-rate horses , donkeys , and mules .
0	It was useless to think of crossing <NAME> , with its fanatic population , in <NAME> dress .
0	`` <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> eagerly , `` can you compare a copper or steel machine with that breath of God which is called the soul , which animates our bodies as the breeze stirs the flowers ?
0	I estimated ( though , perhaps , I may be mistaken ) -- I estimated this adventurous course of the <NAME> to have lasted fifteen or twenty days .
0	`` Aye , aye , sir ; do n't be uneasy . ''
0	I replied only by a shake of my head , which <NAME> could not fail to understand .
0	Since the murder of <NAME> many changes had taken place in this archipelago .
0	<NAME> was in mortal suspense .
0	`` A chain , <NAME> , whose first link , so far as we are concerned , is <NAME> 's ice-block , and whose last will be <NAME> .
0	I can affirm that no later than last evening an author was seen bending over his desk , holding in one hand an open volume of the `` Spectator , '' while with the other he was thawing his ink by the flame of the lamp .
0	There was , however , a dark side to the picture .
0	How he labored to recover himself by work !
0	`` You will not permit it ? ''
0	Indeed , everybody knows that sailors have a remarkable aptitude for tailoring .
0	On the way <NAME> had discovered a tree , the branches of which the Indians of <NAME> employ for making their bows .
0	On the 26th , <NAME> , who was ahead , shouted suddenly to his companions .
0	There would be no storms , no lee-shore to fear .
0	This expedition consisted of the brig <NAME> , 160 tons , <NAME> , and the cutter <NAME> , sixty-five tons , <NAME> commander .
0	I returned to the saloon after having breakfast and set to work .
0	<NAME> <NAME> stood still , without saying a word .
0	At daybreak <NAME> examined the landing-place ; the yawl , which was now their only boat , would carry the crew and the passengers .
0	`` By the mercy of <NAME> , <NAME> !
0	The entire glory of this discovery , foreseen though it was by scientific men , belongs to the <NAME> .
0	Happily the prudence and address of President <NAME> averted the danger .
0	It was then discovered , by taking the longitude 20 degrees 43 minutes east of the <NAME> meridian , that they were in the parallel ( 40 degrees to 41 degrees south ) of the islands named in <NAME> 's chart as <NAME> and <NAME> , and not marked at all upon <NAME> maps .
0	said the <NAME> , shuddering at the idea .
0	<NAME> Sounds. -- A Night Attack. -- <NAME> and <NAME> in the Tree. -- Two Shots. -- “ Help !
0	the charms of <NAME> failed to act , to <NAME> 's great surprise ; and the disturbances , if they existed , would have been more difficult to calculate than those of <NAME> which led to the discovery of <NAME> .
0	Some of them struck the sea and ricochetted , losing themselves in the distance .
0	“ And that year , like every other year , ought to be divided into twelve months. ” “ Yes , certainly , if you wish it , ” said the captain , acquiescing .
0	On the 7th of February he approaches King <NAME> 's <NAME> and runs to the east , where he soon sights the Cape of <NAME> of <NAME> , and the island named after that navigator .
0	They had also to be careful not to fall into one or other of them , which would have been both dangerous and humiliating ; to be taken in their own snares !
0	In the wide open spot , for instance , connected on the south with vast continents and terminating in a point , it would be no easy matter to recognize the reversed image of the <NAME> , the <NAME> , and <NAME> .
0	So then it was all true ?
0	Such a shot , the honor of which belonged to his dear boy .
0	It made him uneasy about the future .
0	The only sentiment of love felt by <NAME> was that which he entertained for his mother , the aged <NAME> , who could never be induced to leave the house of the <NAME> , at <NAME> , on the banks of the <NAME> , where the old huntsman and she had lived so long together .
0	The next day the settlers went to collect some and returned to <NAME> with an ample supply of cycas stems .
0	cried <NAME> ; after some moments ' silence .
0	The Americans are much more practical with their Mississippi islands ; they number them -- -- ” “ As they number the avenues and streets of their towns , ” replied <NAME> .
0	It is divided into several governments or provinces , those of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> ; contains two districts , <NAME> and <NAME> ; and possesses two countries , now under the <NAME> dominion -- that of the <NAME> and that of the <NAME> .
0	On the 21st June the <NAME> once more set sail and touched at <NAME> , and at the <NAME> , where D'Urville had hoped to meet <NAME> , who would have been able to give him some valuable hints on the navigation of the coast of <NAME> .
0	The whale , having taken another breath , had dived again ; but soon it came up and projected fifteen feet into the air that combination of gases and mucous fluid which escapes from its vent-holes .
0	One grasp of the hand , and may God protect us ! ''
0	`` My dear <NAME> , how can a judge give a wise sentence in a clerk 's wig ? ''
0	The best naval glasses could not have discovered the projectile wandering around its hemisphere , and yet all were pointed toward that brilliant disc which millions of eyes were looking at at the same moment .
0	This contrivance is much used by the <NAME> ; and when a fête is given , the host , as a matter of politeness , always presents one to each of his guests , who use them before any ceremonial banquet .
0	The summits of the rocks are lost in the clouds and the valleys are covered with perpetual snow .
0	“ What causes that ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	What a freak of nature , a bird 's beak on a mollusc !
0	`` But you , '' asked <NAME> , hurriedly , `` were you not on your way to the Pole ? ''
0	At the close of this expedition , which was almost entirely unproductive , we lose sight of <NAME> , if not completely , at least so as to be insufficiently informed about his deeds and voyages until 1517 .

0	A few Indians had wandered to the mouth of this river .
0	“ Well ! ” said the reporter , pressing the sailor ’ s hand .
0	“ The unhappy man has been surprised , ” said <NAME> , “ and as he was a man to defend himself , he must have been overpowered. ” “ Yes , that is to be feared ! ” said the reporter .
0	From the number on the board he gradually built up a definitive formula , and then noting it on the left , he cleared away the working by which he had arrived at it , and launched forth into an appalling series of figures and signs .
0	He was carried to the sledge and placed there as comfortably as possible ; the dogs , including <NAME> , were harnessed in ; the travellers cast one last glance at the spot where the <NAME> had lain .
0	Man is made for society and not for solitude , and solitude can only engender despair .
0	At about half-past five , however , M'Nicholl , who had been gazing for some time with his telescope in a particular direction , called the attention of his companions to some bright specks of light barely discernible in that part of the horizon towards which the Projectile was evidently moving .
0	<NAME> ’ t think any more of that letter just now. ” On the old woman ’ s invitation , each drew in his chair , <NAME> opposite to <NAME> -- to do him honor -- the father and son opposite to each other .
0	`` Well , I suppose not , except it may be a certain amount of pain in the ears , '' was my rather grim reply .
0	About thirty pirates could be seen moving on the deck .
0	The animals had also perished in the catastrophe ; the birds , as well as those representing the fauna of the island -- all either crushed or drowned , and the unfortunate Jup himself had , alas !
0	They appeared determined to offer every possible obstacle to the execution of <NAME> 's orders .
0	<NAME> , which seemed as if it issued from the dense forest , covered the clearing .
0	But , after all , the situation was not changed for those among the nine ( now only remaining of the twenty-three ) who should not have drawn the lot of departure .
0	From November to March the sky is always cloudless , and a constant south wind prevails , as the coast is sheltered by the mountain range of the Andes .
0	His conduct and intelligence gave a favourable idea of the inhabitants of the <NAME> .
0	exclaimed <NAME> , seriously ; `` have we not the same weight everywhere ? ''
0	asked <NAME> quickly , as he looked up and saw the Frenchman pointing to something outside the Projectile .
0	They had scarcely rejoined <NAME> and <NAME> , before the islet was overrun with pirates in every direction .
0	cried <NAME> : `` well , a very fanciful eye may detect a face , though , for the sake of <NAME> 's beauteous sister , I regret to say , a terribly pockmarked one ! ''
0	<NAME> tacked in and out along the <NAME> coast ; he saw the two mountains -- <NAME> and <NAME> ; he explored a harbour to which he gave the name of <NAME> del Principe , and an archipelago which he called the <NAME> of <NAME> .
0	-- '' Therefore it 's a _parabola_ , and must be ! ''
0	They knew that <NAME> coinage is all decimal , the franc being the standard of which the other coins , whether gold , silver , or copper , are multiples or measures ; they knew , too , that the caliber or diameter of each piece of money is rigorously determined by law , and that the diameters of the silver coins representing five francs , two francs , and fifty centimes measure thirty-seven , twenty-seven , and eighteen millimeters respectively ; and they accordingly guessed that <NAME> had conceived the plan of placing such a number of these coins in juxtaposition that the length of their united diameters should measure exactly the thousand millimeters that make up the terrestrial meter .
0	But we are going up -- going up , still going up .
0	He saw his daughter alone , without a protector .
0	“ And when it is in the pot , ” asked <NAME> naturally , “ what will it be like ? ” “ An excellent piece of beef , ” replied <NAME> .
0	There was nothing to prevent him , if he chose , from partaking gratuitously of the volcanic light and heat which were being enjoyed by all besides ; but rather than abandon his close and personal oversight of his precious cargo , he preferred to sacrifice his own slender stock of fuel .
0	“ You see , my dear <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ we have come too soon , like honest citizens who like to get their money ’ s worth .

0	At last M'Nicholl opened his eyes , stared at <NAME> for an instant , pressed his hand , looked around searchingly and anxiously , and at last whispered in a faint voice : `` How 's <NAME> ? ''
0	In fact , when the boat was abandoned at the sources of the <NAME> , it had been agreed that after having surveyed the west coast , they should go back to it , and return to <NAME> by the <NAME> .
0	When <NAME> and his companions recovered consciousness , thanks to the attention lavished upon them , they found themselves in the cabin of a steamer , without being able to comprehend how they had escaped death .
0	Happily , after two long hours ' march , a beautiful country spread out before us , covered by olives , pomegranates , and vines , which appeared to belong to anybody and everybody .
0	Occasionally they wore necklaces and bracelets made of bits of wood or shells .
0	The water and the biscuits were soon on board ; but longer time was necessary to procure supplies of coal , which , however , was to be got without any other expense save that of paying the muleteers , who transported it to the beach from a mine scarcely beneath the level of the earth , where it was to be picked up for nothing .
0	This ingratitude and faithlessness overwhelmed the aged man ; his health , already so much impaired , did not improve , and grief carried him to the grave .
0	<NAME> hallucinations took possession of her .
0	Ice is drifting down the <NAME> , which will not be long in freezing , and in that case the <NAME> might perhaps cross. ” “ Will your Highness allow me to make an observation ? ” said the chief of the merchants .
0	The long serpent , covered with the remains of shells , bristling with foraminiferae , was encrusted with a strong coating which served as a protection against all boring molluscs .
0	`` We shall see you at work , '' answered <NAME> ; `` I 'll gladly eat it , <NAME> . ''
0	But the surrounding ocean was deserted as far as the eye could reach , and the colonists must rely on themselves for regaining their native land .
0	This argument cut short the harpooner 's recriminations .
0	your Lordship , ” murmured <NAME> , turning pale .
0	In fifteen days , and after a brush with the <NAME> , they reached <NAME> , having on their way taken measurements of every part of the temple of <NAME> , and determined , as <NAME> had done , its exact geographical position .
0	That news must go into to-day 's issue . ''
0	In him was recognized , not the indefatigable explorer who had braved so many dangers , but the infirm and deaf M. de Condamine , who always held his ear-trumpet in his hand .
0	`` So , '' said <NAME> , `` there is a hemisphere , that invisible hemisphere which is very ill supplied , very ill treated , by nature . ''
0	In short , the colonists had reason to be extremely satisfied , for this chest contained tools , weapons , instruments , clothes , books ; and this is the exact list of them as stated in <NAME> <NAME> 's note-book : -- Tools : -- 3 knives with several blades , 2 woodmen 's axes , 2 carpenter 's hatchets , 3 planes , 2 adzes , 1 twibil or mattock , 6 chisels , 2 files , 3 hammers , 3 gimlets , 2 augers , 10 bags of nails and screws , 3 saws of different sizes , 2 boxes of needles .
0	Other plates , closely fitted , covered the lenticular glasses , and the travelers , hermetically enclosed in their metal prison , were plunged in profound darkness .
0	A moment comes when the centre of gravity of these masses is displaced , and then they are completely overturned .
0	I added impatiently and eagerly .
0	The engine , which was constructed on a new system , was a high-pressure one , of 160-horse power , and put in motion a double screw .
0	It was probably <NAME> , for they ascertained , after doubling it , that the land inclined towards the north-east , and the east .
0	There was not a living being left to tell the tale .
0	At half-past one , notwithstanding all efforts , the raft came up against a thick barrier and stuck fast .
0	He thought of <NAME> Grant and his two sailors , and their deliverance from cruel bondage .
0	They must therefore be saved beforehand , or all hope would be lost .
0	The <NAME> cast anchor in <NAME> Bay on the 22nd of April , and their reception was as friendly as had been anticipated .
0	To gratify this natural yearning of humanity , to afford not only to every foreigner but to every native in the land an opportunity of beholding the three heroes who had reflected such indelible glory on the <NAME> name , and to do it all in a manner eminently worthy of the great <NAME> , instantly became the desire of the <NAME> .
0	Many specimens of the porcine race fled before them , and these animals , which were singularly active , did not appear to be in a humour to allow themselves to be approached .
0	“ Tobacco ! ” cried <NAME> , who evidently had never seen his favorite plant except in the bowl of his pipe .
0	<NAME> waited impatiently for milder weather ; he frequently consulted the barometer , but no confidence could be placed in this instrument , which in these high latitudes seems to lose some of its customary accuracy ; in these regions there are many exceptions to the general laws of nature : for instance , a clear sky was not always accompanied by cold , nor did a fall of snow raise the temperature ; the barometer was uncertain , as many explorers in these seas have noticed ; it used to fall when the wind was from the north or east ; when low it foretold fine weather ; when high , rain or snow .
0	As fate has cast me upon these shores , I shall not leave without having completely examined them . ''
0	His head was full of the entreaties and persuasion of his companion , and he determined to embark secretly on the <NAME> , for <NAME> would not have authorized him to defy the prohibition of his family .
0	All around , the lonely sea extended to the limits of the horizon .

0	The <NAME> and the <NAME> confirmed much of the information which <NAME> had already obtained .
0	“ No , ” thought he , “ no unguarded proceedings .
0	<NAME> explained that he only wanted to recover their books and papers , and to visit the scene of their death ; and the sultan in reply denied having anything belonging to them , adding a warning against his guest 's going to the place where they died , for it was a `` very bad place . ''
0	<NAME> <NAME> had an observatory built in the southern part of the province of <NAME> , at <NAME> , commanding a most splendid view over the sea , and seeming as though it must have been placed there to seek for some unknown land ; he also established a naval college , where learned geographers traced correct maps and taught the use of the mariner 's compass .
0	His dispirited tone made a painful impression on the minds of his auditors .
0	`` We have fifty chances out of a hundred of getting over , '' said one .
0	Well , and what were the contents of this letter ? ” “ It contained orders to leave <NAME> without delay , and go and cruise on the eastern coast of -- ” “ <NAME> ! ” said <NAME> with such vehemence that the old sailor was somewhat disconcerted .
0	The settlers had frequently been obliged to renew their store of wood .
0	It was to be composed of four vessels of medium size , `` in order , '' says <NAME> , `` that they may enter everywhere and again issue forth rapidly . ''
0	The rest of the ships lay to for some time to await her , but in vain , and the twelve vessels then continued their navigation upon the open sea , and not , as had been the manner hitherto , steering simply from cape to cape along the shores of <NAME> .
0	A landing was effected upon the volcanic island of <NAME> .
0	`` There , where perhaps <NAME> and his companions are also waiting , '' said I , to bring back the discussion to more practical points .

0	The half-breed continued to be very friendly with the son of <NAME> , so that the latter began to consider whether the sailing-master might not be counted on in an attempt to regain possession of the ship .
0	But their eyes saw nothing but large plains with no trace of a building .
0	I pity him , <NAME> , and I ca n't do anything to relieve him . ''
0	The sudden calm of this portion of the ocean came , without doubt , from the ascending motion of the columns of air , while the tempest , which was a cyclone , turned rapidly about this peaceful centre .
0	Of all our former collection of nautical and philosophical instruments , there remained only the chronometer and the compass .
0	“ Is it so ? ” he said roughly .
0	“ What does Thalcave mean ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	They were brought by <NAME> ’ s sons , and <NAME> <NAME> paid the sum stipulated for his various purchases , adding his cordial thanks , which the worthy Irishman valued at least as much as his golden guineas .
0	“ ‘ Sir , ’ said he to the <NAME> , ‘ in doubting my statements , you have grossly affronted me ; in believing the thing to be impossible , you have been egregiously mistaken ; and , in proof thereof , you will now eat this beef-steak raw , or you will give me instant satisfaction ! ’ The <NAME> had a wholesome dread of the brawny traveller , and <NAME> eat the steak , although not without a good many wry faces .
0	“ What is the exact longitude of <NAME> ? ” asked <NAME> .
0	They watch for days at their breathing-holes , and seize them the moment they come upon the ice .
0	`` Because I am an <NAME> ? ''
0	`` No doubt , and I congratulate you , <NAME> , for you are a happy man .
0	During their stay the <NAME> gave the Bushmen some hawks ' bells and other objects , which , to their surprise , were accepted , for in the time of Diaz the negroes had shown themselves timid and even hostile , and had thrown stones to prevent the crews from procuring water .
0	“ We will take a little rest , and recruit our strength .
0	All his apprehensions came from this quarter , and he dreaded every instant to hear some flourish of trumpets , announcing the arrival of the lieutenant of the <NAME> .

0	“ Well , <NAME> will be disgusted ! ” “ And <NAME> will perhaps be very perplexed how to explain this disappearance , ” thought <NAME> .
0	This project , which appeared to rest upon solid foundations , could not fail to please a young minister .
0	But , happily , the breeze did not blow from that side .
0	[ Illustration ] And , in fact , three or four young hares , springing about in the heath and young moss , ran boldly towards the three men ; they were so cunning that even <NAME> was softened .
0	They live upon monkeys , dogs , cats , rats , beef , and mutton .
0	<NAME> also observed the presence of minerals on the hills , and his discovery has been verified in late years by the proved existence of gold , iron , copper , coal , and nickel .
0	Looking up , he now said , “ Incident to this expected shock , there may be a variety of dangers .
0	Now then , prepare to receive orders for a new tableau !
0	Then he shook it , and a few coins inside sounded with a metallic ring .
0	At length a time came when despite the enormous thickness and weight of the upper crust , the mechanical forces of the combustible gases below became so great , that they actually upheaved the weighty back and made for themselves huge and gigantic shafts .
0	`` I should as soon believe in one calculation as in the other. -- But -- by the by -- why does not such extreme heat cook us all up like so many beefsteaks ? ''
0	<NAME> <NAME> was enabled to make some curious observations upon the savage inhabitants of those desolate regions .
0	And speaking thus , my uncle , half-naked , his leathern purse round his loins , and his spectacles upon his nose , became once more the terrible Professor of <NAME> .
0	Any stranger entering the mine was brought before <NAME> , that he might give an account of himself .
0	<NAME> was the region the <NAME> was now visiting , a perfect meadow , a close carpet of seaweed , fucus , and tropical berries , so thick and so compact that the stem of a vessel could hardly tear its way through it .

0	Wishing to give them a pleasant reception , one of my petty officers played the violin and the sailors danced .
0	And what would be the use of the <NAME> , which would escape , owing to its position on the neutral line ?
0	He named it <NAME> , because of all that he needed he had been able to procure but one thing -- wood .
0	The engineer announced to the stranger that his dwelling was ready to receive him , and the latter replied that he would go and sleep there that very evening .

0	This was the reason why the greater part of the <NAME> islanders took to flight , headed by their chief , Too-Wit , and the <NAME> , who are the leading personages of Klock-Klock .
0	“ You mustn ’ t be vexed , <NAME> ! ” “ Why should I be vexed , my child ? ” “ And you will let me do it ? ” “ What do you mean ? ” said <NAME> , getting uneasy .
0	His eye was steady , lively , rapid in its changes .
0	The captain could not be relied on to restrain them ; the wretched man tore his hair and wrung his hands .
0	Shall I tell you my theory ?
0	`` The difficulty is , '' said the doctor , `` the bears seem to me very rare and very wild ; they are not civilized enough to come within gun-shot . ''
0	`` If it is , '' continued <NAME> , `` I should not be afraid to go across the ice-fields . ''
0	This was evidently a balance-fish -- the most voracious of all the <NAME> species .
0	But , <NAME> , this wedding -- this wedding that we are both thinking of -- when is it coming off ?
0	My eyes turned involuntarily towards the glass , but I could not stand the fire which seemed to devour them .
0	At last , after having sailed over more than 12,000 miles without meeting with a single island , in a sea where so many and such populous archipelagos were destined to be discovered , the fleet came upon two desert and sterile islands , called for that reason the <NAME> , but of which the position is indicated in much too contradictory a manner , for it to be possible to recognize them .
0	In another instant our feet trod the bottom of the sea .
0	“ Then how did it manage ? ” “ At what distance from the sea did you leave this turtle ? ” asked the engineer , who , having suspended his work , was reflecting on this incident .
0	What events happened during the stay of the ships here ?
0	The front was set apart especially for the ladies , and , under the carpenter ’ s hands , was to be speedily converted into a comfortable room , covered with a thick carpet , and fitted up with a toilet table and two couches .
0	`` <NAME> , '' said <NAME> , taking the sailor 's hand , `` we will build another _Bonadventure_ -- a larger one .
0	Let us call it <NAME> ! ” The engineer ’ s proposal was replied to by three hurrahs .
0	It was , however , the <NAME> , as he became assured when he saw the water rising , although the wind was not violent .
0	The crew were almost all the time at work with the saws , and often powder had to be used to blow up the enormous blocks of ice which closed the way .
0	They themselves were but castaways , but it was to be feared that another might not have been so fortunate , and their duty was to go to his succor .
0	Orders had been given to march rapidly .
0	These thoughts kept him busy all day ; that evening they encamped as usual , and each one took his turn at watching near these unknown lands .
0	A young <NAME> , with an intelligent face , offered his services , which <NAME> accepted , promising so generous a reward as to materially stimulate his zeal .
0	An <NAME> criminal , you know , is always better concealed in <NAME> than anywhere else . ''
0	Therefore an explosive substance must be manufactured , which would make a deep trench in some other part of the shore .
0	`` Yes , friend <NAME> , '' observed <NAME> ; `` but there is a slight and unfortunately a fatal defect in your project .
0	His face , on which a bluish light cast a peculiar hue , became almost fearful to look at , and then , as if his eyes had been opened to the bright blaze spreading across the river , “ Ah ! ” he exclaimed , “ then Heaven itself is against us ! ” <NAME> , the capital of <NAME> , is a populous town , containing , in ordinary times , thirty thousand inhabitants .
0	`` Why not tell it at once then to a fellow that 's dying of impatience to know all about it ?

0	<NAME> <NAME> any means by which to warn his master ?
0	They were not long in coming upon a _moraï_ , similar in every respect to the <NAME> _moraïs_ .

0	Now , as they had undoubtedly made at least about fourteen miles in the interval , it was evident that the ice on which they were was being drifted southwards by a strong current .
0	It was now four o ’ clock in the morning .
0	I exclaimed , `` the same name as our sailing-master 's . ''
0	`` Do you know , my dear <NAME> , '' said <NAME> , `` that the explanation you gave yesterday on the subject of the bottle has not satisfied me at all !
0	At the same moment , firing broke out on the <NAME> and <NAME> of the town .
0	I am in truth <NAME> !
0	The mouth of the <NAME> is a bad place for a vessel , and the sea is heavy there . ''
0	`` But till that time we must be very watchful , '' said <NAME> .
0	During these preparations Harding arranged everything for his astronomical observation .
0	A seat in the stern , a second seat in the middle to preserve the equilibrium , a third seat in the bows , rowlocks for the two oars , a scull to steer with , completed the little craft , which was twelve feet long , and did not weigh more than two hundred pounds .
0	There was no longer any illusion possible .
0	`` Then , sir , you will sadly embarrass a poor ignorant , who , besides , asks nothing better than to learn . ''

0	He placed himself at the head of eighty horse-soldiers and 120 infantry , defeated on several occasions <NAME> , who disputed his passage , and thanks to his prudence and cleverness , he entered <NAME> victorious ; but he did not find there what he sought , that is to say , the treasures of <NAME> .
0	Both animals and birds , influenced by the heaviness of the atmosphere , remained motionless and silent .

0	And yet , from the oily sealskin clothes and boots , from their squat , fat figures , which make it hard to distinguish the men from the women , it was easy to declare the nature of their food ; besides , like all fish-eating people , they were somewhat troubled by leprosy , but their general health was not impaired by it .
0	The horizon is shut in by a barrier of mountains , ending on the south of the <NAME> , a volcano now almost extinct , but the eruptions of which have often caused frightful calamities .
0	Be silent , and farewell ! ” It must be admitted that <NAME> ’ s fears were far from groundless .
0	Who knows but we may come across some vestige of the crew of the <NAME> , supposing them to have succeeded in escaping from <NAME> . ''
0	“ Stop that howling , <NAME> ! ” “ Let him alone , <NAME> .
0	<NAME> <NAME> went next to <NAME> , the most easterly town of <NAME> Proper ; on leaving it , after a ride of seven days through magnificent forests abounding in game , he came to the province of <NAME> .
0	“ Under the circumstances , he must know that you have a right to make a requisition of his goods. ” “ No , no , ” quickly rejoined <NAME> ; “ we will not do that .
0	His able geographical and historical book at once provoked plentiful criticism .
0	I cast a last look at the man-of-war , which was putting on steam , and rejoined <NAME> and <NAME> .
0	`` I tell you , it wants nothing -- unless it is -- '' `` That will come , <NAME> , that will be found , '' replied the engineer ; `` but now we must continue our voyage and push on as far as the river will carry our boat ! ''
0	He even told <NAME> that his marriage was the last freak he would be able to allow himself .
0	The hardest heart would have been moved to see this hamlet , lost among these horrible solitudes .
0	<NAME> tried to resist at the risk of breaking his own oar , too , and <NAME> , with bleeding hands , seconded his efforts with all his might .
0	No time was lost in looking for a place suited for conversion into a temporary hospital , and one being found , the sick on board , to the number of twenty , were removed to it for treatment the very next day .
0	Therefore it is that I sleep in corners , all alone , for fear that his true name should be discovered . ''
0	About the 10th of February , the preparations were pretty well completed ; and the balloons , firmly secured , one within the other , were altogether finished .
0	`` As <NAME> , I am unwilling , we are unwilling , that others should go where we have not been .

0	Some officers were already perched on the mast-heads .
0	Again , although the recruits from the <NAME> formed only a total of fourteen men , as against the twelve of the old crew , was it not to be feared that some of the latter would take <NAME> 's side ?
0	I naturally led up the conversation to the giant unicorn , and examined the various chances of success or failure of the expedition .
0	Had this well branches besides the communication with the sea ?
0	How wonderfully had the field increased in extent , since eighteen months ago , when the first grain of wheat was sown !
0	The land of the <NAME> , opposite this rock , is steep , and covered with large trees . ''
0	They were also able to hunt with greater success , since <NAME> now possessed some dozen arrows armed with sharp points .

0	A whole hour at least would elapse before the hull of the brig could emerge from the water of the channel .
0	If we had started when there was an eclipse of the moon , all our passage would have been in the shadow , which would have been a pity . ''
0	There was a subject for conversation which the whole evening could not exhaust .
0	`` My regular hour for breakfast , '' exclaimed <NAME> , `` and I do n't see the shadow of a reason for changing it now . ''
0	Not only had the copper sheathing and the planks disappeared , reduced , no doubt , to powder , but also the ribs , the iron bolts , and tree-nails which united them .

0	Upon the 3rd of July , anchor was finally weighed , and ten days later , <NAME> put in at <NAME> in the <NAME> of <NAME> for refreshments .

0	There was nothing in sight on the sea , not a sail , neither on the horizon nor near the island .
0	But just as they were shoving off , an observation from <NAME> arrested them .
0	If the watch had neither lost or gained , it won the prize , which was in fact assigned to <NAME> .

0	The doctor made a tolerably large collection of northern birds , such as gulls , divers , molly-nochtes , and eider-ducks , which resemble ordinary ducks , with a white back and breast , a blue belly , the top of the head blue , the rest of the plumage white , shaded with different tints of green ; many of them had already plucked from their bellies the eider-down , which both the male and the female devote to lining their nests .

0	Nevertheless , it has seldom happened to me to sleep so well as I did on that particular night .

0	From 1757 to 1804 it was only part of the captaincy which bears the name of the great river at whose mouth it is placed ; but since 1826 it has been the capital of the large province of <NAME> , borrowing its latest name from an <NAME> tribe which formerly existed in these parts of equatorial <NAME> .
0	The steward was choking under the grip of his powerful hand .
0	At the same moment a blow from the sheet of the mainsail overthrew the first lieutenant , and sent him rolling to a distance , while the mizen-mast , which was not entirely lowered , was torn to pieces .
0	No illusion could be possible , and a fire had actually met their eyes during the night of the 19th of October .
0	I followed it with my eye ; saw it lose itself in the vastness of the <NAME> , and felt myself drawn with it , when <NAME> and <NAME> appeared at the door of the saloon .
0	Two hundred feet from the vessel there was a hole in the ice , a sort of circular crevasse , made by the seals with their teeth , and always dug out from the inside to the outside ; it was there that the seals used to come to breathe on the surface of the ice ; but they were compelled to take care to prevent the aperture from closing , for the shape of their jaws did not permit them to make the hole from the outside , and in any danger they would not be able to escape from their enemies .

0	`` Have we been deceived by an illusion ? ''
0	`` Not from such planets as <NAME> , _Venus_ or _Mars_ anyhow , friend <NAME> , '' observed <NAME> .
0	[ Illustration ] <NAME> went upon the quarter-deck .
0	Half an hour had already passed without our situation being bettered , when the dense darkness suddenly gave way to extreme light .
0	At this moment seven men of the crew , mute and immovable as ever , mounted the platform .
0	`` I made my first trip , '' he says , `` accompanied only by an <NAME> .
0	But the travellers determined to aid them when it was necessary , and they intended to proceed by easy stages ; the distance from <NAME> Bay to the Pole was three hundred and fifty-five miles at the outside , and going twelve miles a day they could make the journey in a month .
0	Far from picking up the wounded and the able-bodied men , who were trying to save themselves by swimming , the <NAME> , `` making way with sails set on the foremast , across the heads which were to be seen in the water , pierced some with lances , and also discharged their cannon over them . ''
0	The doctor lowered the balloon in order to get a better look at this cavalcade of natives ; but , as the balloon grew larger to their eyes , they began to show symptoms of intense affright , and at length made off in different directions as fast as their legs and those of their horses could carry them .
0	She could not do less than give 1,372,640 piastres ; and she gave them with an eagerness which denoted , however , some pressure on the part of the government .
0	All congratulated the honest old sailor whom they loved .
0	`` No such luck , '' replied <NAME> ; `` nothing of the kind is likely to happen ; and even if it did , we should not profit by it .
0	At midday <NAME> disappeared from their view in the south ; it was the last sight these bold sailors were to have of <NAME> , and more than one gazed at it for a long time who was doubtless fated never to set eyes on it again .
0	More than one felt his heart swell with emotion .
0	It had been ascertained to have two tributaries : the <NAME> , part of whose course had been traced , whilst its source had been pointed out by the natives , and the <NAME> , the mouth and lower portion of which had been carefully examined by <NAME> .
0	It is quite possible that <NAME> 's reasoning is correct , and that I have lost my nine thousand dollars .
0	This was the more singular , inasmuch as he could not be unaware that the <NAME> had put in at <NAME> d'Acunha before proceeding to the southern seas .
0	They had been so often visited by the <NAME> and <NAME> , that there were no further discoveries to make .
0	`` But our roving Projectile must pull up somewhere in the long run , '' replied <NAME> , `` and I should like to know where that somewhere can be , if not in the <NAME> . ''
0	The cats brought by the visitors were welcomed with special enthusiasm , for the island was infested with immense numbers of rats , who worked havoc on the plantations .
0	They had been only a few days in port , when a sailor found a leaden plate upon which was an inscription in <NAME> .
0	`` But none dearer to an <NAME> ear , '' answered <NAME> , with much pride .
0	It , however , has passed away .
0	<NAME> knows all about it !
0	<NAME> <NAME> was perfectly right .
0	Besieged in his capital by a large force , he saw himself all at once deprived of the aid of those for whose advantage he had incurred so great a risk .
0	“ This is what <NAME> feared , ” murmured <NAME> , changing countenance .
0	The tops of some baobabs , mimosas , and date-trees peeped up between the houses ; and , even at night , the activity of the place seemed very great .
0	these old vaultings are no longer quite secure , of course , and -- ” “ Mr .
0	She had looked upon town and country , and beyond these , into the immensity of the sea , the infinity of the heavens .
0	The largest of these , <NAME> , is not less than seventy-two miles from one side to the other ; the low shorage consists mainly of swamp and morass , while the banks , which run up steeply , are surrounded by coral reefs , and are full of small caves hollowed out by the waves .
0	She is a famous craft , you see , and she behaved admirably during the squall which struck us on our return. ” “ Could she not float in the river ? ” “ No doubt , captain , she could ; but there is no shelter there , and in the east winds , I think that the ‘ Bonadventure ’ would suffer much from the surf. ” “ Well , where would you put her , <NAME> ? ” “ In <NAME> , ” replied the sailor .
0	In fifteen days later , a day light the most brilliant would have replaced a midnight the most <NAME> .
0	After setting on foot a public subscription , which realized nearly L1,200,000 , they began the gigantic work .
0	`` We 'll have no trunks ; only a carpet-bag , with two shirts and three pairs of stockings for me , and the same for you .
0	In fact , the castaways would have been always able to procure fire , in some mode or other , but no human power could supply another grain of corn , if unfortunately this should be lost !
0	Under this pelisse , a short skirt , also dark , fell over a robe which reached the ankles .
0	The air seemed to have no effect upon these trees -- which in spite of a tolerable breeze remained as still and motionless as if they had been petrified .
0	<NAME> in his turn entered <NAME> , and recognized <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
0	Certainly , he was not out of danger , intermittent fevers being subject to frequent and dangerous relapses , but the most assiduous care was bestowed on him .
0	But you know that in my hunter ’ s way I can just as easily skin and cut up a piece of game as kill it. ” “ I ’ m sure of that , <NAME> .
0	But by this time the <NAME> was disappearing in the distant sky .
0	I call attention to this typical officer of the <NAME> , who was devoted body and soul to <NAME> Len Guy as to the schooner _Halbrane_ .
0	<NAME> and <NAME> looked at each other ; they had not yet troubled themselves about the projectile ; their first thought had been for the traveler , not for the car .
0	cried the <NAME> , his voice betraying unwonted excitement as he put the glass again to his eye .
0	Let us not forget that , according to <NAME> 's narrative , there were thousands of natives on <NAME> , and if your brother -- if his companions are prisoners -- '' `` I hope , <NAME> , our artillery will protect the <NAME> better than the <NAME> was protected by her guns .
0	On the river , vessels of all sorts crammed with visitors gathered round the enormous mass of timber , and the waters of the <NAME> literally disappeared even up to the left bank beneath the vast flotilla .
0	`` Travels in the <NAME> of <NAME> . ''
0	I then thought that the balance-wheel might accomplish this , and I succeeded in regulating the movement !
0	He would like an <NAME> consul and a doctor to reside in a port he called <NAME> , and finally he requested that certain articles of <NAME> manufacture should be sent to <NAME> , a very thriving sea-port of his .
0	The hold of the <NAME> was so arranged as to find a stowing-place for the balloon .
0	“ How can we possibly find traces of the captives in the heart of so vast a continent ? ” No one replied , though <NAME> ’ s questioning glances at her companions seemed to press for an answer .
0	I only observed that in the upper regions the water was always colder in the high levels than at the surface of the sea .
0	It was an essay on ballooning .
0	And all rushed down the bank again .
0	[ Illustration : `` The caravan met a messenger . '' ]
0	“ At last ! ” said <NAME> , when on the evening of the 22nd of September they were strolling about at the mouth of the mine .
0	<NAME> <NAME> must see all his victims face to face. ” <NAME> yielded to his wish .
0	It returned without having found the requisite depth at a cable 's length from shore .
0	The last intelligence of <NAME> Grant was from <NAME> on the 30th of May , 1862 , as appeared in the _Mercantile and <NAME> .
0	They advanced quietly without showing any uneasiness , and gazed at the men , in whom they could not as yet recognize their future masters .
0	`` Yes , M. Aronnax ; you have the right to be proud of your countryman .
0	`` <NAME> is talking about the flesh of the bear , '' said <NAME> , `` but his grease is more useful than his flesh or his fur . ''
0	In 1861 , to the north-east of <NAME> , very nearly in the same latitude we are in now , the crew of the despatch-boat <NAME> perceived a monstrous cuttlefish swimming in the waters .
0	Soon after this , some of the principal people in the country even tried to carve for themselves kingdoms out of the empire of <NAME> .
0	The colonists ’ situation was desperate .
0	What then did I see ?
0	cried <NAME> , `` and that we were there , too !
0	“ A mole-hill like <NAME> would have been ground to powder in a moment. ” “ Mole-hill ! ” exclaimed <NAME> , stung to the quick .
0	On the 21st he doubled the most northerly cape of <NAME> , to which he gave the name of <NAME> , and entered a channel sprinkled with islands near the mainland , which inspired him with the hope of finding a passage to the <NAME> <NAME> .
0	The vessels left this harbour before the end of March , and steered to the west-north-west , in search of the land discovered by <NAME> , between 27 degrees and 28 degrees south .
0	Though its motive power was electricity , it could dispense with the ordinary instruments and even with wires altogether , yet it managed to transmit messages to most parts of the world with an accuracy that , considering how seldom it failed , is almost miraculous .
0	A large stone standing in the middle of the room was the fireplace ; above , in the roof , was a hole for the smoke to pass through .
0	The abrupt character of the slopes momentarily increased , but these remarkable stone steps , a little less difficult than those of the <NAME> pyramids , were the one simple natural means by which we were enabled to proceed .
0	“ Yes , it was I , ” rejoined <NAME> in a firm tone , though somewhat agitated voice .
0	The storm of contempt was so thoroughly <NAME> that it was untranslatable even in <NAME> .
0	chimed in <NAME> ; `` a wind of four miles an hour is very little use to a steamer going ten . ''
0	At this place the beach was covered with little mounds , concealing perfectly spherical turtles ’ eggs , with white hard shells , the albumen of which does not coagulate as that of birds ’ eggs .
0	Still , like energetic men they made ready for a new struggle with the elements , and with themselves , in case they should feel themselves growing faint-hearted .
0	`` <NAME> , captain , and if you say yes , my bag shall be on board this evening . ''
0	Not wishing to be recognised , the young woman drew back from the window , feeling much alarm at her discovery .
0	Next day a sudden wave broke the mizen-mast , just where there was a flaw in the sail , and submerged the vessels for a few moments .
0	Six days passed in fruitless search ; fortunately not wholly wasted , as many curious observations were made on behalf of science .
0	The houses , badly built of flints and bricks cemented with mud , never last longer than about fifteen years . ''
0	My uncle leaped three feet from the ground with joy .
0	The first man who speaks will have to reckon with me ! ''
0	[ Illustration ] The sea appeared perfectly covered as far as eye could reach .
