0	"We could hollow out sheltering-places in the ice, so as to be able to bear the extreme cold of the pole, and so long as we had sufficient to appease our hunger--" At this moment the horrid recollection of the _Grampus_ came to my mind--the scenes in which Dirk Peters killed Ned Holt, the brother of our sailing-master.
0	"I know it, sir," replied Phileas Fogg; "but I wish to prove, by your visa, that I came by Suez."
0	He has gone, and won't come back!
0	In one word, he was the thorough "Frenchman" (and worse, a "Parisian") to the last moment.
0	"I think the idea a good one," I cried in reply, "and with this rivulet as a companion, there is no further reason why we should not succeed in our marvelous project."

0	A brig, the _Advance_, carrying seventeen men, equipped by Mr. Grinnell, a merchant, commanded by Dr. Kane, and sent out in search of Franklin, went as far north, through Baffin's Bay and Smith's Sound, as latitude 82°, nearer to the Pole than any of his predecessors had gone.

0	“I am going to throw myself at the Queen’s feet, and we shall see if she will turn a deaf ear to the prayers of two children, who implore their father’s life.” Lord Glenarvan shook his head; not that he doubted the kind heart of her Majesty, but he knew Mary would never gain access to her.

0	At all events, he would not have given his place up for an empire, "not even if the cannon-- loaded, primed, and fired at that very moment--were to blow him in pieces into the planetary world."
0	Duke understood him, and followed him, barking and howling.
0	"And the harpoon, sir," said the Canadian, "if you do not refuse my help."
0	What is one degree farther south, when it is a question of putting a hundred additional dollars into one's pocket?
0	The vast mass of this combustible, the field of which as yet is utterly unexplored, would suffice to warm Iceland for a whole century.

0	"I am content to rank this incident among those which I have not been able to explain to this day!"
0	I must know that you are here to keep an eye on Shandon and the others.
0	Having this ultimate object in view, he assembled his little colony upon a projecting rock at the extremity of the promontory, and having called Nina and Pablo out to him in front, he said: “Now, Nina, do you think you could throw something into the sea?” “I think I could,” replied the child, “but I am sure that Pablo would throw it a great deal further than I can.” “Never mind, you shall try first.” Putting a fragment of ice into Nina’s hand, he addressed himself to Pablo: “Look out, Pablo; you shall see what a nice little fairy Nina is!

0	Suddenly a tremendous explosion was heard.
0	“I had all the information I wanted now, and came back to the camp quite convinced, begging Paganel’s pardon, that Australia does not reform criminals.” This was all the Major’s story, and his companions sat silently thinking over it.
0	He then asked for the latest information about Napoleon, and wished to know whether it was true that the island of St. Helena had been swallowed up with all its inhabitants!
0	Since their departure, the settlers had descended the slopes which constituted the mountain system of the island, on to a dry soil, but the luxuriant vegetation of which indicated it to be watered either by some subterranean marsh or by some stream.
0	But might not a time come when all their science would be at fault?
0	The fleet had sailed for thirteen days and had passed the Cape de Verd Islands, when it was discovered that one of the ships, under the command of Vasco d'Ataïde, was no longer in company.
0	Top accompanied him, and Gideon Spilett, his gun cocked, was ready for any emergency.
0	"Listen to me, then, Mr. Jeorling, for although this ‘romance'--as you call it--appeared only last year, it is none the less a reality.
0	But they found that the prosperity which had made the colony an object of wonder and admiration to the French travellers who had visited it with Baudin, had passed away.
0	I was trying simply to sail through the Northwest Passage, that is all."
0	Captain Nemo had already risen, and I was beginning to stretch my limbs, when an unexpected apparition brought me briskly to my feet.
0	By what right have you dragged me from my islet?...
0	Thus at this time they caught seals, walrus, and whales in the bay of Disco; there were 190 towns counted then in Westerbygd and eighty-six in Esterbygd, while at the present day, there are far fewer Danish settlements on these icy shores.
0	“By all that’s glorious!” shouted Kennedy, “it looks as if the fire were ascending and coming up toward us!” And, sure enough, with an accompaniment of musket-shots, yelling, and din of every description, the mass of fire was, indeed, mounting toward the Victoria.
0	This greed of gold seized the least audacious.
0	Everybody was full of hope, for in this search for Captain Grant, each day seemed to increase the probability of finding him.
0	The distance separating it from the radiant orb is then increased in round numbers to 400,000 miles, and the heat which she receives must be a little less."
0	The doctor responded, with much dignity, that the moon made her provincial tour every thousand years, feeling the necessity of showing herself nearer at hand to her worshippers.
0	Do you think I am ignorant that there are suffering beings and oppressed races on this earth, miserable creatures to console, victims to avenge?
0	Captain Nemo learned from this professor that the “Nautilus,” taken now for a gigantic mammal of the whale species, now for a submarine vessel carrying a crew of pirates, was sought for in every sea.
0	"Well, then, it is this: however minutely we explore the island, we shall find nothing."
0	The terrible monster is now wounded unto death.
0	As soon as the _Bonadventure_ had been lifted by the rising tide, it was seen that she lay evenly in the water, and would be easily navigated.
0	Our four passengers disembarked at once.
0	These things agreed to, Ayrton made preparations for his departure.
0	"N-no," resumed Frantz; "I thought I felt a little twitch; I was mistaken."

0	After a few necessary delays at Rio-de-Janeiro, St. Paul and Amsterdam Islands, where some seal-hunters were seen, at Batavia, and Bantam, in Java, and at Poulo Condere, the vessels cast anchor off Turon (Han San) in Cochin China, a vast harbour, of which only a very bad chart was then in existence.
0	Let us then be just, and not give way to evil feelings.
0	Cook gave his usual order, to enter into friendly and commercial relations with the inhabitants.
0	But the further they were from each other the more magnificent they appeared, profiting, as they did, by the free, pure air which circulated around them.

0	“Chance alone brought you into her presence.” “I had sworn, whatever might happen, not to betray myself.” “Michael, Michael!
0	And now the puraque redoubled its attacks; it gave forth shock after shock, which made Benito writhe on the sand like the sections of a divided worm, and his muscles were wrenched again and again beneath the living lash.
0	"Do you think that the stranger has the same plans?"
0	But after all, it matters little whether the body of Columbus be at San Domingo or at Havana; his name and his glory are everywhere.
0	Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft chatted, while examining this part of their domain, which was new to them, and, in proportion as the canoe proceeded towards the south, the two Mandible Capes appeared to move, and surround Union Bay more closely.
0	The crew became very tired of this tortuous navigation, which kept them very busy with the sails.
0	Lastly, the provisions were divided between the _Dauphin_ and the _Swallow_.
0	"Tell me, boatswain--I always get back to Hunt--does he seem so much pleased to have passed the Polar Circle as the _Halbrane's_ old sailors are?"
0	From its first declivities to within two miles of the coast were spread vast masses of wood, relieved by large green patches, caused by the presence of evergreen trees.
0	He had good reason to believe in the vanity of human greatness; and he asked himself whether, in this country, adoration did not sometimes go to the length of eating the object adored!

0	Besides, Captain Farragut had spoken of a certain sum of two thousand dollars, set apart for whoever should first sight the monster, were he cabin-boy, common seaman, or officer.
0	The reporter never left the engineer except to hunt with Herbert, for it would not have been prudent to allow the lad to ramble alone in the forest; and it was very necessary to be on their guard.
0	“What astonishes me is that he hasn’t spoken to us before, for now he wants nothing but speech!” “It would amuse me all the same,” resumed the sailor, “if some fine day he said to me, ‘Suppose we change pipes, Pencroft.’” “Yes,” replied Neb, “what a pity he was born dumb!” With the month of September the winter ended, and the works were again eagerly commenced.
0	Hence the Sandwich islanders soon became formidable to their visitors; they seized on several small vessels, and displayed an energy tinctured at first with barbarity, but indicating great capabilities of social improvement.
0	The boy she held by the hand was about twelve, but his face expressed such determination, that he appeared quite his sister’s protector.
0	"Well, we shall see it to-morrow."
0	Now the main point is that the captains of the _Neptune_, the _Enterprise_, the _Isabella_, and the _Advance_ agree in the statement that beyond these high latitudes there is an open polar sea, entirely free from ice."
0	Railroads, post-carriages, steamboats, relays of horses, were at everyone’s disposal, and consequently at the disposal of the courier of the Czar.
0	May the contemplation of so many wonders extinguish for ever the spirit of vengeance!
0	The _Forward_, plunging, under a full head of steam, against the floes, could not separate them; they were obliged to lie at anchor that night.
0	He was evidently contending against extreme weakness.
0	But as a natural consequence of this overflow, the depth of the island increased.
0	And I thought it was a matter of great regret that we could not get aground on one or the other side of this vast strait, whose surface would presently be solidified by the coming of winter.
0	Twenty miles off, the ice masses, entirely separated, floated towards the Atlantic Ocean.
0	“Manoel,” said he, “I have a favor to ask you.” “What is it?” “And you too, Fragoso.” “I am at your service, Mr. Benito,” answered the barber.

0	"That is a wise decision, Hatteras," answered the doctor; "I should have followed you anywhere, but we are all growing weaker every day; we can hardly set one foot before the other; I approve of returning."
0	Under the engineer’s directions, Pencroft, armed with a pickaxe, which he handled skillfully and vigorously, attacked the granite.

0	The old man had again fallen back into a torpid slumber.
0	Whereupon, being arrived in the roadstead of Goa, Alfonzo Albuquerque set in order the affairs of his conscience with the Church, caused himself to be clad in the dress of the Order of St. Iago of which he was a commander, and then "on Sunday the 16th of December, an hour before daybreak, he rendered up his soul to God.
0	It happened, just about this same time, that Ben Zoof had been calling his master’s attention to the fact that some of their most necessary provisions would soon be running short, and that their stock of coffee, sugar, and tobacco would want replenishing.
0	At about half past one, looking to their right on the west, they saw the summits of another mountain; Barbican, consulting his map, recognized _Eratosthenes_.
0	As the temperature became milder, so did the character of the natives, whilst food grew more abundant; and as they came down the Oregon, also known as the Columbia, the salmon formed a seasonable addition to the bill of fare.
0	“I am coming,” replied Ayrton.
0	This was like going down in port.
0	During the nineteen days mentioned above, no incident of any kind happened to signalise our voyage.
0	A short stay was made at Port Santa Cruz in Teneriffe, and thence they proceeded without stopping to Mauritius, where several officers were left who were too ill to proceed when the expedition set sail upon the 25th of April, 1801.

0	An electric telegraph, with a single wire more than eight thousand versts in length, alone affords communication between the western and eastern frontiers of Siberia.
0	Cyrus Harding felt this strongly, and he asked himself what it would be possible to do.

0	Fifty-two charts and plans carefully drawn up; collections of natural specimens of all kinds, both numerous and curious; copious vocabularies, by the help of which it may be possible to throw new light on the migrations of the Oceanic peoples; interesting intelligence regarding the productions of the places visited; the condition of commerce and industrial pursuits; observations relating to the shape of the globe; magnetical, meteorological, and botanical researches; such formed the bulk of the valuable freight of knowledge brought home by the _Coquille_.

0	On the 16th April, finding he had only made half of the distance between Mackenzie River and Icy Cape, though the winter was rapidly approaching, Franklin turned back and embarked on the beautiful Peel River, which he mistook for that of Mackenzie, not discovering his error till he came in sight of a chain of mountains on the east.

0	In spite of these prosperous conditions the country made no progress, on account of the prohibitive system which at this time prevailed.
0	“They may spoil everything, destroy everything in a few hours!” “Everything, Pencroft,” answered Harding, “and we have no means of preventing them.” “Are they numerous?
0	"Well, Pen has already had trouble with him."
0	Notwithstanding the fury of the hurricane, the uproar of the tempest, the thunder, and the tumult, Herbert slept profoundly.
0	But the obstinate sailor would listen to nothing of this, and he would give the engineer no peace till he promised to satisfy his desire.

0	"If he will have me," cried the midshipman, "I am ready!"
0	Thus, my dear Spilett, an eruption would be a serious thing for us, and it would be better that the volcano should not have the slightest desire to wake up.
0	He seized upon the town and bestowed it upon the aspirant who had accepted his conditions beforehand, and who appeared to Albuquerque to present the most solid guarantees of submission and fidelity.
0	Manoel walked by the side of Minha, who looked most fascinating in her bride’s costume, and then came Fragoso, holding the hand of Lina, who seemed quite radiant with joy.

0	Sadler, deprived of ballast by his long sojourn in the air, was dragged over the town of Boston and dashed against the chimneys; Sadler fell, and was killed!
0	Our second entry into Mexico took place on St. John's Day, 1520; our flight from the city was on the 10th day of the month of July following, and we fought the memorable battle of Otumba on the 14th day of this same month of July.
0	The temperature, which had been growing lower for several days, fell at last to -33°.

0	‘A capital quartermaster, with his invention of shipwreck.’ ‘If his project succeeds, it will be a stroke of fortune.’ ‘He is a very devil, is this Ayrton.’ ‘Call him Ben Joyce, for he has well earned his name.’ And then the scoundrels left the forest.

0	Already they seemed to drift slower.
0	Timbuctoo, which is neither so large nor so well populated as Caillié expected, is altogether wanting in animation.
0	Were we in for a disappointment?
0	They breakfasted, therefore, near the Chimneys, and during their repast, as may be supposed, nothing was talked of but the unexpected event which had so miraculously saved the colony.
0	Top, the first moment of surprise over, began a reptile chase with such eagerness, that they feared for his safety.
0	From 84° to 90° there are six degrees, which, at sixty miles each, give a radius of 360 miles and a diameter of 720 miles.
0	The many friends of the old sailor came to bring him their cordial and sincere sympathy.
0	Obie seemed to be affected by the account the English gave of the struggle in which they had lost all their merchandise, but the aid he gave them was by no means proportioned to the warmth of the sentiments which he expressed, indeed he let them all but die of hunger.

0	"I will add," he continued, "that, being as handy with the pickaxe as with the harpoon, if I can be useful to the Captain, he can command my services."
0	On the 22nd and 23rd the survey of this coast was continued; but on the second day an iceberg soldered to the coast compelled the vessels to turn back towards the north, whilst at the same time a sudden and violent snow-storm overtook and separated them.
0	"No," answered Pencroft, "for it was still floating.
0	The natives of this island were very clever in slinging stones, rarely missing their aim, and in the encounters with these islanders many fell on both sides, but more natives than Normans, whose loss, however, amounted to one hundred.
0	It was in part owing to the religious toleration which Albuquerque displayed, a toleration which contrasts strangely with the cruel fanaticism of the Spaniards, and in part to the skilful measures which he took, that the prosperity of Malacca resisted the rude shock which it had received.
0	The sinking ice of a frozen lake, when meeting with some sharp pointed rock, cracks in a radiating manner: every one of its fissures then admits the water, which immediately spreads laterally over the ice pretty much as the lava spreads itself over the lunar surface.

0	I will add here that since we had left the South Pole behind no confidence could be placed in the indications of the compass; it had gone wild at the approach to the magnetic pole, to which we were no doubt on the way.

0	“Well done!” cried Pencroft; “bring the captain’s litter.” The litter was brought; the transverse branches had been covered with leaves and long grass.
0	In the Maori religion the possession of these relics is regarded as indispensable to the destinies of the future life; not the perishable flesh, but the bones, which are collected with the greatest care, cleaned, scraped, polished, even varnished, and then deposited in the “oudoupa,” that is the “house of glory.” These tombs are adorned with wooden statues, representing with perfect exactness the tattoo of the deceased.
0	A notice was inserted in the principal newspapers of the United Kingdom relative to the engineer James Starr, giving a description of him and the date on which he left Edinburgh; nothing more could be done but to wait.

0	A dozen foxes, a few wild boars, and even a jaguar, were taken in this way, the animals being found dead, their stomachs pierced by the unbent bones.
0	It took the whole day to reach the promontory, for the vessel on leaving port had only two hours of ebb tide and had therefore to make way for six hours against the flood.

0	Not one notable scientific man, such as those who had been billeted in such numbers on the _Naturalist_ and other circumnavigating vessels, had embarked upon those of Baron de Bougainville, to whom it was a constant matter of regret, a regret intensified by the fact that the medical officers, with so many under their care, could not be long absent from the vessels when in port.
0	He was now eighteen years of age.
0	Many a time during his absence Hector Servadac had wondered how his present vicissitudes would end, and he had felt some misgivings as to whether he should ever again set foot upon the island, and see his faithful orderly, so that it was not without emotion that he had approached the coast of the sole remaining fragment of Algerian soil.

0	Beds, furniture, cooking utensils--first the stores of the _Dobryna_, then the cargo of the tartan--all were carried down with the greatest alacrity, and the diminished weight combined with the downhill route to make the labor proceed with incredible briskness.
0	The island of Teneriffe was reached on the 28th of the same month, and there the officers hoped to be able to make a few gleanings after the rich harvest of knowledge which their predecessors had reaped; but the Council of Health in the island, having received information of an outbreak of yellow fever on the shores of the Mediterranean, imposed on the _Coquille_ a quarantine of fifteen days.
0	On the 15th of October, at three o’clock in the afternoon, they knocked at the door of the mansion in New Park.
0	But even this last retreat was now closed to them, and the lava-torrent, flowing over the edge of the granite wall, began to pour down upon the beach its cataracts of fire.

0	After a short stay at Kelat, the two travellers, who still passed as horse-dealers, resolved to continue their journey, but instead of following the high road to Kandahar, they crossed a dreary and barren country, ill-populated, watered by the Caisser, a river which dries up during the summer; and they reached a little town, called Noschky or Nouchky, on the frontier of Afghanistan.

0	Here, bridges were thrown from one rock to another; there, arches like those of a wave, into the depths of which the eye could not penetrate; in one place, large vaulted excavations presented a monumental aspect; in another, a crowd of columns, spires, and arches, such as no Gothic cathedral ever possessed.

0	One day he published a celebrated map of America, and put Japan in it!
0	The jangada was moored to the bank with solid cables, so that it could not be carried away by the current when it floated off.

0	From time to time the castaways stopped and shouted, then listened for some response from the ocean, for they thought that if the engineer had landed, and they had been near to the place, they would have heard the barking of the dog Top, even should Harding himself have been unable to give any sign of existence.

0	"And yourself, captain," said André.
0	The narratives of the voyages of Vespucius are very diffuse and wanting in precision and order; the information they give upon the places he visited is so vague, that it might apply to one part of the coast as well as to another; as to the localities treated of, as well as of the companions of Vespucius, there are no indications given of a nature to aid the historian.
0	England, I fear, has suffered grievously by the late catastrophe.
0	To linger in this region or to expose ourselves to the danger of wintering out would be to tempt Providence!

0	Was it simple chance which brought it to that part of the Pacific, where the maps mentioned no land except Tabor Islet, which itself was out of the route usually followed by vessels from the Polynesian Archipelagos, from New Zealand, and from the American coast?
0	The kraal, or Hottentot village, is a collection of huts in a circle, all very similar, and of the shape of beehives.
0	A loud clapping of hands was suddenly raised, which subsided by degrees, and finally was succeeded by absolute silence.
0	What charming hours I passed thus at the window of the saloon!

0	The least noise aroused his suspicions, and he questioned even the slightest rustling of the leaves.
0	The want of fresh provisions, the cold, and the privations of all kinds which he underwent, and which had decimated his crew, forced him to return northwards along the coast of Brazil, where the Portuguese opposed every attempt at landing.

0	“It is my right as a free American citizen to keep from anybody the result of my work!” “But if that is your right, Mr. Maston,” said President Prestice solemnly, as if he spoke in the name of the entire world, “it may be your duty to speak in face of the anxiety that exists.” J. T. Maston did not think it was his duty.
0	After this event, and during all the time that the colonists, detained by Herbert's illness, remained in the corral, the pirates did not leave their cavern, and even after they had pillaged the plateau of Prospect Heights, they did not think it prudent to abandon it.
0	The sailor was wounded himself, but his wound was insignificant, as were those of his companions; for thanks to their firearms they had been almost always able to keep their assailants at a distance.
0	Under the arch of trees the darkness was such that even the edge of the road could not be seen.
0	cried Altamont; "and these long-legged water-fowl!"
0	If everything had been done as it was settled, and the lot had fallen to me to go with the boat, I would have given up my turn to one of the others.
0	Some kingfishers were rambling along the water-courses, but they would not let themselves be approached.
0	"But a still more terrible danger menaces us," said Vasling.
0	There was no danger in descending close to the lake, and the car was soon skimming its surface like a bird at the distance of only five feet.
0	The settlers, therefore, prudently advanced towards the north point, walking over ground riddled with little holes, which formed nests for the sea-birds.
0	All interest there was too much absorbed in terrestrial matters, and in ascertaining what changes had taken place in the configuration of the earth itself, to permit much attention to be paid to its erratic movements through space.
0	Of a sudden the knife he held was snatched out of his hand, the rope broke, and the grapnel, like a projectile, shot off in the direction of the sphinx.
0	Pencroft attacked the granite, and for half an hour, by the light of the torches, he made the splinters fly around him.

0	While Glenarvan and his cousin were making these observations, the report of firearms resounded frequently above their heads, and the jubilant outcries of the two sportsmen--for Paganel was every whit as much a child as Robert.
0	As to those, they are cruel, mischievous creatures; they would be right in exterminating them."
0	Our situation would have been safe had we not anchored upon a rocky bottom, which extended several cables' length around us, and which was different from what MM.
0	The real strength of the armament lay in the ten pieces of artillery, the four falconets provided with an ample supply of ammunition, and the sixteen horses which had been obtained at great expense.

0	Do you take our vessel for a wreck and us for porpoises?"
0	There was nothing for it but to erase Loch Katrine from the map of Scotland until (by public subscription) it could be refilled, care being of course taken, in the first place, to stop the rent up tight.
0	Soon he made out that the _Porpoise_ was an American bark from New York, that it had been caught in the ice with a large supply of food and fuel; and, although she lay on her beam-ends, she must have withstood the ice, and it would be possible to save her cargo.

0	San Salvador presented an almost flat plateau of which no mountain broke the uniformity; a small lake occupied the centre of the island.
0	“However,” said the captain, “the thing may prove dangerous.” “What matters that,” replied the doctor, “provided that it be practicable?” The Arrival at Zanzibar.--The English Consul.--Ill-will of the Inhabitants.--The Island of Koumbeni.--The Rain-Makers.--Inflation of the Balloon.--Departure on the 18th of April.--The last Good-by.--The Victoria.
0	Barbican let go his chronometer, but it kept its place as firmly in empty space before his eyes as if it had been nailed to the wall!
0	We have demonstrated that the force of attraction here is only one-seventh of what it is upon the earth, and shall consequently have to multiply the apparent weight of our cube by seven, in order to ascertain its proper weight.
0	Its rays threw out a light which was reflected from the ice; towards the northwest the ice-field looked like a perfectly smooth plain; not a hummock was to be seen.
0	All these views were held by some people in some form, and we can quite understand what interest the affair created.
0	These bullets, not having the weight of leaden bullets, were made larger, and each charge contained less, but the skill of the sportsmen made up this deficiency.

0	"Fine talent that," said Nicholl, looking suspiciously at his companion.

0	Cultivated plains soon appear, where are united all the productions of the northern and tropical floras, terminating in prairies abounding with pineapples and yams, tobacco, rice, cotton-plants, and sugar-canes, which extend beyond reach of sight, flinging their riches broadcast with careless prodigality.

0	The marks of respect lavished upon Poulaho by all the natives, convinced Cook that he had been entertaining the real sovereign of the archipelago.
0	But now you all see that the grandchild of old Silfax can never be the wife of Harry Ford, because it would be certain death to you all!” “Nell!” cried Harry.
0	"Nothing," says Robertson, "more entirely proves the ascendancy gained by the Spaniards over the Americans, than seeing that the latter, witnesses of the defeat and dispersion of one of the parties, had not the courage to attack the other, even weakened and fatigued as they were by their victory, and dared not fall upon their oppressors when fortune offered them so favourable an opportunity for attacking them with advantage."
0	"Easily," answered the doctor; "various experiments have been made and curious facts have been found out.
0	This was clearly shown, when he ceded the last remnants of French colonial rule in America to the United States for a few millions.
0	But the morning after, the wind changed, and the captain ordered the men to put up the foresail, and brigantine and foretopsail, which greatly lessened the rolling of the vessel.
0	Evidently the island, with its water, its harbor, its resources of all kinds so increased in value by the colonists, and the concealment afforded by Granite House, could not but be convenient for the convicts; in their hands it would become an excellent place of refuge, and, being unknown, it would assure them, for a long time perhaps, impunity and security.
0	Proper names might put me on the track, among others that of Joam Dacosta; and if he had anything to do with this document, his name will evidently not be absent from its concluding paragraph.” The magistrate’s reasoning was logical, and he was decidedly right in bringing all his resources to bear in the first place on the gist of the cryptogram as contained in its last paragraph.
0	Instead of being enclosed in a telescope-case, it was this time secured in a preserved-meat tin, hermetically sealed, and stamped with the same initials on the wax that fastened it.
0	The travellers having received a hearty welcome, departed on the morrow, but meeting upon his way with many troops of Arabs, upon whom his demeanour imposed respect, he came to the conclusion that it had been Omar Aga's intention to have him robbed.
0	Among others, he mentioned eclipses of the sun, which only take place on this side of the lunar disc; since, in order that they may take place, it is necessary for the moon to be _in opposition_.

0	Humboldt ascended the volcano of Antisana to a height of 2773 fathoms, but could go no further, as the cold was so intense that the blood started from the lips, eyes, and gums of the travellers.

0	"You must go by land along the coast.
0	Besides, there was a sort of fireplace in it, with a chimney of bricks, badly enough put together, certainly, but still it allowed of a fire being lighted.
0	But his apprehensions were groundless; Gourbi Island was just as he had left it, with nothing unusual in its aspect, except that a very peculiar cloud was hovering over it, at an altitude of little more than a hundred feet.
0	Being composed of the sort of clay which is used for making bricks and tiles, it was very useful for the work in question.
0	The four railways from Philadelphia and Washington, Harrisburg and Wheeling, which converge at Baltimore, whirled away the heterogeneous population to the four corners of the United States, and the city subsided into comparative tranquility.
0	Nay, the Moon, realizing the weird fancy of the Arabian poet, who calls her a "giant stiffening into granite, but struggling madly against his doom," might shriek, in a spasm of agony, loudly enough to be heard in Sirius.

0	"There is, indeed, reason to believe so from his narrative."
0	During the following months the evil, in place of subsiding, became more extended.
0	He also noticed the curious tribe of the Otomaques.
0	Fortunately a lovely breeze blew from the northwest, and if it held would be favorable for crossing Lake Teffe.
0	“I exaggerate nothing,” continued Ferguson, “for, upon reading the narratives of such travellers as have had the hardihood to venture into these regions, your eyes would fill with tears.” About eleven o’clock they were passing over the basin of Imenge, and the tribes scattered over the adjacent hills were impotently menacing the Victoria with their weapons.
0	He quickly concealed himself in his cabin, to avoid an awkward explanation, and hoped--thanks to the number of passengers--to remain unperceived by Mr. Fogg's servant.
0	“Is it the Indians?” asked Glenarvan.
0	It was nevertheless necessary to keep up the stores of Granite House, in view of the approaching winter.
0	How could anything else be expected in a vessel which was not provided with either wine or brandy, but was provisioned only with foetid water, biscuits infested with maggots, and putrid meats, the mere smell of which was injurious?

0	Bell and the doctor were at the end of their strength, almost blind and quite lame; the carpenter could not walk without crutches.
0	So, then the moon displays invariably the same face to the earth; nevertheless, to be quite exact, it is necessary to add that, in consequence of certain fluctuations of north and south, and of west and east, termed her libration, she permits rather more than half, that is to say, five-sevenths, to be seen.
0	IT was agreed that the inhabitants of the cottage must keep more on their guard than ever.
0	Nor could any amount of fuel be enough.
0	Perhaps, after all, the document was already several months or several years old, and it was possible in this case, either that the castaway had been enabled to return to his country, or that he had died of misery.

0	It has a wicked look!” “Hallo!” cried Pencroft, “here is Neb turning up his nose at my gulf, just as I was thinking of presenting it to America!” “But, at any rate, is the water deep enough?” asked the engineer, “for a depth sufficient for the keel of the ‘Bonadventure’ would not be enough for those of our iron-clads.” “That is easily found out,” replied Pencroft.

0	Barbicane had accordingly supplied himself with these fireworks, enclosed in little steel guns, which could be screwed on to the base of the projectile.

0	Under his direction the plateau was surrounded by a real fortification of ice which secured it against every invasion; its height made a natural protection, and as there was no salient, it was equally strong on all sides.

0	During the afternoon of Wednesday, 30th October, the Rangoon entered the Strait of Malacca, which separates the peninsula of that name from Sumatra.
0	"Every one to his own," answered the Captain, looking fixedly at Ned Land.
0	Soon he redoubled his attack, when another ball having torn away the leafy screen, disclosed a gaping aperture in the granite.
0	I had put out my arm to detain him--to seize him would be a more correct term--and the conversation, ill begun, seemed likely to end still more ill, when this odd person turned towards me and said in a milder tone,-- "Pray understand, sir, that I am very sorry to be unable to do what you ask, and to appear disobliging to an American.
0	Barbicane, Michel Ardan, Nicholl, and the delegates of the Gun Club, returning without delay to Baltimore, were received with indescribable enthusiasm.
0	And he had reason to be watchful.
0	However, all danger had quickly disappeared.
0	Ayrton then, followed by Pencroft, crossed it with a rapid step, scaring the birds nestled in the holes of the rocks; then, without hesitating, he plunged into the sea, and swam noiselessly in the direction of the ship, in which a few lights had recently appeared, showing her exact situation.
0	John arranged everything for resuming their voyage, and then he ordered the anchor to be weighed.
0	Perhaps, even, one of them had found in Ayrton his old Australian companion Ben Joyce, the chief of the escaped convicts.
0	There were twenty-seven degrees of difference between its temperature and that of the daytime.
0	It was quite evident that we were being cast upwards by eruptive matter; under the raft there was a mass of boiling water, and under this was a heavier mass of lava, and an aggregate of rocks which, on reaching the summit of the water, would be dispersed in every direction.
0	The vessel had just anchored in sight of Granite House!
0	At the same time ambassadors were sent by the people of the distant countries of the empire, to convince themselves of the reality of that wonderful event, the taking of Mexico, to behold the ruins of the abhorred town, and to tender their submission to the conquerors.

0	No doubt an officer had fallen in some encounter, and thus these articles had come into native hands.
0	Sometimes the Major followed him, and sometimes Paganel, ready to lend a helping hand among the slippery peaks and dangerous precipices among which he was dragged by his rash and useless imprudence.
0	I see the flaming red eyes of the Ichthyosaurus, each as big, or bigger than a man's head.
0	The accident was explicable when it was ascertained that, between the bed of the lake and the vast cavity beneath, the geological strata had become reduced to a thin layer, incapable of longer sustaining the weight of water.

0	Thus there existed beneath the county of Stirling a vast tract, full of burrows, tunnels, bored with caves, and perforated with shafts, a subterranean labyrinth, which might be compared to an enormous ant-hill.
0	Fortunately, although the wind was strong the sea, being sheltered by the land, did not run very high.
0	But as hitherto the sea had encroached upon the land, the land in its turn now encroached upon the sea; for a frowning headland stood out far into the basin of the Mediterranean, and formed a promontory stretching out beyond the proper places of the Balearic Isles.
0	As to white men’s flesh, they do not like it so well, because the whites eat salt with their food, which gives a peculiar flavor, not to the taste of connoisseurs.” “They are dainty,” said the Major.

0	Whether the young woman were married or not, he would be able to create such difficulties for Mr. Fogg at Hong Kong that he could not escape by paying any amount of money.

0	All navigators are agreed in considering that the class of chiefs belong to a race excelling the other inhabitants, both in intelligence and in stature.
0	exclaimed the Captain, "do you wish to be pierced by the spur of the Nautilus before it is hurled at this vessel?"
0	Hoarse sounds issued from his throat between his teeth, which were sharp as the teeth of a wild beast made to tear raw flesh.
0	This future Emperor was named Cunius; he received the envoys in a most friendly manner, a letter from Prince Bathy having explained to him the object of their visit; not being yet Emperor he could not entertain them nor take any part in public affairs, but from the time of Ojadaï's death, his widow, the mother of Prince Cunius had been Regent; she received the travellers in a purple and white tent capable of holding 2000 persons.

0	Of the satellites, Lieutenant Procope went on to say that one is rather smaller than our own moon; that another moves round its primary at an interval about equal to the moon’s distance from ourselves; but that they all revolve in considerably less time: the first takes only l day 18 hours 27 minutes; the second takes 3 days 13 hours 14 minutes; the third, 7 days 3 hours 42 minutes; whilst the largest of all takes but 16 days 16 hours 32 minutes.

0	It is armed with a steel spur as good as Master Land's harpoon, I imagine."
0	“Have the Tartars passed this way?” “Yes, for my house is in flames.” “Was it an army or a detachment?” “An army, for, as far as eye can reach, our fields are laid waste.” “Commanded by the Emir?” “By the Emir; for the Obi’s waters are red.” “Has Feofar-Khan entered Tomsk?” “He has.” “Do you know if his men have entered Kolyvan?” “No; for Kolyvan does not yet burn.” “Thanks, friend.
0	The carbonic acid from the crater had not yet had time to unite with the hydrogen of the water; nor the ammonia of the clouds, to form under the action of the light, organized matter.

0	After he had got so far, Judge Jarriquez, with his head nearly splitting, arose and paced his office, went for fresh air to the window, and gave utterance to a growl, at the noise of which a flock of hummingbirds, murmuring among the foliage of a mimosa tree, betook themselves to flight.
0	During the eight months which were employed in the work of excavation the preparatory works of the casting had been carried on simultaneously with extreme rapidity.
0	These clothes were warm and good; they had taken great care of them as well as of their linen, and they were perfectly whole, but they would soon need to be replaced.
0	For arms they carried bows, poisoned arrows with sharp points hardened in the fire, or tipped with bone and steeped in the juice of a herb, great stones, heavy wooden swords made of stiff wood, with three harpoon points, each more than a handbreadth long.
0	Yes, he would willingly, had it been necessary, have resumed the miner’s pick, and with his still stout arms vigorously attacked the rock.
0	Suddenly little Nina, who had again taken possession of the pigeon, and was hugging it to her breast, said: “Look here, Ben Zoof!” And as she spoke she pointed to the left wing of the bird.
0	But what would this unknown island, five degrees farther off in the depths of the southern sea, be for our schooner?

0	Between ourselves, Atkins, could you venture to pretend that your bays are not still ice-locked in this month of August, which is the February of our northern hemisphere?"
0	As to the road in question, the choice of trees had rendered its direction somewhat capricious, but at the same time it facilitated the access to a large part of the Serpentine Peninsula.
0	That's the simple explanation; and this poor beast, who might have saved the life of two crews, has fallen uselessly beneath our guns."

0	The madman disappeared in space!
0	I can understand your rising to the surface; but, diving below the surface, does not your submarine contrivance encounter a pressure, and consequently undergo an upward thrust of one atmosphere for every thirty feet of water, just about fifteen pounds per square inch?"
0	Had Belfast shot him with a ten pound weight, right between the two eyes, he could not have knocked him flatter or stiffer.
0	"I will never believe that such animals exist," said Ned.
0	Raised by this rising tide, driven by the ice which attacked her aft, she was getting across this impenetrable ice.

0	Cook, however, soon proceeded to Matavai Bay, where King Otoo left his residence at Pané, to pay his old friend a visit.
0	“But why should there be coal at the Pole?” “Why?” replied the supporters of President Barbicane.
0	All day my thoughts were bent upon these speculations, and my imagination scarcely regained a degree of calmness and power of reflection until after a sleep of many hours.

0	She had been signalled by the look-out, and the whole population flocked to the jetty.
0	Provisions, camp effects, a portable stove, and various utensils were packed in the cart, as also weapons and ammunition, carefully chosen from the now complete arsenal of Granite House.
0	On the day following, the crews before quitting this hospitable coast, set up a large cross in the middle of the little town.

0	They came on board, and proceeded to deposit on deck--what?--three magnificent pigs, tied and bound.
0	Upon landing next day, the French found the natives feasting.
0	An hour after sunrise on New Year’s Day, Frenchmen, Russians, Spaniards, and little Nina, as the representative of Italy, sat down to a feast such as never before had been seen in Gallia.

0	The engineer leapt in first, and found, on examining the rope, that it had been really worn through by rubbing against the rocks.
0	The Nautilus began to sink, following a vertical line, for its screw communicated no motion to it.
0	No light could pierce through the heavy piles of clouds on the horizon.

0	Here it may be well to explain what this island was.
0	"Suppose we find out," observed Barbican, jumping up to try, his voice as clear and his step as firm as ever.
0	It is strange but true, that Diaz not only received no reward of any kind for this voyage which had been so successful, but he seemed to be treated rather as though he had disgraced himself, for he was not employed again for ten years.
0	Astronomers, geographers, mineralogists, botanists, zoologists, draughtsmen, and gardeners, all mustered four or five strong.

0	“Yes,” rejoined Cyrus Harding, “if the intervention of a human being is not more questionable for us, I agree that he has at his disposal means of action beyond those possessed by humanity.
0	To do so, I need hardly remind you, is a task involving care and patience.
0	About a mile further he stopped again, and leaving the straight route, made a circuit of some miles north and south, and then returned and fell back in his place at the head of the troop, without saying a syllable as to what he hoped or feared.

0	However, Pencroft had thought of doing so, but Cyrus Harding having told him that even if he managed to count three hundred grains a minute, or nine thousand an hour, it would take him nearly five thousand five-hundred years to finish his task, the honest sailor considered it best to give up the idea.
0	“What’s bad in the Highlands is not better here,” returned Wilson sententiously.
0	"I'll bet," said Johnson, "that we'll find some way of driving them off after dinner."
0	Their feathery feet could be seen clasping the slender twigs which supported them.
0	During the seven months which had passed since the last researches made round the mountain, and during the month of September, which brought back fine weather, nothing was heard of the genius of the island.
0	"The longitude of these islands," says the narrative, "is pretty nearly similar to that which Abel Tasman reckoned it when he discovered Amsterdam and Rotterdam Islands, the Pilstaars, Prince William Island, and the low lands of Fleemskerk.
0	At ten o’clock a vivid flash showed them the palisade, and as they reached the gate the storm burst forth with tremendous fury.

0	The Amazon was not likely to escape the inevitable fate, and Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia have for years disputed as to the honor of its glorious paternity.
0	If either of the first two, the comet, after once appearing within the range of terrestrial vision, would vanish forever in the outlying regions of space; if the last, it would be sure, sooner or later, after some periodic interval, to return.
0	For, as the reflecting reader need hardly be reminded, since she rotates with perfect regularity on her axis, she can make such rotations visible to the Selenites by bringing some particular point on her surface once every twenty-four hours directly over the same lunar meridian.
0	The inside of their mouths seemed as black as the outside of their bodies.
0	He had been able to protect his wife and children from the brutality of the Tartars by sending them away into the Northern provinces.
0	"But," observed Herbert, "from Claw Cape to Granite House there must be at least another ten miles."
0	"No, Mr. Spilett," answered Pencroft, "I will ask you to set off to-morrow at daybreak.
0	"It is to be feared," answered the doctor, "for--" He did not finish his sentence; a cry from Bell interrupted him; he had turned over a tolerably large piece of ice and showed a stiff, frozen human leg in the ice.
0	Jacques Paganel drank largely, and discoursed still more _de omni re scibili_.
0	Even Barbican, who had been to Paris in his youth, yielding for a moment to the humor of the thing, acted the _naif Anglais_ to the life.
0	In quitting this sea we sighted Muscat for an instant, one of the most important towns of the country of Oman.
0	The day passed away, and not the faintest outline of a shadow could be seen at the bottom of the crater.
0	Still, the common safety demanded the success of this trip, and the captain deemed it right to choose sure and experienced men.
0	In spite of these difficulties, which would have discouraged any less energetic explorers than the _descubridores_ of the sixteenth century, they persevered in their attempt and descended the Rio Napo or Coca, an affluent on the left of the Marañon, as far as its confluence.

0	Of this new feature in their journey, Barbican had assured himself by the most undoubted proof towards four o'clock in the morning.
0	Under this leafy dome, which never lost its greenness, the air circulated freely, and dried up the dampness of the ground.
0	The inhabitants were extremely timid and distrustful; they fled away into the interior and no communication could be held with them.
0	What could be more pleasing in her eyes than the knickknacks given by a loving hand which spoke to her without saying anything?
0	"Suppose we reach this dead point," asked Ardan; "what then is to become of us?"
0	"Or," I continued, "the size of the Nautilus being 1,500 tons; and one ton holding 200 gallons, it contains 300,000 gallons of air, which, divided by 480, gives a quotient of 625.

0	Not a soul remained within the enclosure.
0	I saw the schooner topple over, slide down first on its left side, crush one of the men who delayed too long about jumping to one side, then bound from block to block, and finally fling itself into space.
0	"Is that really the case, Captain?"
0	I leave it to be imagined if the return of Professor Hardwigg made or did not make a sensation in Hamburg.
0	“It’s going up; I’m sure.” “Keep on yet,” said Kennedy.
0	I am, however, armed at all points against human incredulity.
0	"When I have mixed this honey with the paste of the bread-fruit," said he, "I shall be able to offer you a succulent cake."
0	However, having weighed the pros and cons, he thought that whatever might be the difficulties of a journey across the steppe without a beaten path, he ought not to risk capture a second time by the Tartars.
0	However, Herbert declared it to be an orang-outang.
0	Wolston, the armorer, Gripper, Clifton, and Bell were attacked by snow-blindness, which is very common in the spring, and which totally blinds many of the Esquimaux.
0	At least we should survey the unknown shore, and then we shall not have to begin the exploration again.” “Very good,” said Pencroft.
0	The first observations had not discovered these rifts.
0	But though the bottom of the Projectile continued to turn towards the lunar surface in obedience to the law of centripetal force, the centrifugal force was still evidently strong enough to change the path which it followed into some kind of curve, the exact nature of which would be exceedingly difficult to calculate.
0	“The first hypothesis I reject, then, to begin with, for Harry Grant could not have reached the English colonies, or long ago he would have been back with his children in the good town of Dundee.” “Poor father,” murmured Mary, “away from us for two whole years.” “Hush, Mary,” said Robert, “Monsieur Paganel will tell us.” “Alas!

0	It would be useless to attempt any reproduction of this immense work, for which a volume would be required, and it is the less necessary as at this day we have fuller and more complete details of the country than are to be found even in the learned father's book.
0	"'There is one more chance,' said he.
0	In a short time all the inhabitants of Fortaventura had embraced the Christian religion.
0	In a few hours the wind had changed from a hurricane to a fresh breeze, that is to say, the rate of the transit of the atmospheric layers was diminished by half.
0	Pencroft and Herbert examined for some time the country on which they had been cast; but it was difficult to guess after so hasty an inspection what the future had in store for them.
0	They could not be seen, but they could be heard.
0	What was the loss of the _Susquehanna_ and all it contained, in comparison to the loss experienced by the world at large in the terrible tragic _dénouement_ just witnessed?

0	This work finished, every moment was devoted to finishing the schooner.
0	They had no such effect upon him.
0	“But this document; had he not put it in some place of security?” “No,” answered Manoel--“no; it was too precious for Torres to dream of parting with it.

0	Vivres vont manquer et...” The rest of the document had been so damaged by the beaks of the gulls that it was illegible.
0	When they went to the corral they examined the sea to the west with no less attention, and by climbing the spur their gaze extended over a large section of the western horizon.
0	Its inhabitants probably fancied themselves safe in the center of the Baraba, whence at least they thought they would have time to flee if they were directly menaced.
0	Boussa, which the traveller reached at last, is not a regular town, but consists of groups of scattered houses on an island of the Quorra, situated in lat.

0	Upon the latter island, whilst the ships were being repaired and calked, several affrays with the natives occurred, in which some prisoners were made.
0	To cut the discussion short, I took Edward Simon, who had already made his preparations as a third guide.
0	Although she was still a very young girl in the literal sense of the term, the development of her high forehead and clearly-cut features gave the idea that she was the possessor of great moral energy--a point which did not escape Michael Strogoff.
0	"Let us return to our good friend, Hans," he said; "we will then bring the raft down to this place."
0	It is, however, always badly done, and very difficult of digestion.
0	Here and there large spaces were covered with salt, which sparkled in the sunlight with astonishing brilliancy.

0	"Very well," said Mr. Fogg, coldly.
0	A shot brought it to the ground, and Top carried it to the canoe.
0	There was not a bird in its fire-impregnated atmosphere, not an animal on the soil of cinders, not a fish in its boiling waters.
0	Gallia’s path, extending beyond the orbit of Jupiter, lay clearly defined before their eyes, the progress along the orbit and the solar distances being inserted for each month separately.
0	Glenarvan and his friends could only go half a mile an hour.
0	It was not till eight o’clock that the latter returned to the raft, and gave the young mulatto an account of his exploits, and repeated, with no little vanity, that the renown of the illustrious Fragoso was increasing in the basin of the Upper Amazon.
0	The attack had lasted nearly five hours.
0	There, when the fire got low, the ice used to cover the walls and the intervals between the planks; every nail and bolt and piece of metal was immediately covered with a film of ice.
0	Those "fellows," as he called them, "are only fit to mark the points, while we play the game."

0	It is only four or five inches long, but more formidable than the largest crocodile, and the waters it frequents are carefully avoided by the Indians, in spite of their fondness for bathing, and the relief it affords them, persecuted as they are by ants and mosquitoes.
0	By attentively watching, the observer would then have perceived the other molecules of the mass, following the example of this central star, become likewise condensed by gradually accelerated rotation, and gravitating round it in the shape of innumerable stars.
0	We have already related what was done by Cook, La Pérouse, and Marchand, so we can pass on to say a few words on the expeditions of Vancouver.
0	"It is far too tough and too big to be destroyed by a pickax or crowbar," I replied.
0	“Ayrton,” said Glenarvan, “here we are then, you and us, on this very DUNCAN that you wished to deliver into the hands of the convicts of Ben Joyce.” The lips of the quartermaster trembled slightly and a quick flush suffused his impassive features.
0	They could now remark not only that they were passing the tenth degree of north latitude, but that the Projectile followed almost directly the twentieth degree of east longitude.
0	That belongs to a Higher Power than ours!” Another month passed away, and it was now September, but it was still impossible to leave the warmth of the subterranean retreat for the more airy and commodious quarters of the Hive, where “the bees” would certainly have been frozen to death in their cells.
0	Again he was in thought back at Iquitos.
0	The mass of cedars and pines became blacker and blacker, and the waters of the Tom, totally obscured in the distance, mingled with the approaching shadows.
0	But, after all, as you have not had time to fight here, why not fight as we go along?"
0	The weather was magnificent, and the sun seemed to take part in the festivity.
0	“Wait till to-morrow,” replied Cyrus Harding.
0	Humboldt first tested the power of the gymnotus, or electric eel, large numbers of which are met with in all the tributaries of the Orinoco.

0	The engineer was eagerly expected.
0	There began the sea, the tumult of which could be distinctly heard during the equinoctial gales.
0	_Doing!_ Their bodies most probably were lying in a shapeless pile on the floor of the Projectile, like a heap of clothes, the uppermost man being the last smothered; or perhaps floating about in the water inside the Projectile, like dead gold fish in an aquarium; or perhaps burned to a cinder, like papers in a "champion" safe after a great fire; or, who knows?
0	At the same time the war-drum was beaten on every side.
0	Phileas Fogg was in prison.
0	“And the second question?” asked the latter.
0	The reporter’s argument was just, and besides, the incident of the bullet proved that a shot must have been fired in Lincoln Island within three months.
0	The interior of the _Halbrane_ corresponded with its exterior.
0	This gentleman's authority, Ardan, would have given you decided support in your famous dispute with the Captain at the meeting near Tampa, for he says very decidedly that the Moon has an atmosphere, very low to be sure but very dense.
0	11th November, early in the morning.
0	But in spite of his preoccupation, Michel Ardan did not forget to prepare the morning repast with his accustomed punctuality.
0	He has even uttered a moan.
0	Really, we ought to think before speaking.
0	Just at this moment there was an unusual stir in the human mass.

0	The two vessels set sail from Cronstadt on the 1st September, 1828, and touched at Copenhagen and Plymouth, where scientific instruments were purchased.
0	"So," added Bolton, in conclusion, "you persist in saying that dog is the captain?"
0	“Wait till the heads of the relieving columns appear on the heights, and we will speedily crush these invaders.” Then turning to General Voranzoff, “To-morrow,” said he, “we will visit the works on the right bank.
0	Doubtless, a sudden order to move having been foreseen, they were restricted to their barracks.
0	Unquestionably they must be interesting to a naturalist; but for me they have a far greater charm, for I have collected them all with my own hand, and there is not a sea on the face of the globe which has escaped my researches."
0	“That I do,” returned the girl.
0	Once upon the ice, everyone followed his own fancy, and some singly, some in groups, scattered themselves in all directions.
0	Hence it was that the solitary soldier who survived the massacre had reported that Ortega had perished in the struggle.
0	On Saturday, the temperature fell still lower under the influence of an east-wind; the sky cleared up, and they all had a wide view over the white expense, which shone brilliantly beneath the bright rays of the sun.
0	Then, I will watch over her without her suspecting it; and as she appears to me as anxious as myself to reach Irkutsk, she will cause me no delay.” But one thought leads to another.
0	The distance now separating them from our Satellite they estimated at about 400 miles.
0	"Perhaps so," said Conseil; "but, in any case, the Nautilus can only contain a certain number of men.

0	"You see, Pencroft," observed Harding, "there has been resistance on the part of the unfortunate Ayrton.
0	And to their ears she was no nearer.
0	Another valuable observation made, was that the vibrations of the compass were as slow in these southern latitudes as Parry had noted them to be in the Arctic regions.
0	"Yes," replied Pencroft; "but we must not forget to capture a couple or two of those pigs, of which Lincoln Island is destitute--" "Nor to gather those seeds," added Herbert, "which will give us all the vegetables of the Old and the New Worlds."
0	"The hypothesis that, for some reason or other, fire was never set to the powder, and we have not started at all."
0	Thirty miles from thence an island was seen surrounded by high mountains; it received the name of Montserrat; on the next day another, which was called Santa-Maria la Rodonda; and on the day following two more islands, St. Martin and Santa Cruz.
0	The convicts spoke loudly, they recounted their deeds, drinking deeply at the same time, and this is what Ayrton gathered.
0	Suddenly a loud trumpet call resounded through the forest.
0	Since yesterday, thanks to you, there is a gain of 5000 subscribers."
0	When evening came, the sorcerers of the island took him respectfully by the hand, and conducted him to a sort of house surrounded with talismans; but, as he was entering it, Joe cast an uneasy look at the heaps of human bones that lay scattered around this sanctuary.
0	A report was heard, and Glenarvan fell wounded by a ball.
0	Their circumspection proved to me that these birds knew what to expect from bipeds of our species, and I concluded that, if the island was not inhabited, at least human beings occasionally frequented it.
0	--"But I now begin to see a possibility, nay, a very decided probability, of our being able to attain the great end at last!"
0	In the meanwhile, the bad weather came with the month of May, the November of the northern zones.
0	The hasty departure from London soon after the robbery; the large sum carried by Mr. Fogg; his eagerness to reach distant countries; the pretext of an eccentric and foolhardy bet--all confirmed Fix in his theory.
0	On that day the thermometer fell several degrees; the wind shifted to the southward, and the heavy gusts, having passed over the ice, discharged themselves of their dampness under the form of a thick snow.
0	It was the acme of German luxury--parsley soup, a ham omelette with sorrel trimmings, an oyster of veal stewed with prunes, delicious fruit, and sparkling Moselle.
0	By the 28th of November eight hundred cartridges had been placed in the bottom of the Columbiad.
0	The delightful vision gave a happier turn to Mr. Smith's thoughts.
0	The travellers being no longer able to see each other, it was proposed to light the gas, though such an unexpected demand on a commodity at once so scarce and so valuable was certainly disquieting.
0	Their search had not been fruitless, for they were bringing back the survivors of the shipwrecked BRITANNIA.
0	“What do you still apprehend?” queried Kennedy.
0	The fleet now returned to Ceylon, where in 1284 Kublaï-Khan had sent an ambassador who had brought him back some pretended relics of Adam, and among other things two of his molar teeth; for, if we can believe the Saracen traditions, the tomb of our first father must have been on the summit of one of the precipitous mountains, which forms the highest ground in the island.
0	Little Robert did wonders in company with Major McNabbs.
0	His object was to enlist an army of workmen, and to collect together the greater part of the materials.
0	Besides, if necessary, the cart will take us rapidly to Granite House.” “Good!” answered the sailor.
0	Doctor Ferguson, at a public meeting of the Royal Geographical Society, gave a recital of his journey through the air, and obtained for himself and his companions the golden medal set apart to reward the most remarkable exploring expedition of the year 1862.
0	Confound the bolide that we met the first night of our journey!"
0	From this point, they occupied both banks beyond Irkutsk.
0	Sometimes they thought her fairly stopped; but some unexpected motion of the ice-streams would open a new passage into which she would plunge boldly; during these stoppages the steam would escape from the safety-valves and fall on the deck in the form of snow.
0	“And public opinion, which will not permit you to again risk the fate of the world?” added Mrs. Scorbitt.
0	Could we not, with the boat--" "Go on a discovery cruise?
0	Beyond the reef, the sea sparkled beneath the sun’s rays.
0	"We shall be attacked," said Bell.
0	The examination was easy, and Ayrton soon let the glass fall again, saying-- “It is not the ‘Duncan’!
0	In the pelting storm, Glenarvan, the Major and John Mangles transported the body of Mulrady.
0	A cry of terror escaped from every one's lips.
0	He wished to advance southward between 41 degrees to 46 degrees S. lat.
0	“We have seen smoke among the rocks, a hundred paces from us.” “Men in this place?” cried the reporter.
0	It was impossible, besides, to estimate the distance traversed, or to trust to the reckoning for the direction, as the speed had been very irregular.
0	The police had as yet found no traces of Ivan Ogareff.
0	A flag would not have been perceived; a gun would not have been heard; a fire would not have been visible.
0	I looked at the intruder, but he took no notice of my astonishment.
0	“We can do without him,” said Paganel.
0	The torches were now almost consumed, and as they were obliged to return by the passage to reach the summit of the plateau, it was decided to put off the work necessary for the arrangement of their new dwelling till the next day.
0	The mouth of the Columbiad, now completely disencumbered, was open entirely to the sky.
0	Mr. Fogg rose, and, followed by Fix, went out upon the platform.
0	Almost immediately the stranger entered, and without any preamble,-- “Gentlemen,” said he, “before I leave you, it is right that you should know my history.
0	A story he had evidently heard from some facetious whalemen, but had not entirely believed.
0	This king invited them to a great banquet which he said it was his custom to give when a vessel or junk was loaded with the first cloves.
0	Not only Gideon Spilett and Herbert, but Pencroft and Neb also took part in this excursion.
0	The _Forward_ sailed rapidly, and its screw, as yet unused, did not delay its progress.
0	The atmosphere was completely saturated with electricity, and its influence was felt by men and beasts.
0	Thus the strife became deadly.
0	I may say, then, that the 100-pounder Dahlgrens, which carried a distance of 5,000 yards, impressed upon their projectile an initial velocity of 500 yards a second.
0	Pencroft shook his head doubtfully.
0	It is Top!” cried Herbert, who had just awoke; and all three rushed towards the opening of the Chimneys.
0	On entering the house he was struck by the great cold within it; he went up to the stove and found the fire out; the occupations as well as the excitement of the morning had made Johnson forget his customary duty.
0	Ogareff had therefore no doubt that the pretended Nicholas Korpanoff was Michael Strogoff, courier of the Czar, seeking concealment under a false name, and charged with some mission which it would have been important for him to know.
0	Traces of the old fortifications remain, and also many pillars and arches of marble, basalt, and granite.
0	During the years following 1865 he even, for a time, deserted his favorite field of labor, fiction, and devoted himself to a popular semi-scientific book, now superseded by later works, entitled “The Illustrated Geography of France and her Colonies.” Verne has perhaps had a larger share than any other single individual in causing the ever-increasing yearly tide of international travel.
0	"You, sir, are only a passenger, I suppose?"
0	“At Judge Ribeiro’s,” answered Joam Garral.
0	But what a contrast between this and the eastern coast, upon which chance had first thrown them.
0	A whole day had to elapse before they could make a start, and they employed it in arranging a plan of flight.
0	"Well," said Hatteras, "to enter at one end and go out by the other, isn't that going through?"
0	In Timmannee Laing made acquaintance with a singular institution, a kind of free-masonry, known as "Purrah," the existence of which on the borders of the Rio Nuñez had been already ascertained by Caillié.
0	There is little reason to suppose, that marine officers, who had passed all the grades of the service, looked with gratification upon an appointment which no past event justified.
0	“However, I think that in making the experiment, we ought to employ, not the ordinary powder, the supply of which, I think, should remain untouched, but the pyroxyle which will never fail us.” “Can the cannon support the shock of the pyroxyle?” asked the reporter, who was not less anxious than Pencroft to try the artillery of Granite House.
0	Though it was not a project that claimed to affect either the velocity or the direction of the Projectile, still, as it was eminently practicable and not only unattended by no inconvenience on the one hand but evidently fraught with many advantages on the other, it met with decided and instantaneous success.
0	A suite of private apartments, with no opening to the court, but with a view of the gardens, is reserved for the "Ratu" (sovereign) and the harem.
0	I have been looking for you.
0	"Terrestrial volcanoes," said Barbicane, "are but mole-hills compared with those of the moon.
0	The _Bonadventure_ was then going at a very moderate rate, as the breeze, partly intercepted by the high land, scarcely swelled her sails, and the sea, smooth as glass, was only rippled now and then by passing gusts.
0	A map of the Moon in their eyes was a map of the Moon, no more, no less; their romantic friend might view it as he pleased.
0	The Major looked at the Professor, and the Colonel, and the Dutchman, and the Dane; and the Professor, and the Colonel, and the Dutchman, and the Dane looked at the Major.
0	He, however, found no one at Jisr-Benat-Yakûb who was willing to accompany him along the eastern shore of the Jordan, until a native, believing him to be a doctor, begged him to go and see his sheik, who was suffering from ophthalmia, and who lived upon the eastern bank of the Lake of Tiberias.
0	“Yes, in latitude 37 degrees.” “On the west coast?” “No, on the east coast,” was the prompt reply.
0	This aspect was not altered even when the projectile, at the height of 80@, was only separated from the moon by a distance of fifty miles; nor even when, at five in the morning, it passed at less than twenty-five miles from the mountain of Gioja, a distance reduced by the glasses to a quarter of a mile.
0	Although the cell was large, we had evidently consumed a great part of the oxygen that it contained.
0	And, indeed, who would have disputed with him the possession of this submarine property?

0	"He hopes!--He is not sure!-- and he waits for the moment when we are encased to make this deplorable admission!
0	Hence Shandon was left out, but not much to his regret.
0	A few days afterwards another messenger was sent to demand the presents reserved for El Khanemy, and on Clapperton's refusing to give them up, they were taken from him.
0	But some days later advices were received to the effect that foreign subscriptions were being eagerly taken up.
0	Supper was quickly devoured, for they were very hungry, and then there was only sleeping to think of.
0	In the meantime, those of the party who had been left in the fort had waged a petty war with the natives, and had made a great number of prisoners.
0	He was so posted up in the travels of Frezier, Molina, Humboldt, Miers, and Orbigny, that he had the geographical nomenclature at his fingers’ ends, and could trust implicitly to his never-failing memory.
0	Let us rather try to find out where we are."
0	"No," answered the engineer, "we are Americans."
0	Why is that not enough?
0	During the first part of their excursion, they saw numerous troops of monkeys who exhibited great astonishment at the sight of men, whose appearance was so new to them.
0	Many most beautiful and suggestive ideas of architectural beauty would have been discovered by them.
0	It would have been interesting to discover whether James West was aware of the state of the case, whether his chief had ever talked to him of the follies he had revealed to me.
0	None of them showed any intention of coming on board.
0	On issuing from the gorges of the Cordilleras, Glenarvan and his band came first to plains of sand, called MEDANOS, lying in ridges like waves of the sea, and so extremely fine that the least breath of wind agitated the light particles, and sent them flying in clouds, which rose and fell like water-spouts.
0	We know how certain animals retain the memory of the bad treatment they have received, and it is possible that against backwoodsmen in general he bore some special grudge.
0	The outside belongs to you, the inside to us.
0	Grijalva, accompanied by the pilot Alaminos, who had made the voyage to Florida with Ponce de Leon, had two hundred men under his command; amongst the volunteers was Bernal Diaz del Castillo, the clever author of a very interesting history of the conquest of Mexico, from which we shall borrow freely.
0	Fix evidently was no longer an enemy, but an ally; he was faithfully keeping his word.
0	No land nor even a sail was in sight.
0	An instant before she sank, the brig, as I saw perfectly well, rose on an enormous wave, and fell back on her larboard side.
0	The beard was on the chin, the features could be recognized.
0	Nadia understood that her companion had not told, or could not tell, her all.
0	It has changed to fitful gusts.
0	“I do not think,” he said to Count Timascheff and Lieutenant Procope, “that we ought to allow our people to lose their interest in the world to which we are all hoping to return; and how can we cement the bond that ought to unite us, better than by celebrating, in common with our fellow-creatures upon earth, a day that awakens afresh the kindliest sentiments of all?
0	"That is to say," broke in Ardan, to give what he conceived a sharper point to Barbican's cogent arguments, "such a race of beings as could exist without existing!"
0	One of them ran to him at once, and was immediately seized and carried on board.
0	It may, perhaps, seem singular that the ancient lords of the country, Tupinambas and Tupiniquis, should find their principal occupation in making objects for the Catholic religion.
0	Kotzebue had suffered very much from pain in his chest ever since when, doubling Cape Horn, he had been knocked down by a huge wave and flung overboard, an accident which would have cost him his life had he not clung to some rope.
0	“Such are the two segments from which the waters will retire.
0	He lived two years in this country, and upon Cook's third voyage he accompanied him, and returned to his native land.
0	"Well, no; I can't say that I did hear any report."
0	At the sight of the vessel a considerable fleet of canoes put off from the shore, and the natives, palm branches in their hands, advanced with the rhythmic sound of the paddles serving as a kind of solemn and melancholy accompaniment to numerous singers.
0	"I mean," roared the terrible Secretary, "that we are no better than a lot of cabbage heads, dead beats, and frauds, calling ourselves scientists!
0	But, when we arrive in the moon, during its fifteen days of night at either face, we shall have leisure to make the experiment, for our satellite lies in a vacuum."
0	"The steamer Atlanta from Liverpool put to sea on the 2nd of October, bound for Tampa Town, having on board a Frenchman borne on the list of passengers by the name of Michel Ardan."
0	Columbus, as soon as he recovered, was anxious to leave this coast.
0	To provide, at the same time, against the possible contingency of the frail vessel failing to reach the Rio de la Plata, Freycinet determined to commence the construction of a schooner of a hundred tons, as soon as the sloop had taken her departure.
0	The nets were hauled in.
0	To the engineer’s great satisfaction, this invention, copied from the Aleutian fishermen, succeeded perfectly.
0	However, it was not Neb's speech which interrupted the conversation, but Top's barking, which broke out again with that strange intonation which had before perplexed the engineer.
0	The next day, the 8th of December, was but a succession of the fainting fits.
0	You are always what we were under the influence of the gas; you are always foolish!"
0	A path had to be cut through the ice.
0	One would say it was all one color.
0	Jack Ryan went on thus until he got to the twenty-sixth landing, and consequently had two hundred feet between him and the bottom.
0	This apartment was kitchen, parlor and dining room all in one.
0	Thus ended a conversation which, at no very distant time, led to such grave results.
0	"But you are a good shot," answered Bell.
0	"A hundred dollars we shall find none!"
0	Numerous blackish patches spread on the surface, showing the formation of fresh ice.
0	Michael Strogoff could not be mistaken.
0	I repeat that some one has been using our vessel!” “But if the convicts had used her, they would have pillaged her, or rather gone off with her.” “Gone off!
0	After several fruitless attempts, which resulted in nothing but scaring the grouse, the sailor said to the lad,-- “Decidedly, since we can’t kill them on the wing, we must try to take them with a line.” “Like a fish?” cried Herbert, much surprised at the proposal.
0	For hours they continued to gaze with indescribable interest on the faintly luminous mass so easily distinguishable among the other heavenly bodies.
0	But was not his calm only apparent?
0	"I hope not," replied the reporter.
0	At twelve o'clock still nothing.
0	The most beautiful are called virgin pearls, or paragons.
0	At once all the crews deeply moved, joined in singing together the _Salve Regina_.
0	there is no doubt about it," replied Spilett.
0	"It is a pity," said I, "that as we are so near, we should not attempt to solve this question of a polar continent."
0	It was about ten feet long and five feet wide.
0	The little company, having passed the chaotic barrier that intercepted the northern route, proceeded rapidly towards the north-west.

0	He swore that Servadac and his people were responsible for his loss; he vowed that they should be sued and made to pay him damages; he asserted that he had been brought from Gourbi Island only to be plundered; in fact, he became so intolerably abusive, that Servadac threatened to put him into irons unless he conducted himself properly; whereupon the Jew, finding that the captain was in earnest, and would not hesitate to carry the threat into effect, was fain to hold his tongue, and slunk back into his dim hole.
0	So it happened on this occasion.
0	Then the imagination set to work; all the mountain catastrophes rose in the fancy.
0	"Unless the lava opened a new way for itself towards the fertile parts of the island!"
0	"But has he not invented machines which go all by themselves, and which actually do the work of a real man?"
0	cried Michel Ardan, "we are hideous.
0	The very last tufts of grassy vegetation appeared to die at our feet.
0	At the sight of strangers they paused in their music, and simultaneously the dancers, with their victim, alighted gently on the sward.
0	Ah, Captain Harding, you won’t now oppose my going.” “No, Pencroft,” replied Cyrus Harding; “and you shall set out as soon as possible.” “To-morrow?” “To-morrow!” The engineer still held in his hand the paper which he had taken from the bottle.
0	I did as Hurliguerly directed.
0	"True," answered Johnson; "we are building a fortification against the cold, and also against the animals, if they care to visit us; when that is finished, it will look well, you may be sure; in this snow we shall cut two staircases, one fore, the other aft; when the steps are cut in the snow, we shall pour water on them; this will freeze as hard as stone, and we shall have a royal staircase."
0	"I know that is so, Mr. Jeorling," replied the captain, "but if such a continent exists, we must conclude that there is a great gap in its coast, and that Weddell and my brother each got in by that gap at six years' interval.
0	Many of the crew visited their cemeteries, and especially the tomb of a chief, which was a kind of mound, decorated with spears, javelins, arrows, and darts, which were stuck around it.
0	Hatteras took it; it was in good condition, and loaded.
0	And this idea rooted itself deeper than ever in his determined heart.
0	The two piers of Dunkirk stretch far out into the sea.
0	It is important that our respective situations should be clearly defined.
0	Four natives came with great confidence to sup and sleep on board.
0	To the enormous lava rocks succeeded soon those capricious sand dunes, among which the engineer had been so singularly recovered, and which seabirds frequented in thousands.
0	The rise in the thermometer foretold a fall of snow, and soon it came, beginning in large flakes.
0	"You are in a great hurry, then," said Fix to him one day, "to reach Hong Kong?"

0	At last, on Tuesday, the seventh of the month of July, after crawling on our hands and knees for many hours, more dead than alive, we reached the point of junction between the galleries.
0	They had travelled over 360 miles, and were forced to keep a man incessantly throwing the line and sounding the rocks through which they navigated.
0	On the west, however, rise the Rocky Mountains, that immense range which, commencing at the Straights of Magellan, follows the western coast of Southern America under the name of the Andes or the Cordilleras, until it crosses the Isthmus of Panama, and runs up the whole of North America to the very borders of the Polar Sea.
0	Although its principal object had not been attained, it had at least resulted in some geographical discoveries; it had completed or rectified those made by preceding navigators; and to it, especially to the exertions of La Billardière, are due the acquisition of an immense number of facts in natural history.
0	"No," replied Fix coldly, "I think him a rascal.
0	For the last time, I ask you, will you reply to my questions?” Ayrton turned his head toward Glenarvan, and looked into his eyes.
0	It is surrounded by a thick cloud of smoke.

0	And when William S. Forster had to name the real purchasers, he placidly drawled,—“Barbicane & Co!” Barbicane & Co.!
0	"Yes," said the doctor, "that cannot be denied; every one should have the praise he deserves."
0	Ross gave to the principal peaks the names of Herschell, Whewell, Wheatstone, Murchison, and Melbourne.
0	They lay on each other like inert masses, M'Nicholl stretched across Barbican.
0	On they went for another quarter of an hour, and a distance of half-a-mile must have been cleared from the mouth of the cave, when Harding’s voice was again heard.
0	Harding, Pencroft, and Spilett seized their guns and ran out of the house.
0	Now this happened the 30th of March, 1865.

0	Nicholl then tried to prepare some tea destined to help the absorption of a dozen sandwiches.
0	The reporter could not but admire the boy, who had acquired great skill in handling the bow and spear.
0	Bell seemed to wish to push on, but Altamont held him back.
0	I say,” repeated Rosette; “and if you don’t understand me, you may go to the devil!” Without availing himself of this polite invitation, Ben Zoof betook himself to his master.
0	To mistake its identity with the moon was absolutely impossible; not even Servadac could discover a trace of the seas, chasms, craters, and mountains which have been so minutely delineated in lunar charts, and it could not be denied that any transient hope that had been excited as to their once again being about to enjoy the peaceful smiles of “the queen of night” must all be resigned.

0	There the experiment will be more conclusive.” “Besides, he could not run away,” said Neb, “since the bridge is raised.” “Oh!” said Pencroft, “that isn’t a man to be troubled by a stream like Creek Glycerine!
0	They are entirely personal, and will not do much to help you to recover the lost traces of Captain Grant.” Keen disappointment was depicted on the faces of Glenarvan and the Major.
0	He built two huts of willow, which he covered with a sort of rush, and lined with the skins of the goats he killed to satisfy his hunger, so long as his ammunition lasted.
0	It was decided that he should spend two days there, and return to Granite House after having liberally supplied the stables.
0	I'm not mistaken, and the stores must be within a hundred paces of us, and if they're not there,--it's because--" He durst not finish his sentence; Hatteras ran forward, and terrible despair seized him.
0	At last the city of Jenne, on a large island, came in sight, with the two towers of its clay-built mosque, and the putrid odor of the millions of swallows’ nests accumulated in its walls.
0	However, more than once Pencroft hoisted him on his back, which Top never complained of.

0	Nature made no mistake in giving this peculiar foliage to the tree, but men have erred in calling them EUCALYPTUS.” “What does the word mean?” asked Mary Grant.
0	Although the great _I_ is generally hateful, it is not so in travels, where the assertion _I_ have been there, _I_ have done such or such a thing, carries weight, and gives interest to the narrative.
0	They are of various tribes; the greater number lead a wandering life on the frontiers, where they pasture their camels, oxen, and horses.
0	One of them was very perceptibly gaining on Joe, and was about to pierce him with his lance, when Kennedy, with fixed eye and steady hand, stopped him short with a ball, that hurled him to the earth.
0	Not unlike Europeans in height and figure, they are less hideous than the Tchinkitaneans.
0	To Marchand we owe also the curious observation that their huts are raised upon flat stones, and that the stilts which they use indicate that Santa Cristina is subject to inundations.
0	The struggle was contemptible in the extreme, and this abortive attempt closed the war.
0	A great many noteworthy winters have been known, and it seems as if the severest has a periodic return about every forty-one years,--a period which nearly corresponds with the greater appearance of spots on the sun.
0	“Well, I won’t be behind you in politeness, and so I’ll give you one of my country reels.” So at it he went, in one of the wildest jigs that ever was seen, twisting, turning, and jerking himself in all directions; dancing with his hands, dancing with his body, dancing with his knees, dancing with his feet; describing the most fearful contortions and extravagant evolutions; throwing himself into incredible attitudes; grimacing beyond all belief, and, in fine giving his savage admirers a strange idea of the style of ballet adopted by the deities in the moon.
0	The settlers followed the wire along it.
0	Barbican and M'Nicholl always treated the subject gravely, as became learned scientists, but Ardan preferred to look on things with the eye of fancy.
0	“Now, the two bodies may impinge either directly or obliquely.
0	Amongst these travellers we must mention Daniel William Harmon, a member of the North-West Company, who visited Lakes Huron and Superior, Rainy Lake, the Lake of the Woods, Manitoba, Winnipeg, Athabasca, and the Great Bear Lake, all between N. lat.
0	Now, in order to calculate the elements of a comet, it is always deemed the safest mode of procedure to assume the orbit to be a parabola.
0	Ivan Ogareff and the housch-begui walked forward and almost immediately two men, whom the soldiers had not been able to keep back appeared before them.
0	Some wonderful exploits were related.
0	"Well, Mr. Bronsfield," replied the captain, "now, with your permission, we will have the line cut."
0	what a splendid idea!--Dolts that we were for not thinking of it sooner!"
0	No thought had been bestowed upon comfort or convenience, as the ascent was to last for so short a time, merely long enough for making the transit from atmosphere to atmosphere.
0	Thus the new men of the crew, and especially the Americans, did not conceal their regret for the captain's indifference in the presence of so many animals worth their weight in gold, and more abundant than they had ever seen whales at that period of the year.
0	On Friday, after a night when I began to feel the gnawing agony of thirst, and when in consequence appetite decreased, our little band rose and once more followed the turnings and windings, the ascents and descents, of this interminable gallery.
0	The cold season was now almost at an end, and it appeared as if this second winter was to pass without any unusual occurrence, when, on the night of the 11th August, the plateau of Prospect Heights was menaced with complete destruction.
0	We had to fall back on the mineral kingdom.
0	In a short time the doors and palings were removed, and the walls demolished.
0	“One important point is to see if the vowels and consonants are in their normal proportion.” And so he seized his pen, counted up the vowels, and obtained the following result:          _a_ =  3 times          _e_ =  9  --          _i_ =  4  --      Total... 276 times.

0	Benito’s intention had been to land that evening, but Manoel dissuaded him.
0	He asked to be allowed to go to England.
0	"Pass the neutral line," cried Michel; "then let us do as the sailors do when they cross the equator."
0	A rope fastened above, near the surface, would certainly support our weight and enable us to reach the bottom, but how, when we had arrived at its utmost depth, were we to loosen it above?
0	After this expedition, so fruitful in results, voyages of discovery became rather less frequent for some years; the Spaniards being occupied in asserting their supremacy in the countries in which they had already founded colonies.

0	On the 28th, after a skilful reconnaissance of the coasts had been made by Coelho, the Portuguese sailors landed upon the American shores, and became aware of a delicious mildness of temperature, with a luxuriance of vegetation greatly exceeding anything which they had seen on the coasts of Africa or of Malabar.

0	To such questions no answer can be given.
0	“Let them be called,” said Glenarvan, “we cannot leave them on the ship.” Mulrady and Wilson went down to the forecastle, and two minutes after they returned.
0	We have to decide now on what island of the Pacific Ocean you are to be left?” “It matters little, my Lord,” replied Ayrton.
0	[Illustration] [Illustration] So during meal-time the prudent Clawbonny always took care to guide the conversation and to direct it in such a way as not to offend the susceptibilities of either; but he had a great deal to do.

0	However, once or twice in the second week of August, the traps supplied the hunters with other animals more useful than foxes, namely, several of those small wild boars which had already been seen to the north of the lake.
0	It is enough for us to say that the key was found by him, and to others was left the task of completing and perfecting his work.
0	On this vast extent of twenty miles square, the subterranean forces had a field for the display of all their varied effects.

0	Thus ended all his labours, without their having ever brought him any satisfaction."
0	The ship was exposed to a gentle, but persistent pressure, which was gradually crushing it; it was evident that nothing could be done with its fragments; still the doctor kept hoping to be able to build a launch out of them to return to England in, but the time for building it had not yet come.
0	Dirk Peters took not faintest notice of this state of things.
0	"It is at least 8000 feet high and is well known to terrestrial astronomers as well by its peculiar shadow as on account of its comparative isolation.

0	Herbert was somewhat delirious, but the fever did not reappear in the night, and did not return either during the following day.
0	They waited, of course not without some anxiety.
0	At first he tried gentle means, but the captain's excitement amounted to delirium; on the way he had exhibited all the signs of growing madness, and whoever has known him in the different scenes of his life cannot be surprised.
0	If to live in this style is to be eccentric, it must be confessed that there is something good in eccentricity.

0	"Quite true," said the general.
0	Aupic also made one of their band, and held himself apart, with loud disapproval of all the new measures taken; but Louis Cornbutte, to whom his father had transferred the command of the ship, and who had become once more master on board, would listen to no objections from that quarter, and in spite of Marie's advice to act gently, made it known that he intended to be obeyed on all points.

0	After all, as Conseil said, we enjoyed perfect liberty, we were delicately and abundantly fed.
0	Conseil, who was astonished at nothing, seemed to look upon it as quite natural that he should wake under a mountain, after having fallen asleep under the waves.
0	"Look well, Neb, and if you find one hollow tooth in this set, I will let you pull out half a dozen!"
0	Wait for daylight, and the scene will change."
0	Since my son has not told you his secret, I must keep it.
0	Although the attempts to find a passage by the north-west had been abandoned by the English for twenty years, they had not, however, given up the idea of seeking by that way, for a passage which was only to be discovered in our own days, and of which the absolute impracticability was then to be ascertained.
0	No sooner does he enter it with me than an immense stone is cast upon us, and communication is interrupted by the breaking of the ladders in the Yarrow shaft.
0	"I think that we are caught, Captain."
0	What had this condor discovered then?
0	Four months afterwards they had the good luck to be picked up by a Portuguese expedition, which seems to have had orders to thwart the plans of Cabot.
0	None of the comrades of Louis Cornbutte failed to respond to his call, and there were hardy tars among them,--Alaine Turquiette, Fidèle Misonne the carpenter, Penellan the Breton, who replaced Pierre Nouquet as helmsman, and Gradlin, Aupic, and Gervique, courageous and well-tried mariners.
0	Besides, they were able to shoot occasionally; they killed ducks, geese, and other game, which gave them fresh and wholesome food.
0	They wear a sort of wooden bowl without a handle, which rests on the gums, "to which this split lip forms an outer cushion, in such a way that the lower part of the mouth protrudes some two or three inches."
0	Now, since the thaw begins at this season of the year, the drift will last for only a short time.
0	On his journey back to Catarocouy, La Sale, having discovered a new site appropriate to the construction of a fort, summoned Tonti thither, who immediately set to work, while La Sale continued his route.
0	The _Mare Imbrium_ or the Rainy Sea, a fit emblem of our human life, beaten by many a pitiless storm.
0	The peak itself is next attached, the ascent of which is broken one-third of the way up by a sort of esplanade called the Estancia de los Ingleses.
0	But where these shrubs appeared in all their beauty was on the eastern coast, which the Nautilus soon gained.
0	The friends, sitting around and having nothing more to do, looked out of the window and began once more to watch the Earth and the Moon with great attention.
0	I confess, not at all," replied Pencroft; "and the wound which the dugong had in its side, a wound which seemed to have been made with a sharp instrument; that can't be understood either."
0	Some of the men were able to leave the ship for the driest hours of the day; but ophthalmia and scurvy kept most of them on board; besides, neither hunting nor fishing was possible.
0	asked the Captain, somewhat surprised.
0	“The savages,” said Paganel, shrugging his shoulders.
0	But was it frequented, at least occasionally, by the natives of neighboring islands?
0	Those which attack humanity spare the animals, and those which attack the animals spare the vegetables.
0	The invasion could not, therefore, be immediately stopped, and the whole Tartar army might at once march upon Irkutsk.
0	At that spot the two attractions, lunar and terrestrial, would be annulled.
0	By advice of the Moors, the king refused to receive the traveller, and forbade him to remain in his capital, where he could not have protected him from ill-treatment.
0	The latter, without a word, made a rush for him, grasped him by the throat, and, much to the amusement of a group of Americans, who immediately began to bet on him, administered to the detective a perfect volley of blows, which proved the great superiority of French over English pugilistic skill.
0	John Mangles supported Paganel’s proposal.
0	It was painful in the extreme.
0	has your family never left the old mine since the cessation of the works?” “Not a day, Mr. Starr.
0	What if this sea was no longer the Mediterranean?
0	“It is there that they have been struck!” said Cyrus Harding.
0	He had the DUNCAN built expressly that he might take his bride to the most beautiful lands in the world, and complete their honeymoon by sailing up the Mediterranean, and through the clustering islands of the Archipelago.
0	Besides, until the window-frames were made, the engineer meant to close the openings with thick shutters, which would prevent either wind or rain from entering, and which could be concealed in need.
0	The two friends left Corunna on the 5th June, 1799, and reached the Canaries thirteen days later.
0	Often we rounded high rocks scarped into pyramids.
0	See, how circumscribed is the horizon!” Servadac replied that he had noticed the same circumstance from the top of the cliffs of Gourbi Island.
0	As to what they were, Europeans or Malays, enemies or friends of our race, we cannot possibly guess; and if they still inhabit the island, or if they have left it, we know not.
0	"We will trust your word, as a gentleman of honour."
0	“In forty-eight hours, with a good wind, we should sight it!” And, on this reply, it was decided that a vessel should be constructed in time to be launched towards the month of next October, on the return of the fine season.
0	Neither the islet nor Prospect Heights was visible, and could not be from thence, for the rising ground and the curtain of trees closed the northern horizon.
0	"There's no doubt of it," answered Shandon; "and sailing-vessels have hard work in making headway against it."
0	The internal rumblings, the crash of the avalanches, the fall of masses of granite and basalt, and the whirlwind of pulverized snow, made all communication impossible.
0	At the back of the pirogue, a man stood erect, holding in his hands a bunch of herbs, raising them above his head, with a rhythmical movement.
0	“No; but there are races here still more to be dreaded.” “Why!” said Joe, again, “there’s something like a town.” “That is Kernak.
0	The reporter and his companion had judged it best to abandon the post at the Mercy, from which they could do nothing against the ship, and they had acted wisely.
0	Fix, without saying a word, looked at Mr. Fogg, and it would have been difficult to analyse the thoughts which struggled within him.
0	"Well, have I not my Rouquayrol reservoir, which can furnish it at need?
0	I felt that sickly giddiness which arises from long-continued whirling round.
0	Three-quarters of an hour later a cab deposited him at the door of the doctor’s modest dwelling, in Soho Square, Greek Street.
0	It makes a very good audiobook of seven hours duration.
0	How gracefully they shut in the horizon!
0	In the evening the hunters returned, having enjoyed good sport, and being literally loaded with game; indeed, they had as much as four men could possibly carry.
0	At this moment the door of the large saloon opened, and Captain Nemo appeared.
0	In a few seconds Barbican was profoundly absorbed in his problem, while M'Nicholl was watching out of the window, and Ardan was busily employed in preparing breakfast.
0	In short, the most alarming symptoms manifested themselves and increased from day to day.
0	Such are the principal branches above the village of Iquitos.
0	They provided a variety of intellectual pursuits; they instituted debates in which everybody was encouraged to take part; they read aloud, and explained extracts from the elementary manuals of science, or from the books of adventurous travel which their library supplied; and Russians and Spaniards, day after day, might be seen gathered round the large table, giving their best attention to instruction which should send them back to Mother Earth less ignorant than they had left her.
0	“Speak, for our _amour propre_ is wounded to the quick!” “I am ready to satisfy you,” replied Harry Grant; “but, you know, to multiply the chances of safety, I had inclosed three documents in the bottle, in three different languages.
0	To this question, which each one asked himself, a reply was suddenly made by Herbert.
0	He found out the entrance to the bowels of the earth, he has indicated correctly, but that he or anyone else ever followed up the discovery is madness to suppose."
0	As the rope caused him to swing gently round and round, the light of his lamp fell in turns on all points of the side walls, so that he was able to examine them carefully.
0	Here he built a canoe, and went in it down the stream, which flowed into an innumerable series of large and small lakes.
0	Nevertheless, December 25th he went down into the common-room.
0	He knew as much about ship-building as about nearly everything else, and he had at first drawn the model of his ship on paper.
0	"It is absolutely void of air."
0	Without a moment's loss of time a small boat put off in the direction of its fall; some divers plunged into the water and attached ropes to the handles of the shell, which was quickly dragged on board.
0	His disappearance started numerous search-expeditions, which have effected the discovery of the passage, and given the world definite information about the rugged coasts of the polar lands.
0	Lady Helena and Mary Grant were led in by Mrs. O’Moore, while the gentlemen were assisted by his sturdy sons to disencumber themselves of their fire-arms.
0	The wind being aft, and the sail square, all he had to do was to keep his oar in the centre.
0	The result was that in a short time five of the most imprudent were confined to their hammocks with dysentery.
0	“When Herbert is cured, we can organize a general battle of the island, and have satisfaction of these convicts.
0	With these words the Canadian withdrew, leaving me almost dumb.
0	They were sincerely attached to their new companion.
0	Now, they ought to be better informed on this subject, and if they did not attempt to visit us, to what motive were we to assign such conduct?
0	ferocious brute!” he added, “I’ll settle you in a moment more!” and swiftly reloaded his rifle.
0	These words inspired such confidence, that Michel Ardan carried all the Gun Club with him in his enthusiasm.
0	It was useless to attack it on the ceiling-like surface, since the iceberg itself measured more than 400 yards in height.
0	Although all this portion of the narrative of his voyage, in countries unknown before his time, abounds in precious details, Carteret, a far more able and zealous navigator than his predecessors Byron and Wallis, makes excuses for not having collected more facts.
0	Was it to them an unknown island, ready to become a magazine for stolen cargoes?
0	It was well worth while, besides, to turn Prospect Heights into a kitchen-garden, defended by its deep belt of creeks, and to remove them to the meadows, which had no need of protection against the depredations of quadrumana and quadrapeds.
0	It was summer succeeding winter, which had been driven away by the tempest; the snow had been blown away by the wind before it could melt, and the barren soil reappeared.
0	More than one change of this sort has taken place on the globe, and I should astonish you much more by saying that, according to Icelandic chroniclers, two hundred villages flourished on this continent eight or nine hundred years ago."
0	The river Pharpar fertilizes the orchards and gardens outside the town.
0	Rewards were offered to the natives if they saved any one; but the return of the sloops destroyed all hope.
0	It is a great misfortune to be alone, my friends; and it must be believed that solitude can quickly destroy reason, since you have found this poor creature in such a state!” “But, captain,” asked Herbert, “what leads you to think that the brutishness of the unfortunate man began only a few months back?” “Because the document we found had been recently written,” answered the engineer, “and the castaway alone can have written it.” “Always supposing,” observed Gideon Spilett, “that it had not been written by a companion of this man, since dead.” “That is impossible, my dear Spilett.” “Why so?” asked the reporter.
0	After rounding the peak, she steered direct for the channel to which Servadac by his gestures was pointing her, and was not long in entering the creek.
0	“Yes, and it was the last service he desired to render us before his death!” “The last service!” exclaimed Pencroft, “the last service!
0	However, Herbert's convalescence progressed rapidly.
0	The doctor, followed by Kennedy, leaped in, and lit his cylinder, while his companions threw out the superfluous ballast.
0	The boundless plain stretched out with tiresome monotony; everywhere there appeared heaped-up ice-hills, hummocks, blocks, and icebergs, separated by winding valleys; they walked staff in hand, saying but little.
0	The six bullocks, yoked in pairs, had a patriarchal air about them which took her fancy.
0	This gives them six days of clear light--time enough in all conscience not only to land safely but to install themselves quite comfortably in their new home.
0	There appeared a narrow ridge, running horizontally and parallel with the sea.
0	I pushed back the canvas of the tent, which I shared with Captain Len Guy and West respectively, as each succeeded the other on release from the alternate "watch," very early, and experienced a severe disappointment.
0	Fortunately, this cone inclined to the north, and had fallen upon the plain of sand and tufa stretching between the volcano and the sea.
0	From the moment of their departure, the travellers moved with great velocity.
0	Instead of a noble firmament of blue, studded with stars, there was above me a heavy roof of granite, which seemed to crush me.
0	It might have been taken for one of the best Roman roads.
0	But why we should be under the Mediterranean more than under Turkey or the Atlantic Ocean can only be known when we are sure of not having deviated from our course; and of this we know nothing."
0	The bearings of the place were taken exactly, and the Moravian continued its route without apparent damage.
0	And through a luminous emanation, which lasted some seconds, the whole three caught a glimpse of that mysterious disc which the eye of man now saw for the first time.
0	Nadia had followed her companion in his search after a suitable vehicle.
0	It is evident that an unaccustomed fire devours her.
0	“But let me have my coffee,” he added impatiently; “I cannot collect my thoughts without my coffee.” Fortunately, Ben Zoof appeared with a great cup, hot and strong.
0	They had no doubt about it themselves!
0	He impressed upon him that he was to wait at Melbourne for Lord Glenarvan’s commands, and to obey them scrupulously, whatever they might be.
0	Some moving ice-blocks, broken by this point, floated in the midst, and the sea, sheltered from the colder winds, was not yet entirely frozen over.
0	Tayf, it appears, is famous for the beauty of its gardens; roses and grapes are sent from it into all the districts of Hedjaz.
0	It was evident that the vessel had been moved, more or less, since Pencroft had brought her to Port Balloon.
0	It was an acknowledged impossibility to get access to the crater by the exterior declivities of the mountain-side; they were far too steep and too slippery to afford a foothold.
0	On leaving this town they diverged from the lake, and their weariness increased amid these mountain districts.
0	But it is decidedly the most remarkable and conspicuous of them all.
0	"We must start this very day, Captain Bloomsbury," cried Marston resolutely; "Barbican has been lying two weeks and thirteen hours in the depths of the Pacific!
0	Come, now, tell me, you want me very much to stay, don’t you?” said Paganel.
0	Bougainville, like the Russian navigator Lütke, is of opinion that the position of Valparaiso does not justify its reputation.
0	The coast of Japan still remained less than two hundred miles to leeward.
0	As he was about to start, Harding asked him if he would not like one of them to accompany him, observing that the island was less safe than formerly.
0	These words of the commander had a great effect upon me.
0	There he remained until the 15th of October, the repairs of the vessels meanwhile going actively forward.
0	This city of Mien, which may be, perhaps, the old town of Ava now in ruins, or the old town of Paghan situated on the Irrawaddy, possessed a veritable architectural marvel, in two towers, one built of fine stone, and entirely covered with a coating of gold about an inch in thickness, and the other, also of stone, coated with silver, both intended to serve as a tomb for the king of Mien, before his kingdom fell under the dominion of the khan.
0	The principle actuating it, though guessed at by many shrewd scientists, is still a profound secret and will probably remain so for some time longer, the _Herald_ having purchased the right to its sole and exclusive use for fifteen years, at an enormous cost.
0	We are not belligerents; we are neutral, and we will claim our freedom.” “From that brute of a Feofar-Khan?” “No; he would not understand,” answered Jolivet; “but from his lieutenant, Ivan Ogareff.” “He is a villain.” “No doubt; but the villain is a Russian.
0	The second time, after many careful researches, he found that a pillar had just been blown up.
0	Ivan Ogareff, without frowning, mounted his horse, and going to the head of his escort, soon disappeared in a cloud of dust.
0	"So," went on the captain, "I don't want them to lose the money they came so far to seek.
0	To leeward is a turtle about forty feet wide, and a serpent quite as long, with an enormous and hideous head peering from out the waters.
0	Utensils:--1 iron pot, 6 copper saucepans, 3 iron dishes, 10 metal plates, 2 kettles, 1 portable stove, 6 table-knives.
0	As I approached him, he offered his hand, still without attempting to come forward, and said, 'Good day!
0	All modern experiments tend to explode the older theories.
0	"I heard no report whatever."
0	But few words were spoken; the vagueness of the unknown impressed us, but the new and strange situation excited us, and rendered us insensible to its dangers.
0	Herbert caught sight of this turtle as it was crawling among the rocks to reach the sea.
0	Besides these sounds, the presence of chemical combinations was soon betrayed by their powerful odor, and the engineer and his companion were almost suffocated by sulphurous vapors.
0	Two hours after a stiff breeze came on.
0	There, with arms crossed and stern gaze, he watched the hero of the meeting.
0	“What a strange phenomenon!” exclaimed the captain.
0	Pencroft was silent, but a reaction set in, and great tears rolled down his cheeks.
0	To advance southwards and endeavour to find Circumcision Cape, which was said to have been discovered by M. Bouvet, in the 54 degrees southern parallel, and about 11 degrees 20 minutes east longitude, reckoning from Greenwich.
0	“I did not say Gallia,” replied Rosette, stamping his foot impetuously; “I said Nerina.” “Oh, Nerina,” answered Servadac.
0	The particular object of their expedition was, as has been said, to procure the greatest possible quantity of game for the inhabitants of the Chimneys.
0	Let us intrust to Providence the care of guiding us and of keeping us in good health as we are now.
0	"Without taking into account," said Ned, "that, even if we get out of this infernal prison, we shall also be imprisoned under the iceberg, shut out from all possible communication with the atmosphere."
0	The marvellous saloon, still flooded with light, had been carefully closed.
0	Then he went on as follows:-- "You remember the voyage of Blanchard and Jeffries from Dover to Calais?
0	Passepartout was waiting for his master, armed with half a dozen six-barrelled revolvers.
0	As yet, they only hunted in Jacamar Wood, on the left of the river, because, for want of a bridge or boat, the Mercy had not yet been crossed.
0	"As I was about to re-embark," says D'Urville, "a little barrel was brought to me which had been found hung on a tree on the beach, near a post on which was written _Post Office_.
0	To this list we must now add the name of the ornithologist Le Vaillant.
0	The passengers and sailors on the yacht were watching all the animal’s movements with the liveliest interest.
0	The water-hole was frozen over; I hadn't a drop of water.
0	In such a case it would just as certainly fall back to the Earth, in obedience to the law of Terrestrial attraction.
0	The Rector had no notion of practicing the usual cordial and antique hospitality.
0	And in this matter I do not think your impertinent orderly will venture to put Montmartre into the comparison.
0	An immediate change was the result; the petitions the natives were going to address to the Russians were converted into shouts and enthusiastic demonstrations of delight, some rushing forwards to welcome their friend, others running over to announce his arrival to their fellow-countrymen.
0	At the foot of the pylone stood a miserable shed, its shutters tightly closed.
0	The first attempts were somewhat crude, but in consequence of the cleverness and intelligence of the workmen, by consulting, and recalling the models which they had seen, and by emulating each other, the possessions of the colony were soon increased by several baskets of different sizes.
0	Occupation was not wanting to the colonists, for without reckoning their out-door cares, they had always a thousand plans for the fitting up of Granite House.
0	John Mangles, before his friends trusted themselves to this flax rope, tried it; he did not think it very strong; and it was of importance not to risk themselves imprudently, as a fall would be fatal.
0	Did he really see all this?
0	"Gratian," cried West, calling one of the sailors, "take the helm; and you, Hearne, go down into the hold."
0	What had he really gained by all this trouble?
0	The ten travelers pressed closer round Tom Austin, devouring him with their eyes.
0	What do you mean?” “From my little tartan yonder, I saw the yawl go out from the rock here on a journey, and I saw it come back, and it brought a stranger; and I thought--I thought--I thought--” “Well, you thought--what did you think?” “Why, that perhaps the stranger had come from the northern shores of the Mediterranean, and that I might ask him--” He paused again, and gave a glance at the captain.
0	Of course, it took seven pounds of coffee to do this.
0	According to the advice of the Observatory of Cambridge, the gun must be fired perpendicularly to the plane of the horizon, that is to say, toward the zenith.
0	Upon his arrival in England this Tahitian was presented to the king by Earl Sandwich, first lord of the Admiralty.
0	The crater of Cantal in central France is only about six miles in width; the famous valley in Ceylon, called the _Crater_, though not at all due to volcanic action, is 44 miles across and is considered to be the greatest in the world.
0	During the month of February, no event of any importance occurred.
0	Yes, indeed, it will take all the smartness of the good fellow who now drinks to your health, regretting that you don't return the compliment!"
0	"Making believe not to see me approach, he remained stationary in the entry of his house.
0	Sometimes they gave vent to a convulsive laugh, but by no chance did they smile.
0	Between the door and the rose, just as Scholastique had said, a maxim, relative to the employment of every moment of the day, appeared on a copper plate.
0	It was the Ape Gigans, the antediluvian gorilla.
0	A large quantity of dry fodder was discovered lying heaped up in the RAMADA, and this supplied them amply with both food and bedding.
0	had exclaimed the little Midshipman, and the cry had thrilled every heart on board as with an electric shock.
0	A boat was lowered, and Captain Len Guy got into it, with the boatswain, four sailors at the oars, and one at the helm.
0	The sky was cloudless; the wind, almost imperceptible, was north-east.
0	Man is wholly the sport of the changes of the weather, which alternates between intense cold and severe storms with savage relentlessness.
0	It was folded and fastened to Top's collar in a conspicuous position.
0	“Out with it, I say!” cried Servadac.
0	Many learned men belonging to various scientific bodies, and noteworthy among others, Messrs. Milne-Edwards and De Quatrefages, took the affair very much to heart, demonstrated the incontestable authenticity of the bone in question, and became--to use the phrase then recognized in England--the most ardent supporters of the "jawbone question."
0	Michael remained silent all the evening.
0	A.D. Kingston, 1881; The Giant Raft, W.J.
0	My uncle at once ordered me to turn my steps that way, and accordingly we went on board the steam ferry boat which does duty on the canal, and very soon reached the noted dockyard quay.
0	"Yes," answered the doctor; "we can only have one shot, and we must not miss; if he were to run away, he would be lost, for he can run faster than a hare."
0	“Because out of all our horses only the one your blacksmith had in his hands has escaped the common fate.” “That’s true,” said John Mangles.
0	The temperature remained at an average of sixteen degrees below zero.
0	But from such unprofessional travellers no trustworthy scientific details could be expected.
0	"Suppose some obstacle, for the sake of argument," said Ardan.
0	"We will set off to-morrow at daybreak," said Pencroft to his two companions, as about two o'clock they were resting for a few minutes under the shade of a clump of firs.
0	“But have we great resources?” inquired the Major.
0	Then we felt more keenly than before the dangers which threaten every expedition to the Antarctic zone.
0	Every native here fêted the new-comers, some by their silence--like the queen forbidden by etiquette to answer the speeches made to her--some by their dances, cries, and songs, in which the name of Totabou (Kotzebue) was constantly repeated.
0	He took no interest in the meteorological phenomena which kept the doctor in a constant state of admiration.
0	The Governor caused the _Concorde_ to be seized, and arrested her officers and sailors, whom he sent off to Holland, there to be tried.
0	After this sad affair Béthencourt left Gran Canaria and went to try to subdue Palma.
0	James Starr and his companions now felt perfectly happy.
0	The beds of water farthest from the trench, that were not warmed by the men's work, showed a tendency to solidification.
0	Lyons, Prince Henry the Navigator.
0	It is difficult to praise Forster's disinterestedness under these circumstances too highly.
0	The Canadian might have said still less.
0	We saw some black monkeys with red beards.
0	“With you for a guide I can still act.
0	The apprehensions of Jolivet and Blount may be better understood than described.
0	What happened when the terrible shock took place, when the raft was cast upon the rocky shore, it would be impossible for me now to say.
0	What people can have constructed works such as these, which denote a civilization greatly in advance of that of the Indians, is a difficult problem of which no solution has yet been found.
0	The crevices had undergone no alteration; the carburetted hydrogen still filtered through, though in a small stream, which was no doubt because it had had a free passage since the day before.
0	In that spot he calculated with the assistance of Cassini's Tables, and with an exactitude never before obtained, the difference between the longitudes of Paris and Uraniborg.
0	"And the doctor, Dominique Custos?"
0	Parties of holiday-makers were moving about in all directions.
0	Yet, I did not recognise in him a fellow-countryman.
0	“Thaouka scents an enemy,” he said to himself, going toward the opening, to make careful survey of the plains.
0	On the other hand, the representatives of the ovine and bovine races were to be counted by tens of thousands.
0	The necessity for careening the ship, that it might be thoroughly examined, and the copper sheathing repaired, led to a much longer stay in this port than Freycinet had calculated upon; but our travellers found no cause to regret the delay, for the society of Port Louis fully sustained its old reputation for generous hospitality.
0	The fire had actually been seen!
0	Motion under such conditions is "felt" no more than repose; and when a body is in repose it will remain so as long as no strange force displaces it; if moving, it will not stop unless an obstacle comes in its way.
0	The OMBU produced no fruit, though fortunately, it would likely abound in fresh eggs, thanks to the numerous nests stowed away among the leaves, not to speak of their feathered proprietors.
0	Perhaps it might be even better to conduct the vessel to Port Balloon, that is to say, as far as possible from the center of eruption, for at the mouth of the Mercy, between the islet and the wall of granite, it would run the risk of being crushed in the event of any convulsion.
0	Then having attended to her spiritual wants, he bethought himself of her bodily needs, and offered her some European delicacies.
0	But, once out of Europe, he had to depend alone on the power of his roubles.
0	The doctor answered these despairing words by incessant cares; although worn out by the fatigue of the day, he spent the night in composing a soothing potion for his patient; but the lime-juice was ineffectual, and continual friction could not keep down the progress of the scurvy.
0	"Now _m_ prime over _m_, that is the ratio of the Moon's mass to that of the Earth is about the 1/81.
0	The following day, the master was sent in search of an easier landing-place, with orders to propitiate the natives, if possible, by presents.
0	Had his design really been to blow up the brig, as Bob Harvey had thought?
0	Cyrus Harding advised them to be very careful, as the forest probably enclosed many dangerous beasts.
0	He found the mercury entirely frozen in the bulb.
0	“A joyful sight, gentlemen!” he exclaimed.
0	In return for the trifling presents which were made to him and his wife, he vouchsafed marks of goodwill in the shape of slight pats on the cheek, the shoulder, or the thigh.
0	Once more I began to lose all hope.
0	Certainly I was sure of this devoted boy.
0	His hand trembled, as he grasped an imaginary harpoon.
0	"Today you are far too weak.
0	The leading guide takes care to trace them at an angle of thirty degrees, when there is fresh snow, to avoid the avalanches.
0	Neither did they care to capture many of the graceful dolphins which played about in hundreds, striking with their tails the planks of the raft, gamboling at the bow and stern, and making the water alive with colored reflections and spurts of spray, which the refracted light converted into so many rainbows.
0	"Now, my boys," Ardan went on, "all things thus turning out quite comfortable, I would just ask you why we should not succeed?
0	A little further on, more than eight hundred cod, which were at once salted, were caught, and an immense quantity of oysters with superb mother of pearl were also obtained.
0	The trunk of some ficus or mimosa was never covered by a more startlingly tropical attire.
0	They had therefore to make use of the oars, Herbert and Neb each took one, and Pencroft took the scull.
0	This expedition cost him only forty-two francs, a very paltry sum in comparison with the price involved in the smallest attempt at an African journey in our own day; but we must not forget that Burckhardt was content to live upon millet-seed, and that his entire _cortége_ consisted of two dromedaries.
0	On the other side, prudence bids us profit by the first opportunity to leave the Nautilus."
0	So saying, he paid another visit to the upper portion of the Projectile and remained there awhile whistling _Malbrouk_, whilst his companions amused themselves in looking through the floor window.
0	“Half of the time she is stranded on the sand, and that works her.

0	But at the same moment a flock of birds of prey, which skimmed along the surface of the stream, pounced on the floating body.
0	A delightful residence was made of the house; it was raised a story, surrounded by a veranda, and half hidden under beautiful trees--mimosas, fig-sycamores, bauhinias, and paullinias, whose trunks were invisible beneath a network of scarlet-flowered bromelias and passion-flowers.

0	All this volcanic commotion was confined till then in the envelope of the cone, because the safety valve of Tangariro was enough for its expansion; but when this new issue was afforded, it rushed forth fiercely, and by the laws of equilibrium, the other eruptions in the island must on that night have lost their usual intensity.

0	During the three next days, from the 15th to the 17th of January, all the monotonous incidents of the voyage were repeated; they advanced more slowly, and with much fatigue; their legs grew tired; the dogs dragged the sledge with difficulty; their diminished supply of food could not comfort men or beasts.

0	The voyage to the Cape, where the vessels arrived upon the 18th of January, 1792, was barren of incident, if we except the unusual quantity of bonitos, or tunny, and other fish that were met with, and a small leakage which occurred, but was quickly remedied.

0	It would be beyond our province to give an account of the ingenious deductions, the skilful guesses, and the patient groping through which Grotefend finally achieved the recognition of an alphabetic system of writing, and succeeded in separating from certain groups of words what he believed to be the names of Darius and Xerxes, thus attaining a knowledge of several letters, by means of which he made out other words.
0	Humanity had made great strides.
0	Lastly, the time had come for turning the balloon-case to use, by cutting it up to make shirts and other articles; for as to keeping it in its present form, and risking themselves in a balloon filled with gas, above a sea of the limits of which they had no idea, it was not to be thought of.
0	“Well said, Neb!” cried Pencroft, with a shout of laughter; “and you’ll undertake the job, no doubt?” Cyrus Harding attentively observed the dense smoke emitted by Mount Franklin, and even listened, as if expecting to hear some distant muttering.

0	The greater part of these animals were killed in the part of the forest on the left bank of the Mercy, to which they gave the name of Jacamar Wood, in remembrance of the bird which Pencroft and Herbert had pursued when on their first exploration.
0	The unfortunate Frenchman was but twenty-six years of age.” “And France has never avenged so hideous a crime?” said Kennedy.

0	Besides, if Michael Strogoff had already become attached to his horse, the horse himself seemed to become inured, by degrees, to the fatigue of such a journey, and provided that he got several hours of repose daily, his rider might hope that he would carry him beyond the invaded provinces.

0	“Good!” said Michael Strogoff, to himself; “if these gipsies do not wish to be understood when they speak before me, they had better use some other language.” From his Siberian origin, and because he had passed his childhood in the Steppes, Michael Strogoff, it has been said, understood almost all the languages in usage from Tartary to the Sea of Ice.

0	In the course of the few minutes’ conversation which Ben Zoof had held with him, he had mentioned that he knew that the whole soil of Gallia was made of gold; but the old man, guessing that the orderly was only laughing at him as usual, paid no attention to the remark, and only meditated upon the means he could devise to get every bit of the money in the new world into his own possession.

0	For a long time D'Urville had wished to explore the Strait of Magellan, not with a view to further hydrographical surveys, for the careful explorations of Captain King, begun in 1826, had been finished in 1834 by Fitzroy, leaving little to be done in that direction, but to gather the rich and still unappropriated harvest of facts relating to natural history.

0	However, Cyrus Harding, after having discussed the pros and cons of the question, ended by saying,-- “In short, would you like to know my opinion, my dear Spilett?” “Yes, Cyrus.” “Well, then, it is this: however minutely we explore the island, we shall find nothing.” The next day Pencroft set to work.
0	I know how it is worked.
0	There was no fear of the brig being carried away by the sea, for she was already fixed as firmly as if moored by her anchors.

0	This was an intense cold, which soon covered the inside of the glass of the scuttles with a thick coating of ice.
0	"Be patient, Pencroft," replied the engineer.
0	Now, if he had appeared on board when we set sail, and every one had known where we were going, he might have been embarrassed."

0	Tasman, upon seeing these pacific dispositions, despatched a boat for the purpose of obtaining a more accurate knowledge of the shore.
0	This makes more sense since the previous temperature cited, from which it had fallen, was 6 degrees above zero.
0	Hitherto, for the last few days, the thermometer had been registering an average of about 6 degrees below zero, and it had become matter of experience that the stove, although replenished with all the wood that was available, was altogether inadequate to effect any sensible mitigation of the severity of the cold.
0	Beyond the village, Nadia sank down on a stone bench.

0	He stepped toward the seat that had been prepared for him on his presentation, and then, standing erect and motionless, he, with a determined glance, pointed his right forefinger upward, and pronounced aloud the single word-- “Excelsior!” Never had one of Bright’s or Cobden’s sudden onslaughts, never had one of Palmerston’s abrupt demands for funds to plate the rocks of the English coast with iron, made such a sensation.
0	So, if you have no objection, assemble your friends, colleagues, the whole town, all Florida, all America if you like, and to-morrow I shall be ready to explain my plans and answer any objections whatever that may be advanced.

0	There is a peculiarly inky flavor about it, which is by no means disagreeable.
0	“Take my arm,” replied the gallant geographer.
0	Marco Polo gives some interesting details of the customs of the natives, one is that when a king dies, the nobles throw themselves into the fire in his honour; another strange custom is that of the religious purifications twice every day, and their blind faith in astrologers and diviners; he also speaks of the frequency of religious suicides, and the sacrifice of widows whom the funeral pile awaits on the death of their husbands.
0	They obtained the most curious information from him with regard to the expeditions which the king of Portugal had despatched to the Cape of Good Hope, to the Rio de la Plata and to the Moluccas; but from various circumstances these latter expeditions had not been able to take place.
0	The watch, telescope, and thermometer, which he naively called a "heat watch," especially delighted him; but he wondered more at his visitor than at any of his gifts.
0	“Don’t let me keep you then.” “Tell me, Jack,” said Harry, “what was taking you to our cottage to-day?” “I wanted to see you, man,” replied Jack, “and ask you to come to the Irvine games.

0	“Every man, according to his temperament, can choose his own climate, which will be invariable!” Those modern Titans, the North Polar Practical Association, were going to effect a complete change in the state of things which had existed ever since the spheroid had been launched on its orbit to become the Earth as we know it.
0	"Probably," answered the doctor, "for here is an answer addressed to the committee:-- "'Gentlemen: I am a widow, twenty-six years old, and I can produce warm testimonials as to my morals and talents.
0	This was the opinion of all, and the reporter, going to the telegraphic apparatus which placed the corral in communication with Granite House, sent this telegram:--"Come with all possible speed."
0	"And what are six hundred miles," said the doctor, briskly, "when it is proved that a Cossack, Alexis Markoff, went along the frozen sea, north of Russia, on sledges drawn by dogs, for a distance of eight hundred miles, in twenty-four days?"
0	Although the bridges over the Mercy were raised, the convicts would not be stopped by a river or a stream, and, rendered desperate, these wretches would be capable of anything.
0	A comfortable armchair had been reserved for Mrs. Scorbitt, as was only right, considering that she was the chief proprietor of the Polar freehold; and there were a number of other lady shareholders belonging to all classes of the city, whose bright bonnets, and hats, and feathers, and ribbons, were a welcome relief to the black coats of the noisy men that crowded under the glazed cupola of the hall.
0	In the first place, then, in the hinder part of the jangada they built the master’s house.
0	A leak sprang in the hold, and could not be stopped.
0	Benito and his companions soon left the last houses of the town behind, and followed the bank, making a slight detour so as not to be observed from the jangada.
0	He found himself, then, about twenty-four hours behind-hand, thirty-five days after leaving London.
0	At the first port we touch at, you will be given up into the hands of the English authorities.” “That is what I demand,” was the quartermaster’s reply.
0	I know it, for I know the true culprit, and I am in a position to prove your innocence.” “And the unhappy man who committed the crime?” “Is dead.” “Dead!” exclaimed Joam Garral; and the word made him turn pale, in spite of himself, as if it had deprived him of all power of reinstatement.
0	The whole day passed in fruitless research; the bed of the sea was a desert.
0	James Starr examined, as well as the insufficient light would permit, the sides of the dark shaft, which were covered by a partly rotten lining of wood.
0	"Certainly, Mr Spilett," answered the sailor, "and there is no fear of my doing so again.

0	As to whether or not Nell had lived alone in the recesses of New Aberfoyle, James Starr was obliged to remain uncertain; indeed, any allusion to the subject excited evident alarm in the mind of this strange girl.

0	There, guessing what had been done at Krasnoiarsk by order of the Czar, and to facilitate the passage of the river to the Emir’s troops, this column had launched a flotilla of boats, which would enable Feofar to cross and resume the road to Irkutsk.
0	He was a good-sized animal, being nearly fifteen feet long from his muzzle to the end of his tail, and he would certainly furnish many barrels of oil.
0	Then Ayrton, approaching the engineer, said simply, “Where should this coffer be deposited?” It was the coffer which Ayrton had saved at the risk of his life, at the very instant that the island had been engulfed, and which he now faithfully handed to the engineer.
0	They had to occupy profitably these hours of leisure.
0	He would only have to descend the river for about fifty miles, to the mouth of the Madeira, a tributary coming in on the right, and there he was almost sure to meet the head of these _“capitaes do mato,”_ to which Torres belonged.
0	Laing had now spent three months in Soolimana, and had made many excursions.

0	<i>I will go on alone.</i>" "You ask us to leave you?"
0	Do you not think me sometimes subject to dangerous folly?
0	This sort of supply left no doubt as to the length of the cruise; but an experienced observer would have known at once that the _Forward_ was to sail in polar waters, from the barrels of lime-juice, of lime lozenges, of bundles of mustard, sorrel, and of cochlearia,--in a word, from the abundance of powerful antiscorbutics, which are so necessary in journeys in the regions of the far north and south.

0	But after what he had just seen, Joe determined to be more circumspect for the future; and, taking his bearings by the sun, he set off afoot toward the northeast, avoiding with the utmost care cabins, huts, hovels, and dens of every description, that might serve in any manner as a shelter for human beings.

0	The same measures were necessary each time they fetched water.
0	“We want to know whether, as the days are only six hours long, we are to have but two meals instead of four?” The officers looked at each other, and by their glances agreed that the corporal was a man of sound common sense.
0	"I have visited it several times."
0	The loss of his telescope had doubtless a great deal to do with his ill-humor; but the captain drew the most favorable conclusions from Rosette’s continued irritation.
0	Gerande hastened to her father's aid.
0	They were not, any more than Sparrman's, actual journeys of discovery; and we owe the acquisition of no new geographical fact to Thunberg.

0	This decision, which Richard Lander tried in vain to shake, plunged the brothers into the depths of despair, a state of mind soon succeeded by an apathy and indifference so complete that they could not have made the faintest effort to recover their liberty.
0	The best arrangement of the first kind was certainly Barbican's water-contrivance for counteracting the shock at starting, which has been so fully described in our former volume.
0	"You begin to see the possibility--I should say the success--of this attempt.

0	But a tear, falling from his eyes, froze on his pale cheek.
0	But Barbicane had furnished himself with a spirit thermometer on Wafferdin's system, which gives the minima of excessively low temperatures.
0	Altamont's priority appears to me incontestable.

0	And as to his √, the root of a quantity or of a number, it was really a triumph, and when he completed the horizontal bar in this style it seemed as if the indicatory vinculum would shoot clean off the blackboard and menace the world with inclusion within the maniacal equation.
0	The contraction of the terrestrial scaffolding, when it suddenly cooled, had been evidently the cause.
0	Patterson was the second officer of the _Jane_, the mate of that schooner which had picked up Arthur Pym and Dirk Peters on the wreck of the _Grampus_, the _Jane_ having reached Tsalal Island; the _Jane_ which was attacked by natives and blown up in the midst of those waters.

0	They set out on Easter-day with two guides; but having lived upon nothing but millet, water, and salt, the travellers were but little fit for a journey; nevertheless their guides obliged them to travel very quickly, changing horses five or six times in a day.
0	It was better to trust to his own brave steed, which had already rendered him such important service.
0	"Yes, Dr. Clawbonny," answered Johnson, "something has told them it was time to go, and they are off."

0	Jean Cornbutte obtained these at a low price, and they were certain to become most useful.
0	During his absence, the natives did all in their power to induce Labbé to land, pointing out to him the abundant cocoa-nut and other fruit trees, and even attempting to possess themselves of the boat-hook.

0	The captain stamped and stamped again with mingled vexation, agitation, and bewilderment.
0	May I be excused for saying that I was forty years old?
0	The garrison of Omsk, reduced to two thousand men, resisted valiantly.
0	A strip of stuff, artistically arranged and fringed, covered them from the waist to the heels.
0	"Friend Michael," answered Barbican, with a quiet smile, "you appear to forget that the 5/6 of the surface of our Earth is water.
0	"We ought to suppose so," continued the American, "for this open sea which Captains Penny and Belcher saw near the coast of Grinnell Land was seen by Morton, Kane's lieutenant, in the straits which are named after that bold explorer."
0	I took the height of the sun at the meridian every day, and I noted its amplitude at its rising and setting, wherever I went."
0	The platform was only three feet out of water.
0	"Something about sixty years," replied Penellan.
0	They are the most ill-treated brutes in all creation.
0	That terrible avenger, a perfect archangel of hatred, was still looking.
0	"I think you are right; still, men get accustomed to everything, and these Greenlanders appear to me better off than the workingmen of our large cities; they may be unfortunate, but they are not miserable.
0	He was still incessantly at work, but now on other calculations, which he only left to spend an occasional evening with Mrs. Scorbitt at New Park.
0	But they are going to throw it overboard!
0	The cetacean, having entered far into Union Bay, made rapid furrows across it from Mandible Cape to Claw Cape, propelled by its enormously powerful flukes, on which it supported itself, and making its way through the water at the rate little short of twelve knots.
0	But, Toline, I should like to know your opinion of Europe, or rather your professor’s.” “Europe?” said Toline not at all understanding Paganel’s excitement.
0	Each stomach was transformed into a gulf, and it became necessary to fill this gulf by the most energetic means.
0	The boat from the DUNCAN was now fast approaching, and in another minute had glided into a narrow channel between the sand-banks, and run ashore.
0	The letters and narratives of Columbus and his companions, especially those dwelling upon the large quantity of gold and pearls found in the recently discovered countries, had inflamed the imagination of eager traders, and of numbers of gentlemen who loved adventure.
0	The corral is only a storehouse to them, and not a definitive encampment.” “I am of Cyrus’ opinion,” said the reporter, “and I think that it is among the spurs of Mount Franklin that the convicts will have made their lair.” “Then, captain, straight to the corral!” cried Pencroft.
0	Not a single word, or part of a word, French, English or German, could apply to this group in the Indian Ocean.
0	said the poor cacique, "I do not wish to go to any place where I should meet a single man of that accursed race."
0	He instructed Passepartout to remain at the hotel until his return, that Aouda might not be left entirely alone.
0	Endowed doubtless with sight which enabled him to pierce the obscurity, he was always in the thick of the fight, uttering from time to time a sharp hissing sound, which was with him the sign of great rejoicing.
0	Of the bread, madeira, and beef offered to them, the natives would taste nothing but the meat; and of the many objects shown to them, they liked pieces of iron and looking-glasses best, amusing themselves with making grimaces in the latter of such absurdity as to keep the crew in fits of laughter.
0	"You need not threaten," retorted Pen, brutally, "we are not going any farther."
0	"Forty seconds," said my uncle.
0	He was anxious to pay me the same attention, but I drew back.
0	"Is there nothing to try?"
0	The last heights were soon crossed, and then the expedition descended the slopes overlooking the Pacific.
0	Thus the time passed in never-ending conversations all about the moon.
0	Upon this imaginary creature rested the responsibility of all these shipwrecks, which unfortunately were considerable; for of three thousand ships whose loss was annually recorded at Lloyd's, the number of sailing and steam-ships supposed to be totally lost, from the absence of all news, amounted to not less than two hundred!
0	But when Narvaez heard of what was going on, he determined not to leave his troops any longer exposed to temptation; he set a price upon the heads of Cortès and his principal officers, and advanced to the encounter.
0	What she suffered through the long hours it would be impossible to describe.
0	On this day the engineer came on deck, went up to Mr. Fogg, and began to speak earnestly with him.
0	From Quito the travellers went to the Amazon by way of Lactacunga, Ambato and Rio-Bamba situated in the province laid waste by the earthquake of 1797, when 40,000 inhabitants were swallowed up by water and mud.
0	These words had hardly been exchanged between the engineer and his two companions when a body leapt over the palisade and fell on the ground inside the corral.
0	Fragoso, kneeling down in the pirogue, had already begun to undo the clothes of the drowned man, which came away in fragments.
0	The moon advanced upward in a heaven of the purest clearness, outshining in her passage the twinkling light of the stars.
0	They were not less excited than the rest of the population, and they ended by quarrelling as violently as the burgomaster and the counsellor.
0	This scene lasted but a few seconds:  the shark returned, and, turning on his back, prepared himself for cutting the Indian in two, when I saw Captain Nemo rise suddenly, and then, dagger in hand, walk straight to the monster, ready to fight face to face with him.
0	“Do you not see, then,” continued the astronomer, “that if a Gallian month is twice as long as a terrestrial month, and a Gallian day is only half as long as a terrestrial day, there must be a hundred and twenty days in every month?” “No doubt you are right, professor,” said Count Timascheff; “but do you not think that the use of a new calendar such as this would practically be very troublesome?” “Not at all!
0	I’m not in my senses.
0	Yes, my friends, I believe that water will one day be employed as fuel, that hydrogen and oxygen which constitute it, used singly or together, will furnish an inexhaustible source of heat and light, of an intensity of which coal is not capable.
0	Happily, we were able to illumine our progress by means of the Ruhmkorff apparatus.
0	“We will make our way back at once,” replied Captain Servadac.
0	Glenarvan, repulsing McNabbs, was already on the track, when at three hundred paces from the wagon they heard the exclamation: “Help!
0	Then, with the cunning for which he was noted, without dwelling too much on it at first, he spoke of the gravity of the situation, exaggerating the success of the Tartars and the numbers of the barbarian forces, as he had when speaking to the Grand Duke.
0	They then searched between decks, and then the hold.
0	He must have travelled everywhere, at least in the spirit.
0	Perhaps at the last attempt the influence of this amiable lady might be successful.
0	But it was even a greater excitement when, darting wildly over this mass of organic dust, he caught up a naked skull and addressed me in a quivering voice: "Harry, my boy--Harry--this is a human head!"
0	Now, with the given rapidity, the projectile will have traversed this in five seconds, and the period is too brief for the resistance of the medium to be regarded otherwise than as insignificant.
0	In the midst worked a wheel, placed vertically, and caught to the tiller-rope, which ran to the back of the Nautilus.
0	Now, at the time when the events related in this story took place, some of the most important mines of the Scottish coal beds had been exhausted by too rapid working.
0	This hole filled, he heaped a pile of fagots on it a foot in height, and set fire to it.
0	This done, he had no wish to return to the City of Constantinople, and intending to breakfast on the bank of the Volga near the wharf, he settled his bill and left the inn.
0	Once more had Joam spoken encouraging words to them.
0	But the cetacean grew warm itself, no doubt; for without straining itself, it What a pursuit!
0	Tom Austin!” the lad shouted.
0	Whilst the engineer thought, his eyes fell on Top, who, going backwards and forwards, seemed to say-- "Am not I here?"
0	More than one, in digging underneath the wheel, was dangerously injured by the splinters of stone.
0	If he was alive, where was he?
0	He delighted every one by his good humour, gaiety, and friendly demonstrations.
0	The captain, however, had his own special object in view, and would not be diverted.
0	What was to be done?
0	At 10 46' 40'', precisely, Murphy will send the electric current into the gun-cotton.
0	Burckhardt having watched his guide commence this operation, began quietly to imitate him, and then said, "Here is thy grave; as we are brothers, it is but fair that we should be buried together."
0	The Nautilus remained on the surface of the ocean.
0	Circulation was impeded, and everywhere disputes, discussions, and financial transactions were going on.
0	There was not a trace of Ayrton.
0	"With the increasing consumption of coal," replied Gideon Spilett, "it can be foreseen that the hundred thousand workmen will soon become two hundred thousand, and that the rate of extraction will be doubled."
0	They also took some dozen of Nile ducks, a wild bird of high flavour, its throat and upper part of the head white with black spots.
0	His regular features, his deep blue eyes, his curly hair, rather chestnut than fair, the natural grace of his person, altogether made him a fine specimen of a lowlander.
0	At the time we speak of the Indians of Iquitos went about in almost a state of nudity.
0	This time the veritable land of spices had been reached, it now only remained to found establishments there and to take possession of it definitely, which was not likely to be long postponed.
0	If we are both of us standing, you will walk one way and I shall walk the other, and the room will be too narrow to hold us.” Manoel sat down and repeated his question.
0	“Well,” said the doctor, “nothing remains for us but to make signals; take the flag, Kennedy, and show them our colors.” It seemed that the travellers by the other balloon had just the same idea, at the same moment, for the same kind of flag repeated precisely the same salute with a hand that moved in just the same manner.
0	"My ideas generally are of that category," observed Ardan with an affectation of dry pomposity.
0	The journey from Tomsk had taken eight days.
0	Now I began to understand the cause of the strange silence which prevailed when last I tried if any appeal from my companions might perchance reach my ear.
0	He was in fact one of those practical men to whom is due the prosperity of England.
0	Yes, these men were worthy to reconcile Captain Nemo with that humanity which they represented so nobly in the island.
0	All at once he began to show a remarkable interest in the Jew and his affairs, paying several visits to the dark little storehouse, making inquiries as to the state of business and expressing some solicitude about the state of the exchequer.
0	A lake of medium extent stretched away before him, surrounded by an amphitheatre of hills, which yet could not be dignified with the name of mountains.

0	"But there is another serious difference between the two sides," said Barbican, "in addition to those enumerated.
0	He must have been attacked two miles off.
0	if Raphael had seen us thus, what an `Assumption' he would have thrown upon canvas!"
0	The Esperance and the Recherche passed before Vanikoro without stopping there, and, in fact, this voyage was most disastrous, as it cost D'Entrecasteaux his life, and those of two of his lieutenants, besides several of his crew.
0	The doctor very attentively examined the phenomenon.
0	But my uncle sternly opposed this wild project.
0	"In point of fact," replied Ardan, "this is your chief, if not your _only_ argument; and a really scientific man might be puzzled to answer it.
0	As it happened, there was a large sloop belonging to the ship; if the sides were raised, and a deck added, it might be possible to reach Monte Video, and there obtain the assistance of a vessel capable of bringing off in safety the members of the expedition and all the cargo worth preserving.
0	"I should be the most incredulous of men, captain, to doubt either fact, and my earnest desire is that the favour of Heaven may attend you and secure the safety of the shipwrecked mariners of the _Jane_."
0	"When I decided to bring you far away from the country which was so unsafe for you, I was rich, and counted on putting a portion of my fortune at your disposal; then your existence would have been free and happy.
0	The sick were taken on board without accident, and the encampment, reinforced and put on guard, was not molested.
0	It is not a skeleton, it is a complete and uninjured body, preserved with an anthropological object."
0	We live like the birds, we sing and fly about.
0	Aouda pathetically thanked her deliverers, rather with tears than words; her fine eyes interpreted her gratitude better than her lips.
0	It must be confessed that sometimes the ropes which fasten the concern together break, and whilst the hinder part remains stuck in some bog, the fore-part arrives at the post-house on two wheels; but this result is considered quite satisfactory.
0	The Emperor, however, was quite unable to send him any.
0	This bottom, inclined at an angle of 25 degrees, allowed the metal to flow into the receiving troughs; and the 1,200 converging trenches carried the molten metal down to the central well.
0	You do not know how to look at the bright side of things.” “How, pray, are we to go on?” asked Blount.
0	Each looked at everything in his own light, and made notes of such incidents as occurred on the journey--few and but slightly varied--while they crossed the provinces of Western Siberia.
0	“I dare say this frail concern has made a long voyage, protected by this strong covering.” “But I want to know where from?” said Lady Glenarvan.
0	The exiles, till then mingled with the population, had behaved in such a way as to draw on themselves the attention of the Grand Duke.
0	"Forward, forward, my friends," shouted Simpson, eager for the chase; "the whale is ours."
0	There is only one thing I could fancy, and nobody here could get it for me.’ ‘What is it?’ asked the Jesuit.
0	The landing appearing easy, the captain determined to send an expedition on shore, which would bring back cocoa-nuts and other antiscorbutic fruits.
0	Cyrus Harding resolved then to try him, by transporting him to another scene, from that ocean which formerly his eyes had been accustomed to contemplate, to the border of the forest, which might perhaps recall those where so many years of his life had been passed!
0	Shortly before the detachment arrived, Passepartout and his companions had begun to struggle with their captors, three of whom the Frenchman had felled with his fists, when his master and the soldiers hastened up to their relief.
0	"At first," says Crozet, "they appeared formed of two islands; I took a sketch at a distance of eight leagues, and shortly afterwards we took them for two capes, imagining we could see in the far distance a stretch of land between them.
0	At this moment the engineer sent to inform the captain that steam was up and they could start, for which agreeable communication the captain thanked him.
0	D'Urville had intended to survey Tamnako, Kennedy, Nitendi, and the Solomon Islands, where he hoped to meet with traces of the survivors from the shipwreck of the _Boussole_ and the _Astrolabe_.
0	After going about two hundred miles, the travellers at last found themselves on one of those vast plains which extend to the Atlantic, and which nature has made so propitious for laying the iron road.
0	Mary Grant was to be present at the interview, for the influence of the young girl might be considerable, and Lady Helena would not lose any chance of success.
0	Upon his head he wore a large hat which dated from the period when Flanders was separated from Holland, so that this venerable masterpiece was at least forty years old.
0	J. ANDREWS, The telegram dropped from Glenarvan’s hands.
0	"But, sir," continued the Canadian, "in the Red Sea you allowed us to follow the dugong."
0	But these desperate efforts were vain; the iceberg, driven by a submarine current, moved rapidly towards the exit; the brig was still three cable-lengths distant, when the mountain, entering the vacant space like a wedge, joined itself to its companions, and closed the means of escape.
0	A deplorable mixture this of religion and profanity, too common unfortunately, in these times of mingled superstition and avarice.
0	“It was more than an engagement, your Highness,” answered Ogareff; “it was a battle.” “Twenty thousand Russians, from the frontier provinces and the government of Tobolsk, engaged with a hundred and fifty thousand Tartars, and, notwithstanding their courage, were overwhelmed.” “You lie!” exclaimed the Grand Duke, endeavoring in vain to curb his passion.
0	Along the huge bank the trunks were got into place according to their sizes and floating power, which of course had to be taken into account, as among these thick and heavy woods there were many whose specific gravity was but little below that of water.
0	No doubt a certain sentence has been written out and then jumbled up--some plan to which some figure is the clue.
0	"It is true," I answered; "your boat is at least a century before its time, perhaps an era.
0	"And no boat with which to reach England?"
0	One day, certain of these poor people, so numerous in America, came to call upon him, and requested permission to return with him to their native country.
0	The remainder is only a question of arithmetic, requiring merely the knowledge of the four rules."
0	Next day, the first ESTANCIAS of the Sierra Tandil came in sight.
0	For God's sake do not let yourself grow downhearted!
0	He was, besides being a jovial companion, a good workman.
0	"So, then," cried J. T. Maston, "our projectile need not be more than nine feet in diameter."
0	These he considered quite sufficient for all purposes, and certainly they considerably simplified his labors as an observer.
0	With their practical instinct, the Dutch had acquainted themselves with English navigation.
0	At length a time came when I ceased to recollect anything--when all was one awfull hideous, fantastic dream!
0	"I am not, but my master is.
0	Without including the thirteen Englishmen at Gibraltar, about whom he was not particularly disposed to give himself much concern at present, Servadac put down the names of the eight Russians, the two Frenchman, and the little Italian girl, eleven in all, as the entire list of the inhabitants of Gourbi Island.
0	In one important particular the present communication differed from those that had preceded it: it was written entirely in French, and exhibited none of the ecstatic exclamations in other languages that had been remarkable in the two former papers.
0	"It is a tempest," said he.
0	Of course it was the Major who suggested looking for him, and he was not far off, for about fifty paces from the RIO a man of very tall stature was seen standing motionless on the lowest crags at the foot of the mountain.
0	The reporter knelt down beside the motionless body, and placed his ear to the engineer’s chest, having first torn open his clothes.
0	When we have to work under the bottom of the Caledonian Canal, where will be the harm?” “Well said, Simon,” cried the engineer, who could not restrain a smile at the overman’s enthusiasm; “let us cut our trenches under the waters of the sea!
0	“What is it after all?
0	No; by a gesture he bade us crouch beside him in a deep fracture of the rock, his hand pointed to one part of the liquid mass, which I watched attentively.
0	Top accompanied him, and Gideon Spilett, his gun cocked, was ready for any emergency.
0	“Well, Herbert, now we only want the house.” The water of the river was limpid.
0	The steppe presents nothing to attract notice but the long line of the telegraph posts, their wires vibrating in the breeze like the strings of a harp.
0	Then, feeling somewhat refreshed, Cyrus Harding crossed his arms, and said,-- “So, my friends, you do not know yet whether fate has thrown us on an island, or on a continent?” “No, captain,” replied the boy.
0	But to the question whether a three-mast vessel, called the BRITANNIA, had gone ashore either on the Chilian or Araucanian coast, he gave a decided negative.
0	“The name of this creek, my friends?
0	Arrived at the foot of the hill, Pencroft, Spilett, and Herbert climbed it in a few minutes, and gazed anxiously round the horizon.
0	And with his long legs stretched out, and his great arms folded under his head, Michel slept in his turn.

0	They had only to sharpen it on a piece of sandstone, then to raise the edge on a finer stone.
0	At first there rose against this unusual measure a murmur of protestation, a cry of despair, but this was quickly suppressed by the presence of the Cossacks and agents of police.
0	On his way down the River Gila to its mouth, Pattie visited races then all but unknown, including the Yotans, Eiotaws, Papawans, Mokees, Umeas, Mohawas, and Nabahoes, with whom but very little intercourse had yet been held.
0	"Very watchful indeed, my friends," replied Harding; "and I beg you to confine your hunting excursions to the neighbourhood of Granite House."
0	All at once an idea struck him.
0	And that was why, when he found the error at the last moment, and had no time to reassure his fellow-men, he so calmly sipped his pleasant hot coffee while the spinal marrow was so unpleasantly cool in his fellow-men’s backs.
0	"The case is plain enough.
0	"Good day, Hans, good day," I replied, in as hearty a tone as I could assume, "and now, Uncle, that we are together, tell me where we are.
0	I trouble myself very little about it."
0	As to the mean depth of this part of the Pacific, I tell you it is only 4,000 yards."
0	"Jem," resumed Captain Len Guy, "we are making good way, and no doubt land will be signalled in a few hours.
0	We next find that he went southward to Arabia, and he calls it the Ethiopia of Asia, for he thought the southern parts of Arabia were the limits of human habitation.
0	And indeed, so confident was their air, they seemed to have no doubt as to the possibility of success in such an undertaking.
0	The head-dresses look like pyramids or sugar-loaves, two or three feet high.
0	Communication between Siberia and the empire was already extremely difficult.
0	Although the commercial project, which had been the chief aim of Clapperton's journey, had fallen through, owing to the jealousy of the Arabs, who opposed it in their fear that the opening of a new route might ruin their trade, a good deal of scientific information had rewarded the efforts of the English explorer.
0	And the two oars, plunging into the dark waters, urged the boat onwards.
0	The cannon-ball, gentlemen, to my mind, is the most magnificent manifestation of human power.
0	It is very likely that the king wished for time to prepare the present he intended to offer the strangers upon their leaving; and, accordingly, the day before the one fixed upon, the king begged Captains Cook and Clerke to accompany him to his residence.
0	"Why," responded Fix, a little embarrassed, "I don't know; perhaps--" "Ah, if you would only go on with us!
0	It was natural, then, that during this lucid interval, the old man's choice should fall on Aubert Thun.
0	It was an animal of strength and mettle, and Michael Strogoff, accomplished horseman as he was, could make good use of it.
0	But as we are making no progress, what is the use of keeping up the sail, which may be the cause of our perdition if the tempest should suddenly strike us without warning.
0	"Yes," said Jean Cornbutte; "and we must use every effort to strengthen the house in the interior."
0	The sea was less boisterous, since the wind came off land--a fortunate circumstance for the boat, which would suffer, owing to its small tonnage, by a heavy surge on the sea.
0	"One might as well say, living creatures which do not live," replied Michel.
0	But a learned man, a philosopher, is nothing if not a philosopher, when he keeps his ideas calm and collected; and certainly the Professor possessed this quality to perfection.
0	“Hurrah for the Sun!” shouted Donellan.
0	The time could not be far distant when ships’ sides and ordinary walls would fail to give an adequate protection from the severity of the cold that must be expected; the stock of fuel was too limited to keep up a permanent supply of heat in their present quarters, and consequently they must be driven to seek some other refuge, the internal temperature of which would at least be bearable.
0	“In conclusion, it is desirable to point out that all the inhabitants of the Earth are interested in unravelling the secret, for all are menaced by the proceedings of the Association.
0	The 5th of February we at last entered the Gulf of Aden, a perfect funnel introduced into the neck of Bab-el-mandeb, through which the Indian waters entered the Red Sea.
0	The Company, thoroughly satisfied with the manner in which Captain Christie and Lieutenant Pottinger had accomplished their embassy, resolved to confide to them a delicate and difficult mission.
0	M. N---- was also getting himself ready for the ascent.
0	If, on the one hand, we have to chastise crime, we have, on the other, an act of gratitude to perform."
0	On seeing these hailstones, some of which were the size of a pigeon's egg, Pencroft's first thought was that his cornfield was in serious danger.
0	"In this condition," he says, "the natives gather it for food.
0	"During that time, those who had remained with the boat saw a canoe coming towards them from a distance, containing eight men and as many women; to these our people made signs; but they on approaching, began to transpierce ours with their arrows, before they had time to cover themselves with their bucklers, so that one Spaniard was killed by a shaft aimed by a woman, who also transfixed another with a second arrow.
0	Happily some projections of the granite, forming regular steps, made the descent less perilous.
0	Their brains became cooler, and simmered down like a coffee-pot when taken away from the fire.
0	Thence he went a little to the south to visit Sining-foo, across a tract of country where grazed great wild oxen and the valuable species of goat which is called the "musk-bearer."
0	There was, however, one single individual alone in all the States of the Union who protested against the attempt of the Gun Club.
0	Certainly, the former savage of Tabor island could not be perplexed how to live in the forest, abounding in game, but was it not to be feared that he had resumed his habits, and that this freedom would revive in him his wild instincts?
0	It would have been difficult, in this miserable dress, to judge of either his size or face.
0	A keen observer of English customs relates that, being in one of the rooms of the Bank one day, he had the curiosity to examine a gold ingot weighing some seven or eight pounds.
0	There was nothing there, not an animal, not a human being; and yet Top continued to bark.
0	There was no one there.
0	Upon the 25th of June, 1806, Seetzen left Jerusalem, and returned to St. Jean d'Acre by sea.

0	To the left, they had no difficulty in distinguishing the ramparts of _Philolaus_, about 12,000 feet high, but though the crater had a diameter of nearly thirty miles, the black shadows prevented the slightest sign of its interior from being seen.
0	This bold step would have endangered the safety of the town, so Verdugo refrained from executing the order.
0	He worked away, without losing a moment, without taking a minute's rest, but always in a retired place.
0	The Marquesas are five in number, Magdalena, San Pedro, Dominica, Santa Cristina, and Hood Island, the latter so called after the volunteer who first discovered it.

0	"Because the instructions in this letter are formal; it tells me to give the captain's thanks to the crew; now, hitherto I have strictly obeyed his orders, in whatever way they have been given to me, and I cannot--" "Still--" interposed Johnson, who had a warrantable dread of the effect of such communications on the men's spirits.
0	They would run no risk here of catching a heavy cold, as they do in the damp streets of the old capital.” “I’m not the man to contradict you, Simon,” answered James Starr, glad to find the old man just as he used to be.
0	They had gone only seven hundred feet in thirty-seven minutes.
0	The flow was westward, and the ebb eastward, just the reverse of the case in Botany Bay.
0	For my part I prefer to be told one of those simple comparisons that I find in the old almanacs: The Sun is a globe two feet in diameter; _Jupiter_, a good sized orange; _Saturn_, a smaller orange; _Neptune_, a plum; _Uranus_, a good sized cherry; the Earth, a pea; _Venus_, also a pea but somewhat smaller; _Mars_, a large pin's head; _Mercury_, a mustard seed; _Juno_, _Ceres_, _Vesta_, _Pallas_, and the other asteroids so many grains of sand.
0	They hunted there, among the shingle, in the clefts of the rocks, but found nothing.
0	"Well," resumed the boatswain, "there can be no doubts about our condition!
0	The marriage of Minha afforded an excellent opportunity, it being so natural for them to accompany her to Belem, where she was going to live with her husband.
0	He was quite willing to start at daybreak, however, for they had to get to Lake Salinas before sundown.
0	He then landed with Messrs. Banks, Solander, and Green, soon found a favourable spot, and in presence of the natives immediately traced out the extent of land he intended to occupy.
0	[Illustration: Columbus named it the Vale of Paradise.]
0	A journey of six hundred miles under such circumstances is long, I confess, but not insuperable; we can, or rather we ought, to make twenty miles a day, which would bring us to the coast in a month, that is to say, towards March 26th."
0	Whether, for this reason, or for some other, Paganel did not connect any idea of further search with this proposition of reaching Auckland.
0	The scientific world of England was inclined to believe that one of its most distinguished members had positively disappeared.
0	As soon as a suitable position was found, the instruments were set up, and the usual physical and astronomical observations were made in conjunction with geographical researches.

0	They mended their worn-out, torn clothes, all soaked through and through by the snow; new moccasins and snow-shoes replaced those which were no longer serviceable.
0	A thermometer of the usual kind, as may be readily supposed, would be of no use whatever in the experiment that was now about to be made.
0	But we were obliged to fire at them during flight, which gave us few chances to bring them down; and, indeed, we vainly exhausted one half our ammunition.
0	My uncle was gay and lighthearted; he rubbed his hands, and assumed all sorts of attitudes.
0	He resolved only to take command of the brig at some critical juncture, and when his crew had gone too far to be able to retreat; he kept in reserve, as we have seen, the power of making generous offers to the men, so that they would follow him to the end of the world.
0	Even the _Herald_ Reporter seemed to have got enough of exploring.
0	"Pittonaccio, them wilt keep thy promise!"

0	In 1764 he was made naval engineer for Newfoundland and Labrador, and was employed for three consecutive years in hydrographical tasks, which obtained for him the notice of the ministry, and helped to correct innumerable errors in the maps of America.
0	"Let us go on shore," said the Professor, after some minutes of silence.
0	Consequently, the clubrooms became deserted, the servants dozed in the antechambers, the newspapers grew mouldy on the tables, sounds of snoring came from dark corners, and the members of the Gun Club, erstwhile so noisy in their seances, were reduced to silence by this disastrous peace and gave themselves up wholly to dreams of a Platonic kind of artillery.
0	We could not complain, and, indeed, the singularity of our fate reserved such wonderful compensation for us that we had no right to accuse it as yet.

0	North and south there have been changes, and the oceans have withdrawn from many localities they formerly occupied.
0	After having encountered the islands which Roggewein believed to be Cocoa and Traitor Islands, already visited by Schouten and Lemaire, and which Fleurieu, imagining them to be a Dutch discovery, named Roggewein Islands; after having caught sight of Tienhoven and Groningue Islands, which were believed by Pingré to be identical with Santa Cruz of Mendana, the expedition finally reached the coast of New Ireland.

0	They succeeded in measuring 1,905 different elevations, of which six exceed 15,000 feet, and twenty-two exceed 14,400 feet.
0	This expedition owed its formation to Professor Michälis, who was anxious to obtain information which would throw light on certain passages in the Bible, and its expenses were defrayed by the generosity of King Frederick V. of Denmark.
0	After the capture of Quebec, Cook passed on to the _Northumberland_, under command of Lord Colville, and profited by his stay on the shores of Newfoundland to devote himself to astronomy.
0	About ten the balloon anchored on the side of the Trembling Mountain, so called, because, in Arab tradition, it is said to tremble the instant that a Mussulman sets foot upon it.
0	This ill-advised economy resulted in the illnesses of the crew, and the discontent of many of the scientific staff.
0	Johnson and Bell hastened to the deck.
0	"And you would not be sorry to go back, for one day, to your trade of a fisherman and to add this cetacean to the list of those you have already killed?"
0	You see it?” “It is impossible!” “But it is a fact.
0	Paganel wondered whether he was to consider himself a prisoner or not.
0	An escort from the Sultan had met them at this port, and after a difficult journey of about 300 miles across this harassed region, obstructed by forests, cut up by streams, and chequered with marshes, they had reached the royal residence.
0	"Still, Captain," persisted Shandon, "facts are as contradictory--" "You're wrong, Shandon, you're wrong!"
0	"I do not say no," replied Pencroft, who had always the casting vote in maritime questions; "I do not say no, although it is not exactly the same thing to make a long as a short voyage!
0	The explanation given by President Barbicane was correct.
0	“Lay aside your rifle, Dick.” And the Scot obeyed the request at once.
0	Most of the women were rather good-looking, and they laughed and chattered merrily as they smoked their tobacco and “thang” in huge black pipes.
0	And this is the reason why these plants unite in the peaceful basin of the Atlantic.
0	asked Michel; "for I cannot believe that savants would ever be stranded for want of an explanation."
0	The doctor asked if it were proved that this current was felt throughout Baffin's Bay.
0	Their hearts had not deceived them.
0	"Because to give you that exact curve would be to solve a point in the 'Problem of the Three Bodies,' which Integral Calculus has not yet reached."
0	Labbé assumed the command, and took her back to Lorient on the 23rd of August, 1773.
0	It was serious, certainly, and to less brave men, it would have been security lost!
0	A man had dared to do--what?
0	The grass here was five or six feet in height, and had made room for swamp-plants, to which the dampness of the place, assisted by the heat of summer, had given giant proportions.
0	"I have the dollars," replied Nicholl, slapping the pocket of this coat.
0	It contained only a scrap of paper, yellowed by time, and apparently torn out of an old copy book.
0	In order to turn to account the winter season, Beechey visited San Francisco and cast anchor yet again off Honolulu in the Sandwich Islands.
0	We enjoyed as much liberty as if we had been in the country; and in the market and arsenal we found the same resources as in the best European ports."
0	In addition, it was proposed to disprove the assertion of the Hindus that the source of the Ganges is beyond the Himalayas, in Lake Manasarowar.
0	To those unacquainted with the group of facts on which it was based, the opinion of Starr and his friends could not fail to appear wholly inadmissible.
0	Only a touch of weakness, that’s all.
0	Sight the most unforeseen, and little adapted to gratify the eyes!
0	The other vessels, in an equally bad plight, were not long in regaining her.
0	It was so much work saved for the smiths, but the carpenters had much to do.
0	“And is it not evident, then, that at the moment of writing the words, the shipwrecked men were expecting to be made prisoners by the Indians?” “I take exception to that, my Lord,” said Paganel; “and even if your other conclusions are right, this, at least, seemed to me irrational.” “What do you mean?” asked Lady Helena, while all eyes were fixed on the geographer.
0	There she was broken up by the icebergs floated by the thaw, and the castaways were carried, with a part of the _débris_ of their cabin, on the southern shores of Shannon Island.
0	But, September 8, an impenetrable, continuous mass of ice lay between him and the north; the temperature fell to 10°.

0	Just as Jack Ryan laid his hand on the edge of the canoe, the old man, foiled in his purpose of revenge, cast himself headlong into the waters of the lake.
0	Representatives of the earth, of humanity, past and present, all centered in them!

0	Next day the direct progress of the _Dobryna_ was arrested by a long projection of land, which obliged her to turn southwards, until she reached what formerly would have been the southern extremity of Corsica.
0	The sultry air penetrated the depths of the coal mine, and elevated the temperature.
0	The adventurer took a step or two backward without replying.
0	At nine o’clock the three travellers got into their car.
0	Rubbing had re-established the circulation of the blood.
0	However, in time, the sails were adjusted by the five sailors, aided by the stimulus of the captain’s oaths.
0	It missed its aim; but the jackal, deeming it on the whole prudent to decamp, disappeared across the trees and hedges with a series of bounds, which could only be likened to those that might be made by an india-rubber kangaroo.
0	Then he set out again for England with an ambassador and his suite, sent by Ivan to Great Britain.
0	They wore necklaces, earrings, and gold and silver ornaments, which were scarcely in keeping with their coarse attire.
0	They thought they saw the dark forms of some wild animals prowling round the camp among the bushes, but the night passed without incident, and the next day, the 31st of October, at five o’clock in the morning, all were on foot, ready for a start.
0	Ned Land, on seeing them, showed evident repugnance to dress himself in one.
0	For have we not been half annihilated by the shock?
0	"Is there any truth in this hypothesis?"
0	There, to a certainty, in the depths of those rocks, was the dwelling so long sought for in vain.
0	During this interview Kai-Koumou smiled, but his eyes betrayed a deep-seated enmity.
0	These savages sitting motionless around the fire, suspected nothing of what was going on twenty feet off.
0	Both in form and color the animal was of perfect beauty.
0	They could soon all see the glittering specks not only becoming more and more numerous, but also gradually assuming the shape of an extremely slender, but extremely brilliant crescent.
0	Now, I repeat, the season being considered, that hour had not come, when the schooner cast anchor on the 6th of September at Ansiedling, in Falmouth Bay, precisely in the place indicated in Arthur Pym's narrative as the moorings of the _Jane_.
0	They were alone on the island.
0	On the 14th of the same month, in 33 degrees 23 minutes, the master's mate and the boatswain of the vessel landed upon a shore which formed the northern part of Spitzbergen.
0	"My friends," answered Shandon, evasively, "you will always find me devoted to you.
0	"Well said," replied Barbicane; "but if nothing had any weight, nothing would keep in its place, not even your hat on your head, worthy Michel; nor your house, whose stones only adhere by weight; nor a boat, whose stability on the waves is only caused by weight; not even the ocean, whose waves would no longer be equalized by terrestrial attraction; and lastly, not even the atmosphere, whose atoms, being no longer held in their places, would disperse in space!"
0	It was the _New York Herald_ that first published this curious farrago, and the innumerable patrons of Gordon Bennett read, on the morning of the 7th of November, the following advertisement, which rapidly spread through the scientific and industrial world, and became appreciated in very different ways:— “The regions of the North Pole situated within the eighty-fourth degree of north latitude have not yet been utilized, for the very good reason that they have not yet been discovered.
0	"Evidently," said Johnson, "the animal is within six feet of us."
0	No more lands lying fallow, no more impassable deserts, no more useless streams, no more unfathomable seas, no more inaccessible mountains!
0	Captain Furneaux arrived in Queen Charlotte's Sound on the 13th of November, 1773, and took in wood and water.
0	"There you are wrong, Pencroft," said the engineer; "these gigantic eucalypti, which shelter us, are good for something."
0	All of a sudden a light flashed upon me.
0	"Well," asked Bolton, "where is the ship going to?"
0	Although he was provided with a life-belt, one of the sailors, who could not swim, refused to jump into the sea to reach the boat.
0	His guides, very vigorous and skilful, were happily able to check him; but ours, feeling, with reason, that the whole party might be dragged down, wished to detach us from the rope.
0	The vast plain, a compact mass the evening before, was now separated in a thousand places, and the waves, raised by some submarine commotion, had broken the thick layer which sheltered them.
0	Once only, when her neighbor--the merchant who had jumbled together so imprudently in his remarks tallow and shawls--being asleep, and threatening her with his great head, which was swaying from one shoulder to the other, Michael Strogoff awoke him somewhat roughly, and made him understand that he must hold himself upright.
0	In spite of my efforts to keep my eyes open, they would close.
0	We concluded that we had come in contact with a whale or a grampus, and that our ship had apparently received no damage, which was true."

0	Finally Mauritius was reached by means of jury-masts."
0	"And now, M. Aronnax, our breakfast is ready.
0	"All right," said Mr. Fogg; and, turning to the others, he continued: "I have a deposit of twenty thousand at Baring's which I will willingly risk upon it."
0	The Angara being here very wide, it would not be possible to pass it under the fire of the besieged.
0	They have a pleasant expression, are superior to the Egyptians in courage and intelligence, and naturally inquisitive.
0	Of the convicts, the dangers which menaced Granite House, the ruins with which the plateau was covered, the colonists thought no longer.
0	Across these they were often whirled through immense forests of varied character, here dense enough to obscure the track, there swaying in the sweet sunlight and vocal with joyous birds of bright and gorgeous plumage.
0	I pulled the valve-cord, and the barometer began to ascend.
0	There was always something to be done.
0	It was settled that the name of Falls River should be given to this stream.

0	At any other time they would have travelled by night to avoid this inconvenience, but then there was no night.
0	The captain afterwards saw several other islands of this immense archipelago, which were similar to those he had left, especially the Pernicious Islands, where Roggewein had lost his sloop, the _African_, and to which Cook gave the name of Palliser Islands."
0	“Curses on it!” he yelled, in his madness, “it’s nothing but salt water!” Then, while Ferguson and Kennedy lay there motionless, the resistless longing came over him to drain the last few drops of water that had been kept in reserve.
0	"Yes," answered Hatteras, "three of his sailors were buried there, three fortunate men!"
0	When swollen by the addition of all the waters of the valley, the river, a little above the Falls, is 175 feet wide, but on entering the defile which appears to have been made by an earthquake, it is not more than forty feet in breadth.
0	“But, Captain Harding,” he added, “since I was imprisoned in that cavern, how is it that I find myself in the corral?” “How is it that the convicts are lying yonder dead, in the middle of the enclosure?” answered the engineer.
0	What passed during that night--how the boat escaped from the eddies of the maelstrom--how Ned Land, Conseil, and myself ever came out of the gulf, I cannot tell.
0	Scarcely had he doubled the peak, when he found that the coast described the arc of a circle.
0	There was a slight report; and a little red flame, rather blue at its outline, flickered over the rock like a Will-o’-the-Wisp.
0	It was decided that they should wait till they came to Twofold Bay.
0	In fact, eruptions are not unfrequently accompanied by earthquakes; and an island of the nature of Lincoln Island formed of substances so varied, basalt on one side, granite on the other, lava on the north, rich soil on the south, substances which consequently could not be firmly attached to each other, would be exposed to the risk of disintegration.
0	Horror-struck, Denham let slip the branch, and tumbled headlong into the water, but fortunately the shock revived him, he struck out almost unconsciously, swam to the opposite bank, and climbing it, found himself safe from his pursuers.
0	A humorous reply appeared in the February number of the Bulletins de la Societe Geographique of Geneva, which very wittily showed up the Royal Society of London and their phenomenal sturgeon.
0	It was about half-past two, and, not feeling well, I gone to my cabin, where the side window was open, that at the back was closed.
0	an idea occurs to me, Mr. Spilett," replied Herbert.
0	The man was alone; it was Johnson.
0	That they dragged him away living, since he has resisted.
0	I made it a point to agree with the Professor in everything; but I envied the perfect indifference of Hans, who, without taking any such trouble about the cause and effect, went blindly onwards wherever destiny chose to lead him.
0	The first improvement which the English marine owed to Cabot was the sheathing of the keels, which he had seen done in Spain, but which had not hitherto been practised in England.
0	Ayrton concluded his investigations by a survey of the masts and rigging.
0	Captain Len Guy made me no answer; he remained in silent thought, but did not endeavour to slip away from me.
0	It had not reached the office; indeed, there had not yet been time for it to arrive.
0	Seetzen left Aleppo in 1805 for Damascus.
0	Almost immediately, hundreds of little animals, similar to rabbits, fled in every direction, with such rapidity that even Top could not overtake them.
0	The frost continued for another week, and the settlers did not leave Granite House unless to look after the poultry-yard.
0	And then it came to my remembrance that according to Arthur Pym's narrative, Tsalal belonged to a group of islands which extended towards the west.
0	On the 2nd of March, Denham returned to Kouka, and on the 20th of May, he was witness to the arrival of Lieutenant Tyrwhitt, who had come to take up his residence as consul at the court of Bornou, bearing costly presents for the sultan.
0	What passion, what fire in the actors!
0	At last, one final trembling flame remained in the lamp; I followed it with all my power of vision; I gasped for breath; I concentrated upon it all the power of my soul, as upon the last scintillation of light I was ever destined to see: and then I was to be lost forever in Cimmerian and tenebrous shades.
0	In a few seconds I felt myself once more able to breathe.
0	We are at the mercy of very variable winds; but I should think myself fortunate were we to strike it between Sierra Leone and Portendick.
0	The extremities were not visible either on the east or the west, and if our boat did not find an open passage, we could not clear it.
0	But we find a worthy successor to the Venetian traveller in an Arabian theologian, named Abdallah El Lawati, better known by the name of Ibn Batuta.
0	The detective, at least, seemed to have found a way; for, after a few moments, he said to Mr. Fogg, "These are long and slow hours, sir, that we are passing on the railway."
0	I had to content myself with the different specimens of fish brought up by the nets.
0	“Will they be better than what I see now?” was Cybele’s invariable reply.

0	To the eminent geologists of the United Kingdom who looked upon the fact as certain--Messrs. Falconer, Buck, Carpenter, and others--were soon united the learned men of Germany, and among those in the first rank, the most eager, the most enthusiastic, was my worthy uncle, Professor Hardwigg.

0	Almagro left Chili in the greatest haste, crossed the stony and sandy desert of Atacama, where he suffered as severely from heat and drought as he had done in the Andes from cold and snow, penetrated into the Peruvian territory, defeated Manco-Capac in a great battle, and succeeded in approaching the town of Cuzco, after having driven away the Indians.
0	“He’s an energetic fellow, this brave John of mine!” said Lord Glenarvan, as he entered the saloon.
0	He wrote the note, he tied it to Jup’s neck, he brought the ape to the door of Granite House, from which he let down a long cord to the ground; then, several times he repeated these words,-- “Jup Jup!
0	In this case it was a volcano, not a colliery, that was the object of exploration, and thankful enough they were to find that it had not become extinct.
0	The besieged, however, noticing the hesitation of their assailants, in their turn assumed the defensive, and rallying their archers discharged a shower of poisoned arrows, to which many an Arab fell a victim, and before which the forces of Bornou and Mandara gave way.
0	T. Maston slowly rose, and rubbed the different parts of his body to make sure he was not hurt.
0	“It is a long time since this room has been inhabited,” observed Herbert.
0	Ten days later, Clawbonny, Johnson, Bell, Altamont, and Captain Hatteras landed at Korsoeur, in Zeeland, in Denmark; a steamboat carried them to Kiel; thence, _via_ Altona and Hamburg, they reached London the 13th of the same month, hardly recovered from their long sufferings.
0	No longer, then, could there be any doubt as to the annihilation of a considerable portion of the colony.
0	All the experiences of preceding navigators, in the latitudes through which we were to pass, all that theories and reasoning could suggest, had been called into requisition.
0	They declared that it was a country containing rich gold-mines, of which the most important was situated seventy-five miles to the south.
0	"Well then," exclaimed Ardan, "at such a temperature--" "Wait a moment," replied Barbican.

0	Before again issuing from it, this spiral runs into a small cone with a concave base, that is turned downward in the shape of a spherical cap.
0	How grateful the inhabitants of Granite House then were to Heaven for having prepared for them this solid and immovable retreat!
0	The correspondent of the Daily Telegraph had thus an opportunity of observing how much recent events preoccupied the merchants of Nijni-Novgorod, and to what a degree the commerce with Central Asia was threatened in its transit.
0	"Well," answered the doctor, "so much the worse for them; it is indeed an open space, where four roads meet, and I don't see any sign-post to point out the right way!

0	"Certainly," he replied; "since the reservoirs are not empty; and, when empty, the Nautilus must rise to the surface of the sea."

0	It might be, indeed, that their only intention was to obtain fresh water from the Mercy, and it was not impossible that the bridge, thrown across a mile and a half from the mouth, and the manufactory at the Chimneys might escape their notice.
0	It is this effect which is being produced at this moment."
0	Will you deliver a letter for me?” “With pleasure.” “Take this letter, then, my friend, and deliver it at Manaos.” The Indian took the letter which Joam gave him, and a handful of reis was the price of the commission he had undertaken.

0	At the same time that the King of Portugal, John II., despatched Diaz to seek in the south of Africa the route to the Indies, he ordered two gentlemen of his court to find out if it would not be possible to attain the same end by an easier, safer, and more rapid means; by way of the isthmus of Suez, the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean.
0	He, therefore, kept on his northerly course, bearing a little east, and the correctness of his calculations was soon verified.
0	These poor creatures seemed to be neither well off nor happy.

0	For some time the Moors dissembled their resentment, but when they had succeeded in thoroughly exasperating the population against the foreigners, they rushed at a given signal into the factory which was under the direction of Ayrès Correa, and massacred fifty of the Portuguese, whom they surprised in it.
0	The detention of the expedition amongst the ice lasted no less than forty-six days, and not until the 22nd did Ross reach the great barrier of stationary ice, which was considerably lower beyond Erebus, where it was no less than 200 feet high.

0	Neither the _Pleiades_, the _Northern Crown_, the _Magellanic Clouds_ nor the great nebulas of _Orion_, or of _Argo_, no sparkling cluster, no corona, no group of glittering star-dust that the travellers had ever gazed at, presented such attractions as the diamond ring they now saw encompassing the Earth, just as the brass meridian encompasses a terrestrial globe.

0	All that was accomplished this season was to bring the _Victory_ as far as Discovery Harbour, a very little further north than that of Sherif.
0	As he said, by groping carefully, they could not mistake the way.
0	This produce of the chase was brought back to Granite House, and figured at the evening repast.
0	The gale lasted thirty-six hours, and after many narrow escapes, I found myself some sixty miles W. to leeward of this bay.
0	If, then, I force the temperature 18 degrees, the hydrogen of the balloon will dilate 18/480 or 1614 cubic feet, and will, therefore, displace 1614 more cubic feet of air, which will increase its ascensional power by 160 pounds.
0	A perfect avalanche of stones and trunks of trees began to roll down the slope above them.
0	They gave him a cordial welcome.
0	In fact, the ship was destined to disappear beneath a thick casing of ice, which was needed to preserve its inside temperature; a roof made of thick tarred canvas and covered with snow was built above the deck over its whole length; the canvas was low enough to cover the sides of the ship.
0	The people of this province, who were very numerous before the invasion of the Fellatahs, are armed with bows and arrows, and trade in tobacco, nuts, gouro, antimony, tanned hares' skins, and cotton stuffs in the piece and made into clothes.
0	The rival parties promenaded the streets with arms in their hands; and at every occasion of their meeting a collision was to be apprehended which might have been attended with disastrous results.
0	If the true medium of our difficulties did not increase, it was within the range of possibility that we might ultimately reach the end of our journey.
0	"So, Mr. Fogg," resumed Aouda, "not content with rescuing me from a terrible death, you thought yourself bound to secure my comfort in a foreign land?"
0	"Now then, Ardan, what do _you_ say to the first question?
0	An instant before she sank, the brig, as I saw perfectly well, rose on an enormous wave, and fell back on her larboard side.
0	"Of course not," replied the Captain, "nor need we; our lights, being provided with hinges, can be lifted back.

0	"That theory of yours holds no more water than mine, Ardan," observed M'Nicholl.
0	In short, it was not without a motive that all communication had been stopped between the corral and Granite House, and who but the convicts could have any interest in interrupting this communication?
0	As far as Staten Island the weather was uniformly fine, but beyond it the explorers had to contend with extremely violent gales, storms of hail and snow, dense fogs, huge waves, and a swell in which the vessels laboured heavily.
0	They had nothing, save the clothes which they were wearing at the time of the catastrophe.
0	The ship, yielding to this enormous pressure, inclined to larboard, and the end of the main-yard was already touching the ice, at the risk of breaking the mast.
0	Master Zacharius remained standing upright beside her.
0	A deafening noise fell on his ear like the roar of artillery.
0	Without hesitating, the little band moved towards the palisade.
0	One day, Michael asked him what sort of weather it was.
0	Was the Nautilus being drawn into this gulf at the moment our boat was going to leave its sides?

0	Upon Magadoxo, another town on the African Coast, Cunha tried but in vain, to impose his authority.
0	"We have none of them."
0	On the disc, the plains were already returning to the dark tint which is seen from the earth.
0	"No, Doctor," answered the boatswain, "it's impossible; there's not a piece of wood large enough; it's good for nothing except to keep us warm for a few days and then--" "Then?"
0	My uncle made vain attempts to restrain me.
0	Some reflected the light of day upon a thousand crystal facets.
0	Error of _observation_, as facts afterwards proved; the Projectile _was_ not seen on the 13th and _could_ not have been on that day, so that the little black spot which Belfast professed to have seen was most certainly not the Projectile; 2.
0	But gradually he fell into a half-drowsy state, and his apprehensions were lulled.
0	The wall of the imperial palace was at once recognized by its yellow colour.
0	Amongst the specimens of these branches I noticed some placenae, with thin unequal shells, a kind of ostracion peculiar to the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean; some orange lucinae with rounded shells; rockfish three feet and a half long, which raised themselves under the waves like hands ready to seize one.
0	“Not altogether; but, if the worst came to the worst, and the balloon were to fail us, we might make our way to the French settlements.
0	The horses soon tired of treading over ground that gave way at every step.
0	While the astronomers devoted themselves to estimating the regularity of the astronomical watches, the naturalists, with several officers, ascended the Peak, and collected some curious plants.
0	It may be easily conjectured that André's conversation referred more to the future than to the present, and that he did not conceal the slight probability there was of saving the castaways.
0	Top had not been sent again to him, as it appeared useless to expose the faithful dog to some shot which might deprive the settlers of their most useful auxiliary.
0	A general cry arose from the frigate.
0	The departure was fixed for the following morning, the 2nd of November.
0	Then, their curiosity satisfied, they would rush off to enjoy the pleasures of intoxication.
0	"Is it one of those particles of meteoric matter you were speaking of just now, caught within the sphere of our Projectile's attraction and accompanying us to the Moon?"
0	It was not even necessary that he should go to his bankers for the twenty thousand pounds; for his antagonists already had his cheque in their hands, and they had only to fill it out and send it to the Barings to have the amount transferred to their credit.
0	It was only from the few astronomical works that happened to be included in the _Dobryna’s_ library that any details could be gathered, but these were sufficient to give a large amount of interesting information.
0	"And Mr. Fogg is getting on well?"
0	"Five minutes more," said Andrew Stuart.
0	"Knock spots out of the best of them by fifty per cent!"
0	The monkeys were numerous, but happily they did not manifest any hostile disposition.
0	Thus, in the midst of this great sea, Captain Nemo's life was passing, even to his grave, which he had prepared in one of its deepest abysses.
0	An observer placed at the bottom of the enormous Columbiad, pointed perpendicularly to the horizon, would have framed the moon in the mouth of the gun.
0	Indeed, their whole force would have been barely sufficient to cope with the convicts, and just now no one could leave Granite House.
0	Captain William Guy and his men, although the place was propitious to an ambuscade, walked in close order, each pressing upon the other.
0	"He was born at Rouen," says Father Charlevoix, "of a family in easy circumstances; but having passed some years with the Jesuits, he had had no share in the inheritance of his parents.
0	It was not a corpse that the miners abandoned; and I dare to assert, Mr. Starr, that its heart beats still.” “Speak, Ford!
0	Semilowskoe was almost entirely abandoned.
0	So Nadia thought; and she was not mistaken.
0	The king agreed to the admiral's request, and placed him in command of a flotilla composed of four vessels, the _Santiago_, _Gallego_, _Vizcaino_, and a caravel, as admiral's galley.
0	This company imposed on Hudson as a condition, that he should carry on board, rather as an assistant than as a subordinate, a clever seaman, named Coleburne, in whom they had full confidence.
0	Two bottles were fastened to the horse’s sides to support it in the water.
0	"No, Pencroft," replied Cyrus Harding, "no!
0	A peculiar phenomenon, for the river displaces itself to feed its own tributaries!
0	He certainly would not have recognised Passepartout in the eccentric mountebank's costume; but the latter, lying on his back, perceived his master in the gallery.
0	France entrusted the command of hers to Dumont d'Urville; England chose James Ross; and the United States, Lieutenant Charles Wilkes.
0	All were indeed wonderfully well.
0	The possible fault which he attributed to errors in the observation was, it may be seen, of five degrees on both sides, which, at sixty miles to a degree, would give an error of three hundred miles in latitude and longitude for the exact position.
0	Evidently the new Continent between the Arctic Sea and the Gulf of Mexico had nothing to fear.
0	For two whole months he waited for the sailing of the frigate which was to take him; and, weary of inaction, he went to Spain with his friend Bonpland, in the hope of obtaining permission to visit the Spanish possessions in America.
0	Neb, in his delight at having found his master, did not listen, or rather, did not care to trouble himself with what Pencroft was saying.
0	"That they are moving icebergs."
0	Every one set out in search of Jup, trembling lest he should be found amongst the slain; they cleared the place of the bodies which stained the snow with their blood, Jup was found in the midst of a heap of culpeux, whose broken jaws and crushed bodies showed that they had to do with the terrible club of the intrepid animal.
0	Although no one of all the community cared at all for the safety of the Jew, they cared very much for the security of his cargo, and when Servadac found that nothing would induce the old man to abandon his present quarters voluntarily, he very soon adopted measures of coercion that were far more effectual than any representations of personal danger.
0	"Yes, fully prepared, as far at least as we have been able to foresee.
0	It was an exciting and a magnificent spectacle.
0	"You were born too soon, Pencroft," returned Neb, who only took part in the discussion by these words.
0	The rest of the crew waited for whatever might turn up, ready to make the best use of it for their own profit.
0	Harry’s lamp was not necessary here, but it would very soon be of use, for the old overman was about to conduct the engineer to the very end of the Dochart pit.
0	D'Urville continued to sail northward up the coast until the capes, named by Cook Turn-again and Kidnappers, had been doubled, and Sterile Island with its "Ipah" came in sight.
0	"No, Van Tricasse; none that I know of."
0	It concerns a gigantic bird the Epyornis, of which the bones and the enormous eggs were discovered in Madagascar about the year 1850.
0	The desirable harbour was reached on the 17th of June, at the mouth of a current which Cook called Endeavour River.
0	They were witnesses of frequent and terrible avalanches which they could not have foreseen.
0	What were Pencroft’s feelings, sheltered under a rock on the islet!
0	If he had for a moment suspected that Hearne spoke of what happened on board the _Grampus_, if he had heard that the rascal (as Hurliguerly called him, and not without reason) constantly talked to Martin Holt about his brother, I really do not know what would have happened.
0	This was evident by the fertility and abundance of the pasture and its dark color.
0	Coal-beds are found in many parts of the world.
0	A south-easterly wind having arisen, Columbus soon put to sea again, and twenty-seven miles further westward, he discovered a third island, which he called Fernandina, but which now goes by the name of the Great Exuma.
0	The glass, worked by a powerful lever which enabled it to overcome the pressure of the enclosed air, turned quickly on its hinges, and poor Satellite was dropped out.
0	All his life was in that last look.
0	One of them I will describe.
0	The telescope, after having slowly swept the horizon, at last stopped on the looked-for spot, and Cyrus Harding, lowering it, pronounced one word only,-- And in fact a vessel was in sight, off Lincoln Island!
0	Michel Ardan perceived the fact.
0	At that moment a hand was laid on Ayrton's shoulder.
0	Indeed, after the most recent calculations this reduction is only .000436 of an atmosphere for each thirty feet of depth.
0	If in the daytime the enemy would be more easily resisted, any ambuscades which might be prepared would be more easily avoided, while they could better take precautions to repair any bridges broken by the Mexicans.
0	The cannibals on seeing this fled, as in the island of Guadaloupe, and all retired into the forests.
0	I went to the panel.
0	cried Barbican and M'Nicholl starting to their feet in an "Come, come!"
0	Haven't you got to carry back to England the copy of the document which proves our discovery, in case--" "Still--" "It is settled," said Hatteras, in a tone of command; "and since my entreaties as a friend are not enough, I order it as captain."
0	It was enough to drive one mad.
0	It was under these extraordinary circumstances that they abandoned their island, whither they were destined never to return.
0	cried Passepartout; "you are convinced he is an honest man?"
0	The corporal was again sent forward with some men, but he found only a very poor spring, barely affording sufficient water to slake the thirst of his party.
0	The visitors having taken what seats they could, Hakkabut closed the door, and, like a prisoner awaiting his sentence, stood with folded hands, expecting the captain to speak.
0	But before starting, a touching ceremony was witnessed by the good people of Glasgow.
0	If Nadia had been less energetic, she would have succumbed to this double blow.
0	One horrible thought glanced across the minds of both Kennedy and the doctor: caymans swarm in these waters!
0	At last Tchien Lung consented to content himself with the respectful salutation with which English nobles are accustomed to greet their own sovereign.
0	The time began to drag.
0	"You understand now, Ardan, don't you?"
0	Naturally, therefore, the time slipped away in endless conversation.
0	He remembered them at the farewell breakfast given on board the BRITANNIA to the captain’s friends, at which Sheriff Mcintyre was present.
0	An instant after we were landed, one after the other, in about two yards of water upon an even sand.
0	If the crew had perished among the waves, the waves probably had thrown some bodies on the shore.
0	Finally, Bello made an effort to induce Clapperton to read to him the letter of Lord Bathurst to the Sultan of Bornou.
0	I have very strong doubts if the most determined geologist would, during that descent, have studied the nature of the different layers of earth around him.
0	This was the secret of the capricious Emir.
0	It had been till now occupied by M. Olbinett, who vacated it for the expected guest.
0	A great many bears, attracted by the scent, were seen to leeward of the _Forward_; the healthy men gave chase; but these animals are very swift of foot, and crafty enough to escape most stratagems; it was impossible to get near them, and the most skilful gunners could not hit them.
0	All here was in order; but a cry escaped the colonists when they saw that the door, which they had closed on their departure, was now wide open.
0	I will now ask our worthy secretary to calculate the weight of a cast-iron gun with a bore of nine feet and a thickness of six feet of metal."
0	If the last hypothesis is correct, it will be easy enough to get home again.
0	"That is true," replied Herbert.
0	They ran to him, exclaiming: “Paganel!

0	“Then I take your bishop, major,” said Colonel Murphy, as he made a move that he had taken since the previous evening to consider.
0	At five o'clock, the log showed that the speed of the Nautilus was slackening, and I knew that it was allowing them to draw nearer.
0	Then the screw set to work at its maximum speed, its four blades beating the waves with in describable force.
0	All was stowed away, and happily there was no want of room in Granite House, in which they might have housed all the treasures of the island.
0	Ah, gentlemen of the Reform, this shall cost you dear!"
0	The train reached Ogden at two o'clock, where it rested for six hours, Mr. Fogg and his party had time to pay a visit to Salt Lake City, connected with Ogden by a branch road; and they spent two hours in this strikingly American town, built on the pattern of other cities of the Union, like a checker-board, "with the sombre sadness of right-angles," as Victor Hugo expresses it.
0	Marie descended to her cabin, and the whole crew, by the captain's orders, remained on deck.
0	He said nothing but this--nothing more.
0	To each man a special duty was assigned; some were employed to facilitate the sliding with wooden rollers, if necessary; others to moderate the speed of the hull, in case it became too great, by means of hawsers and cables.
0	Five minutes after, all the fugitives had safely escaped from the Ware-Atoua, left their retreat, and keeping away from the inhabited shores of the lakes, they plunged by narrow paths into the recesses of the mountains.
0	Charles Green, assistant to Dr. Bradley, of Greenwich Observatory, embarked with him.
0	Lost in bewildering maze of thought, he gazed long and intently upon the heavens.
0	And the lightning disappeared out of window.
0	This apparatus had been so ingeniously combined that it did not weigh more than seven hundred pounds, even including twenty-five gallons of water in another receptacle.
0	The sea ran continually high, violent and variable winds, dull, foggy, and cold weather was accompanied by thunder, rain, and snow.
0	In spite of all this the combats began again, and many of the islanders fell, among others a giant of nine feet high, whom Béthencourt would have liked to have made prisoner.
0	Two years later Botwell discovered the Southern Orkneys, and then Palmer and other whalemen sighted, or thought they sighted, districts to which they gave the names of Palmer and Trinity.
0	We were the only living creatures in this subterranean world!
0	"But what is this volcanic mountain?"

0	The suburbs were abandoned, the bridges destroyed.
0	All night Nadia had tried to see if the body of Nicholas had not been left on the road, but it was in vain that she looked among the ruins, and searched among the dead.
0	[Illustration] The doctor made the experiment with all care.
0	If Heaven did not come to their aid, they were lost.
0	Yes, it must have been so; and on every sea they were now seeking this engine of destruction.
0	"I will sign an agreement to that effect," I continued, "with Captain Len Guy as your representative, and the sums gained shall be handed to you on your return, no matter under what conditions that return be accomplished."
0	Indeed, I was going to do it without your leave.
0	He was in that state of excitement that solitude was exasperating to him.
0	Thus, through the assistance of Divine Providence, we surmounted the difficulties and distresses of a most perilous voyage."
0	You know very well that it is on the surface of the earth that its action is most powerfully felt, while on the contrary, in the very centre of the earth bodies cease to have any weight at all."
0	Where, then, did he seek that liberty denied him upon the inhabited earth?
0	The ship's crew agreed with him.
0	"Then can the convicts have been on board?"
0	"We must walk very fast,--even run, if possible," said they, "and we shall be in safety in five minutes.
0	If the stone which had fallen at the feet of James Starr had been thrown by the hand of some ill-disposed person, it was the first criminal act of that description.
0	The atmosphere threw off that chilly dampness which is felt after the passage of a great meteor.
0	I instantly recalled to mind what the boatswain had told me concerning a certain conversation in which he had overheard Hearne prompting Martin Holt to ask the half-breed what were the circumstances of his brother's death on board the _Grampus_.
0	The _New York Tribune_ and the _Boston Journal_ took up their parable against Barbicane.
0	“Is it a success?” asked Bali-Bali rubbing his shoulders.
0	Having got quite near he took aim, but just as he was about to pull the trigger he felt his arm trembling; his large fur gloves were in his way; he took them off quickly, and seized his gun with a firmer hand.
0	“To settle.” “And when shall we begin?” “To-morrow, by having a seal hunt.” “To make candles?” “Yes.” Such was the engineer’s project; and it was quite feasible, since he had lime and sulphuric acid, while the amphibians of the islet would furnish the fat necessary for the manufacture.
0	Barbicane and Nicholl looked upon the lunar map from a very different point of view to that of their fantastic friend.
0	However, Herbert scarcely suffered at all, and the cold water with which they were constantly bathed, prevented any inflammation of the wounds.
0	Then turning to me, said: "The Island of Ceylon, noted for its pearl-fisheries.

0	My surprise was slightly modified when I knew that this tranquil and solemn personage was only a hunter of the eider duck, the down of which is, after all, the greatest source of the Icelanders' wealth.
0	The morning mists surrounded us, but they soon cleared off.
0	You see these bones, my friends; well, when it freezes, I will bend them, and then wet them with water till they are entirely covered with ice, which will keep them bent, and I will strew them on the snow, having previously covered them with fat.
0	"Well, my friend, let us talk, if you are not required on board just now."
0	A dozen of red partridges and rays were speedily brought down, and Glenarvan also managed very cleverly to kill a TAY-TETRE, or peccary, a pachydermatous animal, the flesh of which is excellent eating.
0	[Illustration: Map of France, corrected by order of the king, in accordance with the instructions of the Members of the Academy of Sciences.
0	“Is it a volcano?” he asked of Paganel, who was gazing at this new land through his telescope.

0	For this purpose, the Nautilus was clearly the only part of the machinery that could be employed with advantage.
0	“And now, captain, do you know how many dozens of these fellows are up there?” It was difficult to reply to Pencroft, and as for the young boy making another attempt, that was not easy; for the lower part of the ladder had been drawn again into the door, and when another pull was given, the line broke and the ladder remained firm.

0	Either he had not been able to get down into the hold again, or he had not ventured to do so, fearing to betray the presence of Arthur Pym, and thinking the moment for confessing everything to his father had not yet come.
0	But at last, if all indication of an encampment escaped Herbert’s sight could he not even catch a glimpse of smoke, the faintest trace of which would be easily discernible in the pure atmosphere?
0	"And pray what is the ether?"
0	He therefore left a garrison in Omsk, and, reinforcing himself en route with the conquerors of Kolyvan, joined Feofar’s army.

0	All these out-buildings, a perfect village, comprising more than twenty huts and houses, were about a quarter of a mile off in the heart of a little valley.
0	These instructions concluded in terms proving the exalted ideas of the government.
0	Towards eleven o'clock everything was prepared for a meal; the canvas of the tent served as a cloth; the breakfast, consisting of pemmican, salt meat, tea and coffee, was set and soon devoured.
0	Further on, some remains of a gigantic aqueduct; here the high base of an Acropolis, with the floating outline of a Parthenon; there traces of a quay, as if an ancient port had formerly abutted on the borders of the ocean, and disappeared with its merchant vessels and its war-galleys.
0	The distance of the projectile from the moon diminished very rapidly under its speed, though that was much less than its initial velocity-- but eight or nine times greater than that which propels our express trains.

0	Meanwhile several officers climbed through the thick furze clothing the hills overlooking the bay, and the following is D'Urville's verdict on the desolate scene which met their view.
0	Where Harding's engineering qualifications now came into play was in the construction of the machine for pressing the wool, for he knew how to turn ingeniously to profit the mechanical force, hitherto unused, which the waterfall on the beach possessed to move a fulling-mill.
0	But travelers are not too particular, and, moreover, in seven or eight months you would get a ship, I dare say, to take you back to Europe.” “Seven or eight months!” exclaimed Paganel.
0	“We can see nothing,” said Kennedy, after two hours of search.
0	“You, Ayrton!” replied his master, not less bewildered than Glenarvan.

0	Another effect I noticed, which was the passage of thick clouds which formed and vanished rapidly; but on reflection I understood that these seeming clouds were due to the varying thickness of the reeds at the bottom, and I could even see the fleecy foam which their broken tops multiplied on the water, and the shadows of large birds passing above our heads, whose rapid flight I could discern on the surface of the sea.

0	During the Siberian winter, the rivers being all frozen to a thickness of several feet, they are easily practicable, and the traveler even crosses them without being aware of the fact, for their beds have disappeared under the snowy sheet spread uniformly over the steppe; but in summer the difficulties of crossing are sometimes great.

0	If elsewhere she produces grand artistic effects by piling up huge masses without order or connection--if elsewhere we see truncated cones, imperfect pyramids, with an odd succession of lines; here, as if wishing to give a lesson in regularity, and preceding the architects of the early ages, she has erected a severe order of architecture, which neither the splendors of Babylon nor the marvels of Greece ever surpassed.

0	This was the visit to Kotzebue of the queen-mother and the royal family.
0	Captain Servadac gave old Isaac full permission to take up his residence amongst the rest of the community, promised him the entire control over his own property, and altogether showed him so much consideration that, but for his unbounded respect for his master, Ben Zoof would have liked to reprimand him for his courtesy to a man whom he so cordially despised.

0	How was it not in the hands of Ben Joyce?
0	To cover it in, it was necessary to demolish the fore and aft cabins of the ship; the roof was put on, on the 2nd October, and a piece of frozen snow was set up like a May pole.

0	The moment you give up jesting about it, we can discuss the thing.” “Let us discuss it, then, at breakfast, if you have no objections, my dear Dick.” The two friends took their seats opposite to each other, at a little table with a plate of toast and a huge tea-urn before them.
0	He would find no difficulty in swimming across the Firth of Forth at Edinburgh.

0	But when he learned, as he now did for the first time, that the ocean bed on which the Projectile was lying could be hardly less than 20,000 feet below the surface, he assumed a countenance as grave as the Captain's, and at once confessed that, unless their usual luck stood by them, his poor friends had not the slightest possible chance of ever being fished up from the depths of the Pacific.

0	They did not doubt that if Top had arrived safely at Granite House, Neb would have sent him back immediately.
0	Yes, Manoel knew all this, and, further, he knew that Joam Garral--or rather Joam Dacosta--was innocent, and his misfortunes made him even dearer and more devoted to him.

0	added Herbert, "and he had been twelve years already on the islet when we found him there!"
0	Then, addressing Robert Grant, "Sir," he added, "you left behind you a criminal; you find in his place a man who has become honest by penitence, and whose hand I am proud to clasp in mine."

0	Upon his arrival in Panama, Almagro could not obtain permission from Los Rios, the successor of Avila, to make new levies, for he had no right, Los Rios said, to allow a greater number of people to go and perish uselessly in a rash enterprise; he even sent a boat to Cock Island to bring away Pizarro and his companions.

0	The cape ran out two miles into the sea, and terminated in a gentle slope, and the boat glided easily into a sort of natural creek between coral banks in a state of formation, which in course of time would be a belt of coral reefs round the southern point of the Australian coast.

0	the gentleness of the native disposition and the constant presence of an element of discord amongst the various tribes, must ever be borne in mind if we would understand the political phenomenon of more than fifty millions of men submitting to the yoke of some five and twenty or thirty thousand foreigners."

0	They might have taken the Ahuaty Parana, a sort of natural canal, which goes off a little below the mouth of the Tunantins, and re-enters the principal stream a hundred an twenty miles further on by the Rio Japura; but if the larger portion of this measures a hundred and fifty feet across, the narrowest is only sixty feet, and the raft would there have met with a difficulty.
0	But instead of affording him the necessary help for the prosecution of his journey, that functionary, discontented with the small present Pottinger offered him, found means to extort from him a pair of pistols, which would have been of great use to him.

0	But, after all, my friend, we are going to keep at about one hundred feet only from the soil, and, should you see any ferocious wild beast, oblige us by sending a ball through its heart!” The Victoria descended gradually, but still keeping at a safe height, for, in a barbarous, yet very populous country, it was necessary to keep on the watch for unexpected perils.

0	But yet in countries where the North Star shines directly above the traveller's head, it is hard to walk by it; in fact, when the north is directly in the zenith, it is hard to determine the other cardinal points; fortunately the moon and great constellations aided the doctor in determining the route.

0	If it has been modified in regular order, and a _b_ is always represented by an _l,_ and _o_ by a _v,_ a _g_ by a _k,_ an _u_ by an _r,_ etc., I will give up my judgeship if I do not read it.
0	Ayrton and Cyrus Harding commenced the descent of this abrupt declivity, following almost step for step the difficult path which, during that stormy night, had led them to Dakkar Grotto.
0	For aught I knew, Captain Nemo and his companion might be able to exchange thoughts by means of signs previously agreed upon.
0	how are you going to manage that, captain?” asked Pencroft.
0	I do not think they can be, for the Moors, proud as they are of their origin, never forget the names of those who have brought credit to their families; and were such the case, the Zénagues, who form the majority of the population, and are skilful warriors, would rise under the leadership of one of their chiefs, and fling off the yoke of servitude."
0	“Listen,” said he to Marfa, “your son is here, and you shall immediately point him out to me.” “No.” “All these men, taken at Omsk and Kolyvan, will defile before you; and if you do not show me Michael Strogoff, you shall receive as many blows of the knout as men shall have passed before you.” Ivan Ogareff saw that, whatever might be his threats, whatever might be the tortures to which he submitted her, the indomitable Siberian would not speak.

0	They are as much at home in the water as upon land, and are very clever divers, as we perceived when we threw five pieces of iron into the sea, which a single man went to search for."
0	Kerguelen returned to France, but his successful enterprise had gained him many enemies.
0	But when the long murmur of the distant ocean fell on their ears, the exhausted men forgot their fatigue, and ran up the sandhills with surprising agility.
0	At London, N. M. Rothschild and Son.
0	Ten days’ march at ten miles a day, could be done, not without fatigue, but none of the party gave that a thought.
0	Several times Gideon Spilett and Herbert searched the forest in the neighbourhood of Granite House, without meeting or finding any trace of him.
0	cried the Captain, stretching over and seizing him by the left.
0	In the midst of these living plants, and under the arbours of the hydrophytes, were layers of clumsy articulates, particularly some raninae, whose carapace formed a slightly rounded triangle; and some horrible looking parthenopes.

0	A number of Asiatic traders had thought it best to leave Nijni-Novgorod immediately.
0	The iemschik will stay with you.
0	Paganel said no more, but went off in front alone, and came back in a few minutes quite himself, as if he had completely forgotten his grievance.
0	Then I heard steps upon the platform; and I knew they were unfastening the pinnace and launching it upon the waves.
0	They passed without seeing us, brushing us with their brownish fins, and we escaped by a miracle from a danger certainly greater than meeting a tiger full-face in the forest.

0	Water was abundant, and the cisterns could hardly fail to be replenished by the numerous streams that meandered along the plains; moreover, the Gallian Sea would ere long be frozen over, and the melted ice (water in its congealed state being divested of every particle of salt) would afford a supply of drink that could not be exhausted.

0	In a letter of two days' later date, giving particulars of his intended route, La Perouse says,-- "I shall regain the Friendly Islands, and carry out the instructions I have received with regard to the northern portion of New Caledonia, to Santa Cruz de Mendana, to the land south of the Arsacides of Surville, and to the Louisiade of Bougainville, and also ascertain, if possible, whether the latter constitutes a portion of New Guinea, or is a separate continent.

0	Not to find an Indian where in general there were only too many, was so unusual that there must be some grave cause for it; but worse still if Harry Grant were a prisoner in the hands of any of those tribes, had he been dragged away with them to the north or south?

0	But this peaceable life without adventures could not long satisfy the enterprising spirit of Cortès.

0	After long and sad mishaps, he landed at Massowah in Abyssinia, traversed the country, and in 1618 pushed on as far as the sources of the Blue Nile,--a discovery the authenticity of which Bruce was hereafter to dispute, but of which the narrative differs only in some unimportant particulars from that of the Scotch traveller.
0	Very extraordinary articles were provided at the instance of Captain Cook, who claimed them as anti-scorbutics, for instance, malt, sour krout, salted cabbages, soup-slabs, mustard and saloop, as well as carrot marmalade, and thickened and unfermented beer, which was tried at the suggestion of Baron Storch of Berlin, and Mr. Pelham, secretary to the Commissariat department.

0	The attempt to clear away these wrecks had also turned out very well; even sufficient treasure had been recovered to repay all the expense, though the preparations for the purpose by the contractors, M'Gowan and Co. had been made on the most extensive scale, and in accordance with the latest improvements in the apparatus for submarine operations.
0	he asked next morning, as the vessel was briskly heading southward, at a distance of ten or twelve miles from the coast on their left.
0	The island of Isabella was beautiful of aspect, with its clear lakes, and thick forests; the Spaniards were never tired of admiring the new type of nature presented to their view, and of which the intense verdure was wonderful to European eyes.
0	Right in their very path, a blazing ball of fire had suddenly risen up before their eyes, the pitchy darkness all round it rendering its glare still more blinding.

0	Much surprise was therefore felt when in a short time they were seen returning with joyful acclamations.

0	It could not be turned against him.
0	A world absolutely and completely dead, fixed, still, motionless--save when a gigantic land-slide, breaking off the vertical wall of a crater, plunged down into the soundless depths, with all the fury too of a crashing avalanche, with all the speed of a Niagara, but, in the total absence of atmosphere, noiseless as a feather, as a snow flake, as a grain of impalpable dust.

0	The bullocks would never have grazed where the sheep had passed along, and consequently they had to go first, divided into two battalions.
0	Count Timascheff, a Russian nobleman, was evidently rich; to him perhaps, for a proper consideration, a loan might be made: Captain Servadac was a Gascon, and Gascons are proverbially poor; it would never do to lend any money to him; but here was a professor, a mere man of science, with circumscribed means; did _he_ expect to borrow?

0	"Now," said the engineer one day to him, "I must observe, my friend, that after having said so much, in praise of Lincoln Island, after having spoken so often of the sorrow you would feel if you were obliged to forsake it, you are the first to wish to leave it."
0	Passepartout tried to reason about the matter, but the policeman tapped him with his stick, and Mr. Fogg made him a signal to obey.

0	As the pitching, however, was the result of a long uniform swell, the yacht did not labor much harder than she would against the ordinary short strong waves of the Mediterranean; the main inconvenience that was experienced was the diminution in her proper rate of speed.

0	For him, he was a misunderstood genius who, tired of earth's deceptions, had taken refuge in this inaccessible medium, where he might follow his instincts freely.
0	West Port moreover, was as yet only known from the reports of Baudin and Flinders, and it was therefore better worth exploring than a more frequented district.

0	But the time of rest had not yet come for this indefatigable explorer; the following year he revisited his native place Tangier, and then after travelling in the southern countries of Europe he returned to Morocco, went to Soudan and the countries watered by the Niger, crossed the Great Desert and entered Timbuctoo, thus making a journey which would have rendered illustrious a less ambitious traveller.
0	The lens of a telescope, as is well known, gives only the inverted image of the object; therefore, when an upright image is required, an additional glass must be used.

0	“Well,” said Pencroft, “this bay would make admirable roads, in which a whole fleet could lie at their ease!” “What is especially curious,” observed Harding, “is that the gulf has been formed by two rivers of lava, thrown out by the volcano, and accumulated by successive eruptions.
0	Unless the Tartars should bring with them materials for building a bridge of boats, their march towards Irkutsk would certainly be stopped for some time by this barrier, the Yenisei.
0	And all this horrible living mass writhed and twisted in the first rays of the morning sun!
0	"Yes, sir," said the Captain, "and if I do not hesitate to tread this South Pole, it is because, up to this time, no human being has left a trace there."

0	Ten days' journey from hence he entered a province which must be the Peshawur of the present day, whose dark-skinned inhabitants were idolaters; then after seven days' further march, about mid-day he came to the kingdom of Cashmere, where the temperature is cool, and towns and villages are very numerous.
0	Grey at once disavowed the discoveries with which he was so generously credited, explaining that he had only sailed fifty miles up the strait, which runs from east to west till it reaches a spot where, according to some natives, it veers to the north and disappears.
0	This interchange of musical phrases lasted for two or three minutes, and the Muras disappeared.

0	On the side of the terrestrial sphere nothing was to be seen.
0	Now, of these three well-watered valleys, either might have served as a retreat to some solitary who would have found there everything necessary for life.
0	Barth, in following out to Soudan the track traced by Denham and Clapperton; Dr. Livingstone, in multiplying his fearless explorations from the Cape of Good Hope to the basin of the Zambesi; Captains Burton and Speke, in the discovery of the great interior lakes, have opened three highways to modern civilization.
0	On this he endeavoured to make Freycinet cancel the engagement between them, hoping to prevail on him to land at Monte Video.

0	This coast was uninviting enough.
0	This was at the middle of Melville Bay, one of the largest seas of this region.
0	A mountaineer disturbing them from their perilous position, they began the descent, running down a very steep incline.
0	The Ba-Fing, the chief affluent of the Senegal, was not more than a hundred paces across, and a foot and a half deep where he passed it; but the force of the current, and the huge granite rocks encumbering its bed, render it very difficult and dangerous to cross the river.
0	Evidently there was nothing to be done, for the time at least, but to take him on board the _Bonadventure_.
0	"But does your master propose to carry this young woman to Europe?"

0	It is in Pekin that the field is situated which the emperor, in accordance with ancient custom, sows every spring.
0	But in this jurisdiction of Para, Manoel was at home, and he could tell them the names of the double chain which gradually narrowed the valley of the huge river.
0	Shandon had doubtless received word to take particular care about this part of the cargo, for he gave to it especial attention, as well as to the ship's medicine-chest.
0	I looked at him stupefied.
0	By this time, some blacks, having ventured in a boat just under the balloon, Kennedy saluted them with a shot from his rifle, that made them regain the bank at their utmost speed.
0	We passed tolerably near to the Island of Aurou, that at noon looked like a mass of green woods, surmounted by a peak of great height.
0	All must end in smoke.
0	We could see it stretching away from Mount Bransfield in the north (62 degrees W.
0	After some time, I explained my state of mental indecision to my uncle.
0	But do you better understand either, my dear Spilett, in what way I was saved myself--how I was drawn from the waves, and carried to the downs?
0	“You are a brave traveling companion, dear Helena,” said Lord Glenarvan.
0	He questioned him, and was surprised by the nobleness of his language, but still more astonished was he, by the boldness of the ideas of Columbus, who made the good Father the confidant of his aspirations.

0	Finding themselves then short of provisions, and having reconnoitred the coast of America for a distance of 2100 miles, they returned to France, and disembarked safely at Dieppe in the month of July, 1524.
0	It was only on the 22nd of May, 1768, on the return of the monsoon, that Captain Carteret was able to leave Bonthain, after a long series of annoyances, vexations, and alarms, which it is impossible to give in detail and which had sorely tried his patience.
0	What are the finest arches of our bridges, what the vaulted roofs of our cathedrals, to that mighty dome above us, and beneath which floats an ocean with its storms and calms and tides!"
0	On that side descent was impossible, and had it been possible, the bottom was shut in by the enormous rock.
0	"There are very good reasons why we should," answered Hatteras, "for we have taken measures to make it possible, and we shall profit by the experience of others.
0	"The expression _v_ zero, which you see in that equation, is the speed which the projectile will have on leaving the atmosphere."
0	"After a thousand hardships, a thousand dangers, Lord Glenarvan had accomplished his journey, and arrived on the east coast of Australia, at Twofold Bay.
0	The light, of course, had ceased to be visible, but in the direction where it had been seen, and at a distance of about ten miles, there was the distinct outline of a solitary island of very small extent; rather, as the count observed, it had the appearance of being the projecting summit of a mountain all but submerged.

0	The General Grant was rigged with three masts, giving a large capacity for sails, and thus materially aiding the steam power.
0	Had they spared her masts and keel?
0	This she cannot always do, as while one motion, the latter, is strictly uniform, the other being eccentric, sometimes accelerating her and sometimes retarding, she has not time to shift herself around completely and with perfect correspondence of movement.
0	It was a natural observatory; the running-rigging alone was taken down.
0	Those who did not take refuge in the capital had to retire beyond Lake Baikal, a district to which the invasion would probably not extend its ravages.
0	Apparently it was the latter, for he threw a rapid glance on the combustible materials heaped up in the inclosure, and the expression of anxiety on his countenance seemed to deepen.
0	An elephant, if you please!” “But where is he taking us to?” said Kennedy, whose rifle itched in his grasp.
0	I was therefore very much confused to see at last a bright light shining close to me.
0	There's nothing to be got out of him one way or another.
0	But plaintive, grievous cries arose from the berths, transformed into death-beds.
0	“But,” said he, “you may jump and play just now; we shall have one or two words to say to you on our way back!” At half-past nine the way was suddenly found to be barred by an unknown stream, from thirty to forty feet broad, whose rapid current dashed foaming over the numerous rocks which interrupted its course.

0	There is one season in the year when not only one ship, but an entire fleet, might safely cross the straits, and to profit by this season one should enter them in the month of December.
0	“What course shall we pursue?” asked Kennedy.
0	The imperial fort, too, was built upon an elevation of 750 feet; it is incredible that it should be so totally submerged.

0	They were as much astonished as I, and equally at a loss how to account for it.

0	That day, the 14th of March, Conseil and he came to me in my room.

0	At that moment they heard a clear and merry voice, the voice of Michel Ardan, exclaiming in an accent of triumph: "White all, Barbicane, white all!"
0	The settlers were now only four, and, as it seemed, at the mercy of the convicts.
0	"Nothing but to go away," echoed the guide.
0	During their stay at Rio de Janeiro the officers took a great many magnetical observations and made experiments with the pendulum, whilst the naturalists scoured the country for new specimens and curiosities, making large and important collections.
0	Under these circumstances, was it necessary to return to Mauritius, disarm the ships, and give up the expedition?
0	However, the colonists kept a strict watch.
0	But perhaps we shall not have to resort to all this noisy work.
0	“Don’t be afraid, the liana is getting thinner; we shall get the better of it, and find out its end!” And, without hesitation, the young mulatto boldly ventured toward Benito.

0	These men, he says, live to a great age, owing to their abstinence and sobriety; some have been known to attain 150 and even 200 years of age; their diet is principally rice and milk, and they drink a mixture of sulphur and quicksilver.
0	Toward eight o’clock in the evening, after supper, while Lady Helena and Mary Grant slept in their berths, Paganel and his friends conversed on serious matters as they walked up and down the deck.
0	The Mongolia, thanks to the vigorous exertions of the engineer, seemed likely, so rapid was her speed, to reach her destination considerably within that time.

0	"Good comparison, friend Ardan;" observed M'Nicholl.
0	See, they came from the southwest and stopped here, and began to explore the country."
0	They then passed between Marikon Island and the Island of the Four Brothers, calling the strait--the finest amongst the Kurile Islands, through which they penetrated--La Boudeuse.
0	said Pencroft to the reporter.
0	"Let master have patience," said the imperturbable Conseil.
0	added Johnson, turning to Hatteras.
0	But this time the thing was more serious.
0	Paganel asked Glenarvan, however, to let him have the document again, on the faith of which they had set out on so bootless a search.
0	Several gunshots, fired into the air, having no effect, a well-directed general volley soon put the natives to flight.

0	These polypi are found particularly in the rough beds of the sea, near the surface; and consequently it is from the upper part that they begin their operations, in which they bury themselves by degrees with the debris of the secretions that support them.

0	When Passepartout reached the International Hotel, it did not seem to him as if he had left England at all.

0	Everyone was eager to reach the goal--that is to say the Pacific Ocean--at that part where the wreck of the BRITANNIA had occurred.
0	A miraculous agreement of the times of departure and arrival, which was impossible, was absolutely necessary to his success.
0	Ardan wished to convey a number of animals of different sorts, not indeed a pair of every known species, as he could not see the necessity of acclimatizing serpents, tigers, alligators, or any other noxious beasts in the moon.
0	All the effect was felt outside.
0	It was folly, folly, folly!
0	They had thus a supply of food for several days, and as to water, there would be no want of that in a district rendered fertile by the numerous little affluents of the Angara.
0	Arrived at the spot on which grew the first beautiful trees of the forest, their foliage slightly agitated by the breeze, the stranger appeared greedily to drink in the penetrating odor which filled the atmosphere, and a long sigh escaped from his chest.
0	The stranger worked alone, and he had resumed his usual life, never appearing at meals, sleeping under the trees in the plateau, never mingling with his companions.
0	"There are," said Michel Ardan, "just as there are horses, cows, donkeys, and chickens.

0	Trees are rare; not a garden enlivens the view, and the scene depends for animation upon the well-stocked shops which abound during the pilgrimage.
0	Soon the Parsee stopped on the borders of the glade, which was lit up by the torches.
0	For himself, he would be quite content to lay one hand on the cart, to push it if necessary, for his legs showed no sign of failing him; but he felt sure that Nadia, compelled to walk ever since they crossed the Obi, that is, for eight days, must be almost exhausted.
0	All was embarked, and the “Bonadventure” was ready to weigh anchor and sail with the morning tide.
0	One or two facts of this kind, well attested, would singularly elucidate the vexatious question of a lunar atmosphere, which is still so far from being decided.
0	It was important that the new vessel should be ready in five months--that is to say, by the beginning of March--if they wished to visit Tabor Island before the equinoctial gales rendered the voyage impracticable.

0	The steadiest winds blow generally from the ice to the open sea, and are very cold.
0	The heat was becoming insufferable, surpassing the heat of Senegal and other equatorial regions; not a cloud ever tempered the intensity of the solar rays; and unless some modification ensued, it seemed inevitable that all vegetation should become scorched and burnt off from the face of the island.
0	As for edible animals, pigs and fowls alone were met with, but dogs if not existing there, are known by name.
0	And may you never come back!"
0	He stepped toward the mass; with his spear he felt it.

0	Without wife or children, and having no settled home, Isaac Hakkabut lived almost entirely on board the _Hansa_, as he had named his tartan; and engaging a mate, with a crew of three men, as being adequate to work so light a craft, he cruised along the coasts of Algeria, Tunis, Egypt, Turkey, and Greece, visiting, moreover, most of the harbors of the Levant.

0	This personage began by refusing the Czar's presents, under pretence that if they were accepted the Emperor would have to send back others with an embassy, which would be contrary to the customs of the country; and he then went on to speak of the law against the entry of any vessels into the ports of Japan, and absolutely forbade the Russians to buy anything, adding, however, at the same time, that the materials already supplied for the refitting and revictualling the vessel would be paid for out of the treasury of the Emperor of Japan.

0	They kept careful watch, through fear lest some bear should be hidden behind the masses of ice; often they took the blocks for animals, from their shape and whiteness, but soon they discovered their mistake.
0	The travellers of whom you speak did not attempt to go forward without sending many presents in advance of them to the chiefs, and surrounded by an escort armed and trained for these expeditions.

0	"At any rate, my dear uncle," I said, "let us start without delay."
0	Hardy, the caulker, hastened first of all to mend the hull; pegs had to be changed, bits of planking to be replaced, seams to be caulked.
0	Shortly afterwards, several of our number fancied they could distinguish waves breaking upon a sandy shore, but after steering with the utmost caution for an hour, that which we had taken for land disappeared suddenly, and we were convinced to our amazement that it had been only a land of fog!

0	These plebeians could under no circumstances raise themselves to a higher class; and a seafaring life was forbidden to them.
0	The most southerly point that Hojeda had reached in this voyage was 4 degrees north latitude, and he had only spent fourteen weeks on the voyage of discovery, properly so called.
0	“I think with you,” resumed Ayrton, “that the captain and his two sailors have escaped alive from the wreck, but since they have not found their way to the English settlement, nor been seen any where, I have no doubt that their fate has been similar to my own, and that they are prisoners in the hands of some of the native tribes.” “That’s exactly what I have always argued,” said Paganel.
0	"Well, and does Nicholl understand what that means?"
0	This man was always practical and thoughtful.
0	The _Ariel_, aided by the ebb tide, had already lost sight of land when a violent storm arose.

0	A tongue of land, sharply pointed and bristling with bushes, projected into the uniting streams.
0	My uncle now began to see to the efficiency of our Ruhmkorff coil, which would doubtless soon be needed; the raft, securely fastened to a rock, was left alone.

0	He was avowedly following the example of Arago, who was accustomed always in lecturing to watch the countenance of the least intelligent of his audience, and when he felt that he had made his meaning clear to him, he concluded that he must have succeeded with all the rest.

0	The fourth act of the "Huguenots," which formerly lasted six hours, began, on this evening at half-past four, and ended at twelve minutes before five.
0	Before reaching this town he was captured by the Portuguese and carried prisoner to Cochin; he afterwards fell ill and was nursed in the Hospital of Goa which he only quitted to serve for two years as a soldier, at the end of which time he was again thrown into prison, and it was not until 1611, that he was able to revisit the good town of Laval.
0	A word from you will accredit me with your chief officer, and in six days I guarantee the DUNCAN shall be in Twofold Bay.” “That’s well spoken,” replied Glenarvan.
0	The doctor began to get uneasy again.
0	Of what this incomparable mountain really is, with all these lines of projections converging towards it and with all these prominent points of relief protruding within its crater, photography has, so far, been able to give us only a very unsatisfactory idea.
0	Under the woods which skirted the glade on the left they could hear the bushes rustling and see the grass waving, which indicated the presence of timid animals, but still nothing to show that the island was inhabited.
0	It is under these conditions that it overturns houses, breaks iron gates, displaces twenty-four pounders.
0	The word Omagua means flat-head in Peruvian, and these people have the singular custom of squeezing the foreheads of new-born babies between two flat pieces of wood, to make them, as they say, resemble the full moon.
0	Here’s the first time that I believe in Africa, and I’m not sorry to get a taste of it.” Toward evening, the doctor calculated that the balloon had not made twenty miles during that whole burning day, and a heated gloom closed in upon it, as soon as the sun had disappeared behind the horizon, which was traced against the sky with all the precision of a straight line.

0	On the morning of the 17th the man in the crow's-nest at last signalled the icebergs.

0	“Then I am to understand that you are determined to retain your two garrisons here and at Gibraltar?” asked Servadac, with one last effort at persuasion.
0	But the next day, by taking the exact hour of the rising and setting of the sun, and by marking its position between this rising and setting, he reckoned to fix the north of the island exactly, for, in consequence of its situation in the Southern Hemisphere, the sun, at the precise moment of its culmination, passed in the north and not in the south, as, in its apparent movement, it seems to do, to those places situated in the Northern Hemisphere.
0	Did the failure prove that the project was impossible, that the forces of which man disposes will never be sufficient to bring about a change in the Earth’s diurnal movement, that never would the Polar regions be displaced in latitude to such an extent that their icy mantle will be melted by the solar rays?
0	The king of this island came alongside, with four canoes bearing his principal officers dressed in their state costumes.
0	The captain leaped in, accompanied by his officers and passengers, and the rapid current of the Thames, aiding the strong arms of the rowers, bore them swiftly to Greenwich.

0	Such an assertion on the part of a man who had made the comparison, is but little flattering to the grandson of Henry IV.
0	The eyes of the whole Selenitic world will be upon you.
0	There were various reasons why he should be left behind, not the least important being that the schooner had no accommodation for horses, and the orderly would have found it hard to part with Zephyr, and much more with his own favorite Galette; besides, it was advisable that there should be some one left to receive any strangers that might possibly arrive, as well as to keep an eye upon the herds of cattle which, in the dubious prospect before them, might prove to be the sole resource of the survivors of the catastrophe.

0	Might not all of them have drawn the lot of "stay"?

0	One danger only is to be feared in crossing the desert; that of finding the wells at Nedjeym dry; and, unless the traveller should lose his way, which, however, with trustworthy guides, is little likely to happen, no serious obstacle arises.
0	Suddenly a dreadful shock was felt, and the projectile, under the force of six billions of litres of gas, developed by the combustion of pyroxyle, mounted into space.
0	Although, therefore, the spreading of the volcanic matter might not constitute a serious danger, any movement of the terrestrial structure which should shake the island might entail the gravest consequences.

0	"I conclude that they feel the approach of winter."
0	The illuminating power in this subterranean region, from its trembling and Rickering character, its clear dry whiteness, the very slight elevation of its temperature, its great superiority to that of the moon, was evidently electric; something in the nature of the aurora borealis, only that its phenomena were constant, and able to light up the whole of the ocean cavern.
0	The Hottentots are as tall as Europeans, their hands and feet are small, and their colour a brownish yellow.

0	The woods, which they had left green, especially in the part at which the firs predominated, had disappeared under a uniform color.
0	Barbicane and his bold colleagues, to whom nothing seemed impossible, had succeeding in solving the complex problems of projectile, cannon, and powder.

0	Tavernier is a specimen of insatiable curiosity.
0	His dog would have warned him of any danger, and, as Top did not bark, it might be concluded that there was nothing to fear at that moment at least, and that the convicts were occupied in another part of the island.
0	The American bowed his head to show that he understood.

0	“We know nothing as yet,” replied Alcide; “but we shall certainly go as far as Ishim, and once there, our movements must depend on circumstances.” “Well then, gentlemen,” said Michael, “we will be fellow-travelers as far as Ishim.” Michael would certainly have preferred to travel alone, but he could not, without appearing at least singular, seek to separate himself from the two reporters, who were taking the same road that he was.

0	As the tide was beginning to rise with its accustomed violence, caused by the narrowness of the straits, the pirates were drawn towards the river, and it was only by dint of hard rowing that they were able to keep in the middle of the channel.

0	Strange to say, as they had advanced in a westerly direction through Lancaster Sound, the vibrations of the pendulum had increased, whilst now it appeared to have lost all motion, and "we now therefore witnessed for the first time the curious phenomenon of the directive power of the needle becoming so weak as to be completely overcome by the attraction of the ship; so that the needle might now be properly said to point to the north pole of the ship."
0	"That is evident," I replied; "and for the sake of archaeologists let us hope that these excavations will be made sooner or later, when new towns are established on the isthmus, after the construction of the Suez Canal; a canal, however, very useless to a vessel like the Nautilus."
0	The result was that, thanks to these attentions, the stranger resumed a more human appearance, and it even seemed as if his eyes had become milder.
0	A bullet even ploughed his shoulder; but Kennedy, leaning over, and discharging his rifle with one hand, brought another of the enemy to the ground.

0	After another fruitless attack by the Hindoos, the two agents returned on board, and a portion of the hostages whom Gama had secured were given up.
0	It is not strange that such masses should run aground, and in consequence become immovably fixed to the spot; as for every foot above the surface of the water they have nearly two beneath, which would give to this one a total height of about four hundred feet.
0	The ancients gave it the name of an ocean, and were not far from believing that it flowed directly from the sun; but we must come down from these flights from time to time, and accept what science teaches us.

0	Numerous mock-moons appeared also while the moon was shining, and a great many would appear in the sky, adding to the general brilliancy; often, too, simple lunar halos surrounded the moon with a circle of splendid lustre.

0	Some hours later the village of Bella Vista, situated on a somewhat lower bank, appeared, with its cluster of magnificent trees, towering above a few huts roofed with straw, over which there drooped the large leaves of some medium-sized banana-trees, like the waters overflowing from a tazza.
0	Lieutenant Procope proceeded to observe that he believed the paper might be considered as genuine, and accordingly, taking its statements as reliable, he deduced two important conclusions: first, that whereas, in the month of January, the distance traveled by the planet (hypothetically called Gallia) had been recorded as 82,000,000 leagues, the distance traveled in February was only 59,000,000 leagues--a difference of 23,000,000 leagues in one month; secondly, that the distance of the planet from the sun, which on the 15th of February had been 59,000,000 leagues, was on the 1st of March 78,000,000 leagues--an increase of 19,000,000 leagues in a fortnight.

0	Atahualpa received it with eagerness and turned over some of the leaves with much curiosity, then, putting it to his ear, he exclaimed, "What you show me there does not speak to me, and tells me nothing."
0	"My friends, then," said Cyrus Harding, "we can no longer be in doubt as to the presence of a mysterious being, a castaway like us, perhaps, abandoned on our island, and I say this in order that Ayrton may be acquainted with all the strange events which have occurred during these two years.
0	Cyrus Field, the bold promoter of the enterprise, as he had sunk all his own fortune, set a new subscription on foot, which was at once answered, and another cable was constructed on better principles.

0	Ere long, two heads appeared to the gaze of Kennedy and Joe, on a level with the very branch to which they were clinging.
0	As to Atahualpa, although his principal officers tried to make a rampart of their own bodies, while they carried him off, Pizarro sprang upon him, dispersed or overthrew his guards, and seizing him by his long hair, threw him down from the litter in which he was carried.

0	These improvements being adopted, the commercial question of the western route increased daily in importance in Spain, Portugal, and Italy, countries in which three-quarters of the science is made up of imagination.
0	The naturalist availed himself of the opportunity to make many excursions in the neighbourhood, and attempt the somewhat dangerous ascent of the Table Mountain.
0	We have only just enough food left to take us back to the ship.
0	He found some dry moss, and by striking together two pebbles he obtained some sparks, but the moss, not being inflammable enough, did not take fire, for the sparks were really only incandescent, and not at all of the same consistency as those which are emitted from flint when struck in the same manner.
0	“If your father is in the hands of the natives, which seems probable from the document, we shall find him.” “And what if he is lost in that immense country?” asked Mary.

0	Gideon Spilett threw into it about eighteen grains of quinine, and they succeeded in making Herbert drink the mixture.
0	The ubas approached, the harpoons were thrown at the same instant; one missed its mark, but the other struck one of the cetaceans near his tail.
0	Hudson found himself forced to change his route, and to propose to his sailors, who were in open mutiny, to seek for a passage, either by Davis' Strait, or the coasts of Virginia, where, according to the information of Captain Smith, who had frequently visited them, an outlet must surely be found.

0	Before entering such places Harding was, careful to send in Top and Jup, who faithfully accomplished their commission, and when the dog and orang returned without giving any warning, there was evidently nothing to fear, either from convicts or wild beasts, two varieties of the animal kingdom, whose ferocious instincts placed them on the same level.

0	Then we might have found out the road they had come by taking the exact latitude and longitude, and studying the atmospheric and submarine currents; but with such a postman as a shark, that goes against wind and tide, there’s no clew whatever to the starting-point.” “We shall see,” said Glenarvan, gently taking out the cork.
0	Immediately the door was forced rather than opened, and the colonists rushed into the room.

0	And on the bromelias, grass plantains, orchids, cacti, and in short all the parasites which formed a little forest beneath the large one, many marvelous insects were they tempted to pluck as though they had been genuine blossoms--nestors with blue wings like shimmering watered silk, leilu butterflies reflexed with gold and striped with fringes of green, agrippina moths, ten inches long, with leaves for wings, maribunda bees, like living emeralds set in sockets of gold, and legions of lampyrons or pyrophorus coleopters, valagumas with breastplates of bronze, and green elytræ, with yellow light pouring from their eyes, who, when the night comes, illuminate the forest with their many-colored scintillations.

0	On the northern side, near an arched doorway, the emperor has had a mound made, a hundred feet in height and more than a mile in circumference; it is covered with evergreen trees, and the emperor, being very fond of horticulture, whenever he hears of a fine tree, sends for it and has it brought by his elephants, with the roots and surrounding soil, the size of the tree being no impediment, and thus he has the finest collection of trees in the world.
0	At present, in order to fly over the surface of the Earth by the simple exertion of our muscles or even to sustain ourselves in the air, we require a muscular force fifty times greater than we possess; but if attraction did not exist, the simplest act of the will, our slightest whim even, would be sufficient to transport us to whatever part of space we wished to visit."

0	In some of the less wooded parts, in places where the breaks were tolerably spacious, they saw several pairs of ostriches, of the species known as _“naudus,”_ from four to five feet high, accompanied by their inseparable _“seriemas,”_ a sort of turkey, infinitely better from an edible point of view than the huge birds they escort.

0	And then there was the singular possessive adjective: “‘Our’ balloon; ‘our’ car; ‘our’ expedition.” And the same in the plural, too: “‘Our’ preparations; ‘our’ discoveries; ‘our’ ascensions.” Dick shuddered at them, although he was determined not to go; but he did not want to annoy his friend.

0	First of all, the large store of corn and fodder, the produce of the recent harvest, was landed and deposited in one of the vaults; then, on the 15th, about fifty head of live cattle--bullocks, cows, sheep, and pigs--were conveyed to their rocky stalls.
0	The wind was blowing north-north-west.

0	He drew near, took Nell’s hand from his mother, and looked directly at her, while something like a smile curved her lip.
0	Ten yards from me I saw the open shell, through which the water was rushing with the noise of thunder, then the double line of guns and the netting.
0	She wrote and told him she was starting.
0	Such a thing as a bite or scratch from any of them had not been known from time immemorial.
0	The barometer went the way of the compass, accompanied by several more bags of sand.
0	The inhabitants were deeply touched by the honours accorded by the English to the remains of their sovereigns, and the day seemed to be not far distant when European customs would completely supersede those of the natives.
0	My eyes could no longer see; my knees shook.
0	“The difference of level will be considerable.
0	As yet she could only wonder, but she felt instinctively that she must above everything avoid drawing attention upon herself, that she must conceal herself, make herself insignificant.
0	He wrote quietly, with his large square writing, in a business-like style.
0	[Illustration] "My friends," said Hatteras, "we have not come out for sport, but to save our lives.

0	But soon the leader perceived that he was no longer master of his musicians.
0	Accordingly the greater portion of the party, escorted by Ben Zoof, made their way into one of the adjacent galleries that led to the shore.
0	In the full light I do not think he would have noticed me, so entirely was he absorbed in the ecstasy.
0	“I have taken the same course as I should have done at sea, and I have kept some distance to windward of the island; we can bear straight down upon it whenever we like.” “Bear down then, now; and as quickly as you can.” The yawl was at once put with her head to the northeast and Captain Servadac, in defiance of the icy blast, remained standing at the bow, his gaze fixed on the horizon.

0	No wonder, since he had never existed, save in the brain of the novelist!

0	Night came, and not a breath of wind was stirring.
0	The eye took in the firmament from the Southern Cross to the North Star, those two constellations which in 12,000 years, by reason of the succession of equinoxes, will resign their part of the polar stars, the one to Canopus in the southern hemisphere, the other to Wega in the northern.
0	They cross districts of many different latitudes, and consequently of many different climates.
0	Balboa set out without caring for the risk he ran in the event of the guides and native auxiliaries proving faithless; he was escorted by a thousand Indians as porters, and accompanied by a troop of those terrible bloodhounds which had acquired the taste for human flesh in Hispaniola.
0	When the Jew had retired, Count Timascheff asked, “But how in the world can you ever make those fellows pay anything?” “They have lots of money,” said Ben Zoof.
0	Were we going to emerge and regain the open polar atmosphere?
0	This "fantasia" almost deafened the visitor.
0	For travellers in the air, this situation is just as dangerous.” “Are you speaking seriously, doctor?” “Very seriously, Dick.” “Let us wait, then!” “Wait!
0	That evening the hunters returned to Granite House quite exhausted.

0	This was singularly in contradiction with the theories of Professor Hardwigg.
0	Next, unrolled before me like a panorama, came the great and wondrous series of terrestrial transformations.
0	The pilgrims carried a staff, a gourd hung at the belt, and they chanted psalms in a plaintive voice: one came from the Ukraine, another from the Yellow sea, and a third from the Finland provinces.
0	“I know nothing about that,” answered Pencroft, “but what is certain, is that some one has weighed the ‘Bonadventure’s’ anchor and dropped it again!
0	Our sea voyage had at length commenced; and once more we were making for distant and unknown regions.
0	The reporter, therefore, thought it best to simply bathe the two wounds with cold water.
0	Suddenly Cyrus Harding drew back, and in a hoarse voice,--“Ayrton!” he exclaimed.
0	But you both know well that nowhere are any such traces visible: therefore, they don't exist; therefore, no lunar inhabitants exist--except, of course, such a race of beings, if we can imagine any such, as could exist without revealing their existence by _movement_."
0	He omitted no means of doing so.
0	[Illustration: Human sacrifice at Tahiti.
0	Hans, with a perfectly calm and indifferent air, took his usual post at the head of the adventurous little band.
0	At sea he always condemned himself to greater privations than the rest of his crew.
0	They kept a sharp look-out, for either Lincoln Island could not be far distant and would be sighted at daybreak, or the “Bonadventure,”  carried away by currents, had drifted so much that it would be impossible to rectify her course.
0	On the 9th of April he touched at Marie-Galante, and on the 10th at Guadaloupe, to take in water; here there occurred a sharp skirmish with the natives.
0	He had traveled during most of the morning, and having already eaten a little, he began to feel the want of a snooze.
0	Talking whilst they worked, reading when the hands remained idle, the time passed with profit to all.
0	The _Speedy_ had not been able to withstand a torpedo that would have destroyed an ironclad as easily as a fishing-boat!
0	Not being able to proceed farther on account of the numerous shallows and powerful currents which we encountered, we decided to alter our course to the south-west, by the deep channel which has been mentioned, as far as about 11 degrees.
0	"We can never reach the neutral point!"
0	They did not catch his meaning.
0	A bag was filled with the crustaceae, whose shells were of a cobalt blue.
0	Jean Cornbutte, spy-glass in hand, responded merrily to the questions of his friends.
0	"Good evening, my friends," he said, springing to his feet.
0	Famine and fatigue had reduced their number to four men, all of them half dead, when the pirogue capsized.
0	"When can I see him--today?"
0	At length he held the key of the document, which would incontestably prove the innocence of Joam Dacosta, and without reading any more he flew from his study into the street, shouting: “Halt!
0	"Let us try it without losing a moment," replied Cyrus Harding.
0	Besides, the latter and Kennedy were dropping off their feet with fatigue.
0	"As you please, sir," replied the harpooner, shrugging his shoulders; "but, as for me, unless I am forced, I will never get into one."
0	"What makes you think so?"
0	I can describe this strife of the elements!
0	It would appear, therefore, that the sufferings experienced by Bruce must have been greatly exaggerated, although the narrative of the Scotch traveller is generally trustworthy.
0	If he did not succeed in finding the fountain of youth which he sought so credulously, at least he had the satisfaction of discovering an apparently fertile tract of country, which he named Florida, either from his landing there on Palm Sunday, (Pâques-Fleuries), or perhaps from its delightful aspect.
0	The blue flowers of the slender-leaved flax, combined with the bright hues of the scarlet acanthus, a flower peculiar to the country.
0	Cast iron, however, if subjected to only one single fusion, is rarely sufficiently homogeneous; and it requires a second fusion completely to refine it by dispossessing it of its last earthly deposits.
0	And still the mighty monster advanced.
0	They worked thus all the time that the navigation in the straits lasted.
0	But from that side they could not see the orb of night, which, traveling from east to west, would rise by degrees toward the zenith.
0	For about an hour longer the CATAPEZ kept wandering about almost at haphazard, though always getting higher up the mountains.
0	He commenced his apprenticeship to the trade of a fazender, which would probably one day become his own, as he was about to do that of a merchant on their descent of the river.
0	“Their eyes, I imagine, bring more money to these spies than their legs.” In putting them down as agents in the Emir’s service, Alcide Jolivet was, by all accounts, not mistaken.
0	Hence, therefore, the very stringent instructions which had been given to the young courier to pass incognito through the invaded district.
0	With all their enthusiasm, the travellers felt their eyes "get out of gear," as Ardan said, like those of a man blind from his birth and suddenly restored to sight.
0	Gideon Spilett declared himself ready to set out accompanied by Pencroft.
0	As to the men lying on the deck, they were about ten in number, but it was to be supposed that more were sleeping down below.
0	"Besides," they said, "as the land is now on our left, let us go back and see the Cape, which we have doubled without knowing it."
0	This cone, indeed, is very narrow, the angular diameter of the moon being so little when compared with the diameter of the orb of day; and up to this time the projectile had been floating in this deep shadow.
0	See, down there on the ice-field, that protuberance caused by the pressure of the ice; we call that a hummock; if the base were under water, we should call it a cake; we have to give names to them all to distinguish them."
0	My early rising probably contributed to the fact that I felt sleepy, and gradually gave way to the sensation of drowsiness.
0	“You are right about that, Simon.
0	I could not abuse the sympathy you show to strangers.” “Strangers, dear child!” interrupted Lady Helena; “you and your brother are not strangers in this house, and I should like Lord Glenarvan to be able on his arrival to tell the children of Captain Grant himself, what is going to be done to rescue their father.” It was impossible to refuse an invitation given with such heart, and Miss Grant and her brother consented to stay till Lord Glenarvan returned.
0	They fight with javelins, bucklers, and certain clubs of stone, the whole adorned with beautiful feathers.
0	"Very well, young man," returned Mr. Fogg, coolly; "it will burn--at your expense."
0	Every quarter of an hour the railway brought fresh accessions of sightseers; and, according to the statement of the Tampa Town _Observer_, not less than five millions of spectators thronged the soil of Florida.
0	That day’s breakfast was composed solely of pigeon’s eggs and lithodomes.
0	Ned and Conseil had prolonged my life during the last hours of this long agony.
0	A month afterwards, Webb and his companions entered Delhi, having definitely settled the course of the Ganges, and ascertained the sources of the Baghirati and Aluknanda; in fact, having attained the object which the Company had had in view.
0	Was it lest I should hurt my fingers that I worked the surface of these copper pieces in the lathe?
0	It was not above a two days’ march, and Ayrton reckoned on their sleeping next night at Apsley, the most westerly town of Victoria.
0	It will be seen that we narrowly escaped being the victims of our own persistance."
0	Not the slightest trace of vegetation was found upon it.
0	He addressed himself to Servadac, and begged him to tell him the whole truth, piteously adding that surely it was unworthy of a French officer to deceive a poor old man like himself.
0	“It has even been observed,” remarked Harding one day to his companions, “that in equal latitudes the islands and coast regions are less tried by the cold than inland countries.
0	Another similar symptom was the reappearance of some ptarmigans, arctic geese, plover, and flocks of quail; the air was soon filled with the deafening cries which they remembered from the previous summer.
0	"The happiest animal in the world," he used to say, "would be a snail who could make himself just such a shell as he wanted; I shall try to be an intelligent snail."
0	Well, then, look at the plenipotentiaries of all nations and our own ministers themselves crowding about his door, entreating his counsels, begging for his approbation, imploring the aid of his all-powerful organ.
0	The wagon shook and the planks creaked, and the axles grated in the naves of the wheels; and before long the hospitable farm of the Irishman was out of sight.
0	In thirty-six hours she had covered that distance; and on the 14th of December, at twenty-seven minutes past one at night, she entered the bay of San Francisco.
0	It would have been pure folly.
0	While my companion was fumbling with his papers, I had seized the valve-cord without his perceiving it.
0	Something must be done!” “I think,” said Lieutenant Procope, breaking his thoughtful silence, “that I can tell you of a sledge already provided for your hand, and I can suggest a motive power surer and swifter than horses.” “What do you mean?” was the eager inquiry.
0	We descended the gradual slopes which led to the summit of the Corridor.
0	The next morning, at daybreak, Cyrus Harding took the necessary measures to protect Granite House from any invasion.
0	So much for the effects of what my uncle called "wholesome fatigue."
0	But we may still, I think, possibly increase the number of precautions to be taken against the terrible shock that we are so soon to experience."
0	So it came about that the old watchmaker at last perceived that he was not alone in the world.
0	Honestly, was it possible to admit that William Guy and his five companions could have accomplished such a distance on a craft, and was there one chance in a hundred that they could ever be recovered?
0	Those boundless prairies, whose monotony is unbroken by a single hillock, were succeeded by a sandy desert gradually sloping up, for a distance of nearly four hundred miles, to the Rocky Mountains.
0	What do you think about it, Cyrus?"
0	It has been said that between a vigilant jailer and a prisoner who wishes to escape, the chances are in favor of the prisoner; the fact is, the interest of the one is keener than that of the other.
0	During these different journeys, Ferguson had been the most active and interesting correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, the penny newspaper whose circulation amounts to 140,000 copies, and yet scarcely suffices for its many legions of readers.
0	Possibly he might have made a useless attempt at flight when his eye fell on Thalcave.
0	Hence certain delays occurred, which all the impatience of Michael Strogoff could not avoid.
0	This trip was succeeded by a kangaroo hunt in the cow-pastures with Mr. Macarthur, one of the chief promoters of the prosperity of New South Wales.
0	Shall we keep the name of the Chimneys for our first encampment, captain?” “Yes, Pencroft, since you have so christened it.” “Good!
0	Here was an obstacle, indeed, which all his master's banknotes could not remove.
0	Some of these platforms extended over three hundred feet, and travelers by tarantass, when crossing them have experienced a nausea like sea-sickness.
0	A few days afterwards, King Guardafia came and threw himself on their mercy.
0	The _allegros_ were "long-drawn out" indeed.
0	They were almost suffocated with smoke, and scorched with the unbearable heat, for the conflagration had already reached the lower branches on their side of the OMBU.
0	The trees, both by their height and their thick foliage, bore witness to the vegetative power of the soil, more astonishing here than in any other part of the island.
0	He filled it himself, lighted it with a glowing coal, and appeared to be the happiest of quadrumana.
0	He opened it, and I saw a bundle of papers, yellow but still readable.
0	The French pitched three camps on land.
0	He forgot even the strangeness of the fate that had sent them wandering through these forbidden regions, like a bewildered comet that had lost its way.
0	Had they been killed in the struggle?
0	This project, the result of long elaboration, is the object of my present communication.
0	Their desires are limited, their existence is a modest one; they are calm, moderate, phlegmatic--in a word, they are Flemings; such as are still to be met with sometimes between the Scheldt and the North Sea.
0	This disposition of the soil is called <i>hraun</i>: the crumbled lava on the surface was in some instances like ship cables stretched out horizontally, in others coiled up in heaps; an immense field of lava came from the neighboring mountains, all extinct volcanoes, but whose remains showed what once they had been.
0	His glass never left his eyes.
0	He was like a prisoner that had escaped from prison, and knew not that it was necessary to re-enter it.
0	This was why several hundreds of prisoners were brought under the soldiers’ whips.
0	The astronomer who first gave names to those "seas" in all probability was a Frenchman.
0	A gun nine hundred feet long had been solemnly cast at Tampa Town, in the Floridan peninsula, and loaded with 400,000 lbs.
0	"And we shall profit by it, for my intention is to make for Bennet Islet.
0	When it approached the sides of the gallery, I took care to throw upon them the light of the lantern, and I was able to judge of the rapidity of motion by looking at the projecting masses of rock, which as soon as seen were again invisible.
0	I do not wish to pry into your secrets:  but I must confess that this Nautilus, with the motive power which is confined in it, the contrivances which enable it to be worked, the powerful agent which propels it, all excite my curiosity to the highest pitch.
0	Sometimes this state of affairs would last a whole month, and the stock-keeper would be driven to his wits’ end by his bleating, bellowing, neighing army.
0	"The very reason why you should go up.

0	Jean Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier, a captain of one of the East India Company's ships, was so struck by the immensity of the space surrounding the Southern Pole, known to geographers as the _Terra australis incognita_, that he begged for the privilege of prosecuting discoveries in these unknown regions.
0	On what part of the coast had the tempest thrown them?
0	After all, we did what we could.” The night passed, and whether the prisoner slept or not could not be known, but at any rate, although he had been unbound, he did not move.
0	He went to the poop, saying to himself, "He will be like a madman!"
0	In the avenues and long alleys there was already a large assemblage of people--the sun, which had risen at four o’clock, being well above the horizon--an extraordinary mixture of Europeans and Asiatics, talking, wrangling, haranguing, and bargaining.
0	At the same time a party of the staff joined in a kangaroo hunt, and crossing the Blue Mountains penetrated the Bathurst settlement.
0	Trains, like time and tide, stop for no one.
0	In 1760, another Frenchman, Imbert by name, and, in 1810, an Englishman, Robert Adams, had seen this curious place; but Rene Caillie was to be the first European who could bring back any authentic data concerning it.
0	We must not leave this place without doing all in our power to save him.
0	The distance of the Projectile from the Lunar surface, however, might be set down roughly at roughly The dispatch concluded with the following hypotheses, positively pronounced to be the only two possible: Either, 1, The Lunar attraction would finally prevail, in which case the travellers would reach their destination; or 2, The Projectile, kept whirling forever in an immutable orbit, would go on revolving around the Moon till time should be no more.
0	This was the ever-pressing question.

0	They sped rapidly and directly to the northwest, and the doctor’s anxiety gradually subsided.
0	Captain Furneaux had agreed to take a young man named Omai on board.
0	The excitement produced by the Moon's vicinity had died out.
0	Nothing further occurred to interrupt the voyage, until the two English vessels sighted Cape Frio.
0	To contend against this disaster would have been folly--nay, madness.
0	Cyrus Harding reflected a few minutes; he attentively observed the perimeter of the island, taking into consideration the height at which he was placed; then,-- “My friends,” said he, “I do not think I am mistaken in giving to the shore of the island a circumference of more than a hundred miles.” “And consequently an area?” “That is difficult to estimate,” replied the engineer, “for it is so uneven.” If Cyrus Harding was not mistaken in his calculation, the island had almost the extent of Malta or Zante, in the Mediterranean, but it was at the same time much more irregular and less rich in capes, promontories, points, bays, or creeks.
0	For two years, at least, no ship had been wrecked on that coast, neither above nor below the Cape.
0	There was nothing to show that J. T. Maston and Mrs. Scorbitt had anything to do with the affair.
0	This must have been of a far fiercer nature than it has ever been with us.
0	"Just so," said Nicholl, "and everything we throw out of the projectile will accompany it until it reaches the moon."
0	"Can a whale-fisher ever forget his old trade, sir?
0	The hurri cane blew nearly forty leagues an hour.
0	“Well, Cyrus,” said the reporter, “there seems to be nothing suspicious in this water.” “No, my dear Spilett,” replied the engineer, “and I really do not know how to account for the incident of yesterday.” “I acknowledge,” returned Spilett, “that the wound given this creature is, at least, very strange, and I cannot explain either how Top was so vigorously cast up out of the water.
0	This, since it had ceased to be formed by the original river bank, had considerably altered its aspect.
0	They were simply the last traces left by the torrent which had so long thundered through this cavity, and the air there was pure though slightly damp, but producing no mephitic exhalation.
0	“But till that time we must be very watchful,” said Herbert.
0	Ben Zoof!” ejaculated Servadac, who could scarcely shout loud enough to relieve his pent-up feelings.
0	The foot of the mast supported the partition which separated the two cabins, which were reached by two hatchways let into the deck.
0	At this moment the Nautilus arrived at the side of this high, perpendicular wall.

0	Then I suddenly lost the bottom altogether, proving that we had passed above a submarine mountain.

0	They imagined themselves walking through its unknown countries, climbing its highest peaks, descending into its lowest depths.
0	A castle or rather fort was built at the south-western extremity of the island, and some men left there under the command of Berthin de Berneval, while Béthencourt set out with the rest of his followers for the island of Erbania or Fortaventura.
0	Had I unwittingly provoked this fit of anger?
0	“Well, the story is about stealing diamonds, and a handful of those pretty stones is worth a million, sometimes two!” And Torres, whose face expressed the vilest sentiments of cupidity, almost unconsciously made a gesture of opening and shutting his hand.
0	Men that even the Great War had left the warmest of friends, now abused each other like fishwomen.
0	He had been shut up in the Custom House, and he was to be transferred to London the next day.
0	According to my idea, the Nautilus would attack the ship at her waterline, and then it would not only be possible, but easy to fly.

0	If to this is added that the animal is easily caught, it is not to be wondered at that the species is on its way to complete destruction.
0	To do this he had employed every means of conveyance--steamers, railways, carriages, yachts, trading-vessels, sledges, elephants.
0	The pipes intended for the oxygen were already laid.
0	Clothes:--2 dozen shirts of a peculiar material resembling wool, but evidently of a vegetable origin; 3 dozen stockings of the same material.
0	Such at least was Barbican's idea.
0	The least of the evils threatening me would have been the loss of my journals and note-books, the fruit of eight years of work.
0	THE TALK OF THE CREW  .
0	“If our asteroid has carried with it a portion of the old earth’s atmosphere, why should it not likewise retain something of its central fire?” “Ah, well!” said the captain, shrugging his shoulders, “I dare say there is caloric enough in our little world to supply the wants of its population.” Count Timascheff interrupted the silence that followed this conversation by saying, “And now, gentlemen, as our course has brought us on our way once more towards Gibraltar, what do you say to our renewing our acquaintance with the Englishmen?
0	Soon Keeling Island disappeared from the horizon, and our course was directed to the north-west in the direction of the Indian Peninsula.
0	Notwithstanding the distance, and the noise of the wind and sea, one heard distinctly the loud strokes of the animal's tail, and even its panting breath.
0	Quite convenient for barking, and even for man-eating!” “But one thing that has been, unfortunately, proven true, is, the ferocity of these tribes, who are really very fond of human flesh, and devour it with avidity.” “I only hope that they won’t take such a particular fancy to mine!” said Joe, with comic solemnity.
0	The general opinion was that the river took its rise in a small sheet of water known as Deer Lake, sixty miles from Cass Lake.
0	Above this large pond passed the Balloch railway.
0	Such were the relations of the first men to the first animals in the early ages of the world.
0	Meanwhile Valentine has begun her recitative, "I am alone," &c.; but she hurries it.
0	“That enables them to track any horses that may stray from the station, and prevents their being mixed with other herds.” The horse was soon shod.
0	The mountainous country, near the Hindoo Koosh range, confronted him, but this was no barrier to him, and after great fatigue, which he bore with equal patience and good-humour, he reached the important town of Herat.
0	In a few seconds, before he had even time to fire his second barrel, he fell, struck to the heart by Harding's dagger, more sure even than his gun.
0	The man came from the eastern provinces, and had followed the left bank of the river.
0	Better armed than the whale, whose upper jaw is furnished only with whalebone, it is supplied with twenty-five large tusks, about eight inches long, cylindrical and conical at the top, each weighing two pounds.
0	The conversation turned on the convicts after the ladies had left the table.
0	There the same ceremonies had to be gone through as at the court of Prince Sartach.
0	Why, then, on this evening at Collaert the banker's, did the syrups seem to be transformed into heady wines, into sparkling champagne, into heating punches?
0	Top darted after them as fast as his four legs could carry him, but the emus distanced him with ease, so prodigious was their speed.
0	"Well," he said, after giving me time thoroughly to appreciate the marvels of this underground sea, "do you feel strong enough to walk up and down?"
0	"I think we can answer your question categorically," replied Barbican, "if you modify its form a little."
0	They are known in the country under the name of mehari.
0	He, too, must have contemplated this eventuality, and he had not renounced his purpose of further search without being fully convinced of the folly of a last attempt.
0	“Let us go,” said Benito; “we must have all ready before night, and we have no time to lose.” The young men returned on board by way of the canal bank, which led along the Rio Negro.
0	During the five ensuing days Cyrus Harding and his unfortunate companions husbanded their provisions with the most extreme care, eating only what would prevent them from succumbing to starvation.
0	"Probably not," said Ardan, "but why not?"
0	Each piece, suspended on a small, thin skewer, was hung over a fire of green wood.
0	The landing at Toulon of the young Frenchman fresh from Timbuctoo, was a very unexpected event in the scientific world.
0	not so far, I imagine, and if it is not a matter of going beyond the eighty-fourth parallel--" "Who can tell," replied the boatswain, "at all events the _Halbrane_ will make more degrees of latitude than any other ship before her."

0	The 25th brought no other result, nor the 26th.
0	All doubt as to the precise date of Gama's first voyage is now at an end, thanks to the document in the public library at Oporto, a paper with which Castañeda must have been acquainted, and of which M.

0	The numerous robberies committed after the accident, the body of the guard picked up about half a mile from Camden Bridge, proved that this catastrophe was the result of a crime.
0	Glad to have accomplished the aim of their expedition, the explorers wintered at the mouth of the river, and when the fine weather set in they made their way back to St. Louis, arriving there in May, 1806, after an absence of two years, four months, and ten days.
0	Here the expedition was divided into two parties, one, under the command of Major Long, to make its way to the sources of the Red River, the other, under Captain Bell, to go down the Arkansas as far as Port Smith.

0	I've been an itinerant singer, a circus-rider, when I used to vault like Leotard, and dance on a rope like Blondin.
0	It is needless to say that Captain Len Guy proved himself a true seaman, that James West had an eye to everything, that the crew seconded them loyally, and that Hunt was always foremost when there was work to be done or danger to be incurred.
0	During that time, the steward--dumb, perhaps deaf--had arranged the table, and laid three plates.
0	The natives, after some slight hesitation and disorder, returned to the attack with great bravery; and the captain, noticing the constantly increasing numbers of the assailants, was not without anxiety as to the result, when an unexpected event put an end to the contest.

0	Mr. Strachey's horse was nearly thrown to the ground, and the secretary regained his equilibrium with difficulty.
0	The various ports which Bougainville discovered are particularly valuable, as they offer favourable points for doubling Cape Forward, one of the most difficult routes for sailors on account of the violent and contrary winds which prevail there.

0	Nevertheless, I did not fail to take into due account the share that belongs to chance in human affairs, for it is wise, as Edgar Poe has said, always "to reckon with the unforeseen, the unexpected, the inconceivable, which have a very large share (in those affairs), and chance ought always to be a matter of strict calculation."
0	The natives of this country had never heard of the English, and took them for Moguls, Afghans, or Hindus.

0	But with a violent effort he controlled himself.

0	These honest fellows, nothing loth to tell all that they knew and more that they invented, soon had the satisfaction of finding themselves the centrepoint of a wonder stricken audience, greedily swallowing up every item of the extraordinary news and still hungrily gaping for more.
0	They expected to find a bloodthirsty man, happy in his revenge.
0	And then what satisfaction there would be in having accomplished what so many others dared not undertake!
0	Another weed known as velp, with leaves four feet long, buried in the coral concretions, hung at the bottom.

0	The houses on the bank, built of wood, took fire in every direction.
0	This arrangement subjected all objects to but one reflection, making the view consequently much clearer; the result was that, when they were taking observation, J. T. Maston and Belfast were placed in the _upper_ part of the instrument and not in the lower, which they reached by a circular staircase, a masterpiece of lightness, while below them opened a metal well terminated by the metallic mirror, which measured two hundred and eighty feet in depth.

0	"The ground rises gently from the English encampment to the centre of the isle, but before its greatest height is reached, one meets with sloping glade, covered with fine clover, and many brilliant flowers, and bordered by beautiful fruit-trees.
0	After stopping four days at Fortaventura, one of the Canaries, to take in wood and water there, he reached Teneriffe, where Captain Brereton ought to have rejoined him.
0	However that may have been, Mr. Fogg carefully put his watch upon the table, and observed its advancing hands.
0	I saw none but female penitents, not a single man was there amongst them.

0	Then, after gaining his confidence, when the Tartars have invested Irkutsk, he will betray the town, and with it my brother, whose life he seeks.
0	Three other reports, in quicker succession, were heard.
0	Should they meet them again?
0	In Canada, however, some stir was made, particularly among the French; and at Quebec a syndicate was formed for the purpose of competing with the company at Baltimore.
0	It was you whom they sought for this diamond affair, whom they convicted of crime and sentenced to death, and it was you who escaped from the prison at Villa Rica a few hours before you should have been executed!
0	"I am here," replied Mr. Fogg.
0	He was not there, or rather, Mr. Jeorling, he was no longer there.
0	Everywhere and always the geological works of nature, never the work of man.
0	There is, therefore, nothing to fear.
0	Leaving this revolting spectacle, they went to another small island, which received the name of San Juan, being discovered on St. John's Day; to this they added the word _Culua_, which they heard used by the natives of these shores.
0	The products of the country are much the same as those of Timmannee.
0	"This morning," writes the traveller, "we visited the far-famed _Niger_ or _Quorra_, which flows by the city about a mile from our residence, and were greatly disappointed at the appearance of this celebrated river.
0	They therefore followed the crest of one of the spurs, between which the creek that supplied the lake probably had its source.
0	"Let us be prepared for getting there, any how," was Barbican's dubious reply.
0	A sailor can change the head of his ship as he pleases; an aeronaut can give a vertical motion to his balloon.
0	This scientific dispute lasted so long that it made Michel very impatient.
0	"There is a sound of crashing," said the doctor, "as if icebergs and ice-fields were being blown against one another."
0	Four days passed thus without the state of things being in anywise altered.
0	He had been carried by a tribe of natives four hundred miles north of the 37th parallel.
0	In doing so, he had simply obeyed the laws of his nature, and we have good reason to believe that he was, to some extent, a fatalist, but of an orthodox school of fatalism withal, that led him to rely upon himself and even upon Providence.
0	But admitting the parabola, the projectile must quickly have passed through the cone of shadow projected into space opposite the sun.
0	"Sir," I said coldly, "I have to speak to you on a matter that admits of no delay."
0	Perhaps it would be decided to make in common a complete investigation of every part of Lincoln Island.
0	Their courage was evidently the inverse ratio of their speed--in decamping.
0	The reception was cordial, and the repast, served in European style, was delicious.
0	Half an hour after being sighted, this luminous point had disappeared behind the dark horizon; but the verification of this phenomenon was of considerable consequence in their selenographic studies.
0	They worked briskly, encouraged by the cheery songs of the boatswain.
0	He tells how the great khan ascended the throne in the year 1256, being then eighty-five; he was a man of middle height, rather stout, but of a fine figure, with a good complexion and black eyes.

0	Not only has this town no fort, but it has not even a jetty.
0	It drove away the foreigners who had settled in the Moluccas or in the Islands of Sunda, or who came thither to obtain a cargo of spices; it even went the length, in order to raise the price of this valuable commodity, of proscribing the cultivation of certain species in a large number of islands, and of forbidding, under pain of death, the exportation and sale of seeds and cuttings of the spice-producing trees.
0	Then--was it because of their being out of breath?--their wrath subsided, or at least only betrayed itself by a succession of unseemly epithets.
0	It was not only the art for art’s sake which guided him, it was a sentiment of justice, of pity toward a man suffering under an unjust condemnation.
0	It was therefore necessary to pass for humble and unfortunate shipwrecked travelers.
0	Presently afterward the secretary of the Gun Club appeared at the top of the cone in a triumphant attitude.
0	From the first the relations between the natives of this island and the Russians were extremely satisfactory.

0	Although they quenched their thirst with the abundant water-melons, they could not do so without ill results to their health.
0	"The new servant," said he.
0	There was plenty to do.
0	It gives their true names to true personages; but before trying to understand it I ought to begin by counting the number of words it contains, and even when this is done its true meaning may be missed.” In saying this Torres began to count mentally.
0	The black points at first traced a long furrow on the top of the water, and then disappeared for a time.
0	observed the reporter, who was anxious to bring forward every possible objection.
0	It would have been a far more correct and appropriate expression, had he said, "let us slide," for we were going down an inclined plane with perfect ease.
0	And would he appear on Saturday, the 21st of December, at a quarter before nine in the evening, on the threshold of the Reform Club saloon?
0	The first town the brothers came to was Bajiebo, a large and spacious city, which for dirt, noise, and confusion, could not be surpassed.
0	"I believe we're not fellows to be afraid of a bullet, and as for me, if Captain Harding approves, I'm ready to dash into the forest!

0	They are situated twenty-five leagues westward of the Pernicious Islands.
0	The naturalists also made excursions to the desert of Pierra, where they collected specimens of petrified shells imbedded in a tertiary stratum precisely similar to that in the suburbs of Paris.
0	As for Fix, he had arrested Mr. Fogg because it was his duty, whether Mr. Fogg were guilty or not.
0	The current was not long in seizing it, and coasting the left bank, the islands of Iquitos and Parianta were passed on the right.
0	The exchange of telegraphic dispatches with Moscow was incessant.
0	They therefore waited with some impatience, when an incident occurred which increased the desire the settlers had to visit the whole of their domain.
0	As to bottles and tumblers, that was only play.
0	The projectile sustained a certain shock, which was sensibly felt in the interior.
0	In these simultaneous observations they thought themselves justified in estimating the minimum length of the mammal at more than three hundred and fifty feet, as the Shannon and Helvetia were of smaller dimensions than it, though they measured three hundred feet over all.
0	The seal had come within ten feet of his enemy; the bear hastened towards him, made a long leap, and stood stupefied three paces from Hatteras, who, casting aside the sealskin, with one knee resting on the ground, was aiming at the bear's heart.
0	He picked himself and his blackboard up.
0	"Yes, if they had any interest in doing so."
0	The sailor then thought that they could utilize this ebb and flow for the transport of heavy objects.
0	he exclaimed; "why, it's only eight minutes before ten."
0	Its immense area was singularly adapted to the purpose.
0	I know what it is,” answered Benito.
0	Besides, the pace of the horses must be regulated by the slower pace of the bullocks, truly mechanical engines which lose in time what they gain in power.
0	Astronomers, we must allow, have graced these pretended seas with at least odd names, which science has respected up to the present time.
0	At last, on the 7th of November, the admiral entered the harbour of San-Lucar.
0	No want of snow and ice; and perhaps Lincoln Island is just as rigorously tried.
0	When he saw that nothing had changed in the conditions of the Earth’s movement, he was buoyed up with hope that some accident had retarded the work of Barbicane and Nicholl.
0	he exclaimed, in tones of decided emotion; "we have _not_ fallen back to Earth; nor are we lying in the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico.
0	asked the doctor, whose curiosity was aroused by these remarks of a man who had had experience in what he was talking about.
0	Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft chatted, whilst examining this part of their domain, which was new to them, and, in proportion as the canoe proceeded towards the south, the two Mandible Capes appeared to move, and surround Union Bay more closely.
0	Trees, meadows, all disappeared beneath a covering several inches in depth.
0	Thanks to him, and thanks to his apparatus, I was each day nearer the completion of my submarine studies; and I was rewriting my book of submarine depths in its very element.
0	“To Manoel Valdez, who will be glad if your brother will introduce me.” “Oh, away with your nonsense!” cried Benito.
0	He made himself known as a London detective, told his business at Bombay, and the position of affairs relative to the supposed robber, and nervously asked if a warrant had arrived from London.
0	He avoided him, more silent, more shut into himself than ever!
0	“The weather is stormy,” observed Herbert.
0	Our sailors were perfectly confident, and could not refrain from drinking "success to the event"; and although this was a little premature, we added our hurrahs to theirs.
0	At a sign from him the anchor was dropped, but the chain scarcely ran, for it was little more than a yard deep, and this spot was one of the highest points of the bank of pintadines.
0	Pencroft again brought the brig within the range of the telescope, and could see that she was of between three and four hundred tons burden, wonderfully narrow, well-masted, admirably built, and must be a very rapid sailer.
0	Her commander, Captain Bennet, had the name of being a very amiable person, and he took a particular interest in the doctor’s expedition, having been one of that gentleman’s admirers for a long time.
0	As they approached the light grew brighter, and soon they enjoyed its full brilliancy; they advanced in full illumination, and their sharply cut shadows ran out behind them over the snow.
0	For several days past I had not seen the half-breed, or, least, I had not exchanged a word with him.
0	"First impressions are always right," he muttered philosophically.
0	The most densely populated of these 'quebradas' is that rising at the south-west corner of the town.
0	And besides, do not forget that he formed part of the crew of the _Grampus_ and your brother Ned, if I don't mistake--'" "He said that, boatswain; he spoke of the _Grampus_!"
0	Upon the 28th of October Anderson expired, after four months' illness, and Mungo Park found himself once more alone in the heart of Africa.
0	In fact, I had settled in my own mind, if I could find a continent where sufficient provisions were procurable, to remain near its coast until the sun had passed the Equator, then to gain a distant southern latitude and to proceed westward towards the Cape of Good Hope, and to return eastward after touching at the Falkland Islands, should it be necessary, and thence to proceed quickly to Europe."
0	Rain and snow succeeded each other uninterruptedly.
0	No such mistake can be supposed!
0	It has split the lower part of the hull, instead of blowing up the deck and topsides!
0	The moon above, the sun beneath, were inundating it with their fire.
0	He had it conveyed in small quantities, carefully packed in sealed cases.
0	Only a few scattered huts could be seen through the pestilential mists; but the appearance of the country soon changed, for it often happens in Africa that some of the unhealthiest districts lie close beside others that are perfectly salubrious.
0	"Let us have the formula."
0	repeated the engineer, again pointing in the direction of Granite House.
0	"So, sir," I rejoined, "you give us simply the choice between life and death?"
0	The master died of his wounds.
0	But the thought of it was too much for him.
0	He owed his life to the man whom he detested most in the world.
0	Here they were compelled to stop, for not only had the bridge completely disappeared, but the river itself no longer existed.

0	“As yet we have seen no dangerous animals.
0	"We know you, Doctor," said Bell, "and you can speak without fear of interruption."
0	We then learned from maps that the _Paracuta_ had debouched into the Pacific from the land called Clarie by Dumont d'Urville, and the land called Fabricia, which was discovered in 1838 by Bellenny.
0	She was sacrificing her life.
0	The soil is dry, the air very healthy; and the King of Woolli told me that no white man had ever died at Fataconda."
0	Bodies were lying half buried beneath the snow; here an arm, there a leg, or clinched hands, and faces still preserving an expression of despair.
0	Yet more--and this was a flagrant insult to British pride--the English found themselves escorted by a guard, which prevented their taking any other route.
0	certainly not," replied Nicholl; "but our scuttles are fixed on hinges; they can be let down.
0	But this document might still be worth a fortune if, supposing I am acquitted or executed, it should ever escape him.
0	The Marchioness and Countess de Montalembert, the Countess of Podenas, Mademoiselle la Garde, the Marquis de Montalembert, rose from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine for these unknown regions, and the Duke de Chartres exhibited much skill and presence of mind in his ascent on the 15th of July, 1784.
0	Here and there could be seen an isolated farm, some solitary bur, or Icelandic house, built of wood, earth, fragments of lava--looking like beggars on the highway of life.
0	They were no longer in search of Harry Grant.
0	You were right in saying that the existence of that open sea has been formally recognized by Weddell."
0	Seven hundred and fifty miles of smooth waters presented no very difficult task to a fast traveller like the _Susquehanna_, yet it was not till two days and a-half afterwards that she sighted the Golden Gate.
0	But for those beasts we should have been lost.
0	Quiros therefore went to Spain and thence to Rome, where he received a kindly welcome from the Pope, who recommended him warmly to Philip III.
0	So soon as the French imagined they were at a fair distance, they launched two boats in pursuit.
0	In any case, the singular resemblance gives rise to reflection.
0	“I recognize him!” cried Pencroft, and it seemed as if his gun went off by itself.
0	Michael and the girl loaded themselves with as much as they could carry.
0	If he be only a sort of brute, he possesses plenty of courage, and has showed it in getting you out of a bad corner at the risk of his life.
0	Let us open a way for them!” “What!
0	Some feeble sounds--quite perceptible, however--were heard.
0	It was eight o’clock in the evening when the two carriages reached Ichim.
0	“They are colpeo foxes!” he exclaimed.
0	The luminous part traced on the sea an immense oval, much elongated, the centre of which condensed a burning heat, whose overpowering brilliancy died out by successive gradations.
0	"I propose we lie down and take a good nap."
0	There was, however, not much room for this sanguine expectation, for if a new asteroid had thus been brought into existence, it must be a sphere of extremely limited dimensions, and there could be little chance that it embraced more than the merest fraction of either France or Russia.
0	It was thereabouts that Feringhea, the Thuggee chief, king of the stranglers, held his sway.
0	Here, to our mutual surprise, we found an actual flight of stone steps, which wonderfully assisted our ascent.
0	I asked him no questions, but he guessed my thoughts, and answered of his own accord the questions which I was burning to address to him.
0	The colonists, therefore, were careful to observe the sea around the island, and every day their telescope covered the horizon enclosed by Union and Washington Bays.
0	At the northern extremity of the bay the outline of the shore was continued to a great distance in a wider curve.
0	Mr. Fogg learned all this in consulting his Bradshaw, which gave him the daily movements of the trans-Atlantic steamers.
0	When Grijalva landed, he was received with the same honour as the Indians paid to their gods; they burnt copal incense before him, and laid at his feet more than 1500 piastres' worth of small gold jewels, as well as green pearls and copper hatchets.
0	But neither there, nor in any other part of Mount Franklin, did the colonists find any traces of him of whom they were in search.
0	Their mode of cooking these articles was extremely simple, though not so much so as their style of dress, for they went about in a state of nature, unrelieved even by the traditional fig-leaf.
0	According to his own observations, Barbicane reckoned that they would land on her northern hemisphere, where stretch immense plains, and where mountains are rare.
0	But it is to be regretted that Tristan d'Acunha has not a single port.
0	“What do you want with me?” said Marfa.
0	If any unexpected event should oblige us to go to Melbourne, we might be sorry not to find the DUNCAN there.
0	But at this depth of some yards, the Nautilus was unmoved by its fury and reposed peacefully in still water.

0	At intervals a puff of wind came from the east, but it soon died away in the narrow valley of the Angara.
0	These two streams, which lower down became rivers by the absorption of several tributaries, were formed by all the springs of the mountain and thus caused the fertility of its southern part.
0	But although it was the middle of summer in this part of the world, the cold became daily more intense.
0	The tufts of bush and the branches made me a ladder, and I found a kind of grotto already hollowed out in the rock under this hut; I had only to bore some feet in soft earth, and here I am.” Twenty noiseless kisses were his reward.
0	It was no longer to the advocate that the accused applied; it was to the chief justice of the province that the convict appealed.

0	He used to refer them to Johnson.
0	Two days after this occurrence, the stranger appeared to wish gradually to mingle with their common life.
0	And from this day it began to be whispered about that the charming Lina was engaged to Fragoso, that their marriage would take place at the same time as that of Minha and Manoel, and that the young couple would remain at Belem with the others.
0	"And I may add," said Herbert, "that the eucalyptus belongs to a family which comprises many useful members; the guava-tree, from whose fruit guava jelly is made; the clove-tree, which produces the spice; the pomegranate-tree, which bears pomegranates; the Eugeacia Cauliflora, the fruit of which is used in making a tolerable wine; the Ugui myrtle, which contains an excellent alcoholic liquor; the Caryophyllus myrtle, of which the bark forms an esteemed cinnamon; the Eugenia Pimenta, from whence comes Jamaica pepper; the common myrtle, from whose buds and berries spice is sometimes made; the Eucalyptus manifera, which yields a sweet sort of manna; the Guinea Eucalyptus, the sap of which is transformed into beer by fermentation; in short, all those trees known under the name of gum-trees or iron-bark trees in Australia, belong to this family of the myrtaceæ, which contains forty-six genera and thirteen hundred species!"
0	No defects to be afraid of, for the double shell is as firm as iron; no rigging to attend to; no sails for the wind to carry away; no boilers to burst; no fire to fear, for the vessel is made of iron, not of wood; no coal to run short, for electricity is the only mechanical agent; no collision to fear, for it alone swims in deep water; no tempest to brave, for when it dives below the water it reaches absolute tranquillity.
0	Glenarvan, with Robert at his side, galloped along without saying a word.
0	The opportunity that was wanted soon came.
0	All was understood by the old Siberian, and though the young girl was ignorant that her much-regretted companion still lived, she at least knew his relationship to her whom she had made her mother; and she thanked God for having given her the joy of taking the place of the son whom the prisoner had lost.
0	These orders were executed, and the frigate moved rapidly from the burning light.
0	I saw clearly the cultivated ranges, and the several mountain-chains that run parallel with the side, and the volcanoes that overtop Mouna-Rea, which rise 5,000 yards above the level of the sea.

0	In a word, they made what has been for some years called “the great political and military reports.” It will be seen, in following them, that they had generally an independent mode of viewing events, and, above all, their consequences, each having his own way of observing and appreciating.
0	Nothing is more wonderful or more singular than those enormous specimens of the order of the myrtaceæ, with their leaves placed vertically and not horizontally, so that an edge and not a surface looks upwards, the effect being that the sun's rays penetrate more freely among the trees.
0	By that time I had come to realize that the "hallucination" of Captain Len Guy was a truth, and that he and the captain of the _Jane_ (also a reality) were connected with each other by this ocean waif from the authentic expedition of Arthur Pym.
0	“My friend,” said Manoel to the foreman of the raft, “just feel in the pocket of the waistcoat.” The foreman obeyed.
0	"So, then," said the doctor, "this is our exact position; we have reached North Lincoln, exactly at Cape Eden; we are entering Jones's Sound; if we had been a little luckier, we should have found the sea open to Baffin's Bay.

0	On the 5th of April, Cook arrived in sight of Harvey Island, which he had discovered during his second voyage in 1773.
0	For beverages they had a good store of the best that country produced; _“caysuma”_ or _“machachera,”_ from the Upper and Lower Amazon, an agreeable liquor of slightly acidulated taste, which is distilled from the boiled root of the sweet manioc; _“beiju,”_ from Brazil, a sort of national brandy, the _“chica”_ of Peru; the _“mazato”_ of the Ucayali, extracted from the boiled fruits of the banana-tree, pressed and fermented; _“guarana,”_ a kind of paste made from the double almond of the _“paulliniasorbilis,”_ a genuine tablet of chocolate so far as its color goes, which is reduced to a fine powder, and with the addition of water yields an excellent drink.

0	On the evening of the first day the colonists encamped about nine miles from Granite House, on the border of a little stream falling into the Mercy, and of the existence of which they had till then been ignorant; it evidently, however, belonged to the hydrographical system to which the soil owed its astonishing fertility.

0	Solid, morally and physically, he was “deep in the water,” to employ a metaphor of Napoleon’s, and could hold his own against wind or tide.
0	Happily there was no want of tools with which to shape the wood, nor of iron-work to make it firm, nor of the ingenuity of a man who had a marvellous knowledge of the work, nor lastly, the zeal of his companions, who in seven months had necessarily acquired great skill in the use of their tools; and it must be said that not the least skillful was Gideon Spilett, who in dexterity almost equalled the sailor himself.
0	During this first trip Humboldt visited the Chayma and Guarauno Missions.

0	But, in spite of all their ceremonies, the sky remained clear and beautiful, and they profited nothing by their slaughtered sheep and their ugly grimaces.
0	Pulling out his tablets, he reviewed his calculations regarding the motion of projectiles, their velocities, ranges and paths, their retardations and their accelerations, jotting down the figures with a rapidity wonderful to behold.
0	The horses' heads were also guarded by iron plates.

0	A room was engaged for the young woman, and Mr. Fogg, after seeing that she wanted for nothing, set out in search of her cousin Jeejeeh.
0	But the projectile was advancing, and sensibly nearing it.
0	These threats of Silfax are formidable--no doubt about it!
0	These are very few for a town of Spanish origin, though to them should perhaps be added the Carmelite Convent, burned down in 1850, of which only the ruins remain.
0	A professional surgeon would have had difficulty in determining this at once, and still more so the reporter.
0	"Of course I am, Atkins.
0	As the notches in this cane were very numerous, the slits had been made all round, so that whichever way the wind blew it went through some of them.

0	The most frequently occurring trees were knaries and eucalypti of gigantic dimensions.
0	The weather having cleared, the settlers climbed the height above Granite House.

0	The crops had ripened rapidly during the excessive heat of January, when the orbit of Gallia was being traversed at its perihelion, and were now exposed to the depredations of many thousands of birds; and although a goodly number of stacks attested the industry of Ben Zoof during the time of the _Dobryna_‘s voyage, it was only too apparent that the portion of the harvest that remained ungathered was liable to the most imminent risk of being utterly devoured.
0	Now, what was the use of these two manoeuvres, unless the vessel had been employed in some expedition?
0	He resolved to meet these dangers with his usual energy.
0	But I had scarcely spoken, when Captain Nemo imposed silence, saying: "I am the law, and I am the judge!
0	But the weather became very cold and unpleasant; the snow-squalls became as violent as in winter; they all found themselves nearly exhausted.
0	An incessant rain of bolides falling on his surface compensates sufficiently for the heat that he is continually giving forth.
0	After we had passed an hour or more in silent contemplation of the wondrous spectacle, we rose and went down towards the bank on our way to the grotto, which I was not sorry to gain.

0	In fact, rumor of the rising of the Kirghiz hordes, and of the Tartar invasion had transpired in some degree.

0	Was he overwhelmed by the presence of men whose fellow he had once been?
0	However, we will see how M. N---- bears it at first."
0	At the outset of the conversation he took the affirmative, and assumed the part of an accuser.
0	He therefore dilated the hydrogen in his balloon, and it rapidly rose.
0	"The iceberg wall is split on the south-east."
0	On May 14th, 1616, after a voyage in which nothing worthy of remark occurred, the two captains penetrated into Davis' Strait, sighted Cape Henderson's Hope, the extreme point formerly reached by Davis, and ascended as high as 72 degrees 40 minutes to the Women's Island, thus named after some Esquimaux females whom they met with.
0	They also saw numbers of birds, kites, hawks, cockatoos, orioles, paroquets, pigeons, and other unknown birds.
0	From this shelter they beheld the attack on the _Jane_ by sixty pirogues, the defence made by the six men on board; the invasion of the ship by the savages, and finally the explosion which caused the death of a vast number of natives as well as the complete destruction of the ship.
0	A brave man wouldn’t care a bit for them!” Upon this they agreed with the one voice to follow their original programme.
0	They counted the hours as they passed too slow for their wish; Barbicane and Nicholl were obstinately plunged in their calculations, Michel going and coming between the narrow walls, and watching that impassive moon with a longing eye.
0	In fact, the tides of the Pacific, even at their maximum elevation, could never reach the level of the river, and, doubtless, millions of years would pass before the water would have worn away the granite and hollowed a practicable mouth.
0	The ship was afterwards in equal danger, when the ice formed beneath, raising her and bearing her up as though she had been lifted by some instrument."
0	“A goblin!” “A goblin, a brownie, a fairy’s child,” repeated Jack Ryan, “a cousin of the Fire-Maidens, an Urisk, whatever you like!
0	their decision was taken to quit the island, no matter by what means.
0	As a matter of course, the engineer, James Starr, as well as Simon Ford, the discoverers of this rich carboniferous region, shared largely in the profits.
0	The colonists then reached the stern of the brig--the part formerly surmounted by the poop.
0	One would have called them the eyes of some wild beast trying to fascinate his prey before he sprang on it.

0	Did he possess to a very great degree the principle of natural heat which he wanted his men to possess?
0	And never had this delicious beverage been so welcome and refreshing.
0	Still the darkness was not complete during this long absence of the sun; the moon did its best to replace it; the stars were exceedingly brilliant, the auroras were very frequent, and the refractions peculiar to the snowy horizons; besides, the sun at the time of its greatest southern declension, December 21st, approaches within thirteen degrees of the polar horizon; hence, every day there was a certain twilight for a few hours.
0	"What is the matter, Vasling?"
0	It was eight feet in length, five in breadth.
0	"Dr. Clawbonny," asked Johnson, "what is the usual temperature of living beings?"

0	As soon as he arrived at Cananore, Gama obtained an audience of the Rajah, who authorized him to establish a counting-house, and to build a fort.
0	“Ask Dr. Ferguson to come in,” was the quiet remark of Sir Francis And come in the doctor did, and stood there, quite unmoved by the thunders of applause that greeted his appearance.
0	Should the island be inhabited after all, and should some one have taken possession of her?
0	In the first place, how do you propose to get to Sneffels?"
0	The farm servants, on equal footing with their master, were already in their places to take their share of the meal.
0	"That little creek, shut in by rocks, seems to me to be just the harbour we want."
0	But a glimpse of the Sierras looming in the western horizon gave them courage and strength enough to reach Wadsworth, at their foot, a little before midnight.
0	The son of a gentleman of _Cota e Armas_, Ferdinand de Magellan was born either at Oporto, at Lisbon, at Villa de Sabrossa, or at Villa de Figueiro, it is not actually known which; the date of his birth is unknown, but it took place towards the end of the fifteenth century.
0	They preferred the oily portions of the flesh of the seals upon which they lived--a taste which Cook attributed to the fact that the oil warmed their blood, and enabled them to resist the intense cold.
0	There he held on in the front row with crossed arms, glaring at President Barbicane.
0	If my poor Hatteras had at first found so open a sea, he would have soon reached the Pole, his companions would not have deserted him, and he would not have lost his reason under his terrible sufferings!"
0	Pigafetta's funeral eulogy, though a little hyperbolical, is not untrue in the main.
0	The brig sailed along very near the coast; they were able to see on some sheltered rocks a few bushes bearing modest little roses, some reddish moss, and a budding dwarf willow barely rising above the ground.
0	We are unable to exchange a word, or hear each other speak.
0	These are the only ties which bind me to the earth.
0	They were not to attack them, but were to be on their guard.
0	"I have no recollection of the circumstance.
0	The captive thinks oftener of escaping than the jailer of preventing his flight, and hence we hear of frequent and wonderful escapes.
0	Let us cast a glance behind us and enumerate the main features of the progress made in this long series of years.
0	The constellations alone claimed all their attention; and we must allow that the astronomers Faye, Charconac, and Secchi, never found themselves in circumstances so favorable for their observation.
0	I should have said (to be more exact) the north-east.
0	He was most probably alone, for, if Neb had been with him, he would have made his way more directly towards the Chimneys.
0	"Granted it's northward," resumed Shandon.
0	At eight o'clock in the evening, reckoning as above ground, where there is day and night, we are not more than two leagues from the mighty beast.
0	The geographer recognized that it was so, from their eye sockets being hollow and deprived of eye-balls.
0	"Yes, a lighthouse; it will be of use to show us our way back at night when we are returning from distant excursions, and to light up the neighborhood in the eight months of winter."
0	But suddenly, in the middle of a foaming circle, Top reappeared.
0	We were now in a large cavern where air was not wanting.
0	Could there be a more conclusive testimony to his worth than this from a stranger?
0	On the 9th of October of the same year the Pope made Carpini Bishop of Antivari in Dalmatia, and this celebrated traveller died at Rome about the year Carpini's mission was not of much use, and the Tartars remained much as they were before, a savage and ferocious tribe; but six years after his return another monk of the minor order of Franciscans, named William Rubruquis, of Belgian origin, was sent to the barbarians who lived in the country between the Volga and the Don.
0	Although but two feet apart, our aeronauts could not hear each other speak, but with firmly-clinched hands they clung convulsively to the cordage, and endeavored to steady themselves against the fury of the tempest.
0	The sky was veiled with light gray clouds, which moderated the heat of the sun, and allowed the travelers to venture on a journey by day.
0	As for side-arms, they had been taken from the museum of antiquities,--flint hatchets, helmets, Frankish battle-axes, javelins, halberds, rapiers, and so on; and also in those domestic arsenals commonly known as "cupboards" and "kitchens."
0	The town contains 20,000 houses, apart from those belonging to the Ghebers, who are estimated at 4000.
0	At the same time Top began to run round the mouth of the well, which opened at the extremity of the interior passage.
0	cried Ardan, not at all soothed by his friend's patronizing tone, and sticking like a man to his first assertion right or wrong.
0	Louis could not believe it, but Penellan convinced him that after his disappearance Vasling had always acted so as to secure Marie's hand.
0	We may imagine that an ordinary thermometer would afford no result under the circumstances in which this instrument was to be exposed.
0	Then, with the pickaxe and spade, the windows and doors were properly shaped, the jagged edges were smoothed off, and a few days after the beginning of the work, Granite House was abundantly lighted by the rising sun, whose rays penetrated into its most secret recesses.
0	Meanwhile, the cashier had not so much as raised his head.
0	A dead calm prevailing, the first and second days were spent in opening relations with the natives.
0	He was at last in India, the kingdom of the worshippers of the Sun and of the descendants of Cush.
0	I thanked him, but declined his offer, preferring to employ my leisure on land in some mineralogical studies.
0	At any rate, even if it should occur, I do not think Prospect Heights would be seriously threatened.
0	For some days their life continued as before.
0	From that day, Louis Cornbutte and his comrades passed through many other trials; but the lemons, which they found, restored them to health.
0	Madame Blanchard rose in a small sized balloon, to avoid the expense of filling, and she was forced to entirely inflate it.
0	He never found out that the servant had taken the precaution of hiding his own gold watch and those of Pearce and Clapperton about his person.
0	The horses were soon unsaddled, and began to graze on the thick grass which carpeted the ground.
0	What's the matter with this fellow?"
0	The boat was washed out of the davits by the force of the water.
0	Their offers for the recovery of the body of their unfortunate captain were in vain.
0	Then Cyrus Harding, having ended his survey, re-ascended, drew up the ladder, covered the mouth of the well, and returned thoughtfully to the diningroom, saying to himself,-- “I have seen nothing, and yet there is something there!” In the evening the hunters returned, having enjoyed good sport, and being literally loaded with game; indeed, they had as much as four men could possibly carry.
0	The wind had made a harsh attack upon the field.
0	They soon agreed on a principle from which they readily deducted the following general law: _Every object thrown out of the Projectile should partake of the Projectile's motion: it should therefore follow the same path, and never cease to move until the Projectile itself came to a stand-still._ But, in sober truth, they were at anything but a loss of subjects of warm discussion.
0	She looked up for a moment and her face brightened on recognizing her traveling companion.
0	[Illustration] The boatswain remained at Fort Providence alone, but not idle.
0	The silence would have been complete but for the grindings of the wheels of the tarantass over the road, the creaking of the axles, the snorting of the horses, and the clattering of their iron hoofs among the pebbles, sparks flying out on every side.
0	“I think I had better put myself on guard.” And as he spoke he drew from beneath his poncho his manchetta, the weapon, adapted at will for offense or defense, which a Brazilian is never without.
0	But, as he approached them, his project, which at first had seemed so simple, began to grow more and more formidable to his mind.
0	Kneel down, sailors of the _Halbrane_!"
0	I mounted at once, accompanied by Ned Land and Conseil.
0	"But, captain, as we must provide against everything, I shall ask your permission to take Herbert only with me on this voyage."
0	The most absurd and ridiculous ideas passed through my head, each more impossible than the other.
0	To this delight succeeded a great deception, when, trusting to a cursory observation, they launched their first telegram to the world, erroneously affirming that the projectile had become a satellite of the moon, gravitating in an immutable orbit.
0	"Yes, Johnson," answered the doctor, laughing, "those are empty hypotheses!
0	These were carefully removed by Lord Glenarvan, and separated and spread out on the table before the eager gaze of his wife and friends.
0	It won’t do to be too ambitious.” At the height of six thousand feet, the density of the atmosphere has already greatly diminished; sound is conveyed with difficulty, and the voice is not so easily heard.
0	At first it seemed very dark to me.
0	There is a precision in your words, my dear fellow, particularly agreeable to me.
0	For those who were unaccustomed to it, this continuance of the day is a cause of perpetual surprise, and even of weariness; it is difficult to believe how necessary the darkness of the night is for the eyes; the doctor actually suffered from the continual brilliancy, which was increased by the reflection from the ice.
0	These, considering the difficulties under which he labored, were wonderfully accurate, but unfortunately he made no map embodying his observations.
0	"Sublime madman," thought I, "you doubtless would approve our proceedings.
0	The voices appeared to come from a group of passengers enveloped in cloaks and wraps.
0	After a walk of about a quarter of an hour, I saw Hans at work on the other side of the promontory which formed our natural port.
0	The interview would often terminate in a scene of considerable animation.
0	We knew no means of guarding ourselves against it, and while we were consulting together, what we could do for the best, one of our men in this extreme necessity proposed to make use of the coal which we had brought from the ship into our house, and to make a fire of it, because it burns with great heat and lasts a long time.
0	The captain then presented a couple of goats, and a pair of rabbits, of which the king promised to take every care.
0	A kind of eider-duck provided the crew with very palatable food, which relieved the monotony of the salt meat.
0	“My dear lord,” replied Paganel, “I am going to translate the document according to my third interpretation, and you shall judge.
0	“Thalcave is evidently congratulating you, my boy, and paying you compliments.” “What for, my Lord?” “For your good horsemanship.” “I can hold firm on, that’s all,” replied Robert blushing with pleasure at such an encomium.
0	Judge Jarriquez was there in front of his desk, perched on his high chair, his back turned toward the window, so that his face was in shadow while that of the accused remained in full daylight.
0	You had better be off.” “No; but do, please--do, please, let me in,” supplicated the Jew.
0	For five successive days the _Halbrane_ sailed without sustaining any damage, without having, even for a moment, had to fear a collision.
0	A terrible symptom was that their tongues refused to articulate a sound.
0	"I am going to tell you," replied Barbicane quietly.
0	misfortune was making ready to fall on them.
0	“This unfortunate man,” observed Gideon Spilett, “was no longer acquainted with either months or years!” “Yes!” added Herbert, “and he had been twelve years already on the islet when we found him there!” “Twelve years!” rejoined Harding.
0	The Nautilus skirted the shores of this desert island for a little distance.
0	“Confound it!” he cried, “if this is neither Venus nor Mercury, it must be the moon; but if it is the moon, whence, in the name of all the gods, has she picked up another moon for herself?” The captain was in dire perplexity.
0	To begin with, we may note one interesting fact.
0	"To get ideas, however, we must calculate--" "No, no!"
0	On the 9th June, after a week's delay for want of wind, the _Seniavine_ entered Petropaulovsky, where it was retained taking in provisions until the 26th.
0	Pencroft and Neb also pushed with the cart as far as the vein of coal, and brought back several tons of fuel.
0	“She will better enjoy the novelties of the day after a couple of hours’ rest.” At two o’clock in the morning the boat reached Granton pier.
0	Afterwards we had the meat prepared in our own way; but the king continued to provide us with breakfast, dinner, and supper, more than sufficient for 2000 persons, 200 horses, and a large number of elephants.
0	It is the stumbling-block against which the destinies of man strike.
0	This island was merely a collection of nine or ten islets, very slightly raised, appearing almost like the points of reefs, belonging to one coral bank.
0	If the animals were as exaggerated as the plants, the matter would certainly be serious.
0	"My brave Michel, your explanation is not bad; but your comet is useless.
0	"You have informed him that a person of your acquaintance wished to take passage on the _Halbrane_?"
0	They had explored, though only in an imperfect manner, the vast shore of Washington Bay from Claw Cape to Reptile End, the woody and marshy border of the west coast, and the interminable downs, ending at the open mouth of Shark Gulf.
0	Between the year 1405, when Béthencourt had just accomplished the colonization of the Canary Islands, and the year 1492, what had taken place?
0	But I did not reckon on an accidental meeting which delayed our arrival for some time.
0	Bokhara, surrounded by a wall measuring more than eight English miles, and flanked with towers, a glorious city, made illustrious by Avicenna and other learned men of the tenth century, is regarded as the center of Mussulman science, and ranks among the most celebrated cities of Central Asia.
0	Chance led us into his presence.
0	"Without considering a still more terrible result," continued the doctor.
0	He soon afterwards came to the banks of the Yellow River, which he calls Caramoran or Black River, probably on account of its waters being darkened by the aquatic plants growing in them; at two days' journey from hence he came to the town of Cacianfu, whose position is not now clearly defined.
0	by N. We were now in 44 degrees lat., and had reached the degree which geographers assign for the so-called Strait of Tessoy, but we were five degrees farther west than the longitude given for this spot.
0	But was he living or dead, for his hands made no attempt to seize anything to stop himself.
0	There can be no doubt, however, that he set sail for Tyre in Phoenicia, and that he was much struck with the beauty of the two magnificent temples of Hercules.
0	"Yes," replied Gideon Spilett, "but there is a great difference between that and an earthquake."
0	Where did they find themselves at this moment, at eight o'clock in the morning of the day called upon the earth the 6th of December?
0	They were no better clothed than the natives, and were tatooed and smeared with a yellow powder after the native fashion; so that it would have been hard to recognize them but for their white skins and more intelligent looks.
0	"Especially," said Johnson, "when it depends on a better or worse shot."
0	They are now applying heat; now electricity.
0	On the 11th July, the _Nadiejeda_ arrived off Petropaulovski, the capital of Kamtchatka, where the crew obtained the rest and fresh provisions they had so well earned.
0	Here, bowlders, high, square, straight and plumb as an immense hotel, blocked up your way; there, lay an endless level, flat as the palm of your hand, over which your eye might roam in vain in search of something green like a meadow, yellow like a cornfield, or black like ploughed ground--a mere boundless waste of dirty white from the stunted wormwood, often rendered misty with the clouds of smarting alkali dust.
0	My uncle was careful to note every hour the indications of the compass, of the manometer, and of the thermometer, all which he afterwards published in his elaborate philosophical and scientific account of our remarkable voyage.
0	It was already evident that the plans made by Cyrus Harding were admirable, and that the vessel would behave well at sea.
0	But if we were fortunate enough to be of service to Captain MacClure's lieutenant, Bellot, the officer who accompanied us on the _Phoenix_, never saw his home again!
0	Besides, we start to-morrow.” “To-morrow?” repeated the woman in surprise.
0	Ben Zoof had not yet received his orders to retire, and ensconcing himself in a corner of the gourbi, he endeavored to doze--a task which the unusual agitation of his master rendered somewhat difficult.
0	their island no longer belonged to them entirely; others had taken possession of it, miscreants polluted its shores, and they must be destroyed to the last man.
0	“And thus,” continued Manoel, “supposing the conditions continue favorable, and Torres did not live after he fell into the water, if the decomposition is not modified by circumstances which we cannot foresee, he will not reappear before three days.” “We have not got three days,” answered Benito.
0	The path, already trodden under the evergreen trees, was found, and at nine o’clock Cyrus Harding and his companions had reached the western border of the forest.
0	Clearly Verdun regarded the question of the first meridian from a high standpoint, as all really disinterested minds still do.
0	It was probable that the stranger's retreat was not less mysterious than was he himself.
0	This waif had been tossing about in the ocean a long time before the shark swallowed it.” “I quite agree with you,” said McNabbs.
0	She even appeared to be smothering, for the carbonic acid--as in the famous _Grotto del Cane_ on the banks of Lake Agnano, near Naples--was collecting like water on the floor of the Projectile, on account of its great specific gravity.
0	“It is our castle, our dining-room, our study!
0	The sledge sped on as lightly as a boat over the waves.
0	To complete the enclosure the bed of the stream on the beach was considerably enlarged, and the sand supported by means of stakes.
0	His remaining companions, and among them Pigafetta, every one of whom had been hit, hastily regained the boats.
0	This is not the place to discuss identifications belonging to the realm of criticism.
0	“Besides, yesterday I wanted to send a telegram to Krasnoiarsk, and it could not be forwarded.
0	July 15th, they made Altamont Harbor in the south; but since the Polar Ocean was open all along the coast, instead of crossing New America by sledge, they resolved to sail around it, and reach Victoria Bay by sea.
0	In 986 Bjarn Heriulfson, who had come from Norway to Iceland to spend the winter with his father, learnt that the latter had joined Eric the Red in Greenland.

0	The village is most picturesquely grouped on a kind of esplanade, and runs along at about sixty feet from the river.
0	Was it possible to render any aid to the dying man?
0	But in the morning when, dressed in my cork-jacket, I traversed the slushy mass at a temperature of six or seven degrees below zero, I remarked that the side walls were gradually closing in.
0	The creaking of the spring jarred upon the nerves.
0	Puffins, ducks, and white gulls appeared in great numbers.
0	In the conversation overheard by McNabbs, the convicts had plainly said that the BRITANNIA had never been wrecked on the rocks in Twofold Bay.
0	He rested also, for he had nearly reached that degree of exhaustion which had forbidden all movement on the part of Torres.
0	At last he reached a country of which the inhabitants resembled but little any of those whom he had hitherto met with.
0	The whole multitude prostrated themselves, terror-stricken, on the ground.
0	She resolved to build a fort in the newly discovered country, to which she gave the name of _Meta incognita_, (unknown boundary) and to leave there, with 100 men as garrison, under the command of Captains Fenton, Best, and Philpot, three vessels which should take in a cargo of the auriferous stones.
0	The travelers, we may easily imagine, did not dream of taking a moment's rest.
0	An occasional melancholy howl also attested Diana's recognition of her companion's unhappy fate.
0	But it is none the less true that on the next morning, twelve hours after their departure from Tomsk, Michael and she reached the town of Semilowskoe, after a journey of thirty-five miles.
0	“And where is the next point?” asked McNabbs.
0	So Herbert was able, without hesitating, to give them their real name of “Arctic foxes.” They are frequently met with in Chile, in the Falkland Islands, and in all parts of America traversed by the thirtieth and fortieth parallels.
0	"Everybody knows about this affair in Bundelcund."
0	I was walking between the fore and main masts, watching the great flights of birds wheeling about the ship with deafening clangour, and the petrels occasionally perching on our yards.
0	Only four days were there before the time fixed for their departure.
0	As to the distance which separated them, it was impossible to estimate it.
0	At the summit was a circular orifice, by which I had caught the slight gleam of light, evidently daylight.
0	He could do nothing; he was himself suffering from a painful ophthalmia, which might be accompanied by deafness if he did not take care.
0	I hasten to add, to his honour, that, since he succeeded in reaching the summit of Mont Blanc, it was due to a rare moral energy, for his physical energies had long before deserted him.
0	"However," resumed Gideon Spilett, "you do not deny that some day the coal will be entirely consumed?"
0	They were walking upon a sandy soil, mingled with stones, which appeared destitute of any sort of vegetation.
0	"Eight hundred thousand," screamed Maston.
0	Nothing more terrible could be conceived!
0	Mr. Smith continues his round and enters the reporters' hall.
0	shouted Captain M'Nicholl, his eyes almost out of their sockets.
0	It was agreed that there was no other way of accounting for the rescue of Cyrus Harding, and that Top deserved all the honor of the affair.
0	He regretted seeing so much force and so many resources which might have promoted the intellectual progress and material prosperity of the country wasted on perpetual revolutions.
0	Cook received command of the _Resolution_, and Captain Tobias Furneaux, second lieutenant of the _Wallis_, was raised to the command of the _Adventure_.
0	Their only dwelling is underneath their boats, which they overturn and then stretch themselves on the ground beneath them without any covering."
0	Egga, he said, was the last Nouffe town, the power of the Fellatahs extended no further, and between it and the sea dwelt none but savage and barbarous races, always at war with each other.
0	"Very well, a president elected by the congress," cried Michel; "and as I am the congress, you are unanimously elected!"
0	"He wants to know what we're going to do when we get there!
0	But as Almagro met with great opposition to his designs, and as he was not the stronger, he concealed his vexation, put a good face on the matter, and seemed delighted at a reconciliation.
0	In the centre of the village were placed two trees or posts around which were entwined the dead bodies of two serpents.
0	"And you didn't tell us, Johnson?"
0	The enemy’s batteries discharged their guns at random.
0	He stretched his arms towards Cyrus Harding, towards Spilett, towards Pencroft.
0	At last, when I thought myself at my last gasp, about eleven at night, it being in that region quite dark, we reached the summit of Mount Sneffels!
0	He walked to and fro, sat down and got up again, took a chance book, put it down, consulted his instruments without taking his habitual notes, and seemed restless and uneasy.
0	“Might it not have been a long time already on the coast of the island?” “No,” answered Pencroft, “for it was still floating.
0	And whom would you have baptized, boatswain, seeing that all our men, like yourself, have already sailed beyond this parallel?"
0	Our ascent was satisfactorily accomplished.
0	Nay, more--the reception and the welcome that those heroes would everywhere be greeted with, should be on a scale fully commensurate with the grandeur of their own gigantic enterprise.
0	62 degrees 53 minutes, and D'Urville was expecting soon to reach the 65th parallel, when at three a.m. he was told that further progress was arrested by an iceberg, across which it did not seem possible to cut a passage.

0	They pushed on, and in an hour and a half they came up to two of these animals; they were large, and formidable in appearance.
0	At length Joe, continuing his recital, arrived at the point where, sinking in the swamp, he had uttered a last cry of despair.
0	Neither Barbicane nor his co-directors took the trouble to say anything.
0	She had declined every ornament of dress, and the very simplicity of her attire added to the charming elegance of her appearance.
0	The cruelty with which this unfortunate people was treated became more and more unbearable.
0	Nothing was wanted but the spark, or rather the shock of rival interests to produce the spark.
0	"Were you thrown into the sea by the shock to the frigate?"
0	At this moment the detective approached Mr. Fogg, and, looking him intently in the face, said: "Seriously, sir, are you in great haste?"
0	We had everything that was necessary for this work, and we might rest assured that it would be performed in the best possible manner.
0	And now you will be our companion?” Ayrton drew back.
0	We met with numerous streams and rivulets which it was necessary to ford, and that without wetting our baggage.
0	And now, he is far from us; and the wind is carrying us still farther away with resistless speed!” “Come, doctor, admitting that he may have found refuge among the lake tribes, can he not do as the travellers who visited them before us, did;--like Denham, like Barth?
0	Volcanic action alone, unaffected by either aqueous or atmospheric forces, can here be seen in all its glory.
0	This took two months; but all these manipulations were successfully carried on unknown to Pencroft, for, occupied with the construction of his boat, he only returned to Granite House at the hour of rest.
0	He had, no doubt, been under the dominion of a mere hallucination.
0	said Pencroft; "if we only knew his language, we could talk to him."
0	It may well have been so.
0	His childish imagination evidently retraced all the scenes of his father’s shipwreck.
0	What was his title to the command of such an expedition?
0	He was compelled to receive them all, whether he would or no.
0	The five bears were close behind, and the captain was obliged to ward off the blow of a paw with his knife.
0	Autumn here lasts but a very little while, although this part of Siberian territory is not situated above the fifty-fifth parallel, that of Edinburgh and Copenhagen.
0	At this date the idea which had sent so many explorers to Greenland was in full force.
0	Although the precursors of the monsoon were making themselves felt, Dampier again put to sea, and steered towards the western coast of New Guinea, where he arrived on the 4th February, 1700, near to Cape Maho of the Dutch.
0	All was in order, as if old Madge had been still there.
0	The same evening, the 22d of July, they arrived at Tioumen.
0	With a view to impressing upon the natives that the English were not to be illused with impunity, a robber who had taken a piece of cloth was fired upon with grape shot, but although he received the discharge in the back, it had no more effect upon him than a violent blow with a rattan.
0	However, the Bashees were rounded, and Formosa Strait crossed, Sandy Isle, Small Key, Long Island, and New Island were recognized, as also, Condor, Timor, Aros, and Pisang, Pulo-Taya, Pulo-Toté, and Sumatra, before the arrival at Batavia, which took place upon the 30th of November.
0	Nevertheless, it was plain to every one, that if the captain was not on board, his shade or spirit was watching them; henceforth, the wisest kept their opinions to themselves.
0	At half-past nine the way was suddenly found to be barred by an unknown stream, from thirty to forty feet broad, whose rapid current dashed foaming over the numerous rocks which interrupted its course.
0	Fifteen salutes from the neighbouring fort honoured my arrival.
0	Enormous waves caught the schooner and carried her up to their crests, whence again she was plunged deep into the abysses that they left.
0	When I returned to the consciousness of existence, I found myself surrounded by a kind of semiobscurity, lying on some thick and soft coverlets.
0	Reckon up the number of scientists and artists that he supports, of inventors that he has under his pay.
0	Hunt had reached the drowning man just as he sank out of sight, had seized hold of him, and was supporting him with his left arm, while Holt, incapable of movement, swayed helplessly about like a weed.
0	Why, to embrace you in my arms, i' faith!"
0	But neither courage nor coolness deserted the young fellow; he was determined to follow to the end this supreme effort to save the honor and the life of his father, and he it was who addressed his companions, and said: “To-morrow we will try again, and under better conditions if possible.” “Yes,” answered Manoel; “you are right, Benito.
0	“He’ll think John is worthy of Mary, my dear Edward, and he’ll think right.” Meanwhile, the yacht was making rapid progress.
0	The promenade, known as La Cañada, has now supplanted that of L'Alameda on the banks of the river Mapocha, once the evening rendezvous.

0	But, as he had told Torres, remorse began gradually to trouble the scoundrel’s life.
0	The convalescence of the young invalid was regularly progressing.

0	In English or French it would certainly be _e,_ in Italian it would be _i_ or _a,_ in Portuguese it will be _a_ or _o_.
0	"The heart has not been touched; if it had been, Herbert would be dead!"
0	At that moment a rather loud hissing noise told me that the reservoirs were filling, and that the Nautilus was sinking under the waves of the Atlantic.
0	Michael hoped that this fresh meeting at the Zabediero camp would have no disastrous consequences either to his mother or to himself.
0	He had desired to found a colony here, but his crews were not sufficiently numerous to justify the risk of leaving a part of them on land.
0	“The descent, of course, is effected by lowering the heat of the cylinder, and letting the temperature abate.
0	Barbican made no reply to his companions, because a new reflection had begun to trouble him, to talk about which would have done no good.
0	Magellan gave this archipelago the name of the St. Lazarus Islands, afterwards changed to that of the Philippines from the name of Philip of Austria, son of Charles V. This archipelago is formed of a great number of islands which extend in Malaysia, between 5 degrees 32 minutes and 19 degrees 38 minutes north latitude, and 114 degrees 56 minutes and 123 degrees 43 minutes longitude east of the meridian of Paris.
0	That word, which he kept repeating, attracted the doctor's attention, so that he shook himself free from his stupor, and asked the old sailor why he kept talking about a bear, and what bear he meant.
0	The fleet of Magellan consisted of the _Trinidad_, of 120 tons' burden, which carried the flag of the commander of the expedition; the _Sant'-Antonio_, also of 120 tons, commanded by Juan de Carthagena, the second in rank, the _person joined with_ Magellan, says the official document; the _Concepcion_, of 90 tons, commanded by Gaspar de Quesada; the famous _Victoria_, of 85 tons, commanded by Luis de Mendoza; and lastly the _Santiago_, of 75 tons, commanded by Joao Serrâo, called by the Spaniards Serrano.
0	At length, having recalled the volunteers by beat of drum, and taken on board all that appeared necessary, Cortès set sail on the 18th February, 1519, with eleven ships (the largest being of 100 tons), 110 sailors, 553 soldiers,--13 of whom were arquebusiers,--200 Indians from the island, and some women for domestic work.
0	After half an hour’s walking, Dick and Joe plunged into a forest of gum-trees, their eyes alert on all sides, and their fingers on the trigger.
0	After the Major’s inquiry, however, Glenarvan’s examination proceeded more logically, and before long all the details of the event stood out clearly before the minds of the company.
0	It was floating, apparently, upon the surface of the water, advancing by means of what at first appeared paddles.
0	But at last he arrived at the partition dividing the aftercabin, and found the door opening into the magazine itself.
0	The perishing temperature of the cabin, however, was sufficient justification for the orderly’s conduct, and by a little skillful manipulation he soon succeeded in getting up a tolerable fire.
0	I have seen no pirogues on any part of the coast.
0	I am expecting something far more important."
0	The weather being pleasant, they resolved to consecrate the day to a reconnaissance of the country, and the search of musk-oxen.
0	I thought it was going to pass it by, when, going back to north-west, it went through a large quantity of islands and islets little known, towards the Island Sound and Canal Mauvais.
0	He would have died for him.
0	Bread alone was wanting at the table of the settlers, and as has been said, they felt this privation greatly.
0	I will even add, that if we mix it with one-eighth of its own weight of nitrate of potassium, its expansive force is again considerably augmented."
0	In the centre of a railed-in space rises a crucifix with numerous tapers and flowers about it and female figures kneeling on either side representing the witnesses of the Passion of our Lord.
0	“They’re quite natural, but they are very fine!
0	He has already had one attack; should a second come on and should we not be able to prevent a third, he is lost."
0	For certain reasons of political economy the hour of general emancipation had been delayed, but the black had at this date the right to ransom himself, the children which were born to him were born free.
0	But what he did not know, and could not know, was that Marfa Strogoff was in the hands of Ivan Ogareff, and that she was about to atone, perhaps with her life, for that natural exhibition of her feelings which she had been unable to restrain when she suddenly found herself in the presence of her son.
0	before such a misfortune happens I hope we shall have come to a decision on the subject of this tower."
0	Your friends--" "I have no friends, madam."
0	“Yes, as long as we can,” replied Cyrus Harding.
0	Then he resumed his work.
0	She thee-ed and thou-ed both daughter and mother.
0	It was thrown almost flat over upon its side, and the reeds chafed the silk so roughly that it seemed as though they would tear it.
0	Yes, out of place entirely.” “What!” cried Servadac and Procope in a breath, “out of place?” “Yes, completely,” said the professor.
0	Paganel might fairly have used this as an argument in favor of his scheme; in fact, it was a natural opportunity of visiting the shores of New Zealand.
0	That is why we addressed ourselves to our worthy “Hurrah!
0	“My dear,” said Yaquita, feeling somewhat hurt, “have you any objection to make to the marriage?
0	But Phileas Fogg, who was not travelling, but only describing a circumference, took no pains to inquire into these subjects; he was a solid body, traversing an orbit around the terrestrial globe, according to the laws of rational mechanics.
0	Give me your hands, my dear friends."
0	Besides, there is nothing like that which is proved and demonstrated.
0	Alongside them were clippers of all sizes, steamers of all nationalities, and the steamboats, with several decks rising one above the other, which ply on the Sacramento and its tributaries.
0	One of these appeared to lead the others; in it was the Indian who had offered his services to Surville.
0	The coast was explored by the Spaniards as far as Mosquito Bay; its natural features, its plains and hills, its plants and the birds which fluttered amongst the beautiful trees of the island, all recalled to the memory the landscapes of Castille, and for this reason Columbus named it Hispaniola, or Spanish Island.
0	Then shaking his head like one who sees he is mistaken, he went back to his companions, took an armful of dead wood, and threw it into the smouldering fire, which immediately revived.
0	“Nothing!” cried Ford, clenching his fist with a gesture rather of anger than disappointment.
0	If the town was abandoned, they could pass through without risk, but if, by some inexplicable maneuver, the Tartars occupied it, they must at every cost avoid the place.
0	“Pour out!” cried the captain, “and God prosper it!” The barrels were turned upside down, and instantly a sheet of oil covered the whole surface of the water.
0	The major was completely plundered and stripped, and had it not been for his horse, under whose stomach he clung with the skill of an Indian rider, and was borne with a headlong gallop from his barbarous pursuers, he never could have made his way back to Kouka, the capital of Bornou.” “Who was this Major Denham?” “A fearless Englishman, who, between 1822 and 1824, commanded an expedition into the Bornou country, in company with Captain Clapperton and Dr. Oudney.
0	He undertook to ascend it, and thus penetrated as far as possible into the interior of the country.
0	Jupiter is our sole hindrance.
0	While they were putting the saws in place, Garry, Bolton, Pen, and Gripper exchanged their diverse opinions as follows.
0	But I cannot--" The consul did not finish his sentence, for as he spoke a knock was heard at the door, and two strangers entered, one of whom was the servant whom Fix had met on the quay.
0	“I did, captain,” answered Ayrton.
0	With Michelet we may cite the distance and dispersion of the various factories, the smallness of the population of Portugal, but little suited to the wide extension of her establishments, the love of brigandage, and the exactions of a bad government, but beyond all, that indomitable national pride which forbade any mingling of the victors with the vanquished.
0	Pure bravado doubtless, unless it was a sign of the act of taking possession.
0	Would not it be fun to trace the shape of our great Oceans and Continents, and to say: 'there is the Mediterranean!
0	"It really seems as if the blackguards were preparing to weigh anchor."
0	The Bayonnaise cast her anchor before Vanikoro some months after the departure of the Astrolabe, but found no new document; but stated that the savages had respected the monument to La Perouse.
0	I recognized my friend the boatswain in the manner of this warning to all whom it might concern.
0	Did not his unexpected intervention point to--I had a presentiment that it did--some wonderful revelation?
0	But his first enterprise was proportioned to the feebleness of his resources; he laid siege to Raphelim, which he wished to make a military station for his countrymen, and then with two ships he undertook a reconnaissance of the coast of Hindostan.
0	What is it that proves that all mathematicians up to now have not been mad in asserting that the sum of two numbers is equal to that of their parts, that two and two make exactly four?” “Sir!” exclaimed the president, completely puzzled.
0	After descending the Rio Negro they arrived near the bank of the Amazon, at the very place where Torres, mortally wounded, had disappeared beneath the waters of the stream.
0	It was evident that the balloon could no longer support itself!
0	Truly was he a great benefactor of the human race.

0	"You no longer doubt that Arthur Pym and Dirk Peters have really existed, or that my brother William Guy and five of his companions are living?"
0	By-the-bye, Harry,” added the old overman, turning to his son, “Jack Ryan came here to see you.” “I know, father.
0	Only sandstone and schist were round us after that, and when the truck rolled towards the shaft, I followed, with my heart as full as though it were a funeral.
0	The effect of this soft melody on the still clear night was indescribable.
0	Michael Strogoff knew from former experience what a storm in the mountains was, and perhaps this would be as terrible as the snowstorms which burst forth with such vehemence in the winter.
0	Michel, supposing it to be roughly stopped, while still under its formidable initial speed, wished to know what the consequences of the stoppage would have been.
0	It was plunged in profound darkness.
0	The roughnesses with which the staple of wool is naturally filled were so thoroughly entangled and interlaced together that a material was formed equally suitable either for garments or bedclothes.
0	“Look there, there!” His finger was pointing to a tolerably bright light, which was moving about in the distance.
0	The reporter listened to ascertain if the poor lad's heart was still beating.
0	Cook says, "I received my instructions at Plymouth dated 25th June.
0	“He forbids our firing.” “And why?” “Perhaps he thinks it is not the right time.” But this was not the Indian’s reason, and so Glenarvan saw when he lifted the powder-flask, showed him it was nearly empty.
0	No new seams had been discovered, although the soundings had been carried to a depth of fifteen hundred or even of two thousand feet, and when James Starr had retired, it was with the full conviction that even the smallest vein had been completely exhausted.
0	My share in the schooner is considerable, and I have no one but myself to consult in respect to her."
0	But though he had not yet opened his mouth, he gave one the impression of being a great talker, and moreover, one of those absent folks who neither see though they are looking, nor hear though they are listening.
0	Beyond us, around us, human nature is at an end, and we are the only population of this microcosm until we become pure Selenites."
0	He has, moreover, added a close inquiry into the regimen which the convicts were subjected to from the time of their arrival in the colony, the punishments they had to undergo, as also the encouragements and rewards which were readily with reflections full of learning and sound judgment on the probable development and future prosperity of the Australian colony.
0	Instinctively we made our way towards the Central Sea, and I cannot now tell what wild thoughts passed through my mind, nor of what follies I might have been guilty, but for a very serious preoccupation which brought me back to practical life.
0	He hoisted himself onto the cutwater, and by the bowsprit arrived at the forecastle.
0	The outer walls were, however, intact.
0	Hurliguerly, a good fellow at bottom, as I afterwards learned, discerned a little touch of irony in my tone; but he did not appear to do so; he was resolved to persevere in his patronage of me.
0	No rock on our road.
0	Neither bone nor muscle appeared to be injured.
0	The slightest allusion to her past life brought on such fits of violent emotion, that it was judged best to avoid the subject for the present.
0	He might have returned these three men to the ocean, from whence chance had brought them in contact with his mysterious existence.
0	Dillon tried in vain to persuade his informant to take him to Mallicolo, but was more successful with the Prussian, who took him within sight of the island, called Research by D'Entrecasteaux, on which, however, Dillon was unable to land on account of the dead calm and his want of provisions.
0	Only one resource remained, and that was to find some small hiding place to which the fearful denizens of the cavern could not penetrate.
0	AN unfathomable gulf twenty-five miles long, and twenty miles broad was produced, but long before historic times, by the falling in of caverns among the trachytic lavas of the center of the island.
0	Coolly and mechanically, as if seated at his desk, in his office, Barbican opened his memorandum book, wrote a receipt on a blank page, dated, signed and sealed it, and then handed it to the Captain, who put it away carefully among the other papers of his portfolio.
0	Passepartout, however, thinking no harm, went in like a simple tourist, and was soon lost in admiration of the splendid Brahmin ornamentation which everywhere met his eyes, when of a sudden he found himself sprawling on the sacred flagging.
0	"It's simple enough, however," said Barbican.
0	They all embarked in one of the ubas used in the service of the farm, and after having passed between the islands of Iquitos and Parianta, they reached the right bank of the Amazon.
0	What he said seemed so simple and so easy, so sure of success, that none could be so sordidly attached to this earth as to hesitate to follow the three travelers on their lunar expedition.
0	"They will go down of themselves."
0	He held his head tightly squeezed between his hands for some time as if to keep it from splitting.
0	However," he added, not wishing to press the Captain's weak points too closely, "let all these logical niceties pass for the present.
0	The Canadian had stopped in his work.
0	If Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft, Neb, and Ayrton had survived, it was because, assembled under their tent, they had been hurled into the sea at the instant when the fragments of the island rained down on every side.
0	How long that day seemed.
0	Harry had provided himself with a rope about 200 feet long.
0	I returned to the Green Cormorant, and took up my post behind the window panes, which were dimmed by the hissing rain.
0	The next storm, or even a high tide raised by the winds from seaward, would roll it on the sands, break it up into splinters, and scatter them on the shore.
0	Starr,” responded Ford, “I do not need your ears, but your legs.
0	"I'll pay the villains off!"
0	The Moon was gradually assuming the appearance of a gigantic egg with the smaller end turned towards the Earth.
0	Then a hundred voices cried at once, "Stepney morai no Toote," "Stepney the grave of Cook."
0	This important point established, Herbert looked for some cavity which would serve them as a retreat, but in vain; everywhere the wall appeared smooth, plain, and perpendicular.
0	But once on board, where was Joam Dacosta to seek refuge?
0	I could feel it by the rush of air upon my face.
0	So, while the doctor was pursuing his descriptive course of lecturing in the officers’ mess, Joe reigned supreme on the forecastle, holding forth in his own peculiar manner, and making history to suit himself--a style of procedure pursued, by the way, by the greatest historians of all ages and nations.
0	The gardens so anxiously planted by the English had been entirely neglected by the New Zealanders, but in spite of this several plants had grown marvellously.
0	IVAN OGAREFF was bringing up the main body of the army of the Emir.
0	"What are we doing here?"
0	Saint Catherine's Island, of which we have more than once had occasion to speak in the course of this narrative, extends from 27 degrees 19 minutes 10 seconds S. lat.
0	In place of the two hundred natives, counting women and children, whom De Langle had found an hour and a half previously, there were now, at the end of three hours, a thousand or twelve hundred.
0	He again lived the happy days he had spent with Yaquita, and again thought of the birth of his children, again felt the happiness which had its only trouble in the remembrances of Tijuco and the remorse that he had not confessed his terrible secret.
0	To his great astonishment, he suddenly found himself in the open air.
0	Another time we must succeed; and to-night, if necessary----" "In what direction is the Nautilus going?"
0	How to pass the time?
0	“‘It is them!’ said one of the men.
0	How was he to cross the river, if, as was probable, all boats had been destroyed to retard the Tartars’ march?
0	It would have been both pleasurable and profitable if I could have spared the time."
0	There is but one more person to be mentioned; the ship's cook--a negro from the African coast named Endicott, thirty years of age, who had held that post for eight years.
0	“To-morrow morning, then, at six o’clock.
0	It was an oyster of extraordinary dimensions, a gigantic tridacne, a goblet which could have contained a whole lake of holy-water, a basin the breadth of which was more than two yards and a half, and consequently larger than that ornamenting the saloon of the Nautilus.
0	But they disappeared every now and then under thick vapory spots, which are never seen on the Lunar disc.
0	A year after her marriage Yaquita presented her husband with a son, and, two years after, a daughter.
0	The light penetrated deep through the clear waters, and the magnificent sun, shining in a cloudless sky, shot its rays down into them unchecked.
0	Jean Cornbutte returned to the deck.
0	At this moment fate seemed in every way to smile upon Cortès; he had just received the news of the arrival of fresh reinforcements at Vera-Cruz, and the greater part of the towns under the dominion of Guatimozin had submitted to the force of his arms.
0	If the ball was not large, it was at least mixed.
0	The consequence was that they soon had several of the outline maps covered with the best sketches they could make of the Moon's various aspects thus presented under such favorable circumstances.
0	Supper was soon smoking on the table.
0	"What struck me as gigantic in their proportions," says Bougainville, "was their enormous breadth of shoulder, the size of their heads, and the thickness of their limbs.
0	With a grim hope to the contrary, I stooped over the map.
0	In the meanwhile the corral was not abandoned.
0	But did our friends complain of the new perils now looming up before them?
0	The chief of the police, who held a paper in his hand, advanced toward the prisoner.
0	King Ferdinand, who was always lavish of encouragements which cost little, gave both Hojeda and Nicuessa honourable titles and patents of nobility, but not a single maravédis (a Spanish coin).
0	This incident was more than a cosmical phenomenon; it was a threatened danger, the consequence of which might be disastrous in the extreme.
0	"Now there's something to explain the bullet!"
0	The young girl smilingly ran off.
0	Everybody thought something terrible must have happened.
0	As to the animal’s flesh it would furnish excellent food, for in the islands of the Malay Archipelago and elsewhere, it is especially reserved for the table of the native princes.
0	“Do they actually give that version of it in England?
0	The results of the expedition were therefore considerable.
0	But he only shook his head.
0	Eighty of her original crew were dead, and eighty more were so reduced that seven of their number died before they reached the Cape.
0	Did they not belong to the two thousand and more known trees--or were we to make the discovery of a new growth?
0	Might it not possibly thus reach the land?
0	However, as the weather was clearing up a little, he hoped that the cessation of the rain would bring about a change in the atmospheric currents.
0	It was soon observed that this newly discovered land was of very irregular elevation, that it extended due east and west across the horizon, thus dividing the gulf into two separate sections and completely concealing the island of Jerba, which must lie behind.
0	However, the loyal Cossacks of the government of Tobolsk were advancing by forced marches towards Tomsk, in the hope of cutting off the Tartar columns.
0	Without speaking a word, Harding, Spilett, Neb, and Herbert took their places in the car, while Pencroft by the engineer’s order detached successively the bags of ballast.
0	To be sure, the sea was smooth, its long, rolling waves were hardly ruffled on their surface.
0	Now, what was Ned Land's opinion upon the question of the marine monster?
0	I insist upon it; you understand; I insist upon it.
0	Fate could hardly have chosen a better man, for he was not only brave and intelligent, but robust and superior to all fatigue.
0	But, as I have told you, it is one of the richest places in the world, for from 1807 to 1817 the annual return was about eighteen thousand carats.
0	The extreme diffuseness of the light enabled me to see the smallest objects in the distant copses.
0	Would it touch at Spitzbergen, or on the shores of Nova Zembla?

0	In a few moments Harding and Herbert on one side, the reporter and Neb on the other, had disappeared behind the rocks, and five minutes later Ayrton and Pencroft, having without difficulty crossed the channel, disembarked on the islet and concealed themselves in the clefts of its eastern shore.
0	Fortunately, concord was soon restored; and the relations were so friendly when the time came for the French to leave, that many of the natives begged to accompany them to France.
0	To contend against this disaster would have been folly--nay, madness.
0	But this was not all.
0	My uncle, apparently oblivious of the fact that he had summoned me to his presence, was absorbed in a book.
0	Vengeance for this outrage was not slow; ten boats moored in the port were taken, pillaged, and burnt before the eyes of the Hindoos, who were powerless to render opposition; afterwards the town was bombarded, and was half-buried under its ruins.
0	Hindu geographers regard this lake as the source of the Ganges, the Sutlej, and the Kali rivers.
