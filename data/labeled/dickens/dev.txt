1	That part of the subject (I reminded her) involved matters which could form no part of my explanation, for they were the weighty secrets of another.
1	‘Hush, my dear sir--nobody’s fat or old in Ba--ath.
1	Miss Squeers had brought it about, by aspiring to the high state and condition of being matrimonially engaged, without good grounds for so doing; Miss Price had brought it about, by indulging in three motives of action: first, a desire to punish her friend for laying claim to a rivalship in dignity, having no good title: secondly, the gratification of her own vanity, in receiving the compliments of a smart young man: and thirdly, a wish to convince the corn-factor of the great danger he ran, in deferring the celebration of their expected nuptials; while Nicholas had brought it about, by half an hour’s gaiety and thoughtlessness, and a very sincere desire to avoid the imputation of inclining at all to Miss Squeers.
1	Yet when the night comes, Fire bursts out, father!’ she answered, turning quickly.
1	‘Why, I do declare,’ said Mr. Kenwigs, standing opposite the door so as to get the earliest glimpse of the visitor, as he came upstairs, ‘it’s Mr. Johnson!
1	The girl threw herself into a chair, with her back towards him:  and wrung her hands; but made no reply.
1	The Yorkshireman remained on his post for a few minutes, but, finding that there was no pause in the conversation inside, crept back again unheard, and stood, listening over the stair-rail, for a full hour.
1	Allowing a fellow that’s found out, to discharge himself, is one thing; discharging him for insolence and presumption, and likewise for designs upon his master’s money, is another.
1	Now, my dear madam, I think you spoke of some clever personage.
1	‘“No, there is not,” rejoined the guard coolly.
1	I seldom found that the places to which they belonged were locked, or that they were of any use except as a plaything for Jip--but Dora was pleased, and that pleased me.
1	That you will never speak of it to John, whose chief happiness in this act of restitution is to do it secretly, unknown, and unapproved of: that only a very small part of the inheritance may be reserved to us, until Mr Dombey shall have possessed the interest of the rest for the remainder of his life; that you will keep our secret, faithfully--but that I am sure you will; and that, from this time, it may seldom be whispered, even between you and me, but may live in my thoughts only as a new reason for thankfulness to Heaven, and joy and pride in my brother.’ Such a look of exultation there may be on Angels’ faces when the one repentant sinner enters Heaven, among ninety-nine just men.
1	‘I am grieved to hear it.
1	Hurrah!’ Such a cheer arose as the walls of Dotheboys Hall had never echoed before, and were destined never to respond to again.
1	"Now, George," says Mr. Bucket, urging a sensible view of the case upon him with his fat forefinger, "duty, as you know very well, is one thing, and conversation is another.
1	Minnie!’ A musical little voice answered, from somewhere upstairs, ‘I am coming, grandfather!’ and a pretty little girl with long, flaxen, curling hair, soon came running into the shop.
1	‘I mean, are all these yours?’ ‘Madam,’ replied Mr. Micawber, ‘it is a true bill.’ ‘And that eldest young gentleman, now,’ said my aunt, musing, ‘what has he been brought up to?’ ‘It was my hope when I came here,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘to have got Wilkins into the Church: or perhaps I shall express my meaning more strictly, if I say the Choir.
1	‘--and that his talent, combined with disappointment,’ Mrs Gowan went on, ‘has led him into a pursuit which--ah dear me!
1	‘Would you wish to commence with an Animal, sir--from the Register?’ ‘No,’ said Mr Boffin, ‘no, Wegg.’ With that, producing a little book from his breast-pocket, he handed it with great care to the literary gentlemen, and inquired, ‘What do you call that, Wegg?’ ‘This, sir,’ replied Silas, adjusting his spectacles, and referring to the title-page, ‘is Merryweather’s Lives and Anecdotes of Misers.
1	After that day, a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate, and without Orlick's slouching in and standing doggedly before her, as if he knew no more than I did what to make of it.
1	I should tell you that first.’ ‘Then all I have to say about that is,’ interposed Miss La Creevy, ‘that I don’t envy you your taste; and that sitting in the same room with his very boots, would put me out of humour for a fortnight.’ ‘In the main,’ said Nicholas, ‘there may be no great difference of opinion between you and me, so far; but you will understand, that I desire to confront him, to justify myself, and to cast his duplicity and malice in his throat.’ ‘That’s quite another matter,’ rejoined Miss La Creevy.
1	Behold the vessels coming into port!
1	Rosa is shyer than before.
1	Day was dawning when they again emerged.
1	Sir Leicester is quite well.
1	These sufficing, however, to inform the visitor that Miss Flite and her birds are domiciled with a Mrs. Blinder, in Bell Yard, he repairs to that neighbouring place, where Miss Flite (who rises early that she may be punctual at the divan of justice held by her excellent friend the Chancellor) comes running downstairs with tears of welcome and with open arms.
1	This is what I meant when I brought him.’ ‘Whereby,’ proceeded the voice, ‘why not?
1	Over against a London house, a corner house not far from Cavendish Square, a man with a wooden leg had sat for some years, with his remaining foot in a basket in cold weather, picking up a living on this wise:--Every morning at eight o’clock, he stumped to the corner, carrying a chair, a clothes-horse, a pair of trestles, a board, a basket, and an umbrella, all strapped together.
1	Mr. Giles walked into the corner with much importance, and some wonder, and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor, on the termination of which, he made a great many bows, and retired with steps of unusual stateliness.
1	I was a young boy, and she exasperated me, and I threw a hammer at her.
1	He could obtain no engagement, and he wanted bread.
1	Ever live by cheating at play?
1	‘“Ye were merry, daughters,” said the monk.
1	I mean to complain to your husband.
1	‘Monsieur Barronneau left a widow.
1	‘Don’t deny it, Mrs Higden, in your obstinacy; you know you might.’ Old Betty laughed, and said that she would take the letter and be thankful.
1	Don’t be alarmed, Bella my dear.
1	‘No harm will come, no harm shall come, to its own darling,’ rejoined Mr. Mantalini.
1	I am as grateful to Amy, and as fond of Amy, as it’s possible for any human being to be.
1	Madame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little nearer to the door, and there expounded her further views to them thus: “She will now be at home, awaiting the moment of his death.
1	Conscious of his elfin power and submitting to his dread experience, Mr. Guppy consults him in the choice of that day's banquet, turning an appealing look towards him as the waitress repeats the catalogue of viands and saying "What do YOU take, Chick?"
1	That, in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as a notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had been accorded to him to have Charles Darnay brought before the lawless Court, and examined.
1	Nancy remained, pale and almost breathless, listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn, of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific; and of which they became still more so, when the man returned, and said the young woman was to walk upstairs.
1	The evening glided swiftly away, in these cheerful recreations; and when the substantial though homely supper had been despatched, and the little party formed a social circle round the fire, Mr. Pickwick thought he had never felt so happy in his life, and at no time so much disposed to enjoy, and make the most of, the passing moment.
1	Still there was no reply, and still Nicholas stared about him, as did the greater part of the boys, who were by this time roused.
1	‘Morals strictly attended to, though.’ ‘Strictly,’ said Squeers.
1	Mrs. Kenwigs, my dear, will you sort the counters?’ Mrs. Kenwigs, with the assistance of Newman Noggs, (who, as he performed sundry little acts of kindness for the children, at all times and seasons, was humoured in his request to be taken no notice of, and was merely spoken about, in a whisper, as the decayed gentleman), did as he was desired; and the greater part of the guests sat down to speculation, while Newman himself, Mrs. Kenwigs, and Miss Petowker of the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, looked after the supper-table.
1	Riderhood was close after him, caught him up in a few paces, and walked at his side.
1	Her face was radiant with intelligence and pleasure.
1	‘She is ill, then!’ said Florence.
1	Afterwards, when we were fairly at our work, I found Mr. Jack Maldon’s efforts more troublesome to me than I had expected, as he had not confined himself to making numerous mistakes, but had sketched so many soldiers, and ladies’ heads, over the Doctor’s manuscript, that I often became involved in labyrinths of obscurity.
1	‘Give us your hand,’ said Mr. Weller, advancing; ‘I should like to know you.
1	This gentleman is Mr Twemlow.’ The Jew turned to him and bowed.
1	They sat thus, until it grew late.
1	We have little doubt that we should have been enabled to present it to our readers, but for a most unfortunate occurrence.
1	‘I shall be here in the morning to see you fairly off,’ said Ralph.
1	Don’t I deserve even gratitude in return?’ ‘You’re a deyvlish good fellow,’ said the poor young lord, taking his friend’s arm.
1	‘Well done, father,’ said Sam, ‘take care, old fellow, or you’ll have a touch of your old complaint, the gout.’ ‘I’ve found a sov’rin’ cure for that, Sammy,’ said Mr. Weller, setting down the glass.
1	He can make all the letters separately, and he knows most of them separately when he sees them; he has got on that much, under me; but he can't put them together.
1	Ambitious projects trouble him no more.
1	I picture myself with my books shut up, still listening to the doleful performance of Mr. Mell, and listening through it to what used to be at home, and to the blowing of the wind on Yarmouth flats, and feeling very sad and solitary.
1	‘I must submit to you, Sir--’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	And so _he_ goes up the postern stair.
1	The day wore on, evening came, and at a little before ten o’clock Sam Weller reported that Mr. Jingle and Job had gone out together, that their luggage was packed up, and that they had ordered a chaise.
1	rejoiced in the names of Lillyvick Kenwigs, was partially suffocated under the caresses of the audience, and squeezed to his mother’s bosom, until he roared again.
1	If I could have put the case more pleasantly I would; but I hope I haven’t put it very unpleasantly; at all events I haven’t meant to.
1	Fie upon you, you nasty creature!’ ‘Gracious!’ cried Kate, almost paralysed by the violence with which the adjective had been jerked out from between Miss Knag’s closed teeth; ‘have I offended you?’ ‘YOU offended me!’ retorted Miss Knag, ‘YOU!
1	Is it far from here?"
1	At the Counting House, the clerks discuss the great disaster in all its lights and shades, but chiefly wonder who will get Mr Carker’s place.
1	Fledgeby’s mother’s family had been very much offended with her for being poor, and broke with her for becoming comparatively rich.
1	Am I to lie here all my life, my father?’ ‘What do I know!’ cried the jailer, turning upon him with southern quickness, and gesticulating with both his hands and all his fingers, as if he were threatening to tear him to pieces.
1	You don’t believe--I hope you don’t really believe--that I deserve to be cast off as I have been; do you, miss?’ ‘I must believe it,’ returned the child.
1	‘An accident going to the Hospital?’ he asked an old man beside him, who stood shaking his head, inviting conversation.
1	In remembrance of our long companionship!’ He was silent ‘Now, let me tell you, dear,’ quietly sitting by his side, ‘I have, as you have, expected this; and when I have been thinking of it, and fearing that it would happen, and preparing myself for it, as well as I could, I have resolved to tell you, if it should be so, that I have kept a secret from you, and that we have a friend.’ ‘What’s our friend’s name, Harriet?’ he answered with a sorrowful smile.
1	James and myself, sir--’ ‘Nor to me, if you please,’ said I. Mr. Littimer, without being at all discomposed, signified by a slight obeisance, that anything that was most agreeable to us was most agreeable to him; and began again.
1	‘Now, what would you give him?’ inquired my aunt.
1	"Not so very long, Sir Leicester.
1	This time, you see, she will have the person and the property before her together, and will be able to make her choice with her eyes open.
1	It is a eye I never knew to fail with paupers.
1	Many a time of an evening, when I sat alone looking at the fire, I thought, after all there was no fire like the forge fire and the kitchen fire at home.
1	‘I know of his brother, Alice,’ said the old woman, stretching out her neck with a leer of malice absolutely frightful, ‘who might have been where you have been--for stealing money--and who lives with his sister, over yonder, by the north road out of London.’ ‘Where?’ ‘By the north road out of London, deary.
1	For all his waywardness, he took great credit to himself as being determined to be in earnest "this time."
1	Flintwinch, it is closing in.’ Mr Flintwinch replied by directing a look of red vengeance at his wife, and then, as if to pinion himself from falling upon her, screwed his crossed arms into the breast of his waistcoat, and with his chin very near one of his elbows stood in a corner, watching Rigaud in the oddest attitude.
1	‘There’s a Church in London; I may as well take that.
1	He had been enriching his medical attendant in the most lavish manner.
1	‘Well, upon that understanding I’ll tell you,’ replied the traveller.
1	‘Now, there’s an Enquiry in York,’ said Pancks.
1	It makes me shake from head to foot, to hear him give it her.
1	Every day.’ ‘Ah, but you mean here, at your own home?’ ‘Papa couldn’t spare me to go anywhere else,’ she answered, smiling and shaking her head.
1	‘Shave you directly, Mr. Pickwick,’ said the visitor, drawing one of them back from the bed’s head.
1	My house ain’t much for to see, sir, but it’s hearty at your service if ever you should come along with Mas’r Davy to see it.
1	Who, if this were death, would be roused again to all the struggles and turmoils of life; to all its cares for the present; its anxieties for the future; more than all, its weary recollections of the past!
1	Which was more cheerful than intelligible.
1	Then came that singular calm and silence which succeed all uproars; and then, with the vague sensation which I have always connected with such a lull,--namely, that it was Sunday, and somebody was dead,--I went upstairs to dress myself.
1	‘Now, really, Fanny my dear,’ said the sister-in-law, altering her position, and speaking less confidently, and more earnestly, in spite of herself, ‘I shall have to be quite cross with you, if you don’t rouse yourself.
1	Yer as good as there,' said the long-legged tramper, pointing out before him.
1	But it is no.’ ‘Is no short time necessary for reflection; no weeks or days?’ he asked, in the same half-suffocated way.
1	I had seen Mr. Guppy bringing in papers and arranging them for Mr. Kenge; and he had seen me and made me a forlorn bow, which rendered me desirous to get out of the court.
1	Mrs. Bagnet, you'll take care of my mother, I know?"
1	And you know already that I have many extra expenses to meet just now.
1	But we get past even this, and come to the road itself, which is a series of alternate swamps and gravel-pits.
1	But when little Jacob saw his brother, and, thrusting his arms between the rails to hug him, found that he came no nearer, but still stood afar off with his head resting on the arm by which he held to one of the bars, he began to cry most piteously; whereupon, Kit’s mother and Barbara’s mother, who had restrained themselves as much as possible, burst out sobbing and weeping afresh.
1	As little Miss Pankey was afraid of sleeping alone in the dark, Mrs Pipchin always made a point of driving her upstairs herself, like a sheep; and it was cheerful to hear Miss Pankey moaning long afterwards, in the least eligible chamber, and Mrs Pipchin now and then going in to shake her.
1	Esther's Narrative I had gone to bed and fallen asleep when my guardian knocked at the door of my room and begged me to get up directly.
1	But ever afterwards, I remembered,--and soon afterwards with stronger reason,--that while Estella looked at me merely with incredulous wonder, the spectral figure of Miss Havisham, her hand still covering her heart, seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of pity and remorse.
1	He had no intention of leaving them.
1	Quick!--Have we not enough to do to drive away that marble cold, and keep her warm!’ The door was indeed opened, for the entrance of Mr Garland and his friend, accompanied by two other persons.
1	"The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me.
1	‘Sniggle and Blink,’ cried the tenor.
1	Mr. Nupkins was not the man to ask a question of the kind twice over; and so, with another preparatory cough, he proceeded, amidst the reverential and admiring silence of the constables, to pronounce his decision.
1	Therefore I say,’ urged Pancks, ‘Go in and win!’ ‘But what of Go in and lose?’ said Arthur.
1	An evil star occasioned Madame Rigaud to advert to her relations; I reasoned with her on that subject, and remonstrated on the want of duty and devotion manifested in her allowing herself to be influenced by their jealous animosity towards her husband.
1	There were many classes of people here, from the labouring man in his fustian jacket, to the broken-down spendthrift in his shawl dressing-gown, most appropriately out at elbows; but there was the same air about them all--a kind of listless, jail-bird, careless swagger, a vagabondish who’s-afraid sort of bearing, which is wholly indescribable in words, but which any man can understand in one moment if he wish, by setting foot in the nearest debtors’ prison, and looking at the very first group of people he sees there, with the same interest as Mr. Pickwick did.
1	I came here to-day to maintain it, and I’ll come here again fifty times with the same object and always with the same success.
1	Nor was it possible to warm him, when he did come out, by means of a glass of brandy: for in Indian villages, the legislature, with a very good and wise intention, forbids the sale of spirits by tavern keepers.
1	He looked closer at the writing, looked at the man, took his hat from its peg, put the key of his door in his pocket, and they hurried away together.
1	"Don't I know you, George!
1	I know what I know.’ This had never been felt by them both in so great a degree, and never by each so perfectly to the knowledge of the other, as on a day when he came to Mr Dorrit’s to take his leave before quitting Venice.
1	She is to disparage him just as much as she likes, without any check--I suppose because he has been in the law, and the docks, and different things.
1	‘We must make quick work of it,’ he said, ‘and then cut his acquaintance, or we may be suspected.
1	I own to the weakness of objecting to occupy a ludicrous position, and therefore I transfer the position to the scouts.’ ‘I wish, Eugene, you would speak a little more soberly and plainly, if it were only out of consideration for my feeling less at ease than you do.’ ‘Then soberly and plainly, Mortimer, I goad the schoolmaster to madness.
1	He always resolutely answered: “Nothing can happen to him without my knowledge, and I know that I can save him, Lucie.” They had not made the round of their changed life many weeks, when her father said to her, on coming home one evening: “My dear, there is an upper window in the prison, to which Charles can sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon.
1	Mr. Pip, I'll put on my considering-cap, and I think all you want to do may be done by degrees.
1	Holding the letter in her hand, which she has taken from the floor, she tries to collect her thoughts.
1	And when, at last, in the pump-and-tub scene, Mrs Grudden lighted the blue fire, and all the unemployed members of the company came in, and tumbled down in various directions--not because that had anything to do with the plot, but in order to finish off with a tableau--the audience (who had by this time increased considerably) gave vent to such a shout of enthusiasm as had not been heard in those walls for many and many a day.
1	‘It may be, dear Little Dorrit.’ ‘No.
1	After pausing for a few moments, with his hand upon the lock, he entered Newman’s room, and confronted Mr. Charles Cheeryble.
1	I want to feel a hundred times more thankful than I do.
1	She was a little flurried by the unexpected visit, and the schoolmaster was not at his ease.
1	I'll pound it that you han't,' replied Sikes, with a bitter grin.
1	It was not until I came on Table Rock, and looked—Great Heaven, on what a fall of bright-green water!—that it came upon me in its full might and majesty.
1	First, I was not quite unconscious of the contrast in respect of meaning and intention between the silent look directed that way and the flow of words that had preceded it.
1	We sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had so wrought upon me, and I learnt that she had but just come home from France, and that she was going to London.
1	I was their chief exponent, and opened Mr. Barkis’s mind to an amazing extent.
1	There it remained as long as so small an object was discernible, and probably much longer, staring (as though something inexpressibly surprising should happen to a codfish) like an ill-executed eye in a large locket.
1	Governor and commander are interchangeable terms with Phil, expressive of the same respect and deference and applicable to nobody but Mr. George.
1	‘No, don’t go,’ rejoined Mrs Boffin, ‘because we are coming to business, instead of having begun it, and you belong to it as much now, my dear Bella, as I do.
1	‘Now you know; and that’s all I have got to say.’ With which words she hurried into the house, as if to shake off the responsibility of my appearance; and left me standing at the garden-gate, looking disconsolately over the top of it towards the parlour window, where a muslin curtain partly undrawn in the middle, a large round green screen or fan fastened on to the windowsill, a small table, and a great chair, suggested to me that my aunt might be at that moment seated in awful state.
1	‘Then we will have a chop here, at two.
1	‘Because--’ ‘Because she freezes them into it?’ interrupted Fanny.
1	Spring has many beauties, and May is a fresh and blooming month, but the charms of this time of year are enhanced by their contrast with the winter season.
1	We have a friend, father and I--a poor labouring man, but the best of friends--and I wrote out that I wished to do needlework, and gave his address.
1	Being, by that time, rather tired of this kind of life, and having received new provocation from the butcher, I throw the flower away, go out with the butcher, and gloriously defeat him.
1	Uncle Sol attended her lovingly to the legs of the wooden Midshipman, and there resigned her to Walter, who was ready to escort her and Susan Nipper to the coach.
1	“My dear,” said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; “there are frequent risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power to protect at such times, to the end that she may know them--that she may identify them.
1	They were very gay and careless.
1	‘I think I had better say goodbye, at once.’ ‘Not stop and--rest?’ said Ralph, who seldom offered refreshments unless something was to be got by it.
1	I have judged for myself now, and am more than satisfied.
1	Mr. Jorkins was not by any means the awful creature one might have expected, but a large, mild, smooth-faced man of sixty, who took so much snuff that there was a tradition in the Commons that he lived principally on that stimulant, having little room in his system for any other article of diet.
1	Then, indeed, does she captivate all hearts by her condescension, by her girlish vivacity, and by her skipping about as in the days when the hideous old general with the mouth too full of teeth had not cut one of them at two guineas each.
1	And you know what _their_ improvidence is, ma’am.
1	Mr. Crisparkle took the opportunity of giving Mr. Tartar a summary of the distresses of Neville and his sister; the opportunity was quite long enough, as the hat happened to require a little extra fitting on.
1	'You never had, perhaps, a certain gold locket and ring?'
1	But nothing will induce me to quarrel with any one to-night.
1	The whole were attired in such motley, ill-assorted, extraordinary garments, as would have been irresistibly ridiculous, but for the foul appearance of dirt, disorder, and disease, with which they were associated.
1	Money is money, whoever gives it.
1	So at last, Sam, by way of giving him an opportunity, said with a familiar nod-- ‘How are you, governor?’ ‘I am happy to say, I am pretty well, Sir,’ said the man, speaking with great deliberation, and closing the book.
1	Very quaint!’ said his friend.
1	They know him there and defer to him.
1	‘This here gen’l’m’n was a prophet.’ ‘Wot’s a prophet?’ inquired Mr. Weller, looking sternly on his son.
1	What else was to be expected when he was enjoying our past misfortunes--gloating over them at the moment!’ ‘Father--Edward--no indeed!’ pleaded Little Dorrit.
1	“I hope so.” “But as she grew, and promised to be very beautiful, I gradually did worse, and with my praises, and with my jewels, and with my teachings, and with this figure of myself always before her, a warning to back and point my lessons, I stole her heart away, and put ice in its place.” “Better,” I could not help saying, “to have left her a natural heart, even to be bruised or broken.” With that, Miss Havisham looked distractedly at me for a while, and then burst out again, What had she done!
1	It had such a prescriptive, stiff-necked, long-established, solemn, elderly air.
1	The clerk referring the question to them with his eye, and Mr. George not turning round from the almanac over the fire-place.
1	Were this miserable mother, and this miserable daughter, only the reduction to their lowest grade, of certain social vices sometimes prevailing higher up?
1	Having himself deposited the important stone in a small deal box, purchased from the landlady for the purpose, he placed himself in an arm-chair, at the head of the table; and the evening was devoted to festivity and conversation.
1	‘I’ll cry robbers, thieves, murder, alarm the neighbourhood, struggle with you, let loose some blood, and swear you came to rob me, if you don’t quit my house,’ replied Gride, drawing in his head with a frightful grin, ‘I will!’ ‘Wretch!’ cried Nicholas.
1	Though, indeed, I am bound to do Mrs Dombey the justice of saying, however inconsistent it may seem with her subsequent conduct (which remains unchanged), that on my expressing my disapprobation and determination to her, with some severity, on the occasion to which I have referred, my admonition appeared to produce a very powerful effect.’ Mr Dombey delivered himself of those words with most portentous stateliness.
1	The Misses Nettingalls’ young ladies come to the Cathedral too.
1	‘But do you know,’ he asked, quite at a loss, ‘the extent of what you ask?
1	Mighty glad Mr Quilp was to see them, or mightily glad he seemed to be; and fearfully polite Mr Quilp was to Mrs Quilp and Mrs Jiniwin; and very sharp was the look he cast on his wife to observe how she was affected by the recognition of young Trent.
1	Every chandelier or lustre, muffled in holland, looked like a monstrous tear depending from the ceiling’s eye.
1	When she was lost to his view, he pursued his homeward way, glancing up sometimes at the sky, where the clouds were sailing fast and wildly.
1	They would be the pictures of what was very pretty and pleasant, and I would fancy—’ ‘Ay, ay, ay!
1	I hope you won’t think it selfish, Copperfield, if I mention that the broker carried off my little round table with the marble top, and Sophy’s flower-pot and stand?’ ‘What a hard thing!’ I exclaimed indignantly.
1	As he had neither father nor mother, and had been in his minority a ward of Mr. Pickwick’s, that gentleman was perfectly well acquainted with his possessions and prospects.
1	‘Then I’ll tell you what we’ll do,’ said Mr. Crummles.
1	‘Perhaps I expect to retain it still?’  Mr. Crisparkle returned, enlightened; ‘do you mean that too?’ ‘Well, sir,’ returned the professional Philanthropist, getting up and thrusting his hands down into his trousers-pockets, ‘I don’t go about measuring people for caps.
1	You answer me before I speak, I see.
1	Carton,” the Spy answered, with a timid snap of his fingers, “my hazard is not _that_, in the thick of business here, if you are true to the whole of your bargain.” “Don't fear me.
1	‘That about--my--being--’ ‘Married?’ suggested Newman.
1	I should really be glad if you would, friend.’ He saw that the old man looked at Nell, uncertain whether to accept or decline his offer; and added, ‘I shall be glad to have your young companion with me for one day.
1	The city is a beautiful one, and cannot fail, I should imagine, to impress all strangers very favourably.
1	‘By Gad, Sir,’ said the Major, ‘the Bagstock breed are not accustomed to that sort of obstacle.
1	In every Court, ample and commodious provision is made for the accommodation of the citizens.
1	As I had a great desire to see a Prairie before turning back from the furthest point of my wanderings; and as some gentlemen of the town had, in their hospitable consideration, an equal desire to gratify me; a day was fixed, before my departure, for an expedition to the Looking-Glass Prairie, which is within thirty miles of the town.
1	They had a little conchological cabinet, and a little metallurgical cabinet, and a little mineralogical cabinet; and the specimens were all arranged and labelled, and the bits of stone and ore looked as though they might have been broken from the parent substances by those tremendously hard instruments their own names; and, to paraphrase the idle legend of Peter Piper, who had never found his way into their nursery, If the greedy little Gradgrinds grasped at more than this, what was it for good gracious goodness’ sake, that the greedy little Gradgrinds grasped it!
1	Pray leave me.’ ‘But, Lizzie, I came expressly to join you.
1	‘It’s naterally very gratifying to my feelings as a man, to know that man.
1	‘Sometimes I have fancied, sir,’ said Bella, turning away her eyes, ‘that your great regard for Mrs Boffin is a very powerful motive with you.’ ‘You are right again; it is.
1	He fancied that they viewed her, not as having risen away from the prison atmosphere, but as appertaining to it; as being vaguely what they had a right to expect, and nothing more.
1	‘Wal’r, my boy,’ replied the Captain, ‘in the Proverbs of Solomon you will find the following words, “May we never want a friend in need, nor a bottle to give him!” When found, make a note of.’ Here the Captain stretched out his hand to Walter, with an air of downright good faith that spoke volumes; at the same time repeating (for he felt proud of the accuracy and pointed application of his quotation), ‘When found, make a note of.’ ‘Captain Cuttle,’ said Walter, taking the immense fist extended to him by the Captain in both his hands, which it completely filled, next to my Uncle Sol, I love you.
1	Following it out to blissful results, he had descried, without self-commendation, a fitness in it.
1	Some of his rich relations might have paid his debts or compounded for 'em.
1	‘Well,’ said Perker, ‘don’t you know that gentleman?’ ‘Good reason to,’ replied Mr. Jingle, stepping forward.
1	We are very ancient, and we ought to make a good book.
1	These directions Mrs Brown enforced with assurances that there would be potent eyes and ears in her employment cognizant of all she did; and these directions Florence promised faithfully and earnestly to observe.
1	To what do you attribute it?’ ‘I don’t know,’ replies Venus, who is a haggard melancholy man, speaking in a weak voice of querulous complaint, ‘to what to attribute it, Mr Wegg.
1	what a different life the late John Harmon’s, if it had been his happy privilege to take his place upon that ottoman, and draw his arm about that waist, and say, ‘I hope the time has been long without me?
1	‘Once when you was out a walking with them Sket--’ Florence gently looked at her, and Miss Nipper checked herself.
1	'Did you ever know a man come out to do either, in a chariot and pair, you ridiculous old vampire?'
1	He held a corner of it tight, while Venus, taking hold of another corner, searchingly and attentively read it.
1	Her hands had contracted a spasmodic habit of raising themselves of their own accord as in involuntary admiration.
1	you know what I mean, my dear,' said the Jew.
1	‘Our thoughts are free, of course.
1	All this Mrs. Bagnet now relates for the twentieth time at least within the last four hours.
1	And it seemed so curious that her pale face and helpless figure should be lying there day after day where dancing was the business of life, where the kit and the apprentices began early every morning in the ball-room, and where the untidy little boy waltzed by himself in the kitchen all the afternoon.
1	You have trodden on me freely in your climbing up.
1	If she could be brought to become communicative, and to do what lay in her to break the spell of secrecy that enshrouded the house, he might shake off the paralysis of which every hour that passed over his head made him more acutely sensible.
1	While they were gone, Paul sat upon the table, holding Florence by the hand, and glancing timidly from the Doctor round and round the room, while the Doctor, leaning back in his chair, with his hand in his breast as usual, held a book from him at arm’s length, and read.
1	In the pale moonlight, which lent a wanness of its own to the delicate face where thoughtful care already mingled with the winning grace and loveliness of youth, the too bright eye, the spiritual head, the lips that pressed each other with such high resolve and courage of the heart, the slight figure firm in its bearing and yet so very weak, told their silent tale; but told it only to the wind that rustled by, which, taking up its burden, carried, perhaps to some mother’s pillow, faint dreams of childhood fading in its bloom, and resting in the sleep that knows no waking.
1	As he would have struck with his own clenched fist if there had chanced to be nothing in it.
1	He hesitated for a few moments; and then turned away to wander where he might, and seek his bread elsewhere.
1	Why, I find myself at the very period when I might shine most in society, and should most like for very momentous reasons to shine in society--I find myself in a situation which to a certain extent disqualifies me for going into society.
1	Her tears fell frequently for Walter’s sufferings; but rarely for his supposed death, and never long.
1	I am a peaceable man, but I can’t hear folks tell that of you.
1	But, I perfectly remember that I sat swilling tea until my whole nervous system, if I had had any in those days, must have gone by the board.
1	‘I’ll go there directly I have finished my breakfast.’ ‘Stop, stop, my dear Sir; not the least occasion for being in such a violent hurry to get into a place that most other men are as eager to get out of,’ said the good-natured little attorney.
1	The attic chamber in which he sat was bare and mean; the bedstead, and such few other articles of necessary furniture as it contained, were of the commonest description, in a most crazy state, and of a most uninviting appearance.
1	‘--How can you talk about their managing their little means?
1	We have ever been far from wishing to obtrude ourselves on anyone.
1	The neighborhood, however, highly approved of these arrangements, and we were much admired as we went through the village; the more youthful and vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us off, and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage.
1	The faster the old mail went, the faster came the pursuers--men, horses, dogs, were leagued in the pursuit.
1	They was all hard up there, Mr Plornish said, uncommon hard up, to be sure.
1	‘Well, missus,’ said he, ‘I ha seen the lady, and she were young and hansom.
1	‘Have you just returned from Brussels?’ ‘We only reached town late last night,’ said Lord Frederick.
1	"My love," Miss Flite suggested, advancing her lips to my ear with her most mysterious look, "in MY opinion--don't mention this to our diminutive friend--she's the Lord Chancellor's wife.
1	One by one the lights leaped up making the cold grey church tower more remote, and they were alone again.
1	It was occupied, but only by a poor lunatic gentleman, and the people who took care of him.
1	The enlightenment has been painfully forced upon me, and the discovery is not mine.
1	I seldom or never thought of it before.
1	In it we go on once more, lighted by a bright moon, until midnight; when we stop to change the coach again, and remain for half an hour or so in a miserable room, with a blurred lithograph of Washington over the smoky fire-place, and a mighty jug of cold water on the table: to which refreshment the moody passengers do so apply themselves that they would seem to be, one and all, keen patients of Dr. Sangrado.
1	‘It’s the man I spoke to you about,’ said Mr. Pickwick; ‘I sent for him to the Borough this morning.
1	Little Eyes and the wolf in a conspiracy?
1	Oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in such a dirty place, with so many watches; but, thinking that perhaps his fondness for the Dodger and the other boys, cost him a good deal of money, he only cast a deferential look at the Jew, and asked if he might get up.
1	"Well, I think I may.
1	She’s the most extraordinary woman.
1	‘Not one, Sir,’ replied Kit.--‘Yes, though--there’s my mother.’ ‘Did they know her?’ said the single gentleman.
1	"It's dear old honest Ali Baba!
1	It certainly was not called a small steamboat without reason.
1	‘Have I brought ruin upon the best and purest creature that ever blessed a demnition vagabond!
1	He fell for five-and-thirty feet.
1	Will you allow me to retire?"
1	"But, suppose," said my guardian, laughing, "he had meant the meat in the bill, instead of providing it?"
1	‘You are Brooks of Sheffield.
1	Go on with your flowers, Lucretia, and allow me to sit here and rest.’ ‘My Louisa knows,’ observed Miss Tox, ‘that between friends like ourselves, any approach to ceremony would be out of the question.
1	In the meantime Florence had turned again to the Instrument-maker, who was as full of admiration as surprise.
1	‘If you was to go without seeing my little elephant, you’d lose the best of sights.
1	"How did he first come by that idea, though?
1	"We rather thought," said I, glancing at Richard and Ada, who entreated me with their eyes to speak, "that perhaps she was a little unmindful of her home."
1	‘I am not so blind, Sam, as not to have seen, a long time since, that you entertain something more than a friendly feeling towards Mrs. Winkle’s maid,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	‘Lady vants to know vether nothin’ ‘ull do you good.’ ‘Wery much indebted to Mrs. Weller for her po-lite inquiries, Sammy,’ replied the old gentleman.
1	I don’t know what I have done,’ panted Florence.
1	When the pony-chaise stopped at the door, and my eyes were intent upon the house, I saw a cadaverous face appear at a small window on the ground floor (in a little round tower that formed one side of the house), and quickly disappear.
1	You will excuse my wearing my hat, but the palace is damp, and the marble floor is--if I may be allowed the expression--sloppy.’ As a precaution against this latter inconvenience, Mr Swiveller had been sitting for some time with his feet on the hob, in which attitude he now gave utterance to these apologetic observations, and slowly sipped the last choice drops of nectar.
1	‘But I shall confide in you, just the same, Agnes.
1	So there I sat, not knowing where to look--for wherever I looked, I knew Mr. Guppy's eyes were following me--and thinking of the dreadful expense to which this young man was putting himself on my account.
1	Having made this grand point, he wandered into a denser haze and maze of nonsense than even a mayor might have been expected to disport himself in, and came out of it with the brilliant discovery that to take the life of a fellow-creature was to take something that didn’t belong to you.
1	Besides all this, he had a number of little visits to pay, in the course of the day; to the schoolroom, to Doctor Blimber’s study, to Mrs Blimber’s private apartment, to Miss Blimber’s, and to the dog.
1	It was Mr. Jaggers's hand, and he passed it through my arm.
1	At last, the orchestra left off, and the curtain rose upon the new piece.
1	For I began to be sensible of acute pains in my limbs from lying out in the fields, and was now so tired and low that I could hardly keep myself awake for five minutes together.
1	‘Not if I knew when I was well off,’ said the landlord.
1	More than an hour had passed, and they were even dozing, when one of the three--each said it was he, and he had NOT dozed--made out Riderhood in his boat at the spot agreed on.
1	Mr. Honeythunder was very eloquent; but perhaps I may venture to say, without ill-nature, that he rather monopolised the occasion.
1	‘Now, sir,’ said the little man, as he carefully closed the door, ‘is there no way of accommodating this matter--step this way, sir, for a moment--into this window, Sir, where we can be alone--there, sir, there, pray sit down, sir.
1	Traddles buttoned his coat with a determined air.
1	At length Lord Decimus, with a coffee-cup in his hand, began to hover about among the pictures, and to cause an interesting speculation to arise in all minds as to the probabilities of his ceasing to hover, and enabling the smaller birds to flutter up-stairs; which could not be done until he had urged his noble pinions in that direction.
1	After the removal of the cloth, and the singing of Non Nobis (beautifully executed, and in which we were at no loss to distinguish the bell-like notes of that gifted amateur, WILKINS MICAWBER, ESQUIRE, JUNIOR), the usual loyal and patriotic toasts were severally given and rapturously received.
1	The Captain and old Sol have been on board the ship, and have established Di there, and have seen the chests put aboard.
1	Tattycoram, stick you close to your young mistress.’ He spoke to a handsome girl with lustrous dark hair and eyes, and very neatly dressed, who replied with a half curtsey as she passed off in the train of Mrs Meagles and Pet.
1	In the morning, when Mr Dombey was at his breakfast in one or other of the two first-mentioned of them, as well as in the afternoon when he came home to dinner, a bell was rung for Richards to repair to this glass chamber, and there walk to and fro with her young charge.
1	And you will ask him not to hate me?’ With a mournful shake of the head, as if that would be quite a superfluous entreaty, Helena lovingly kissed her two hands to her friend, and her friend’s two hands were kissed to her; and then she saw a third hand (a brown one) appear among the flowers and leaves, and help her friend out of sight.
1	What’s your name now,--P?’ said my aunt, as a compromise for the obnoxious appellation.
1	‘My dear Mortimer, you are the express picture of contented industry, reposing (on credit) after the virtuous labours of the day.’ ‘My dear Eugene, you are the express picture of discontented idleness not reposing at all.
1	“You with a pleasant home?” said Mr. Jaggers.
1	It seemed that Mr Chuckster had been standing with his hands in his pockets looking carelessly at the pony, and occasionally insulting him with such admonitions as ‘Stand still,’--‘Be quiet,’--‘Woa-a-a,’ and the like, which by a pony of spirit cannot be borne.
1	They ain’t Pills, or Hair-Washes, or Invigorating Nervous Essences, to be puffed in that way!’ Having delivered himself of these remarks, Mr Boffin took a trot, according to his usual custom, and trotted back to the spot from which he had started.
1	And he sent his love to me, did he?
1	‘You asked me something,’ he said then.
1	Will you give me your opinion of it?’ ‘I will,’ said Mr. Omer, rising.
1	If anyone had told me, then, that all this was a brilliant game, played for the excitement of the moment, for the employment of high spirits, in the thoughtless love of superiority, in a mere wasteful careless course of winning what was worthless to him, and next minute thrown away--I say, if anyone had told me such a lie that night, I wonder in what manner of receiving it my indignation would have found a vent!
1	‘Very well indeed, I am.
1	The parlour was the space behind the screen of rags.
1	Not that we ever quarrelled, but he was apprenticed down in the country, and he got married there; and new ties and affections springing up about him, he forgot a poor little woman like me, as it was very reasonable he should, you know.
1	And not so old either, five and thirty years ago," says Mr. George.
1	"My blessing on him, never!
1	"Now, Miss Summerson," said he, "we are off, if you please!"
1	"Name of Chadband," Mr. Smallweed puts in, speaking henceforth in a much lower key.
1	All the children of the village, and most of the women, were admiring these sable warders and the closed windows of the house and forge; and as I came up, one of the two warders (the postboy) knocked at the door,--implying that I was far too much exhausted by grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself.
1	He says it is nothing to speak of; which I can confirm, if that is any consolation; but he recommended, to-day, sea-air.
1	Pray God, we are not too late again!’ ‘We cannot be,’ said Mr Garland.
1	Come here, sir!’ The cherub, to his genial amusement, was accordingly conducted to a little washing-room, where Bella soaped his face and rubbed his face, and soaped his hands and rubbed his hands, and splashed him and rinsed him and towelled him, until he was as red as beet-root, even to his very ears: ‘Now you must be brushed and combed, sir,’ said Bella, busily.
1	Our conference being now ended, and everything arranged, I rose to go; remarking to Herbert that he and I had better not go home together, and that I would take half an hour's start of him.
1	‘There’s a gentleman in the parlour that’s ordered a hot beef-steak pudding and potatoes, at nine.
1	‘The times are bad, and one scarcely knows whom to trust,’ continued Ralph.
1	On this occasion, he shone resplendent at one end of the table, supported by the milder lustre of Mr Dombey at the other; while Carker on one side lent his ray to either light, or suffered it to merge into both, as occasion arose.
1	Impelled by such reflections, he grasped his carpet-bag, and creeping stealthily downstairs, shut the detestable street door with as little noise as possible, and walked off.
1	Now and then, when they pass a police-constable on his beat, Mr. Snagsby notices that both the constable and his guide fall into a deep abstraction as they come towards each other, and appear entirely to overlook each other, and to gaze into space.
1	returns the trooper, wheeling his chair to face the old man.
1	After looking at it for a little while as she plies her needle, he looks to young Woolwich, sitting on his stool in the corner, and beckons that fifer to him.
1	I had no one to advise me.
1	At last, when he appealed by name to Monsieur Lorry, an English gentleman then and there present, who, like himself, had been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his account of it, the Jury declared that they had heard enough, and that they were ready with their votes if the President were content to receive them.
1	‘And he writes to me here, that he will be glad to show me, in operation, the only true system of prison discipline; the only unchallengeable way of making sincere and lasting converts and penitents--which, you know, is by solitary confinement.
1	‘He has no right to think that I’d be led away to go to him, sir,’ said Kit, turning round again after half a minute’s hammering.
1	Poor Mr Toots, left to himself, lay down upon the sofa, little thinking who had reclined there last, and, gazing up at the skylight and resigning himself to visions of Miss Dombey, lost all heed of time and place.
1	“And I'll tell you where from.
1	‘Have you been long in England?’ ‘Long--ver long time--fortnight--more.’ ‘Do you stay here long?’ ‘One week.’ ‘You will have enough to do,’ said Mr. Pickwick smiling, ‘to gather all the materials you want in that time.’ ‘Eh, they are gathered,’ said the count.
1	“She has never allowed herself to be seen doing either, since she lived this present life of hers.
1	As Mr Dombey raised his eyes, it changed back, no less quickly, to its old expression, and showed him every gum of which it stood possessed.
1	‘Been here often, my good woman?’ ‘Once in all my life.’ ‘Ay, ay?’ They have arrived at the entrance to the Monks’ Vineyard.
1	He is perfectly good-humoured respecting his failure, and reminds me that he always did consider himself slow.
1	I knew that your ascendancy over him was the cause of his going to China to take care of the business there, while you took care of it here (though I do not even now know whether these were really terms of separation that you agreed upon); and that it was your will that I should remain with you until I was twenty, and then go to him as I did.
1	‘Come, don’t be a fool, Sam,’ said the girl coaxingly, ‘the gentleman wants his boots directly.’ ‘Well, you _are_ a nice young ‘ooman for a musical party, you are,’ said the boot-cleaner.
1	“'Nevertheless, Doctor, my sister married.
1	You--you--are not rich; you have not enough for yourself, and I should not be here.
1	‘What family?’ ‘The Kenwigses of course,’ rejoined Mr. Lillyvick.
1	However, as he is now gone so far away and for an indefinite time, and as he will have good opportunities and introductions, we may consider this past and gone.
1	I was on the point of asking him if he knew me, when he tried to stretch out his arm, and said to me, distinctly, with a pleasant smile: ‘Barkis is willin’!’ And, it being low water, he went out with the tide.
1	An old man now, but in a ruddy, hearty, strong old age.
1	Emma, my love,’ said Mr. Micawber, clearing his throat in his magnificent way, ‘my friend Mr. Thomas Traddles is so obliging as to solicit, in my ear, that he should have the privilege of ordering the ingredients necessary to the composition of a moderate portion of that Beverage which is peculiarly associated, in our minds, with the Roast Beef of Old England.
1	Of course my aunt was immediately made acquainted with the successful issue of the conference, and with all that had been said and done in the course of it.
1	The raging agonies I suffer on the night of the Race Ball, where I know the eldest Miss Larkins will be dancing with the military, ought to have some compensation, if there be even-handed justice in the world.
1	“Kiss me, child of Evremonde.
1	The affair being brought to this head, Mr. George, after a little consideration, proposed to go in first to his comrade (as he called him), taking Miss Flite with him.
1	Is there any little thing I can do for you?’ ‘It comes so very expensive, sir,’ replied Mrs Jarley, ‘and I really don’t think it does much good.’ ‘Hush!
1	The mention that has been made of my daughter, and the use that is made of my daughter, in opposition to me, are unnatural.
1	Mr Richard not receiving his remarks with anything like enthusiasm, his employer turned his eyes to his face, and observed that it wore a troubled expression.
1	Mr. Bazzard’s father, being a Norfolk farmer, would have furiously laid about him with a flail, a pitch-fork, and every agricultural implement available for assaulting purposes, on the slightest hint of his son’s having written a play.
1	‘And you know,’ said Rosa innocently, ‘you couldn’t like me then; and you can always like me now, for I shall not be a drag upon you, or a worry to you.
1	Now, he must be precious old, you know, and he has not a soul about him, and he is reported to be immensely rich; and whether he is a smuggler, or a receiver, or an unlicensed pawnbroker, or a money-lender--all of which I have thought likely at different times--it might pay you to knock up a sort of knowledge of him.
1	Her husband's step was strong and prosperous among them; her father's firm and equal.
1	“Where are the papers of this prisoner?” demanded a resolute-looking man in authority, who was summoned out by the guard.
1	‘Just so, Sir,’ replied Mr. Jinks.
1	The chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment over his nose, but had given them up without an effort to smooth them off.
1	They may vary it with fever and ague, or with as many rheumatic variations as they have joints; but positively not with entertainment after their own manner.
1	After the lapse of an hour, a bit of fish and a steak was served up to the travellers, and when the dinner was cleared away, Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Peter Magnus drew their chairs up to the fire, and having ordered a bottle of the worst possible port wine, at the highest possible price, for the good of the house, drank brandy-and-water for their own.
1	I do not quite understand my elder daughter’s having--hum--too much material.
1	There shall be no secrets from you; you shall be by.
1	‘You wicked old boy,’ Miss Wren would say to him, with a menacing forefinger, ‘you’ll force me to run away from you, after all, you will; and then you’ll shake to bits, and there’ll be nobody to pick up the pieces!’ At this foreshadowing of a desolate decease, the wicked old boy would whine and whimper, and would sit shaking himself into the lowest of low spirits, until such time as he could shake himself out of the house and shake another threepennyworth into himself.
1	It was characteristic of this lady (as of some other people before her time and since) that whenever her original proposition was questioned, she exaggerated it.
1	Mr. Tupman felt every moment more disposed for the ball.
1	‘Now, you know,’ said Brass, ‘if this is a case of innocence, it is a case of that description, Christopher, where the fullest disclosure is the best satisfaction for everybody.
1	From the portal thus decorated, one Sunday after an early dinner of baked viands, Young John issued forth on his usual Sunday errand; not empty-handed, but with his offering of cigars.
1	‘See Serjeant Snubbin, my dear Sir!’ rejoined Perker, in utter amazement.
1	There are plenty of talkers going about, my love, and she will soon find one.’ While this discourse was interchanging, both Bella and the Secretary observed Lizzie Hexam with great attention.
1	Would have been self-willed (he thought in his eminently practical way) but for her bringing-up.
1	We interchanged that confidence without shaping a syllable.
1	Again we lost her, and again she rose.
1	The lights in the shops could scarecely struggle through the heavy mist, which thickened every moment and shrouded the streets and houses in gloom; rendering the strange place still stranger in Oliver's eyes; and making his uncertainty the more dismal and depressing.
1	(Here he took Mr Merdle’s arm and walked him gently away.)
1	This a little confused Rosebud, and may account for her never afterwards quite knowing how she ascended (with his help) to his garden in the air, and seemed to get into a marvellous country that came into sudden bloom like the country on the summit of the magic bean-stalk.
1	I assure you, most exemplary!
1	Death of my soul, I love the sweet lady!’ Mrs Clennam’s face had changed.
1	Perils were closing round her, and the circle was fast darkening, when I--being as you have said, sir, too old and broken to be suspected of any feeling for her but a father’s--stepped in, and counselled flight.
1	With this view, his intention was to print a declaration to the foregoing effect, which he had already drawn up; and, besides circulating it among all who had dealings with the House, to advertise it in the public papers.
1	A mighty secret, my pretty one, no doubt!
1	‘Now, the best thing you can do, sir, if you’ll allow me to advise you,’ said my aunt, after silently observing him, ‘is to abjure that occupation for evermore.’ ‘Madam,’ replied Mr. Micawber, ‘it is my intention to register such a vow on the virgin page of the future.
1	‘Who?’ Short girl--black eyes--niece Emily.’ There was a pause.
1	The coachman shouts an admonitory ‘Now then, gen’l’m’n,’ the guard re-echoes it; the old gentleman inside thinks it a very extraordinary thing that people _will _get down when they know there isn’t time for it; Mr. Pickwick struggles up on one side, Mr. Tupman on the other; Mr. Winkle cries ‘All right’; and off they start.
1	His hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden; and his efforts to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour rushed to his heart.
1	My mother put her hands upon my lips to stop me.
1	DO you hear him say he’ll humour Cheeryble Brothers?’ ‘Tim,’ said Charles and Ned together, ‘pray, Tim, pray now, don’t.’ Tim, taking the hint, stifled his indignation as well as he could, and suffered it to escape through his spectacles, with the additional safety-valve of a short hysterical laugh now and then, which seemed to relieve him mightily.
1	I did it for the love of you.
1	Wititterly,’ said her husband, addressing himself to Mrs. Nickleby, ‘is sought after and courted by glittering crowds and brilliant circles.
1	He is a wonderfully accomplished man--most extraordinarily accomplished--reads--hem--reads every novel that comes out; I mean every novel that--hem--that has any fashion in it, of course.
1	Stop at the next inn, and call out for a glass of hot brandy and water.’ It was in vain for Kit’s mother to protest that she stood in need of nothing of the kind.
1	But she seemed to be everywhere.
1	'There is nothing very alarming in his appearance.
1	‘Don’t grieve for that now.’ ‘--My daughter,’ faltered the old woman, ‘my gal who’ll soon get better, and shame ‘em all with her good looks.’ Alice smiled mournfully at Harriet, and fondled her hand a little closer, but said nothing.
1	I don’t know what come over me just now, but it’ll never come again.’ ‘Well, then, Johnny shall have more time to think of it,’ returned Mrs Boffin; ‘the pretty child shall have time to get used to it.
1	My dearest Edith, there is such an obvious destiny in it, that really one might almost be induced to cross one’s arms upon one’s frock, and say, like those wicked Turks, there is no What’s-his-name but Thingummy, and What-you-may-call-it is his prophet!’ Edith designed no revision of this extraordinary quotation from the Koran, but Mr Dombey felt it necessary to offer a few polite remarks.
1	Brittles replying in the affirmative, and pointing out the building, the portly man stepped back to the garden-gate, and helped his companion to put up the gig:  while Brittles lighted them, in a state of great admiration.
1	‘Many a time the cloud went and came, and many a lesson it taught to Gabriel Grub, who, although his shoulders smarted with pain from the frequent applications of the goblins’ feet thereunto, looked on with an interest that nothing could diminish.
1	And of all the world I wouldn’t have him know that I am here, or get the least clue where to find me.’ ‘Lizzie, dear!
1	"Because I fell in love."
1	“Man, man!” returned Carton, stamping his foot; “have I sworn by no solemn vow already, to go through with this, that you waste the precious moments now?
1	You can bear it?” “I can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this moment.” “You speak collectedly, and you--_are_ collected.
1	There his master, so subtle and vigilant of eye, that Rob quaked before him, more than half expecting to be taxed with Mrs Brown, gave him the usual morning’s box of papers for Mr Dombey, and a note for Mrs Dombey: merely nodding his head as an enjoinder to be careful, and to use dispatch--a mysterious admonition, fraught in the Grinder’s imagination with dismal warnings and threats; and more powerful with him than any words.
1	But I entreat you to bear in mind, very seriously and steadily, that if I am to do you any good, it can only be with your own assistance; and that you can only render that, efficiently, by seeking aid from Heaven.’ ‘I will try to do my part, sir.’ ‘And, Mr. Neville, I will try to do mine.
1	The two out-door boys went upon the staircase to put on their half-boots and pull the in-door boy's hair, as I judged from the nature of his objections.
1	I have had a pattern in my hand.” He glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride.
1	When little Em’ly grew more courageous, and talked (but still bashfully) across the fire to me, of our old wanderings upon the beach, to pick up shells and pebbles; and when I asked her if she recollected how I used to be devoted to her; and when we both laughed and reddened, casting these looks back on the pleasant old times, so unreal to look at now; he was silent and attentive, and observed us thoughtfully.
1	“To--do you mean to the young fellow who's in it?” he asked, in reply.
1	In this light it was clearly understood by the other party, who immediately replied with great approbation, ‘You quite enter into my feelings, ma’am, and it’s jist what I’d do myself.’ ‘But you have no call to do it,’ said Mrs Jiniwin.
1	With characteristic ignorance, it acted on the most decided and energetic notions of How to do it; and never showed the least respect for, or gave any quarter to, the great political science, How not to do it.
1	), but I don't settle down to constancy in other things.
1	And when you can do better, you will?
1	‘It’s like puttin’ gas in a balloon.
1	I can bear it, I dare say.’ Pouring forth these and a perfectly wonderful train of other disjointed expressions of regret, which no mortal power but Mrs. Nickleby’s could ever have strung together, that lady wrung her hands, and her tears fell faster.
1	‘I’ve got him, hard and fast.’ ‘Wa’at!’ exclaimed John Browdie, pushing away his plate.
1	‘Have I called you down from the stars?’ ‘No,’ he answered.
1	What can I have to do with the name?
1	Bar was sorry to miss our good friend Mr Sparkler to-day, Mr Merdle.
1	'I should like,' faltered the child, 'if somebody that can write, would put a few words down for me on a piece of paper, and fold it up and seal it, and keep it for me, after I am laid in the ground.'
1	‘Any maker’s name?’ ‘Brown.’ ‘Where of?’ ‘Muggleton.
1	The old man who had been standing by the door in one attitude during the whole interview, looking at the mother up-stairs as he had looked at the son down-stairs, went out at the same time, and, after a longer absence, returned with another tray on which was the greater part of a bottle of port wine (which, to judge by his panting, he had brought from the cellar), a lemon, a sugar-basin, and a spice box.
1	‘A man does get more way upon himself, perhaps, in his conversation, when he sits down.
1	‘She will miss it when she wakes.
1	'The girl's gone mad, I think,' replied Sikes, savagely.
1	She began piteously declaring that she didn't mean any harm, she didn't mean any harm, Mrs. Snagsby!
1	For which reason Bella’s eyes drooped more engrossedly over her book, and she turned the page with an air of profound absorption in it.
1	Only one man in the crowd cried ‘No!’ and he was promptly taken into custody, and straightway borne off.
1	You can hardly think how kind she is to me, and what pains she takes with me.
1	There has been a delay.’ ‘Not that it is of consequence,’ said Fanny.
1	I shall be as merry as a grig among these gentry.
1	But the peace and rest of the old Sunday morning were on everything, except me.
1	Turn that dog's descendants wild, like Jo, and in a very few years they will so degenerate that they will lose even their bark--but not their bite.
1	If you refer to the presence of any visitor you have here--I say, if you refer to that,’ answered Tip, jerking his head with emphasis towards his shoulder nearest Clennam, ‘I see!’ ‘Is that all you say?’ ‘That’s all I say.
1	Mrs Chick had some such thoughts too, but they were not so quietly developed in her mind.
1	Not, you see, to look at.’ ‘Not azackly,’ observed Peggotty.
1	We journeymen must take jobs when we can get them.
1	Our poor brother Francis’s death has cancelled that.’ ‘We had not,’ said Miss Clarissa, ‘been in the habit of frequent association with our brother Francis; but there was no decided division or disunion between us.
1	That gentleman took it up, and read as follows:-- ‘Our obscure and filthy contemporary, in some disgusting observations on the recent election for this borough, has presumed to violate the hallowed sanctity of private life, and to refer in a manner not to be misunderstood, to the personal affairs of our late candidate--aye, and notwithstanding his base defeat, we will add, our future member, Mr. Fizkin.
1	There was yet another circumstance which went a long way to confirm Little Dorrit in her fears, though it was not a great circumstance in itself.
1	“You think so?” said Mr. Stryver.
1	Then why not have it: especially when our friend Miss Jenny here would profit by it too?
1	‘Now then,’ said Crummles, who had been assisting Mrs. Grudden in the preparations, which were on a more extensive scale than was quite agreeable to the collector.
1	Undeserving as he was, and little as he thought of all these agonies that it cost me--agonies which should have made him wholly and gratefully mine to his life’s end--I loved him.
1	‘I can’t see you running into danger, through carrying your head so high.
1	It was at a distance towards the east, but it was long and loud.
1	I may claim to have felt it, at least as much as anybody else; and I would fain be remembered kindly for my part in the experience.
1	‘She’s at--at Little Bethel, I suppose?’--getting out the name of the obnoxious conventicle with some reluctance, and laying a spiteful emphasis upon the words.
1	At the same time—not to deceive you—I believe I am worthy of her.
1	Mr. Pickwick himself continued to reside in his new house, employing his leisure hours in arranging the memoranda which he afterwards presented to the secretary of the once famous club, or in hearing Sam Weller read aloud, with such remarks as suggested themselves to his mind, which never failed to afford Mr. Pickwick great amusement.
1	The messenger fortunately found Mr. Solomon Pell in court, regaling himself, business being rather slack, with a cold collation of an Abernethy biscuit and a saveloy.
1	He dreams that the footsteps die away into distance of time and of space, and that something touches him, and that something falls from his hand.
1	He was also in the habit of declaiming to Mrs. Stryver, over his full-bodied wine, on the arts Mrs. Darnay had once put in practice to “catch” him, and on the diamond-cut-diamond arts in himself, madam, which had rendered him “not to be caught.” Some of his King's Bench familiars, who were occasionally parties to the full-bodied wine and the lie, excused him for the latter by saying that he had told it so often, that he believed it himself--which is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an originally bad offence, as to justify any such offender's being carried off to some suitably retired spot, and there hanged out of the way.
1	"Let me hope a moment!
1	I had scarcely thought it a reservation a few hours ago, but now that it was gone I felt as if I understood its nature better.
1	Young Barnet did not remain long in the background after they had reached the drawing-room, for Dr Blimber had him out in no time, dancing with Florence.
1	"Do you know the Poulterer's, in the next street but one, at the corner?"
1	Sometimes he would ask her for herself.
1	She stood by the table so perfectly composed and still after this acknowledgment of his remark that Mr Meagles stared at her under a sort of fascination, and could not even look to Clennam to make another move.
1	It was not until every preparation was made for Madeline’s immediate removal that Ralph broke silence by declaring she should not be taken away.
1	I cry chorus to the T’otherest.’ ‘What turn,’ said Bradley, with an effort at self-repression that forced him to wipe his face, ‘did his insolence take to-day?’ ‘It took the turn,’ answered Riderhood, with sullen ferocity, ‘of hoping as I was getting ready to be hanged.’ ‘Let him look to that,’ cried Bradley.
1	Sir Leicester is bound to believe a pair of ears that have been handed down to him through such a family, or he really might have mistrusted their report of the iron gentleman's observations.
1	‘They are here now,’ said Kate, rising and hurrying away.
1	cried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in Sunday clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him.
1	They passed the whole of Sunday with him, and generally rode out before dinner; and on these occasions Mr Dombey seemed to grow, like Falstaff’s assailants, and instead of being one man in buckram, to become a dozen.
1	‘“Remaining always, &c.  &c., WILKINS MICAWBER.”’ Much affected, but still intensely enjoying himself, Mr. Micawber folded up his letter, and handed it with a bow to my aunt, as something she might like to keep.
1	If it could not be done with Mr. Mills’s sanction and concurrence, I besought a clandestine interview in the back kitchen where the Mangle was.
1	Next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the wine-shop, knitting away assiduously.
1	‘I am here by myself, myself.
1	If her mother’s consolations could have restored her to a pleasanter and more enviable state of mind, there were abundance of them to produce the effect.
1	All is told.’ ‘Will you please tell me,’ said Rosa, taking the paper with a prettily knitted brow, but not opening it: ‘whether I am right in what I am going to say?
1	Come!’ ‘I never heard it said, Misses Brown,’ returned the Grinder.
1	I should say, now, that the stage, or the--or the army, Mr Richard--or something very superior in the licensed victualling way--was the kind of thing that would call out the genius of such a man as you.
1	The dog has his likings and dislikings, and Blandois is no great favourite of his; but I am sure you will give him a character, Minnie, for never having been like this before.’ Minnie was too much disturbed to say anything connected in reply; Little Dorrit was already occupied in soothing her; Fanny, who had cried out twice or thrice, held Gowan’s arm for protection; Lion, deeply ashamed of having caused them this alarm, came trailing himself along the ground to the feet of his mistress.
1	I believe I don’t look it.’ ‘Indeed you do not,’ said Mrs Gowan, shaking her head and the great green fan together, for emphasis.
1	What a rusty portion of a boiler and a great iron wheel or so meant by lying half-buried in the dealer’s fore-court, nobody seemed to know or to want to know.
1	‘I hope she steered herself, skiffed herself, paddled herself, larboarded and starboarded herself, or whatever the technical term may be, to the ceremony?’ proceeds the playful Tippins.
1	Oh, don’t, my dear!’ ‘When Jane Murdstone meets, I say,’ he went on, after waiting until my mother was silent, ‘with a base return, that feeling of mine is chilled and altered.’ ‘Don’t, my love, say that!’ implored my mother very piteously.
1	I acknowledge--let me be open--that it is my failing to be the creature of impulse, and to wear my heart as it were, outside.
1	‘_I_ pray to Heaven it may turn out so!’ repeated Jasper.
1	But he’ll soon be home for good, now.
1	An operation which, taken in connexion with the bushy eyebrows and the Roman nose, suggested with some liveliness the idea of a hawk engaged upon the eyes of a tough little bird.
1	They spoke in high praise of the honourable conduct of Messrs. Dodson and Fogg, the attorneys for the plaintiff, did they?’ ‘Yes,’ said Sam, ‘they said what a wery gen’rous thing it was o’ them to have taken up the case on spec, and to charge nothing at all for costs, unless they got ‘em out of Mr. Pickwick.’ At this very unexpected reply, the spectators tittered again, and Dodson & Fogg, turning very red, leaned over to Serjeant Buzfuz, and in a hurried manner whispered something in his ear.
1	Affectionately and sorrowfully, T.C.’ With this missive (which I was in twenty minds at once about recalling, as soon as it was out of my hands), the ticket-porter at last departed.
1	If anything could have added to the interest of this agreeable scene, it would have been the remarkable fact of Mr. Pickwick’s appearing without his gaiters, for the first time within the memory of his oldest friends.
1	I am pretty well known.
1	That very popular trust in flat things coming round!
1	‘Is it, indeed?’ rejoined Mr. Pickwick.
1	‘I--hem!--I can’t think, Amy, what has given Chivery offence.
1	Nor was the young lady herself at all behind-hand in displaying her choicest allurements; but these, heightened as they were by the artifices of Miss Ledrook, had no effect whatever in increasing the attentions of Nicholas, who, with the precedent of Miss Squeers still fresh in his memory, steadily resisted every fascination, and placed so strict a guard upon his behaviour that when he had taken his leave the ladies were unanimous in pronouncing him quite a monster of insensibility.
1	When we came to the usual place of meeting--it was close by, and Mr. Woodcourt had often accompanied me before--my guardian was not there.
1	I’m surprised to hear it.’ Despite his presence of mind, however, the speech of Mr F.’s Aunt produced a depressing effect on the little assembly; firstly, because it was impossible to disguise that Clennam’s unoffending head was the particular temple of reason depreciated; and secondly, because nobody ever knew on these occasions whose Uncle George was referred to, or what spectral presence might be invoked under that appellation.
1	I put up my trembling little hand to clasp hers or to beg her pardon with what earnestness I might, but withdrew it as she looked at me, and laid it on my fluttering heart.
1	But you and I have done one another some good, Trot,--at all events, you have done me good, my dear; and division must not come between us, at this time of day.’ ‘Division between us!’ cried I.
1	I think I should feel as if the name had become endeared to me, and I had no right to use it so.’ ‘And that’s your opinion?’ remarked Mr Boffin, observant of the Secretary’s face and again addressing him.
1	My aunt, though I saw that her shrewdest observation was concentrated on her new guest, had more useful possession of her wits than either of us; for she held him in conversation, and made it necessary for him to talk, whether he liked it or not.
1	Furious with terror, he raised his stick, and struck Edmunds a heavy blow across the face.
1	At the same moment, a small boy clung tight round his leg, and a shrill cry of ‘Here he is, father!
1	The matter of fact, is, that the matron was in no way overpowered by Mr. Bumble's scowl, but, on the contrary, treated it with great disdain, and even raised a laugh thereat, which sounded as though it were genuine.
1	‘Twelve year,’ replied the cobbler, biting the end of his pipe as he spoke.
1	‘I had conquered it, knowing that it _must_ be conquered, and had come to the resolution to think no more about it.
1	She sat upright in her arm-chair, with a stately, immovable, passionless air, that it seemed as if nothing could disturb.
1	That’s the way it works.’ ‘It would be a good thing for me, if I could see things in the calm light you do, Mr Wegg.’ ‘Again look here,’ pursues Silas, with an oratorical flourish of his pipe and his wooden leg: the latter having an undignified tendency to tilt him back in his chair; ‘here’s another observation, Mr Venus, unaccompanied with an objection.
1	That’s my view of the matter, Mr. Pickwick.’ ‘It is a very philosophical one,’ replied Mr. Pickwick.
1	What could Mr. Bumble do?
1	‘Here’s wishing of her back agin.’ Polly cried more than ever at this.
1	To keep Mrs. Sparsit’s ears as far off as possible, I expect.’ With her hand upon her brother’s shoulder, Louisa still stood looking at the fire.
1	‘I know you are unhappy, and have got into great trouble by bringing me away.
1	I hated her then, quite as much as I hate her now; and naturally, therefore, could desire nothing better than that she should marry him.
1	Well; I got the better of it, and went on sorting, and went on singing to myself.
1	‘For well I know, sir,’ Mr Wegg would add, ‘that a man of your delicate mind would wish to be checked off whenever the opportunity arises, and it is not for me to baulk your feelings.’ A certain rustiness in Mr Venus, which never became so lubricated by the oil of Mr Wegg but that he turned under the screw in a creaking and stiff manner, was very noticeable at about this period.
1	He cannot pay something?” “He has paid all, Monseigneur.
1	You know I stood between you and his father so long, that it seems as if death had made no difference, and I was still standing between you.
1	‘The house with the red door, cabmin.
1	‘One of them things that young men do when they get married,’ returned Squeers; ‘and as runs through with their money like nothing at all!
1	If my brother had been a man of activity and prudence, he might have left you a rich woman, ma’am: and if he had turned his son into the world, as my father turned me, when I wasn’t as old as that boy by a year and a half, he would have been in a situation to help you, instead of being a burden upon you, and increasing your distress.
1	Go it, Miss Lavinia Wilfer!’ ‘What you may mean, George Sampson, by your omnibus-driving expressions, I cannot pretend to imagine.
1	And now you must tell me, dearest Ma and Lavvy, upon your words and honours!
1	Chiefly Matrimonial Dombey sat in the corner of the darkened room in the great arm-chair by the bedside, and Son lay tucked up warm in a little basket bedstead, carefully disposed on a low settee immediately in front of the fire and close to it, as if his constitution were analogous to that of a muffin, and it was essential to toast him brown while he was very new.
1	There!’ With this handsome offer, Mr. Gregsbury once more threw himself back in his chair, and looked like a man who had been most profligately liberal, but is determined not to repent of it notwithstanding.
1	‘He bust out a-cryin’, Sir, and said you wos wery gen’rous and thoughtful, and he only wished you could have him innockilated for a gallopin’ consumption, for his old friend as had lived here so long wos dead, and he’d noweres to look for another.’ Poor fellow, poor fellow!’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	‘They brighten at the sight of you,’ returned Neville.
1	‘Sit down,’ said Sir Mulberry, turning towards him, as though by a violent effort.
1	I hope it was not a poor thing in me to wish to be a little more used to my altered self before I met the eyes of the dear girl I longed so ardently to see, but it is the truth.
1	He had come straight away from his work, on being written to, and had walked the whole journey; and was on his way to Mr. Bounderby’s country house after dark, when he fell.
1	I am going to speak upon another subject, a confidential subject, Mr. Nickleby.
1	May I speak out, among friends?
1	The placid look at the white ceiling came back, and passed away, and his head dropped quietly on his breast.
1	Good night!” It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his.
1	Don’t take any notice of it,’ said Miss Ledrook, peeping in from the bedroom.
1	‘The fact is, it ain’t a Hall,’ observed Squeers drily.
1	And hadn’t Astley’s cause to bless itself for their all going together once a quarter--to the pit--and didn’t Kit’s mother always say, when they painted the outside, that Kit’s last treat had helped to that, and wonder what the manager would feel if he but knew it as they passed his house!
1	‘We are all as happy as possible!’ said Traddles.
1	The responsibility of giving the lady away devolved upon the Aged, which led to the clergyman's being unintentionally scandalized, and it happened thus.
1	He was reconciled to what had happened, and went down again quite happy.
1	To make these dwellings as habitable and full of comfort as they could, was now their pleasant care.
1	Have the goodness to confine your dealings strictly to trade and business, and not to travel beyond it.
1	Official sentiments are one thing.
1	‘Dear Pa, if you knew how much I think this morning of what you told me once, about the first time of our seeing old Mr Harmon, when I stamped and screamed and beat you with my detestable little bonnet!
1	Really the time is come (we being at present all mixing ourselves up with what oughtn’t to be), when Doctor Strong must be told that this was full as plain to everybody as the sun, before Mr. Maldon went to India; that Mr. Maldon made excuses to come back, for nothing else; and that he’s always here, for nothing else.
1	‘But I say yes,’ returned his friend.
1	Mad as Bedlam, boy!’ said Mr. Dick, taking snuff from a round box on the table, and laughing heartily.
1	Florence would see that the boys were fond of him; and that would make her happy.
1	‘Mr Dombey,’ pursued Cleopatra, smoothing the rosy hue upon her cheeks, ‘accordingly repeated his visit; and possibly finding some attraction in the simplicity and primitiveness of our tastes--for there is always a charm in nature--it is so very sweet--became one of our little circle every evening.
1	I merely confer with you, on the painful necessity you find yourself under, of depriving this young man of the great advantages of your counsel and instruction.’ ‘It is very lamentable, sir,’ Mr. Crisparkle represented.
1	‘Assuredly, Madame Flintwinch is an oracle!
1	He can speak of nothing else.
1	‘(Private) I ask your pardon, sir,’ said Mr Chivery in a secret manner; ‘but which way might you be going?’ ‘I am going over the Bridge.’ He saw in Mr Chivery, with some astonishment, quite an Allegory of Silence, as he stood with his key on his lips.
1	Did you ever taste beer?’ ‘I had a sip of it once,’ said the small servant.
1	Perhaps--who shall decide on such mysteries!--he was afraid that he might come to hate her.
1	‘I’m a bacheldore.’ ‘A bachelor!’ I said, astonished.
1	‘Why would you?’ ‘If you please, sir, I am very fond of flowers,’ returned the girl.
1	He was familiar with him, in the very extremity of his sense of the distance between them.
1	pointing in the direction of the rag and bottle shop.
1	"I should like to walk a little," says my Lady, still looking out of her window.
1	‘You come on business, sir.
1	‘It is still the truth, Harriet, and my mind is lighter when I think of him for that which made it so much heavier then.’ He checked himself in his tone of melancholy, and smiled upon her as he said ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye, dear John!
1	‘A very judicious arrangement,’ observed Ralph with a sneer, ‘if your husband will keep within it, ma’am--as no doubt he will.’ ‘Demmit!’ exclaimed Mr. Mantalini, opening his eyes at the sound of Ralph’s voice, ‘it is a horrid reality.
1	"You don't object to him, little woman?"
1	‘Let’s hear what John did.’ He did not appear to have hidden anything, so went off rather flatly.
1	Mr Henry Gowan?’ ‘Perfectly, sir,’ returned Mr Sparkler.
1	The gluttony of Swine is put before us, as an example to the young.” (I thought this pretty well in him who had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy.)
1	'I told you before,' replied Nancy, 'that I was afraid to speak to you there.
1	‘I think they must certainly come to-morrow, eh mother?’ said Kit, laying aside his hat with a weary air and sighing as he spoke.
1	‘You’ll excuse me, Sir,’ said Mr Toots, holding his forehead, ‘but I’m at present in that state that my brain is going, if not gone, and anything approaching to politeness in an individual so situated would be a hollow mockery.
1	Mr Towlinson replies to Cook, far be it from him to stand in the way of that good feeling which he could wish to see; and adjourning in quest of the housemaid, and presently returning with that young lady on his arm, informs the kitchen that foreigners is only his fun, and that him and Anne have now resolved to take one another for better for worse, and to settle in Oxford Market in the general greengrocery and herb and leech line, where your kind favours is particular requested.
1	‘To be sure you didn’t,’ said the little old man; ‘of course not.
1	Mr. Vholes, and his young client, and several blue bags hastily stuffed out of all regularity of form, as the larger sort of serpents are in their first gorged state, have returned to the official den.
1	‘We shall soon find out whether he is or not.’ The unfortunate youth had only interchanged a dozen words with Mr. Snodgrass, that gentleman having implored him to make a private appeal to some friend to release him, and then pushed him out with the snuff- box, lest his prolonged absence should lead to a discovery.
1	The coach was punctual to the time appointed; and Mr. Weller, after duly installing Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Winkle inside, took his seat on the box by the driver.
1	croaked the Jew, in his usual voice.
1	retorts Mr. Bucket with a steadfast look, but without loss of temper.
1	‘There were three things,’ said Little Dorrit, ‘that I thought I would like to say, if you were alone and I might come up-stairs.
1	He is not hungry, Mrs. Bedwin,' said the gentleman:  looking very wise.
1	You know how sensitive I am to unkindness.
1	‘And very much to be deplored it was, on all accounts!
1	Noah Claypole, bespeaking his good lady's attention, proceeded to enlighten her relative to the arrangement he had made, with all that haughtiness and air of superiority, becoming, not only a member of the sterner sex, but a gentleman who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on the kinchin lay, in London and its vicinity.
1	Not such power of wind has blown for many a winter night.
1	The milkman, after shaking his head at her darkly, released her chin, and with anything rather than good-will opened his can, and deposited the usual quantity in the family jug.
1	‘But, first and foremost, Slider, burn the box.
1	‘O, pray don’t punish him any more,’ cried Little Dorrit.
1	We don’t want any documents.
1	‘Here’s sport!’ he cried, ‘sport ready to my hand, all invented and arranged, and only to be enjoyed.
1	The family room looked very small and very mean, and the downward staircase by which it was attained looked very narrow and very crooked.
1	I couldn’t see Mr Gills, could I?’ said Mr Toots; ‘because--’ ‘If you could see Sol Gills, young gen’l’m’n,’ said the Captain, impressively, and laying his heavy hand on Mr Toots’s knee, ‘old Sol, mind you--with your own eyes--as you sit there--you’d be welcomer to me, than a wind astern, to a ship becalmed.
1	‘I couldn’t write like that, now-a-days.
1	To give himself up to being put in the way of arning a good living and getting on, he must give me up.
1	‘Peek--christian name; Weeks-- surname; good, ver good.
1	Try the antidote,’ rejoined Mr. Crisparkle; ‘and may it give you a brighter and better view of the case!
1	"Then here's your hat," returns his new friend, quite as intimate with it as if he had made it; "and if you're ready, I am."
1	“How do you manage, Biddy,” said I, “to learn everything that I learn, and always to keep up with me?” I was beginning to be rather vain of my knowledge, for I spent my birthday guineas on it, and set aside the greater part of my pocket-money for similar investment; though I have no doubt, now, that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price.
1	The trial came on at once, and, when he was put to the bar, he was seated in a chair.
1	‘Jupiter!’ exclaimed Mr. Folair, ‘what an unsophisticated shepherd you are, Johnson!
1	She had a curious propensity to call Mrs. Bounderby ‘Miss Gradgrind,’ and yielded to it some three or four score times in the course of the evening.
1	‘He does not seem to see us.
1	Or that night, when I frowned at him?
1	‘“Will you never love any one but me--never marry any one beside?” said the young lady.
1	‘I didn’t do anything in particular,’ said Traddles.
1	I wonder who!’ ‘Is it not very likely that some lady has been taken by him, and that he may love her dearly?’ ‘Perhaps.
1	However, men always think they know best.
1	It was a weak fancy perhaps, the childish fancy of a young and lonely creature; but night after night, and still the sisters loitered in the same place, and still the child followed with a mild and softened heart.
1	I simply request you to care about nothing--or seem to care about nothing--as everybody else does.’ ‘Do I ever say I care about anything?’ asked Mr Merdle.
1	Sometimes she’s proud and won’t touch it for a length of time; sometimes she’s so poor that she must have it.
1	‘You shall not escape me in this way, you morose backwoodsman,’ retorts Lady Tippins.
1	To Scrooge's horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful range of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the dreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.
1	It matters little to me where I live, and I had a desperate hope that some intelligence might be cast in my way there, which would not reach me elsewhere.
1	‘The next I make for you, I hope will be made less clumsily.
1	‘Good master?’ inquired Mrs Brown.
1	‘--Has vispered to me,’ resumed his father, ‘that it vould be better to dewote the liquor to vishin’ you success and prosperity, and thankin’ you for the manner in which you’ve brought this here business through.
1	Both of us did business with him.
1	Why, from you.” “I never told you.” “Told me!
1	He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money; then struck at me with a whip.
1	To this rumour John always returned a stout denial, which he accompanied, however, with a lurking grin, that rendered the suspicious doubtful, and fully confirmed all previous believers.
1	As to this point, and as to some minor topics, there are differences of opinion; but it is perfectly clear to the brilliant and distinguished circle, all round, that nobody is in question but Boodle and his retinue, and Buffy and HIS retinue.
1	He needed some such touch then.
1	But I know what I have seen, and what I have looked in the face in this world here, where I find myself.
1	There was a kettle on the hob, as there had been night and day for fifteen years.
1	The Veneerings have been, as usual, indefatigably dealing dinner cards to Society, and whoever desires to take a hand had best be quick about it, for it is written in the Books of the Insolvent Fates that Veneering shall make a resounding smash next week.
1	In silence they go walking up and down together, walking up and down together, till her love and company have brought him to himself.” Notwithstanding Miss Pross's denial of her own imagination, there was a perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea, in her repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which testified to her possessing such a thing.
1	He had not expected that the house would wear any different aspect--had known indeed that it could not--but coming upon it in the midst of eager thoughts and expectations, it checked the current in its flow, and darkened it with a mournful shadow.
1	What did you expect me to do?
1	It will naturally be very painful to him to find that you are singular in your character and conduct.
1	You have regularly given me up.
1	Also that I can accept no second or inferior position.
1	In this latter establishment there were two curious cases.
1	So they told him yes again.
1	‘He don’t seem to care about his dress,’ thought Tom, ‘and yet how capitally he does it.
1	So goes the wintry day outside the Dedlock mansion.
1	‘If you please.’ ‘Or would next day,’ said Mr Dombey, ‘suit your engagements better?’ ‘I have no engagements.
1	‘It was Miss Edwards who did that, I KNOW,’ said Miss Monflathers predictively.
1	Thank you, thank you.’ He felt that it was better to respect her entreaty, and did not move while her slight form went quickly away from him.
1	Stand down, sir.’ ‘Would any other gen’l’man like to ask me anythin’?’ inquired Sam, taking up his hat, and looking round most deliberately.
1	said Mr. Bumble, stirring his tea, and looking up into the matron's face; 'are _you_ hard-hearted, Mrs.
1	I am going there now for my lesson.
1	"Very good; I see by these portraits that you take a strong interest in the fashionable great, sir?"
1	Newman answered the summons, and Ralph raised his eyes stealthily to his face, as if he almost feared to read there, a knowledge of his recent thoughts.
1	Pokey unknowns, amazed to find how intimately they know Veneering, pluck up spirit, fold their arms, and begin to contradict him before breakfast.
1	‘No, I do not indeed,’ replied Mr. Pickwick.
1	‘You were speaking about its being a girl,’ said Miss Betsey.
1	But as to advising or encouraging or occupying a serious station towards anybody or anything, it is simply not to be thought of in such a child as Skimpole."
1	‘These are my holidays.’ ‘Are they, by George!’ muttered Riderhood, with his eyes on the passion-wasted face.
1	'I'll run all the way, sir.'
1	Sir Leicester and the baronetcy, Sir Leicester and Chesney Wold, Sir Leicester and his ancestors and his patrimony"--Mr. Tulkinghorn very dry here--"are, I need not say to you, Lady Dedlock, inseparable."
1	His face grew purple; his eyes were starting from his head, and with protruded tongue, he seemed to mock me.
1	With all her perfections on her head, my Lady Dedlock has come up from her place in Lincolnshire (hotly pursued by the fashionable intelligence) to pass a few days at her house in town previous to her departure for Paris, where her ladyship intends to stay some weeks, after which her movements are uncertain.
1	Many thousands are in want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir."
1	I say 'Mighty potentate, here IS my homage!
1	That the hope of giving birth to a new partner in such a House, could not fail to awaken a glorious and stirring ambition in the breast of the least ambitious of her sex.
1	‘Mind you don’t break out again, you villain,’ said Quilp, looking sternly at him, ‘or I’ll make faces at you and throw you into fits, I will.
1	“And what wind,” said Miss Havisham, “blows you here, Pip?” Though she looked steadily at me, I saw that she was rather confused.
1	After casting about for some time for a name which should be worthy of her, he decided in favour of Sophronia Sphynx, as being euphonious and genteel, and furthermore indicative of mystery.
1	"Go before me and show me all those dreadful places.
1	Was it an unequal marriage in point of years, this unlucky job of yours?’ said Mr. Bounderby.
1	The effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose I found to be quite awful.
1	Both said that the trade, the manufactures, the commerce, the prosperity of Eatanswill, would ever be dearer to their hearts than any earthly object; and each had it in his power to state, with the utmost confidence, that he was the man who would eventually be returned.
1	But prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded looking-glass, and that I made out at first sight to be a fine lady's dressing-table.
1	Leave it.’ The topic was so disagreeable to him, and so put his usual liveliness to the rout, that Mrs Plornish forbore to press him further: the rather as the tea had been drawing for some time on the hob.
1	Nicholas had the honour to support her, and Mr. Crummles was placed upon the chairman’s right; the Phenomenon and the Master Crummleses sustained the vice.
1	If she were to try one, she would find her teeth in her way, modelling that action of her face, as she has unconsciously modelled all its other expressions, on her pattern of sordid age.
1	The news is--’ ‘Bad?’ interrupted Newman.
1	What else is so extremely charming!
1	‘So he is very impressible.
1	The strange man said nothing but made another snort.
1	“Now you see, Joseph and wife,” said Pumblechook, as he took me by the arm above the elbow, “I am one of them that always go right through with what they've begun.
1	I have been at your disposal, and waiting your pleasure, ever since.’ ‘There was much to arrange before I could leave; and when I did leave, I travelled a little for rest and relief.’ She turned her face towards him, as not having heard or understood his last words.
1	‘Try not to do it again, my dear Clara, and keep a watch upon yourself.’ My mother’s lips moved, as if she answered ‘Yes, my dear Edward,’ but she said nothing aloud.
1	Over the little mantelshelf, was a picture of the ‘Sarah Jane’ lugger, built at Sunderland, with a real little wooden stern stuck on to it; a work of art, combining composition with carpentry, which I considered to be one of the most enviable possessions that the world could afford.
1	It was no unfit messenger of death, who had disturbed the quiet of the matron's room.
1	‘What can it mean?’ she thought, as she accompanied him up stairs.
1	Life and death went hand in hand; wealth and poverty stood side by side; repletion and starvation laid them down together.
1	But his good friend had a weakness which none of us need go into the next street to find, and which no amount of Circumlocution experience could long subdue in him.
1	My mother glances submissively at them, shuts the book, and lays it by as an arrear to be worked out when my other tasks are done.
1	His appetite is wery so-so, but he imbibes wonderful.’ Some thoughts of the rum appeared to obtrude themselves on Mr. Weller’s mind, as he said this; for he looked gloomy and thoughtful; but he very shortly recovered, as was testified by a perfect alphabet of winks, in which he was only wont to indulge when particularly pleased.
1	"I didn't see YOU," says Mercury.
1	‘With the blessing of Providence, Master Copperfield,’ returned Uriah.
1	‘I am sure I didn’t myself.
1	No boat would then be hired for the purpose, and no boatmen; that would save at least a chance of suspicion, and any chance is worth saving.
1	‘It may be my fancy, or it may be that I cannot separate the place from the old recollections associated with it, but this part of London I cannot bear.
1	Mr. George smokes with a profound meaning after this and surveys Miss Flite in silence.
1	Do you see nothing that he might do, under the disappointment?” “I have seen it, Herbert, and dreamed of it, ever since the fatal night of his arrival.
1	The word would not have been exchanged, but that the housebreaker was unable to open the door:  on which he was expending fruitless oaths and violence, when the Jew came panting up.
1	This tall man, Tom, is a rascally adventurer.
1	I was in mortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver; I was in mortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg; I was in mortal terror of myself, from whom an awful promise had been extracted; I had no hope of deliverance through my all-powerful sister, who repulsed me at every turn; I am afraid to think of what I might have done on requirement, in the secrecy of my terror.
1	Yet there was a remarkable gentleness and childishness about these people, a special inaptitude for any kind of sharp practice, and an untiring readiness to help and pity one another, deserving often of as much respect, and always of as much generous construction, as the every-day virtues of any class of people in the world.
1	Seeing me interested in this contrivance, he looked up at it with a great deal of pride, and said that he had been thinking of improving it, and that he hoped the hammer and a little piece of broken glass beside it ‘would play music before long.’  He had extracted some colours from the yarn with which he worked, and painted a few poor figures on the wall.
1	There is very little choice or difference between them; and they may be likened to the car portion of the swings at an English fair, roofed, put upon axle-trees and wheels, and curtained with painted canvas.
1	‘But I will not allow it.
1	I had the honour of making a great success then; I hope to have the honour of making a great success now.
1	Oliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him.
1	That young lady was, no doubt, an acquisition to the Boffins.
1	Rather a curious speculation how Fledgeby would otherwise have disposed of his leisure until Doomsday.
1	Will you perform upon a pipe, sir?’ ‘I am but an indifferent performer, sir,’ returns the other; ‘but I’ll accompany you with a whiff or two at intervals.’ So, Mr Venus mixes, and Wegg mixes; and Mr Venus lights and puffs, and Wegg lights and puffs.
1	I was not sure that I had a right to lay his whole story open, but I referred in a few words to his estrangement from Mr Jarndyce and to his being entangled in the ill-fated Chancery suit.
1	'There ain't,' said Sikes, fixing his eyes upon her, and muttering the words to himself; 'there ain't a stauncher-hearted gal going, or I'd have cut her throat three months ago.
1	Other conversation followed, and induced me to ask her how she knew that it was only necessary for her to make a suggestion to me, to have it obeyed?
1	Mr. Pickwick, sir?’ ‘Confidence is a great thing in these cases,’ observed Mr. Pickwick.
1	replied the Ghost, "do you believe in me or not?"
1	I say, gentlemen, my uncle stopped here, for a minute, to look about him; and then, paying a compliment to the weather, which had a little cleared up, though the moon was sinking, walked on again, as royally as before; keeping the middle of the road with great dignity, and looking as if he would very much like to meet with somebody who would dispute possession of it with him.
1	‘So have I,’ said the stranger.
1	I had no difficulty in recognizing either Minnie or Minnie’s children.
1	So he gallops close to the ‘orse’s legs, And he claps his head vithin; And the Bishop says, ‘Sure as eggs is eggs, This here’s the bold Turpin!’ And the Bishop says, ‘Sure as eggs is eggs, This here’s the bold Turpin!’ Says Turpin, ‘You shall eat your words, With a sarse of leaden bul-- let;’ So he puts a pistol to his mouth, And he fires it down his gul-- let.
1	There would have been loss, disgrace, I don’t know what at all.
1	Very much!’ ‘Did she object to it?’ ‘SHE didn’t,’ rejoined Traddles; ‘but her eldest sister--the one that’s the Beauty--quite made game of it, I understand.
1	Mr. Bucket merely shakes the finger at her.
1	Satisfied that her dwelling was safe, she drew one hand through the old man’s arm and prepared to ply her crutch-stick with the other.
1	Being allowed to purchase the means of writing, and a light, he sat down to write until such time as the prison lamps should be extinguished.
1	‘I hope,’ said that lady, ‘that this unaccountable conduct may not be the beginning of his taking to his bed and living there all his life, like the Thirsty Woman of Tutbury, or the Cock-lane Ghost, or some of those extraordinary creatures.
1	Toots, as an old hand, had a desk to himself in one corner: and a magnificent man, of immense age, he looked, in Paul’s young eyes, behind it.
1	In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and lovable.
1	If he would only have brushed up his hair or turned up his collar, it would have been bad enough; but to know that that absurd figure was always gazing at me, and always in that demonstrative state of despondency, put such a constraint upon me that I did not like to laugh at the play, or to cry at it, or to move, or to speak.
1	My companion paid our two drivers, who were as completely covered with splashes as if they had been dragged along the roads like the carriage itself, and giving them some brief direction where to take it, lifted me out of it and into a hackney-coach he had chosen from the rest.
1	The others follow; and there is a blithe and merry ringing, as of a little peal of marriage bells.
1	‘I’ll look in upon you to-morrow, young man.
1	He died some five years afterwards and left a diary behind him, with letters and other materials towards his life, which was published and which showed him to have been the victim of a combination on the part of mankind against an amiable child.
1	‘You are the next?’ muttered the Manager.
1	Of course it is a far, far better place--millions of times--than any I have ever been used to until lately; and I fancy I don’t look at it with my own eyes, but with hers.
1	I have done with the red coat, believe me.
1	Not that it required much penetration to say that, because I knew that his being there at all was an act of kindness.
1	The strong tide filled his throat, and bore him on, upon its rapid current.
1	"What has ever got your precious father then?"
1	This produced a settled gloom, which in time developed a morbid insanity, and finally terminated in raving madness.
1	"On the wings of the wind," replied the Ghost.
1	‘Codicil among the dust?’ another guesses.
1	Has Mr. Tulkinghorn been disturbed?
1	In compliance with Mr. Fagin's request, the Artful untied this bundle, which was of large size, and formed of an old table-cloth; and handed the articles it contained, one by one, to Charley Bates: who placed them on the table, with various encomiums on their rarity and excellence.
1	Mrs Boffin, plunging at it, brought it to Bella’s lap, where both Mrs and Mr Boffin (as the saying is) ‘took it out of’ the Inexhaustible in a shower of caresses.
1	“Biddy!” I exclaimed, in amazement.
1	One or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops and went a little way down the street before me, that they might turn, as if they had forgotten something, and pass me face to face,--on which occasions I don't know whether they or I made the worse pretence; they of not doing it, or I of not seeing it.
1	He had no occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my patron, neither had I occasion to confess my own.
1	She came out from behind it, with her work in her hand, and joined him in surveying me.
1	You wonder for a long time how she goes on, for there seems to be nobody in charge of her; and when another of these dull machines comes splashing by, you feel quite indignant with it, as a sullen cumbrous, ungraceful, unshiplike leviathan: quite forgetting that the vessel you are on board of, is its very counterpart.
1	On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctor's table, but on other days persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the lower regions, or in her own room on the second floor--a blue chamber, to which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance.
1	Why, what have you got there, Betty?
1	She ses to me she ses 'are you the boy at the inkwhich?'
1	Not this world, oh, not this!
1	You know that well enough, so don’t talk nonsense.’ Mr Brass received this observation with increased meekness, merely remarking, under his breath, that he didn’t like that kind of joking, and that Miss Sally would be ‘a much better fellow’ if she forbore to aggravate him.
1	He would have thought, even if there were no such design as that, had he brought him there to play with his repressed emotions, and torment him?
1	What Mr. Sapsea likes in that young man is, that he is always ready to profit by the wisdom of his elders, and that he is sound, sir, at the core.
1	'I--I drink your health with cheerfulness, Mrs. Mann'; and he swallowed half of it.
1	An appropriate remembrance, presenting an exemplary model for imitation, is revived in the woman’s mind by the sight of the place.
1	It do come in, and it do not come in.
1	'That is my name,' said the old gentleman.
1	‘You and I will perform a little business on our private account by-and-by.’ ‘And just now,’ said Ralph, ‘we had better transact our own, perhaps.’ ‘If you please,’ said Squeers.
1	‘A poor fellow with a craze, sir,’ said Mr. Dick, ‘a simpleton, a weak-minded person--present company, you know!’ striking himself again, ‘may do what wonderful people may not do.
1	Smike becomes known to Mrs. Nickleby and Kate.
1	In the same manner, when he judged it prudent to allow her to depart, he supported her downstairs, after adjusting her shawl and performing such little offices, most probably for the first time in his life.
1	‘Are you a cricketer?’ inquired Mr. Wardle of the marksman.
1	‘I should sleep the worse,’ answered Nicholas, impatiently.
1	Therefore, I followed him without a word, to a retired nook of the garden, formed by the junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish.
1	Sir Leicester is apprehensive that my Lady, not being very well, will take cold at that open window.
1	And yet,” said Pumblechook, turning to the landlord and waiter, and pointing me out at arm's length, “this is him as I ever sported with in his days of happy infancy!
1	there is a likeness,’ said Mr. Kenwigs, after some reflection.
1	He looked in at the Bank.
1	Into one pocket of this greatcoat, he thrust his left hand the moment he dismounted, while from the other he drew forth, with his right, a very bright and glaring silk handkerchief, with which he whisked a speck or two of dust from his boots, and then, crumpling it in his hand, swaggered up the court.
1	"Will you come and dine with me?"
1	It was within a week of the close of the month of July, that a hackney cabriolet, number unrecorded, was seen to proceed at a rapid pace up Goswell Street; three people were squeezed into it besides the driver, who sat in his own particular little dickey at the side; over the apron were hung two shawls, belonging to two small vixenish-looking ladies under the apron; between whom, compressed into a very small compass, was stowed away, a gentleman of heavy and subdued demeanour, who, whenever he ventured to make an observation, was snapped up short by one of the vixenish ladies before-mentioned.
1	Down in Bleeding Heart Yard there was scarcely an inhabitant of note to whom Mr Pancks had not imparted his demonstration, and, as figures are catching, a kind of cyphering measles broke out in that locality, under the influence of which the whole Yard was light-headed.
1	So, one day she stopped the coachman a little way from the cottage, and got out and walked on and peeped in at the door, and there, as usual, was the tiny woman spinning at her wheel, and she looked at the Princess, and the Princess looked at her.’ ‘Like trying to stare one another out,’ said Maggy.
1	A little more elbow-room is all we want here.
1	It were better not to know.
1	He has all Tulkinghorn's, and an excellent business besides.
1	See what a pleasant path; and there’s the bird--the same bird--now he flies to another tree, and stays to sing.
1	The connection in question, being really people of importance and consideration--’ ‘As to that,’ said Edward Dorrit, Esquire, ‘I’ll give you the means of judging for yourself.
1	With this the parties separated, very much to their common satisfaction; Mr. Pickwick once more retracing his steps to the lodge, and the three companions adjourning to the coffee-room, there to spend the five shillings which the clerical gentleman had, with admirable prudence and foresight, borrowed of him for the purpose.
1	‘Have I cut my heart into a demd extraordinary number of little pieces, and given them all away, one after another, to the same little engrossing demnition captivater, and can I live to be suspected by her?
1	I'm wery poor and ill, and I thought I'd come back here when there warn't nobody about, and lay down and hide somewheres as I knows on till arter dark, and then go and beg a trifle of Mr. Snagsby.
1	My aunt leaned her elbow on the little round table that she usually kept beside her, and eyed him attentively.
1	But I would leave the matter there.
1	‘Sudden disappearance--talk of the whole city--search made everywhere without success--public fountain in the great square suddenly ceased playing--weeks elapsed-- still a stoppage--workmen employed to clean it--water drawn off--father- in-law discovered sticking head first in the main pipe, with a full confession in his right boot--took him out, and the fountain played away again, as well as ever.’ ‘Will you allow me to note that little romance down, Sir?’ said Mr. Snodgrass, deeply affected.
1	'I do not seek to know where these dreadful people live, but where will you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time?'
1	The scent of the restoratives that had been tried was pungent in the room, but had no fragrance in the dull and languid air the lady breathed.
1	He loved his country, and couldn't bear it, and had given information.
1	It is thought better that his old housekeeper should give him Lady Dedlock's letter, the contents of which no one knows or can surmise.
1	Shall I shake that faith in Bucket because I want it myself; shall I deliberately blunt one of Bucket's weapons; shall I positively paralyse Bucket in his next detective operation?
1	But my godmother wrote a stiff letter declining for me, and I never went.
1	‘No, I have got it; here it is,’ said Mr Boffin, dusting it with the sleeve of his coat.
1	By little and little it revealed itself to be a woman's--a lady's--Lady Dedlock's.
1	His coming back was a venture, he said, and he had always known it to be a venture.
1	‘Shut the shop-door!’ he then said to his daughter, putting the glass suddenly down.
1	You can find a lady there, I know.’ ‘More easily than I can make one of such material as myself, Jenny.’ The sparkling eye looked steadfastly up, as the musing face looked thoughtfully down.
1	But before I remove one jot of these stains, I must hear the whole from you.
1	He dresses at that gentleman (by whom he is patronized), talks at him, walks at him, founds himself entirely on him.
1	At tea, my prisoner got up to fetch her pocket handkercher from the bedroom where the bonnets was; she was rather a long time gone and came back a little out of wind.
1	inquired the Jew, with eagerness.
1	Even the children were instructed, each to dip a wooden spoon into Mr. Micawber’s pot, and pledge us in its contents.
1	In a word, they were married, and had gone into the church for no other purpose.
1	"I am the son of your housekeeper, Lady Dedlock, and passed my childhood about this house.
1	A gloomy house the Bower, with sordid signs on it of having been, through its long existence as Harmony Jail, in miserly holding.
1	‘Yes, Mary Anne?’ ‘Young Mr Hexam, if you please, ma’am, coming to see Mr Headstone.’ ‘Very good, Mary Anne.’ Again Mary Anne held up her arm.
1	‘Fifteen hundred and twenty-seven pound, four and ninepence ha’penny,’ replied Mr. Scaley, without moving a limb.
1	"You know I don't," said I.
1	As his sister hid behind her nurse, he followed her with his eyes; and when she peeped out with a merry cry to him, he sprang up and crowed lustily--laughing outright when she ran in upon him; and seeming to fondle her curls with his tiny hands, while she smothered him with kisses.
1	I only mean that Mr--’ ‘Again, dearest Georgiana?’ ‘That Alfred--’ ‘Sounds much better, darling.’ ‘--Loves you so.
1	‘Let me see,’ said the legal authority.
1	I'll tell you why, Pip.” He had taken up the poker again; without which, I doubt if he could have proceeded in his demonstration.
1	I shall be more so when I look back upon it, and all is done, I know.’ ‘Your tears fall faster as you talk of happiness,’ said Nicholas, ‘and you shun the contemplation of that dark future which must be laden with so much misery to you.
1	I only got my chest away by means of a friend as nobody’s a match for.
1	When you are looking at a pair of the most delicious lips in the world, and see them gently break into a roguish smile--if you are very near them, and nobody else by--you cannot better testify your admiration of their beautiful form and colour than by kissing them at once.
1	Do you think--’ ‘I never quite thought so,’ said Little Dorrit, more to herself than him.
1	Pickwick is pretty well acquainted with these proceedings.
1	It’s my memory, that fire, and shows me all my life.’ The child, bending down to listen to his words, could not help remarking with what brightened eyes he continued to speak and muse.
1	They took one silent turn backward and forward in the shade of the wall, getting, at the height on which the quarantine barracks are placed, what cool refreshment of sea breeze there was at seven in the morning.
1	Kneeling down and pouring out her thankfulness with uplifted hands, her thanks were for her father.
1	If you are, you must take yourself off, Mrs. Peg--or be taken off.
1	The crisp air, the sunlight, the movement on the river, and the moving river itself,--the road that ran with us, seeming to sympathize with us, animate us, and encourage us on,--freshened me with new hope.
1	‘Some friend of his, as welcome here as he,’ said the old man.
1	‘Come along with me, I’ve got something to tell you.’ ‘Where am I?’ said Mrs Nubbles.
1	Dear Master, dear Mistress, take me back again, and give me back the dear old name!
1	Mr. Bucket brings a chair and diminishes his shadow.
1	Not even in that childish walk of long ago, were they so far removed from all the world about them as to-day.
1	I describe everything exactly as it took place, constraining my mind not to wander from the task.
1	"But you might know it," observed the gentleman.
1	she cried, jumping fiercely up: her face flushed, and her eyes starting from her head--'I robbed her, so I did!
1	I know it was then and there that I had it.
1	The lady lay upon her bed as he had left her, clasping her little daughter to her breast.
1	Hows’ever, it warn’t paid, and so they cuts the water off.
1	He followed directly, and met Harriet Carker on the stair.
1	Or more?’ ‘I beg your pardon, ma’am,’ said Mary Anne, disconcerted now she came to think of it; ‘but I don’t know that I mean more than her brother himself.’ As she said it, she unhooked her arm.
1	If ever you’re attacked with the gout, sir, jist you marry a widder as has got a good loud woice, with a decent notion of usin’ it, and you’ll never have the gout agin.
1	‘I was saying,’ she pursued, ‘that my brother’s illness has occasioned a delay in examining and arranging papa’s property.’ ‘Yes,’ said Mr Merdle; ‘yes.
1	‘A personal discussion, Sophronia, my love?
1	I do mean to say, however, that the whole facts, taken together, will be sufficient to justify you, in the minds of all reasonable men.
1	There is adaptability of character in Fanny.
1	No full-bottomed wig, no red petticoats, no fur, no javelin-men, no white wands.
1	‘Why, and here’s Fanny in tears now!’ exclaimed Miss Price, as if in fresh amazement.
1	Outside, the stately oaks, rooted for ages in the green ground which has never known ploughshare, but was still a chase when kings rode to battle with sword and shield and rode a-hunting with bow and arrow, bear witness to his greatness.
1	‘Not a word,’ said Quilp, making towards the door on tiptoe.
1	‘Really musical, isn’t it, my dear Copperfield?’ said Traddles.
1	Two gentlemen were waiting in it; one was a little, fat man, with black hair; and the other--a portly personage in a braided surtout--was sitting with perfect equanimity on a camp-stool.
1	What’s that noise?’ Then the noise, if there were any, would have ceased, and Mr Flintwinch would snarl, turning upon her as if she had cut him down that moment against his will, ‘Affery, old woman, you shall have a dose, old woman, such a dose!
1	It formed a part of this same short document; and he derived from it the remarkable fact that the sheets of foolscap paper it had devoted to the public service would pave the footways on both sides of Oxford Street from end to end, and leave nearly a quarter of a mile to spare for the park (Immense cheering and laughter); while of tape--red tape--it had used enough to stretch, in graceful festoons, from Hyde Park Corner to the General Post Office.
1	But when the time of trial came, the younger brother’s heart was full of those old days.
1	A few bilious Britons there were who would not subscribe to this article of faith; but their objection was purely theoretical.
1	“The house with the bow-window,” said Wemmick, “being by the river-side, down the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich, and being kept, it seems, by a very respectable widow who has a furnished upper floor to let, Mr. Herbert put it to me, what did I think of that as a temporary tenement for Tom, Jack, or Richard?
1	Debilitated cousin thinks--country's going--Dayvle--steeple-chase pace.
1	During this space he had not been to his mother’s dismal old house.
1	From each arm, she unclasped a diamond bracelet, flung it down, and trod upon the glittering heap.
1	And I might as well have spoken to the iron funnel of the strongest sea-going steamer that passes the Fellowship Porters.’ ‘No, Miss,’ Lizzie pleaded; ‘because that would not be thankful, and I am.’ ‘I vow and declare I am half ashamed of myself for taking such an interest in you,’ said Miss Abbey, pettishly, ‘for I don’t believe I should do it if you were not good-looking.
1	"Jobling," says Mr. Guppy, "myself and our mutual friend Smallweed--" Mr. Smallweed modestly observes, "Gentlemen both!"
1	Another answered, and he called again, but louder than before; then another spoke and then another; and each time the first, aggravated by contradiction, insisted on his case more strongly.
1	‘But let us come away from the window.’ The private residence of Mr Pancks was in Pentonville, where he lodged on the second-floor of a professional gentleman in an extremely small way, who had an inner-door within the street door, poised on a spring and starting open with a click like a trap; and who wrote up in the This scroll, majestic in its severe simplicity, illuminated a little slip of front garden abutting on the thirsty high-road, where a few of the dustiest of leaves hung their dismal heads and led a life of choking.
1	Have you posts of profitable pecuniary emolument?
1	‘If I was to let you loose this once,’ said Riderhood then, still following, ‘I could make you come to me agin, or I could find you out in one way or another.
1	Another friendly demonstration towards him Mr Wegg now regularly gratified.
1	"Is this a healthy place to live in, Richard, do you think?"
1	Mrs. Rouncewell is in attendance and receives Sir Leicester's customary shake of the hand with a profound curtsy.
1	What those treasures are they keep so secret that the court is maddened.
1	Mr. Bucket (still grave) inquires if to-morrow morning, now, would suit, in case he should be as for'ard as he expects to be.
1	"Then you didn't think, at all events," proceeded Mr. Skimpole, "to this effect: 'Harold Skimpole loves to see the sun shine, loves to hear the wind blow, loves to watch the changing lights and shadows, loves to hear the birds, those choristers in Nature's great cathedral.
1	THAT I have discovered beyond the possibility of doubt.
1	The canal extends to the foot of the mountain, and there, of course, it stops; the passengers being conveyed across it by land carriage, and taken on afterwards by another canal boat, the counterpart of the first, which awaits them on the other side.
1	But I do mean it!’ retorted Kit.
1	Soon after the marriage of the young people, the worthy doctor returned to Chertsey, where, bereft of the presence of his old friends, he would have been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a feeling; and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how.
1	And now, what have you got to say next?’ ‘Merely this, Miss Trotwood,’ he returned.
1	‘My dearest, darling child, what necessity has he had, yet awhile, to say anything?’ ‘And you have never heard Mrs General say anything?’ ‘My goodness me, Amy,’ returned Fanny, ‘is she the sort of woman to say anything?
1	‘Nineteen, eh!’ said Ralph; ‘and what do you mean to do for your bread, sir?’ ‘Not to live upon my mother,’ replied Nicholas, his heart swelling as he spoke.
1	I can be happier in nothing than in your happiness.
1	“I repeated the medicines I had given her, and I sat at the side of the bed until the night was far advanced.
1	“Do you play?” “I think, sir,” said the spy, in the meanest manner, as he turned to Mr. Lorry, “I may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence, to put it to this other gentleman, so much your junior, whether he can under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace of which he has spoken.
1	The shady waiting-rooms of the Circumlocution Office, where he passed a good deal of time in company with various troublesome Convicts who were under sentence to be broken alive on that wheel, had afforded Arthur Clennam ample leisure, in three or four successive days, to exhaust the subject of his late glimpse of Miss Wade and Tattycoram.
1	‘He said he must go along with the other one, and so they persuaded Perker to write again, and they’ve got him something on the same estate; not near so good, Perker says, as a convict would get in New South Wales, if he appeared at his trial in a new suit of clothes.’ ‘Foolish fellow,’ said Mr. Pickwick, with glistening eyes.
1	And the natural consequence is, as anybody but a baby might have foreseen, that he prowls and wanders.
1	He was to be away a long, long time.
1	They were all about the new house.
1	‘Everybody must feel it so.’ ‘I feel it more than other people,’ said Mrs. Gummidge.
1	"Don't you contradict when there ain't no occasion, and you won't be took in that way.
1	"Oh, Esther, you would never guess!"
1	‘Is this Captain Cuttle’s house?’ ‘No,’ said Mrs MacStinger.
1	How does it act?’ Which he was not prepared to elucidate.
1	'He says he's worn sham whiskers, and a canary waistcoat, the whole blessed time he's been loitering down there, and it's all of no use.'
1	‘You don’t mean to tell me,’ said Ralph, as his eyes brightened, ‘that her brother’s dead?
1	And it was done--why, how old are you?” “Thirty-five,” said the mender of roads, who looked sixty.
1	However, it’s worth an inquiry; and as I would rather make it in company than alone, and as you too were a fellow-traveller of that immovable woman’s, I thought perhaps--’ Clennam finished the sentence for him by taking up his hat again, and saying he was ready.
1	‘No one need trouble himself to stir,’ said the young gentleman, ‘I am going to remain in the house all night, and shall be found here in the morning if there is any assault to answer for.’ ‘What did you strike him for?’ asked one of the bystanders.
1	My aunt went on with a quiet enjoyment, in which there was very little affectation, if any; drinking the warm ale with a tea-spoon, and soaking her strips of toast in it.
1	'No,' replied Mr. Brownlow, 'I would rather you remained here.'
1	The Major, who had been blowing and panting all the way down, like another engine, and whose eye had often wandered from his newspaper to leer at the prospect, as if there were a procession of discomfited Miss Toxes pouring out in the smoke of the train, and flying away over the fields to hide themselves in any place of refuge, aroused his friends by informing him that the post-horses were harnessed and the carriage ready.
1	‘Is the _Independent_ still in being?’ ‘The _Independent_, sir,’ replied Pott, ‘is still dragging on a wretched and lingering career.
1	‘I don’t know how to thank you sir, I don’t indeed.’ ‘Why then,’ said Brass, suddenly turning upon him and thrusting his face close to Kit’s with such a repulsive smile that the latter, even in the very height of his gratitude, drew back, quite startled.
1	He guided himself by it, no doubt.” “No doubt,” said I.
1	“'How long,' I asked, 'has this lasted?'
1	And few people knew of it.
1	'Come here, you born devil!
1	It is not in my power to retrace, one by one, all the weary phases of distress of mind through which I passed.
1	‘Let us begone from this place, and never turn back or think of it again.
1	‘You remember the night of our first tea-drinking?’ said Nicholas.
1	You must know that I have done no good this long time.
1	When I came down again, I found Joe and Orlick sweeping up, without any other traces of discomposure than a slit in one of Orlick's nostrils, which was neither expressive nor ornamental.
1	As you have been found in company with this woman; as you were detected in possession of this document; as you were engaged with her in fraudulently destroying others, and can give no satisfactory account of yourself; I shall remand you for a week, in order that inquiries may be made, and evidence got.
1	I won’t be led on into a discussion.
1	My dear friend, can I ever repay you?’ ‘Don’t talk of it,’ replied Mr. Jingle.
1	A dog growled as he touched the handle of a room-door; and a man's voice demanded who was there.
1	I have never seen her yet.
1	‘Ah!’ said the dwarf, who with his hand stretched out above his eyes had been surveying the young man attentively, ‘that should be your grandson, neighbour!’ ‘Say rather that he should not be,’ replied the old man.
1	‘You’re too milk and watery with our friend, you are indeed,’ remonstrated Silas, with a disapproving shake of his wooden head.
1	‘You are going through, sir?’ said the coachman.
1	I was hungry, but before I had swallowed a morsel, he began a running sum that lasted all through the breakfast.
1	‘I hate him.’ ‘What do you hate him for, my dear?’ asked Squeers.
1	Sikes had him down, and his knee was on his throat, when Crackit pulled him back with a look of alarm, and pointed to the window.
1	The narrow streets and courts, at length, terminated in a large open space; scattered about which, were pens for beasts, and other indications of a cattle-market.
1	Mrs Chick and Miss Tox, who had brought them down on the previous night (which they all passed at an Hotel), had just driven away from the door, on their journey home again; and Mrs Pipchin, with her back to the fire, stood, reviewing the new-comers, like an old soldier.
1	‘In-deed!’ ‘He has just been speaking to me,’ said Walter, in breathless explanation.
1	One of these double knocks at Madame Mantalini’s door, announced the equipage of some great lady--or rather rich one, for there is occasionally a distinction between riches and greatness--who had come with her daughter to approve of some court-dresses which had been a long time preparing, and upon whom Kate was deputed to wait, accompanied by Miss Knag, and officered of course by Madame Mantalini.
1	Well, Tony, that as I was mentioning is what they're up to."
1	Eager and prominent among them, one man with a craving face, and his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips, whose appearance gave great satisfaction to the spectators.
1	At any rate, you know it now.
1	He faintly moaned, “I am done for,” as the victim, and he barbarously bellowed, “I'll serve you out,” as the murderer.
1	‘I am going out for a constitutional,’ resumed Miss Blimber; ‘and while I am gone, that is to say in the interval between this and breakfast, Dombey, I wish you to read over what I have marked in these books, and to tell me if you quite understand what you have got to learn.
1	This done very rapidly, she kissed his disfigured forehead, looked up in anguish to the stars, and blessed him and forgave him, ‘if she had anything to forgive.’ It was only in that instant that she thought of herself, and then she thought of herself only for him.
1	says Mr. Bucket, opening another door and glaring in with his bull's-eye.
1	‘But mark!’ she added, slowly and sternly, opening the other door to go away, ‘I am resolved, for reasons that I have and hatreds that I entertain, to cast you out, unless you withdraw from my reach altogether, or drop your pretty mask.
1	Thank God,’ said Miss Knag, stamping first her right foot and then her left with remarkable energy, ‘I have never in all that time, till now, been exposed to the arts, the vile arts, of a creature, who disgraces us with all her proceedings, and makes proper people blush for themselves.
1	Mr. Vholes, after glancing at the official cat who is patiently watching a mouse's hole, fixes his charmed gaze again on his young client and proceeds in his buttoned-up, half-audible voice as if there were an unclean spirit in him that will neither come out nor speak out, "What are you to do, sir, you inquire, during the vacation.
1	The helpless kind of candour with which he presented this before us, the light-hearted manner in which he was amused by his innocence, the fantastic way in which he took himself under his own protection and argued about that curious person, combined with the delightful ease of everything he said exactly to make out my guardian's case.
1	‘I know it must sound foolish, and yet it is so.’ ‘Where did you think you saw them?’ ‘I don’t know that I think I saw them anywhere.
1	‘Have you any little thing of that kind in hand, sir?’ inquired the favoured gentleman in blue, drawing a toothpick from his waistcoat pocket.
1	It is my bounden duty to you.
1	And now they had come to the time when they must beg their bread.
1	You are faint of heart to-night, my dear!” “Well, then,” said Defarge, as if a thought were wrung out of his breast, “it _is_ a long time.” “It is a long time,” repeated his wife; “and when is it not a long time?
1	"What is the matter with you?"
1	Mr Witherden, sir, a kind of faintness is upon my spirits--if you would do me the favour to ring the bell and order up a glass of something warm and spicy, I shall, notwithstanding what has passed, have a melancholy pleasure in drinking your good health.
1	In giving Mrs. Bagnet's hand, with her work in it, a friendly shake--for she took her seat beside him--the trooper's attention is attracted to her face.
1	And does it seem to me that I am about to deprive Harold Skimpole of his share in such possessions, which are his only birthright!'
1	Bardell,’ said Mr. Pickwick, at the expiration of a few minutes.
1	‘And so your preparations are nearly finished at last, my dear Dombey?’ said Cleopatra, when the dessert was put upon the table, and the silver-headed butler had withdrawn.
1	“Trouble?” echoed my sister; “trouble?” and then entered on a fearful catalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of, and all the acts of sleeplessness I had committed, and all the high places I had tumbled from, and all the low places I had tumbled into, and all the injuries I had done myself, and all the times she had wished me in my grave, and I had contumaciously refused to go there.
1	This seemed to have been her principal inducement, originally, for taking up her residence there.
1	If it's not in any way disagreeable to you, you'll oblige me by doing the same.
1	Opening this piece of paper in the next pause, the counsel looked with great attention and curiosity at the prisoner.
1	repeats Sir Leicester with awful politeness.
1	‘I believe that boy strews the ground differently every day, on purpose to bruise and maim one; unless his master does it with his own hands, which is more than likely.
1	I shall not be missed!’ Mrs Chick rose erect with these words, and took the arm of Mr Chick, who escorted her from the room, after half an hour’s shady sojourn there.
1	At last, Mr. Skimpole having departed, we three were one afternoon going out for a ride; and I, being dressed before Ada and going down, came upon my guardian, with his back towards me, standing at the drawing-room window looking out.
1	"They'll do as they are?
1	But as you wisely pointed out to me, I can’t do that, for it would look like guilt.
1	Mr. Bounderby still walking up and down when Mrs. Pegler had done, Mr. Gradgrind addressed that maligned old lady: ‘I am surprised, madam,’ he observed with severity, ‘that in your old age you have the face to claim Mr. Bounderby for your son, after your unnatural and inhuman treatment of him.’ ‘_Me_ unnatural!’ cried poor old Mrs. Pegler.
1	‘If it really was a party!’ she thought once, as she sat there.
1	Since you are bent upon it, _very_ well!’ So, Mr. Gradgrind and his daughter took Cecilia Jupe off with them to Stone Lodge, and on the way Louisa never spoke one word, good or bad.
1	Then says he, lifting up his eyebrows in the gayest way, 'It's no use mentioning a fypunnote to me, my friend, because I'm a mere child in such matters and have no idea of money.'
1	Whether his spirits were elevated by the communication I had made to him, or by his having indulged in this retrospect, I don’t know; but they were raised by some influence.
1	Tells Podsnap that their political opinions are identical.
1	“And now you!” said Mr. Jaggers, suddenly stopping, and turning on the two women with the shawls, from whom the three men had meekly separated,--“Oh!
1	There is the Contractor, who is Providence to five hundred thousand men.
1	In the main street of Ipswich, on the left-hand side of the way, a short distance after you have passed through the open space fronting the Town Hall, stands an inn known far and wide by the appellation of the Great White Horse, rendered the more conspicuous by a stone statue of some rampacious animal with flowing mane and tail, distantly resembling an insane cart-horse, which is elevated above the principal door.
1	There being not the least constraint in his manner, there was none (or I think there was none) in mine.
1	‘We shall go by the stage-coach.
1	Upon this, the young gentleman with the pipes came round him, and shook both his hands very hard--especially the one in which he held his little bundle.
1	‘Not what enough?’ said Peg.
1	‘They’re usually kept in carawans to wait upon the dwarfs,’ said Mr Vuffin.
1	When he came to the low church wall, he got over it, like a man whose legs were numbed and stiff, and then turned round to look for me.
1	As he evidently has a rooted feeling on this point, and as the depth of it is recognized in Mrs. Bagnet's face, his mother yields her implicit assent to what he asks.
1	'The will,' said Mr. Brownlow, speaking for him, 'was in the same spirit as the letter.
1	You’d better not keep on pulling his ears, please.
1	Miss Mills was copying music (I recollect, it was a new song, called ‘Affection’s Dirge’), and Dora was painting flowers.
1	Now, let us see whether there’s anything else the matter, and how our ribs are?’ There was nothing else the matter, and our ribs were sound.
1	‘Girl number twenty,’ said the gentleman, smiling in the calm strength of knowledge.
1	The poor people were so neat and clean, and knelt so reverently in prayer, that it seemed a pleasure, not a tedious duty, their assembling there together; and though the singing might be rude, it was real, and sounded more musical (to Oliver's ears at least) than any he had ever heard in church before.
1	‘Why shouldn’t he?’ A murmur of assent ran through the company.
1	After a minute’s pause, during which he had been looking down upon the gentle patient little face moving on at his side, he said, ‘The strangest man, Mr Carker the Junior is, Miss Florence, that ever you heard of.
1	Any police down there?’ ‘Here, Miss Abbey,’ was official rejoinder.
1	Has a scar on the back of his     neck, nearly half round, done by a knife.’     ‘Was committed to jail, a negro man.
1	‘My darling Florence, you must really come and kiss me once more, if you please, my dear!’ Singular coincidence, that these gushes of interest in Florence hurried Cleopatra away from almost every dialogue in which Edith had a share, however trifling!
1	Of these, the Jew was, at all events, sufficiently remarkable to be remembered, supposing he had been seen drinking, or loitering about; but Giles returned without any intelligence, calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery.
1	Their sloping ceilings, cumbrous rusty locks and grates, and heavy wooden bins and beams, slowly mouldering withal, had a prisonous look, and he had the haggard face of a prisoner.
1	‘Walter,’ said Florence, gently, ‘I am not quite well, and I have been weeping.
1	'Indeed you may believe me.
1	Catching up from the table a piece of bread, and taking his Bargeman’s bundle under his arm, Riderhood immediately followed him.
1	But coming to the door, I found him waiting there; and he said was I coming back again, and I said yes; and he said did I know you, and I said, yes, I had the pleasure of your acquaintance--you had given me the pleasure of your acquaintance, after some persuasion; and he said, if that was the case, would I say to you what I have said, about existing circumstances and coming prepared, and as soon as ever I saw you, would I ask you to step round the corner, if it was only for one minute, on most important business, to Mr Brogley’s the Broker’s.
1	"I am much obliged to you.
1	No relief or security from him for a moment.
1	Are we pretty fresh and cheerful sir--eh, Mr Richard?’ ‘Pretty well, sir,’ replied Dick.
1	‘Oh, ask your friend to come here, Sir,’ said Mrs. Bardell.
1	‘I am deeply sensible of it.’ ‘In this position of affairs,’ said Miss Lavinia, again referring to her notes, ‘and admitting his visits on this understanding only, we must require from Mr. Copperfield a distinct assurance, on his word of honour, that no communication of any kind shall take place between him and our niece without our knowledge.
1	The rattle of the harness was the chink of money, and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson's, with all its foreign and home connection, ever paid in thrice the time.
1	He is not ‘brought down,’ these observers think, by sorrow and distress of mind.
1	‘Dear me!’ said Nicholas; ‘what an extraordinary hand!’ It was directed to himself, was written upon very dirty paper, and in such cramped and crippled writing as to be almost illegible.
1	‘There is no teaching here, I suppose?’ ‘There has been,’ said Mrs. Crummles.
1	‘And to think of Doyce and Clennam, and who Doyce can be,’ said Flora; ‘delightful man no doubt and married perhaps or perhaps a daughter, now has he really?
1	Little Dorrit is coming, and will find me in the dark.’ Mr Flintwinch lighted the candle briskly, and said as he put it down upon the table: ‘What are you going to do with Little Dorrit?
1	Moreover, he had the appearance of a perfect ability to go on all night; or, if occasion were, all next day and all next night; whereas Mr Blandois soon grew indistinctly conscious of swaggering too fiercely and boastfully.
1	The rain fell heavily, drearily.
1	That Mrs Dombey had always sat at the head of his table, and done the honours of his house in a remarkably lady-like and becoming manner.
1	You know I have been drinking.” “Since I must say so, I know it.” “Then you shall likewise know why.
1	When I told him No, he said she must have gone down then, and yet she “took up too,” when she left there.
1	‘The ride will do his master good, at all events,’ observed my aunt, glancing at the papers on my table.
1	They most willingly and cheerfully do their duty to all of us who are employed here, and we try to do ours to them.
1	Always the identical same.’ ‘It doesn’t taste so.
1	As my mother stooped down on the threshold to take me in her arms and kiss me, the gentleman said I was a more highly privileged little fellow than a monarch--or something like that; for my later understanding comes, I am sensible, to my aid here.
1	Rouncewell's is so great apparently," mutters the trooper, stroking his chin, "that I have as good as half a mind to go back again.
1	I stopped at the last full stop to read all this over.
1	Mr. Pickwick looked very hard at the man’s face, but his features were immovable, so he noted down the fact forthwith.
1	As he threw his head back in the chair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the room, and communicated for some purpose now forgotten with a chamber in the highest story of the building.
1	Mr. Vholes said, "Very much so."
1	In the momentary firmness of the hand that was never still--a firmness inspired by the utterance of these last words, and dying away with them--I saw the confirmation of her earnest tones.
1	Wretchedness and ruin came on me, I say.
1	‘It will amuse me.’ ‘Oh!
1	On Madame Mantalini calling aloud for Miss Knag, a short, bustling, over-dressed female, full of importance, presented herself, and all the young ladies suspending their operations for the moment, whispered to each other sundry criticisms upon the make and texture of Miss Nickleby’s dress, her complexion, cast of features, and personal appearance, with as much good breeding as could have been displayed by the very best society in a crowded ball-room.
1	I thought she had had some fear that her unhappy father might be in some way to blame for what had happened.
1	'I should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and Mr. Maylie went away, sir,' rejoined Oliver.
1	‘We’re sure to catch them, I think,’ said he.
1	'No other, take my word for it.'
1	Captain Gills, I beg to request the favour of a private interview.’ ‘Why, Brother,’ returned the Captain, taking him by the hand, ‘you are the man as we was on the look-out for.’ ‘Oh, Captain Gills,’ said Mr Toots, ‘what a look-out that must be, of which I am the object!
1	It's only me as is written to.
1	‘This is strange news,’ said Mr. Grewgious.
1	But such an old card as this, so deep, so sly, and secret (though I don't believe he is ever sober), I never came across.
1	He was the dead image of the sun in old woodcuts, his hair and whiskers answering for rays all around him.
1	Mr. Guppy's mother was so diverted that she rolled her head as she smiled and made a silent appeal to Caddy with her elbow.
1	‘I’m a heavy sleeper,’ said Mr. Dowler, as he flung himself on the bed.
1	I shall bring a few little books, if you’ll allow me, and some work, and of an evening now and then, they’ll learn--dear me, they’ll learn a great deal, I trust, and be a credit to their teacher.’ Mr Toodle, who had a great respect for learning, jerked his head approvingly at his wife, and moistened his hands with dawning satisfaction.
1	They are waiting till I shall want the gentleman to show himself somewhere, for half a moment.’ ‘While they’re waiting,’ said Miss Abbey, ‘couldn’t you join us?’ Mr Inspector immediately slipped into the bar, and sat down at the side of the half-door, with his back towards the passage, and directly facing the two guests.
1	Jo crosses and comes halting and shuffling up, slowly scooping the knuckles of his right hand round and round in the hollowed palm of his left, kneading dirt with a natural pestle and mortar.
1	I beg--nay, command!--that you will not pounce.
1	The work went on, until the noon-bell rang.
1	‘It’s some boarding-school in this town, I suppose, ain’t it?’ Now, although this question was put in the most careless tone imaginable, Mr. Job Trotter plainly showed by gestures that he perceived his new friend’s anxiety to draw forth an answer to it.
1	But I never will desert Mr. Micawber.
1	Is it there?’ ‘Here it is!’ said I.
1	The boat floated into the wharf to which it belonged.
1	Shall I say anything for you?’ ‘Say, Walter,’ replied Mr Toots indistinctly, ‘that I shall think of her every day, but never without feeling happy to know that she is married to the man she loves, and who loves her.
1	It’s down my throat again and can’t come up.
1	‘Off at once,’ replied Sam.
1	I'm a soldier's wife and accustomed to travel my own way.
1	Yes, let us go now.
1	There was no harm in his trade.
1	And, considering that the hour-glass they turned from year to year was filled with the earthiest and coarsest sand, the Bleeding Heart Yarders had reason enough for objecting to be despoiled of the one little golden grain of poetry that sparkled in it.
1	‘I can never be grateful enough to you, Sam, I am sure,’ said Arabella, with the sweetest smile imaginable.
1	But as the Captain appeared to be of quite another opinion, and was bent upon it, and as his friendship was too zealous and serious to be trifled with by one so much younger than himself, he forbore to hint the least objection.
1	However, Mr. Vincent Crummles kept him up pretty well, by jerking the rein, and plying the whip; and when these means failed, and the animal came to a stand, the elder Master Crummles got out and kicked him.
1	"Why, they killed him," says Mr. Bucket, "on account of his having so much cheek.
1	Sit down, my beloved.’ She would have gone once more—was all but gone—and once more his face, darkly threatening what would follow if she went, has stopped her.
1	Do you know what you're doing?'
1	‘Now, I’m a going upstairs to tell your aunt as Mas’r Davy’s here, and that’ll cheer her up a bit,’ he said.
1	‘Did he say whether he had any business to speak about?’ inquired Sir Mulberry, after a little impatient consideration.
1	Left alone, Mr Fledgeby locked his outer door, and came back to his fire.
1	‘So am I, Kenwigs,’ rejoined Mr. Lillyvick.
1	I have been in prison for threatening the solicitor.
1	‘Why the fact is,’ replied Mr Toots, ‘that it’s the young woman I come from.
1	Still, when you say there is no change for the better, I must, as a bare matter of fact, deny that."
1	The waiter retired; the breakfast concluded; and the travellers ascended to their respective bedrooms, to prepare a change of clothing, to take with them on their approaching expedition.
1	I think we had better leave him behind?’ My aunt seemed disposed to contest the point; but to facilitate matters I said I would gladly remain behind, if they pleased; and returned into Mr. Wickfield’s office, where I sat down again, in the chair I had first occupied, to await their return.
1	oh dear, oh dear, what an edged tool you are!’ ‘Don’t play with me then,’ said Ralph impatiently.
1	You must leave your father and me alone for two minutes, and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not delay.” “I will be submissive to you.
1	'Oh, I dare say about that, yer know,' observed Noah, backing towards the door, and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm.
1	I want to speak to Agnes, quite alone.’ I promise that she shall, immediately; but I cannot leave her, for my grief.
1	The furniture, at once spare and lumbering, hid in the rooms rather than furnished them, and there was no colour in all the house; such colour as had ever been there, had long ago started away on lost sunbeams--got itself absorbed, perhaps, into flowers, butterflies, plumage of birds, precious stones, what not.
1	The leading curiosity is, to know which is he; he stands at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down, to converse with a mere girl who sits on the side of the cart, and holds his hand.
1	The looms, and wheels, and Hands all out of gear for an hour.
1	The Chancellor is about to bow to the bar when the prisoner is presented.
1	Beguiling the time with these pleasant reflections, Mr. Fagin wended his way, through mud and mire, to his gloomy abode:  where the Dodger was sitting up, impatiently awaiting his return.
1	‘Don’t ye be timorous for me, my dear,’ said the stanch old heart, observant of Bella’s face: ‘when I take my seat with my work, clean and busy and fresh, in a country market-place, I shall turn a sixpence as sure as ever a farmer’s wife there.’ The Secretary took that opportunity of touching on the practical question of Mr Sloppy’s capabilities.
1	Why, I recollect old Tim Linkinwater quite a little boy, don’t you?
1	Mr. Jackson departed upstairs on his errand, and immediately returned with a message that Mr. Fogg would see Mr. Pickwick in five minutes; and having delivered it, returned again to his desk.
1	I resolved that they should not know.
1	Cut me off a piece of that pie, one of you boys, to take the taste of that out of my mouth, or it'll choke me dead.'
1	Come and see us.’ ‘Oh, it’s of no consequence, thank you!’ Mr Toots would blushingly rejoin.
1	The astonished listener remained motionless on his post for some minutes afterwards, and having ascertained, with many cautious glances round him, that he was again alone, crept slowly from his hiding-place, and returned, stealthily and in the shade of the wall, in the same manner as he had descended.
1	‘I wish it was Money, sir,’ said Mr. Barkis.
1	‘I would rather he thought well of me,’ said Bella, ‘though he swept the street for bread, than that you did, though you splashed the mud upon him from the wheels of a chariot of pure gold.--There!’ ‘Well I’m sure!’ cried Mr Boffin, staring.
1	It’s very cheap.’ The old man, notwithstanding his fatigue, would have remained in the churchyard all night if his new acquaintances had remained there too.
1	What matter, my dear?’ ‘Mr.
1	For many hours, they had little hope of his surviving; but grief is strong, and he recovered.
1	"Esther certainly does think so."
1	I must speak to you for myself, since there is no one about me whom I could ask to do so.
1	The drone said unaffectedly, "You will excuse me; I really cannot attend to the shop!
1	It is the next difficult thing to an impossibility to imagine Chesney Wold without Mrs. Rouncewell, but she has only been here fifty years.
1	He had no opportunity of defending himself, however, for Mrs. Raddle gave unequivocal signs of fainting; which, being perceived from the parlour window, Mrs. Bardell, Mrs. Sanders, the lodger, and the lodger’s servant, darted precipitately out, and conveyed her into the house, all talking at the same time, and giving utterance to various expressions of pity and condolence, as if she were one of the most suffering mortals on earth.
1	It seemed that he wanted to know whether all these were brothers and sisters of his?
1	Whether this young gentleman (for he was but three-and-twenty) combined with the miserly vice of an old man, any of the open-handed vices of a young one, was a moot point; so very honourably did he keep his own counsel.
1	I asked after a good deal of hesitation.
1	‘They are both alive.’ ‘Both!’ repeated Newman Noggs, in a low voice.
1	I am willing to take charge of you, Jupe, and to educate you, and provide for you.
1	Sir Leicester, evidently with a great determination to say, in his own manner, something that is on his mind before relapsing into silence, tries to raise himself among his pillows a little more.
1	‘Why, in plain English, to frighten the rooks.’ ‘Oh, is that all?’ ‘You are satisfied?’ ‘Quite.’ ‘Very well.
1	I view it, steadily, as an investment.
1	As thus: ‘Mrs Bangham,’ said the doctor, before he had been there twenty minutes, ‘go outside and fetch a little brandy, or we shall have you giving in.’ ‘Thank you, sir.
1	He had not been there with me; all the noses were straight in my day.
1	But I always say that and have never doubted it.
1	Is it your pleasure, sir, that we decline and we fall?’ with a feint of taking up the book.
1	Had he that deep-seated recondite complaint, and did any doctor find it out?
1	‘When are you relieved?’ asked Bradley.
1	Not, however, towards the ‘shops’ where cunning artificers work in pearls and diamonds and gold and silver, making their hands so rich, that the enriched water in which they wash them is bought for the refiners;--not towards these does Mr Wegg stump, but towards the poorer shops of small retail traders in commodities to eat and drink and keep folks warm, and of Italian frame-makers, and of barbers, and of brokers, and of dealers in dogs and singing-birds.
1	You treated me falsely, ungratefully, and cruelly.
1	In the contemplative mood which these words had awakened, Mr. Samuel Weller walked forth from the Great White Horse when his father had left him; and bending his steps towards St. Clement’s Church, endeavoured to dissipate his melancholy, by strolling among its ancient precincts.
1	Men who had lounged about all night in smock-frocks and leather leggings, came out in silken vests and hats and plumes, as jugglers or mountebanks; or in gorgeous liveries as soft-spoken servants at gambling booths; or in sturdy yeoman dress as decoys at unlawful games.
1	Not much in the habit of travelling by rail myself, Sir, but gentlemen frequently say so.’ ‘Do many gentlemen come here?
1	The Flower may have faded, more or less, Ma’am,’ observed the Major, dropping into a much nearer chair than had been indicated by his cruel Divinity, ‘but it is a tough plant yet, and constant as the evergreen.’ Here the Major, under cover of the dark room, shut up one eye, rolled his head like a Harlequin, and, in his great self-satisfaction, perhaps went nearer to the confines of apoplexy than he had ever gone before.
1	Get up and bustle about, and don't come over me with your woman's nonsense.'
1	As it was, he laid a finger on his lips, and looked towards her brother.
1	I have an association with the name--and with the face.” “I told you you had a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad,” observed Carton, coolly.
1	He was not quite so young as he had been, and his figure was rather running to seed; but there was an air of exaggerated gentility about him, which bespoke the hero of swaggering comedy.
1	‘Good-night, Miss!’ returned Wickam softly.
1	He ascends the door-steps and is gliding into the dusky hall when he encounters, on the top step, a bowing and propitiatory little man.
1	(She really was there, I have since found, both before the deed and after it.)
1	‘Not a bit,’ replied the sage Miss Wren, with an air of vast experience.
1	This is a swimmer, sir, this fellow--a diver, Lord save us!
1	‘Perhaps Walter’s Uncle has gone there, Susan,’ observed Florence, turning to her.
1	His own earnest wish, coupled with the assurance he had received from Quilp, filled him with the belief that she would yet arrive to claim the humble shelter he had offered, and from the death of each day’s hope another hope sprung up to live to-morrow.
1	A giant among pigmies, a giant, a giant!’ Ralph looked at the old dog with a quiet smile as he chuckled on in this strain, and Newman Noggs in the closet felt his heart sink within him as the prospect of dinner grew fainter and fainter.
1	‘Would you remember a message to your sister, Mr. Tom, if I was to charge you with one?’ ‘Well?
1	The air become more sharp and piercing, as its first dull hue--the death of night, rather than the birth of day--glimmered faintly in the sky.
1	Perhaps there is a rather increased sense of power upon him as he loosely grasps one of his veinous wrists with his other hand and holding it behind his back walks noiselessly up and down.
1	It was beginning to rain fast.
1	We have lost our pleasant interpreter (she spoke three foreign languages beautifully, Arthur; you have heard her many a time), and you must pull me through it, Mother, as well as you can.
1	But the Doctor himself was the idol of the whole school: and it must have been a badly composed school if he had been anything else, for he was the kindest of men; with a simple faith in him that might have touched the stone hearts of the very urns upon the wall.
1	There never was, there never had been, there never again should be, such a man as Mr Merdle.
1	Is there anything else he’d like?
1	What’s Miss Florence to her, compared to me?’ The apposite display of the diamonds, or the peach-velvet bonnet (she sat in the bonnet to receive visitors, weeks before she could stir out of doors), or the dressing of her up in some gaud or other, usually stopped the tears that began to flow hereabouts; and she would remain in a complacent state until Edith came to see her; when, at a glance of the proud face, she would relapse again.
1	You know,’ said Mr Toots, ‘it’s as exactly as Burgess and Co. wished to oblige a customer with a most extraordinary pair of trousers, and could not cut out what they had in their minds.’ With this apposite illustration, of which he seemed a little Proud, Mr Toots gave Captain Cuttle his blessing and departed.
1	They can examine for themselves whether there has been anything in the public career of that country during these past eight years, or whether there is anything in its present position, at home or abroad, which suggests that those influences and tendencies really do exist.
1	Oh, do kiss Jip, and be agreeable!’ It was impossible to resist kissing Jip, when she held him up to me for that purpose, putting her own bright, rosy little mouth into kissing form, as she directed the operation, which she insisted should be performed symmetrically, on the centre of his nose.
1	But now he can only whisper, and what he whispers sounds like what it is--mere jumble and jargon.
1	The crier was sent round, in the morning, to proclaim the entertainments with the sound of bell in all the thoroughfares; and extra bills of three feet long by nine inches wide, were dispersed in all directions, flung down all the areas, thrust under all the knockers, and developed in all the shops.
1	In wi’ ‘un.’ ‘Are you at home, sir?’ ‘At whoam!’ cried John, ‘I wish I wur; I’d ha tea’d two hour ago.
1	"I am sure THAT'S very natural!"
1	This was horrible, and gave me a sickening idea of London; the more so as the Lord Chief Justice's proprietor wore (from his hat down to his boots and up again to his pocket-handkerchief inclusive) mildewed clothes which had evidently not belonged to him originally, and which I took it into my head he had bought cheap of the executioner.
1	A difference of opinion had arisen between herself and Mrs. Crupp, on an abstract question (the propriety of chambers being inhabited by the gentler sex); and my aunt, utterly indifferent to spasms on the part of Mrs. Crupp, had cut the dispute short, by informing that lady that she smelt of my brandy, and that she would trouble her to walk out.
1	‘And such a mother,’ observed Mr Dombey, bowing with some confused idea of being complimentary to Cornelia.
1	‘And your respected father,’ said Mr Casby, ‘is no more!
1	The old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles.
1	‘Always hope; that’s a dear boy.
1	This is all true; is it not?’ ‘Yes,’ replied Squeers, ‘that’s all true.’ ‘Well, then,’ said Ralph, ‘what risk do you run?
1	He wath throw’d a heavy back-fall off a Elephant in a thort of a Pagoda thing ath the Thultan of the Indieth, and he never got the better of it; and thee married a thecond time—married a Cheethemonger ath fell in love with her from the front—and he’th a Overtheer and makin’ a fortun.’ These various changes, Mr. Sleary, very short of breath now, related with great heartiness, and with a wonderful kind of innocence, considering what a bleary and brandy-and-watery old veteran he was.
1	"It may be, partly, because I know nothing of the value of money," said Mr. Skimpole, "but I often feel this.
1	‘They taks such as offers.
1	No more wishing one’s self dead now.
1	'This is not the place I went to sleep in.'
1	As I might have expected, he had none at all.
1	‘What kind of compromise would you recommend?’ inquired Mr. Pickwick.
1	His movements might have been planned to gain for him, in getting beyond their reach, twelve hours’ advantage?
1	“And so have you, sir.
1	The air, even in these distempered parts, is fresh after the stifling atmosphere of the houses; and now, as we emerge into a broader street, it blows upon us with a purer breath, and the stars look bright again.
1	I spent some ev’nin’s at your club last winter--picked up my friend Mr. Tupman here this morning, and very glad I was to see him.
1	Most of our Departments are susceptible of considerable improvement in this respect, but the Custom-house above all others would do well to take example from the United States and render itself somewhat less odious and offensive to foreigners.
1	‘Yes, my good friend,’ said my aunt.
1	"My heart aches for him; that it does!"
1	I shan't disgrace it when the time comes.'
1	"Now, Jo," says Allan, keeping his eye upon him, "come with me and I will find you a better place than this to lie down and hide in.
1	But get up, get up!"
1	We agree to keep our own secret, and to work together in furtherance of our own schemes.’ ‘What schemes?’ ‘Any scheme that will bring us money.
1	‘That’s capital!’ said Mrs Boffin, giving it a kiss.
1	Mr. Snagsby standing at his shop-door looking up at the clouds sees a crow who is out late skim westward over the slice of sky belonging to Cook's Court.
1	After some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing with his hand, Jerry attracted the notice of Mr. Lorry, who had stood up to look for him, and who quietly nodded and sat down again.
1	Miss Squeers had been spending a few days with a neighbouring friend, and had only just returned to the parental roof.
1	At one time we were all flung together in a heap at the bottom of the coach, and at another we were crushing our heads against the roof.
1	‘If it was not, ma’am, you don’t suppose that I should offer it to a lady who has moved in the society you have moved in.
1	I know that this is a long voyage.
1	Mrs Merdle had written to this magnificent spouse of hers, whom it was heresy to regard as anything less than all the British Merchants since the days of Whittington rolled into one, and gilded three feet deep all over--had written to this spouse of hers, several letters from Rome, in quick succession, urging upon him with importunity that now or never was the time to provide for Edmund Sparkler.
1	Three, four, five, guineas, you would consider handsome, I dare say."
1	The hour had measured like most other hours.
1	He didn't say so before Prince, he only said so to me.
1	Look here,’ said Mr Boffin, ‘it ain’t that I want to occupy your whole time; you can take up a book for a minute or two when you’ve nothing better to do, though I think you’ll a’most always find something useful to do.
1	Appearances indicated that this establishment was a very recent institution.
1	That’s just the wery sort o’ thing he’d do.
1	‘This is pleasant,’ said Bob Sawyer, turning up his coat collar, and pulling the shawl over his mouth to concentrate the fumes of a glass of brandy just swallowed.
1	‘Servant, sir,’ said Mr. Omer.
1	Now although this was such a fancy of the affectionate girl's that I am almost ashamed to mention it, still it might have all the force of a fact when she was really ill.
1	The old man always plodding on before, turned round, in his slow, stiff, stooping manner, when they came to the turnkey on duty, as if to present his companion.
1	It broke up the establishment.
1	‘Why--no, I haven’t exactly dined,’ said Mr Merdle.
1	He pressed a penny into his hand, and gave vent to his feelings (as did his exemplary wife also), in a shout of approving laughter.
1	She is a tall, dark, black-eyed, fine figure of a woman.
1	But the commentary upon it now indelibly written in his handsome face made it far more distressing than it used to be.
1	"Oh, it's not the trouble," returned Miss Jellyby; "the question is, if there IS any."
1	‘Get into a little training, and we will have a few score miles together.
1	I heard that Mr. Creakle had turned him out of doors, in consequence; and that Mrs. and Miss Creakle had been in a sad way, ever since.
1	The old woman shook her head.
1	‘No, no, no!’ shrieked the other, stamping on the ground with the energy of a madman.
1	That he laid his other hand upon the Doctor’s arm, causing him to look up with an abstracted air.
1	Three or four hours were not a long time after years.
1	Those that want to be safe, must hoist flags.
1	‘I will not,’ said Mrs. Micawber, finishing her punch, and gathering her scarf about her shoulders, preparatory to her withdrawal to my bedroom: ‘I will not protract these remarks on the subject of Mr. Micawber’s pecuniary affairs.
1	He is not a living skeleton, I suppose.’ ‘Very far from it,’ said Mrs Chick, with unspeakable expression.
1	Miss Tox, all unconscious of any such rare appearances in connexion with Mr Dombey’s house, as scaffoldings and ladders, and men with their heads tied up in pocket-handkerchiefs, glaring in at the windows like flying genii or strange birds,--having breakfasted one morning at about this eventful period of time, on her customary viands; to wit, one French roll rasped, one egg new laid (or warranted to be), and one little pot of tea, wherein was infused one little silver scoopful of that herb on behalf of Miss Tox, and one little silver scoopful on behalf of the teapot--a flight of fancy in which good housekeepers delight; went upstairs to set forth the bird waltz on the harpsichord, to water and arrange the plants, to dust the nick-nacks, and, according to her daily custom, to make her little drawing-room the garland of Princess’s Place.
1	Suffice it that as the wine went round he heard enough to acquaint him with the characters and designs of those whose conversation he overhead; to possess him with the full extent of Ralph’s villainy, and the real reason of his own presence being required in London.
1	Fairly.’ ‘What a dreadfully conscientious fellow you are, Jack!
1	Some of my readers may have an interest in being informed whether or no any portions of the Marshalsea Prison are yet standing.
1	But now, my sight strengthening and the glorious light coming every day more fully and brightly on me, I could read the letters that my dear wrote to me every morning and evening and could put them to my lips and lay my cheek upon them with no fear of hurting her.
1	‘Take down the bill,’ were his parting words, as he looked out from between the curtains; ‘and let nobody call me till I ring the bell.’ With that the curtains closed, and he seemed to snore immediately.
1	To avoid being too abrupt, I then spoke of the Aged and of Miss Skiffins.
1	‘Delightful prospect, Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	There is something else upon its flight besides the wind and clouds.
1	It broke from one line in the table of commandments at the altar, and illuminated the building with the words.
1	I saw in this the reason for my being staved off so long and the reason for my late guardian's declining to commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme.
1	replied Sikes: appearing at the head of the stairs, with a candle.
1	Old William Tell, Old Shaw, the Life Guardsman!
1	'I have got a friend that I think can gratify your darling wish, and put you in the right way, where you can take whatever department of the business you think will suit you best at first, and be taught all the others.'
1	Thus:— The time is one o’clock at noon.
1	How do you do, sir?’ ‘My clerk will attend to any business you may have come upon, Mr Brass,’ said the notary, turning away.
1	‘Six foot inside that wall is Mrs. Sapsea.’ ‘Not really Mrs. Sapsea?’ ‘Say Mrs. Sapsea.
1	If Young Pip has a half-holiday, do as much for Old Orlick.” I suppose he was about five-and-twenty, but he usually spoke of himself as an ancient person.
1	I know no gentleman in this strange place; and ten to one if I did, whether he would believe my story.’ ‘Come this way,’ said Sam, suddenly jumping up, and grasping the mulberry man by the arm.
1	You’ll be delighted with him.
1	I knew from the first, that, if I could not do my work as well as any of the rest, I could not hold myself above slight and contempt.
1	“On the contrary; I come direct.” “Pardon me!
1	Apart from which,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘I will not disguise from you, my dear Master Copperfield, that when that branch of my family which is settled in Plymouth, became aware that Mr. Micawber was accompanied by myself, and by little Wilkins and his sister, and by the twins, they did not receive him with that ardour which he might have expected, being so newly released from captivity.
1	"No, no," said Scrooge, "I am in earnest.
1	We would all be gentlefolks together, then.
1	Then he went out again; and then she put her thimble and scissors in her pocket, and stuck a needle threaded with black thread neatly in the bosom of her gown, and put on her outer clothing smartly, at a little glass behind the door, in which I saw the reflection of her pleased face.
1	He was overjoyed to see us and dismounted with great alacrity.
1	The upper part of the house belonged to her, and as she had no necessity for the second-floor rooms just then, she was in the habit of letting them.
1	She was most noticeable, I thought, in respect of her extremities; for, her hair always wanted brushing, her hands always wanted washing, and her shoes always wanted mending and pulling up at heel.
1	I understand that we speak together in confidence.
1	"My dear Jarndyce," returned Mr. Skimpole, "you'll pardon the simplicity of the question, coming as it does from a creature who is perfectly simple in worldly matters, but why ISN'T he a prisoner then?"
1	why didn’t you say at first that you was willing to come down handsome?’ The matter was soon arranged, as the turnkey had foretold.
1	Mr. Guppy affects to smile, and with the view of changing the conversation, looks with an admiration, real or pretended, round the room at the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty, terminating his survey with the portrait of Lady Dedlock over the mantelshelf, in which she is represented on a terrace, with a pedestal upon the terrace, and a vase upon the pedestal, and her shawl upon the vase, and a prodigious piece of fur upon the shawl, and her arm on the prodigious piece of fur, and a bracelet on her arm.
1	He joined it once again, and wondering why and whither he had gone, accompanied it until they reached an iron gate.
1	‘Well, I think I should.
1	‘Cinderella, dear child,’ the old man expostulated, ‘will you never rest?’ ‘Oh!
1	"He has a stake in the country," says Sir Leicester, "I have no doubt.
1	‘What I have made up my mind about has nothing to do with you.
1	Shaking himself as he got up like the surly brute he was, he gave his growl a responsive twist at the end, and turned his face down-stream to see who hailed.
1	‘Have some tea.’ ‘Oh dear me, dear me, do you think it will do me any good?’ cried my mother in a helpless manner.
1	"But it's all like you.
1	So Charley laid it on the table and went to bed, and I sat looking at it without taking it up, thinking of many things.
1	Whatever word you like best.
1	He intended every child in it to be a model—just as the young Gradgrinds were all models.
1	Whether in a late repentance, whether in the first association that comes back upon him, he puts his hands together as a child does when it says its prayers, and raising them towards her breast, bows down his head, and cries.
1	Mr Toots was sure to hail this with a burst of chuckles, like the opening of a bottle of some effervescent beverage.
1	Cook says shrewdly, ‘Oh a long time, bless you!
1	He stood pondering, and she sat looking at the dusty fire without moving, for some time.
1	‘Yes, but not the old pain.
1	Disappointed and uneasy, Nicholas could touch no food, so, after he had seen Smike comfortably established at the table, he walked out (despite a great many dissuasions uttered by Mr. Crowl with his mouth full), and left Smike to detain Newman in case he returned first.
1	‘Try a little more something green, sir,’ said Young John; and again handed the basket.
1	"Miss Summerson," he said, more moved than he had been from the first, "before heaven, I will be a true friend to him!
1	Allan considers a little, then remarks, turning to the woman but keeping an encouraging eye on Jo, "He is not so ungrateful as you supposed.
1	“Write exactly as I speak.” “To whom do I address it?” “To no one.” Carton still had his hand in his breast.
1	Much as he admired the graces of her face and form, and freshly as they dwelt within his sensual remembrance, he had never thought her half so beautiful.
1	‘Devil of a mess on the staircase, waiter,’ said the stranger.
1	Penitence, humiliation, shame, pride, love, and trustfulness--I see them all; and in them all, I see that horror of I don’t know what.
1	Better for common sense, better for him, better for me.
1	He never leaves off making queer faces, and is the delight of all the rest, who grin from ear to ear incessantly.
1	It is a name, Sir, that a man is proud to recognise.
1	‘Clara!’ said Miss Murdstone, in her warning note.
1	There are sixty beds in a ward; and the bolt’s on, sixteen hours out of the four-and-twenty.’ ‘I would rather go to some other place of confinement if I can,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	‘We have found a new one in that word, scout.
1	Mr. George undoubtedly thinks it best to escort her on his arm to the door of her cousinly chamber, and the maid as undoubtedly thinks it best to hustle her into bed with mighty little ceremony.
1	I’ll make Jip bite you!’ Her childish way was the most delicious way in the world to me, but it was necessary to be explicit, and I solemnly repeated: ‘Dora, my own life, I am your ruined David!’ ‘I declare I’ll make Jip bite you!’ said Dora, shaking her curls, ‘if you are so ridiculous.’ But I looked so serious, that Dora left off shaking her curls, and laid her trembling little hand upon my shoulder, and first looked scared and anxious, then began to cry.
1	You have no idea what a state I have got myself into—what a state my sister might have got me out of, if she would only have done it.’ He took to biting the rosebuds now, and tearing them away from his teeth with a hand that trembled like an infirm old man’s.
1	‘Isn’t it shocking?’ ‘It would be quite so, if you fully knew what you said, my dear, or meant it.’ ‘Well, Pa, I can only tell you that I mean nothing else.
1	She ran along the sea beach, believing the old boat was theer; and calling out to us to turn away our faces, for she was a-coming by.
1	“You are still on friendly terms with Mr. Jaggers?” “Quite.
1	Worldly wise in hard and poor necessities, she was innocent in all things else.
1	'If he means to blab us among his new friends, we may stop his mouth yet.'
1	He didn’t find them, and she died not long after.
1	"How did you find out that?"
1	He likes to see a stray face or two looking in through the railings, and perhaps reading his inscription.
1	‘You never see a postboy in that ‘ere hospital as you _walked _(as they says o’ the ghosts), did you?’ demanded Sam.
1	And why go beating about Brentford bushes, seeking orphans forsooth who had established no claims upon you and made no sacrifices for you, when here was an orphan ready to your hand who had given up in your cause, Miss Elizabeth, Master George, Aunt Jane, and Uncle Parker?
1	I am ashamed at you.’ ‘My dear girl, what have I got to do with her dressing beautifully or looking well?’ inquired Nicholas.
1	‘“I need not tell you,”’ said John Carker, reading the letter, ‘“why your name would henceforth have an unnatural sound, in however remote a connexion with mine, or why the daily sight of anyone who bears it, would be unendurable to me.
1	The neighbourhood was a dreary one at that time; as oppressive, sad, and solitary by night, as any about London.
1	If I was a shilling a week less useful in ten years’ time, this impostor would give me a shilling a week less; if as useful a man could be got at sixpence cheaper, he would be taken in my place at sixpence cheaper.
1	‘There,’ he said jokingly, ‘I’m coming here again next Monday at the same time, and mind you’re here, my lad, to work it out.’ ‘Thank you, Sir,’ said Kit.
1	‘We want to make a little transfer, if you please.’ ‘Oh, just come in, will you?’ said Mr. Flasher.
1	This haven was divided from the rough world by a glass partition and a half-door, with a leaden sill upon it for the convenience of resting your liquor; but, over this half-door the bar’s snugness so gushed forth that, albeit customers drank there standing, in a dark and draughty passage where they were shouldered by other customers passing in and out, they always appeared to drink under an enchanting delusion that they were in the bar itself.
1	As to the accident which befel Miss Florence this morning, I regard that as, in one great sense, a happy and fortunate circumstance; inasmuch as, but for that occurrence, I never could have known--and from your own lips too--of what you had been guilty.
1	Mr. Pickwick remembered to have very often observed them lounging under the archway when he had been walking past; and his curiosity was quite excited to know to what branch of the profession these dingy-looking loungers could possibly belong.
1	‘There, I confess, His Honour the Mayor is too many for me,’ said Mr. Datchery, with an ingenious smile and bow; ‘even a diplomatic bird must fall to such a gun.’ Now this was very soothing.
1	He went into the infirmary, this morning; the doctor says his strength is to be kept up as much as possible; and the warden’s sent him wine and broth and that, from his own house.
1	The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose, the customers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of the wine-shop.
1	Mr Merdle’s right hand was filled with the evening paper, and the evening paper was full of Mr Merdle.
1	It was a strong grapple, and a fierce struggle, arm and leg.
1	It was late next morning when Oliver awoke, from a sound, long sleep.
1	Confined as the limits of Field Lane are, it has its barber, its coffee-shop, its beer-shop, and its fried-fish warehouse.
1	'If they don't get any fresh evidence, it'll only be a summary conviction, and we shall have him back again after six weeks or so; but, if they do, it's a case of lagging.
1	Will you be able to have no affection for him when he is gone, poor castaway, gone?’ He burst into tears of maudlin pity for himself, and at length suffering her to embrace him and take charge of him, let his grey head rest against her cheek, and bewailed his wretchedness.
1	‘I live there.’ ‘Live at Brass’s the attorney’s!’ cried Mr Witherden in some surprise: having professional knowledge of the gentleman in question.
1	A host of unpleasant misgivings, which had been crowding upon Nicholas during the whole journey, thronged into his mind with redoubled force when he was left alone.
1	When you say tight--’ ‘I mean tight,’ Mr Boffin explained.
1	You may be astonished to hear it, but my mother—ran away from _me_.’ E. W. B. Childers replied pointedly, that he was not at all astonished to hear it.
1	Isn't it a most wonderful and extraordinary thing that I can't call at a man's house but I find a piece of this poor surgeon's friend on the staircase?
1	‘My first master will succeed me--I am in earnest at last--so you’ll soon have to arrange our contracts, and to bind us firmly to them, like a couple of knaves.’ ‘And to take care,’ said Mr. Wickfield, ‘that you’re not imposed on, eh?
1	I have committed follies, gentlemen,’ said Uriah, looking round with a meek smile, ‘and I ought to bear the consequences without repining.’ A murmur, partly of gratification at Twenty Seven’s celestial state of mind, and partly of indignation against the Contractor who had given him any cause of complaint (a note of which was immediately made by Mr. Creakle), having subsided, Twenty Seven stood in the midst of us, as if he felt himself the principal object of merit in a highly meritorious museum.
1	Everything was so beautiful, so compact, so neat, and in such exquisite taste, said everybody, that there really was no deciding what to admire most.
1	Late in the afternoon we came to the market-town where we were to alight from the coach--a dull little town with a church-spire, and a marketplace, and a market-cross, and one intensely sunny street, and a pond with an old horse cooling his legs in it, and a very few men sleepily lying and standing about in narrow little bits of shade.
1	‘Do you suppose that a man, in forming himself for the duties I discharge, and in watching and repressing himself daily to discharge them well, dismisses a man’s nature?’ ‘I suppose you,’ said Eugene, ‘judging from what I see as I look at you, to be rather too passionate for a good schoolmaster.’ As he spoke, he tossed away the end of his cigar.
1	She took me in both her arms, and squeezed me to her stays until the pressure on my nose was extremely painful, though I never thought of that till afterwards when I found it very tender.
1	As we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more to me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was I going to be?
1	This letter I sealed and laid upon his desk before he returned; and when he came in, I saw him, through the half-opened door of his room, take it up and read it.
1	Mr. Bucket is found to be downstairs, by appointment.
1	‘We have been discussing your emigration, with many apologies to you for keeping you out of the room so long; and I’ll tell you what arrangements we propose.’ These she explained to the unbounded satisfaction of the family,--children and all being then present,--and so much to the awakening of Mr. Micawber’s punctual habits in the opening stage of all bill transactions, that he could not be dissuaded from immediately rushing out, in the highest spirits, to buy the stamps for his notes of hand.
1	This so far surprised him, as to induce him gently to repeat, ‘a proposal of marriage, my dear.’  To which she returned, without any visible emotion whatever: ‘I hear you, father.
1	From beneath a leaf of torn and cancelled scraps of paper, he took one letter that remained entire.
1	There ain't one of the family that wouldn't sell the other for a pound or two, except the old lady--and she's only out of it because she's too weak in her mind to drive a bargain."
1	Mr. Micawber, I may remark, had taken his full share of the general bow, and had received it with infinite condescension.
1	The shining Bull's Eye of the Court was gone, or it would have been the mark for a hurricane of national bullets.
1	Now, I don’t wish to do nothing harsh,” he says, “but if you can’t confine yourself to steady circles, and find your vay back at reg’lar hours, as sure as you’re a-standin’ there, I’ll shut you out altogether!” The little man was seized vith a wiolent fit o’ tremblin’, and never vent outside the prison walls artervards!’ As Sam concluded, Mr. Pickwick slowly retraced his steps downstairs.
1	Turning down Sun Street and Crown Street, and crossing Finsbury square, Mr. Sikes struck, by way of Chiswell Street, into Barbican: thence into Long Lane, and so into Smithfield; from which latter place arose a tumult of discordant sounds that filled Oliver Twist with amazement.
1	"My dear Jarndyce," returned Mr. Skimpole, "I will do anything to give you pleasure, but it seems an idle form--a superstition.
1	“She might have had the politeness to send that message at first, but it's better late than never.
1	I even heard it said between them, "Shall she go?"
1	He runs up the long wooden entry and finds the trooper smoking his pipe.
1	I felt its whole weight now; and I drooped beneath it, and I said in my heart that it could never be lightened.
1	I discovered this, by his being out on the second or third evening of our visit, and by Mrs. Gummidge’s looking up at the Dutch clock, between eight and nine, and saying he was there, and that, what was more, she had known in the morning he would go there.
1	“Touching those signals, little citizen,” said Madame Defarge, sternly, “that she made to the prisoners; you are ready to bear witness to them this very day?” “Ay, ay, why not!” cried the sawyer.
1	But he always saw her as she was, without disguise, and watched her on the dangerous way that she was going.
1	‘He don’t consider himself above it.’ ‘Perhaps he considers himself beneath it,’ suggested Bella.
1	‘No warm water!’ exclaimed Mr. Bob Sawyer.
1	Donkeys!’ and go out to the assault.
1	The following dialogue I have held a hundred times: ‘Is it not a very disgraceful circumstance that such a man as So-and-so should be acquiring a large property by the most infamous and odious means, and notwithstanding all the crimes of which he has been guilty, should be tolerated and abetted by your Citizens?
1	He states his points so clearly that it’s a treat to have ‘em!
1	Mr. Dolloby, not without some grumbling, gave ninepence.
1	‘I ain’t a cove to chuck a word away.
1	Am I so like my poor little Uncle again?’ ‘Yes, Paul.
1	Don’t tell them that I asked.’ Walter Gay Walter could not, for several days, decide what to do in the Barbados business; and even cherished some faint hope that Mr Dombey might not have meant what he had said, or that he might change his mind, and tell him he was not to go.
1	They had scarcely set foot upon its pavement, when the girl started, and immediately made towards them.
1	Give me a kiss, Trot.
1	All this passed in a whisper a door or two from the house in which I could faintly hear crying and moaning.
1	However, they brought her through it by unremitting and affectionate attention; and we were married yesterday six weeks.
1	Nell’s was unheard, for she, poor child, with her head drooping on his shoulder, had fallen asleep, and slept too soundly to be roused by any of his efforts to awaken her to a participation in his glee.
1	‘Shall we, really?’ returned Eugene, indolently surprised.
1	But I am resolved to have the account of the man from Somewhere, and I beg you to elicit it for me, my love,’ to Mrs Veneering, ‘as I have lost my own influence.
1	We have been taking counsel together, and getting on very well, all things considered.
1	Curious, however, after reading this announcement, to see what kind of morsels were so carefully preserved, I turned a few leaves, and found them scrawled all over with the vilest and the filthiest ribaldry that ever human hogs delighted in.
1	‘The counting-house, sir?’ I repeated.
1	He was very unwilling to go, I can tell you, but there was no help for it.
1	If you’ll go on managing capitally, I’ll go on doing my part.
1	Yet you think yourselves very fine, I dare say!"
1	No wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that I should have derived from their simplicity and fidelity; but I could never, never, undo what I had done.
1	Mr and Mrs Sparkler had been dining alone, with their gloom cast over them, and Mrs Sparkler reclined on a drawing-room sofa.
1	"You were always a good friend to me," said Scrooge.
1	I don’t see where we are going.’ ‘I think,’ said Sissy, ‘you have already guessed whom I left just now!’ ‘I have been in the greatest concern and uneasiness during the last four-and-twenty hours (which have appeared as many years),’ he returned, ‘on a lady’s account.
1	‘Show him in.’ Mr Sloppy being introduced, remained close to the door: revealing in various parts of his form many surprising, confounding, and incomprehensible buttons.
1	Flowers, plants, birds, the harp, the old piano whose notes had sounded so much sweeter in bygone times; how many struggles had it cost her to keep these two last links of that broken chain which bound her yet to home!
1	“Eugene, Eugene, Eugene, this is a bad business.” Ah!
1	These two causes of merriment, taken together, struck him as being so keenly ridiculous, that, despite his miserable condition, he laughed till he was thoroughly exhausted.
1	The other mourners (who are only Mr Chick, and two of the medical attendants) proceed upstairs to the drawing-room, to be received by Mrs Chick and Miss Tox.
1	I recollect the wet house-tops, the clogged and bursting gutters and water-spouts, the mounds of blackened ice and snow over which we passed, the narrowness of the courts by which we went.
1	Then why don’t he go?
1	There really was no necessity for the good lady to be much distressed upon this particular head; the extent of her worldly knowledge being, to say the least, very questionable; and so Ralph seemed to think, for he smiled as she spoke.
1	Too late to know for certain, whether injuries received before or after death; one excellent surgical opinion said, before; other excellent surgical opinion said, after.
1	‘Pray, Fanny,’ said Mr Dorrit, raising his eyebrows, ‘what do you mean?
1	I know all.’ The daughter smiled incredulously.
1	If you’re as--as--as perfectly blissful in a matrimonial life, as I am myself, you’ll have nothing to desire.’ ‘I don’t forget my old friends, you see,’ said Mr Feeder.
1	He could calmly think how beautiful she was, how full of promise, what a home some happy man would find in such a heart one day.
1	But I have done it myself; no thanks to the governor.’ ‘And your intelligent sister?’ ‘My intelligent sister is about where she was.
1	I felt it was a time for conversation and confidence.
1	His developed figure and their stunted forms, his large manner filling any amount of room and their little narrow pinched ways, his sounding voice and their sharp spare tones, are in the strongest and the strangest opposition.
1	Mr. Weevle admits that he has been wrong and begs Mr. William Guppy to think no more about it.
1	"Dear guardian," I replied, "when you spoke to me before on that subject--" "But since then," he gravely interposed, anticipating what I meant to say, "I have reflected that your having anything to ask me, and my having anything to tell you, are different considerations, Esther.
1	Her mother, after watching her for some time without speaking, ventured to steal her withered hand a little nearer to her across the table; and finding that she permitted this, to touch her face, and smooth her hair.
1	He is a most respectable man with a wife and family, formerly in the Royal Artillery--" "My friend, I don't care a pinch of snuff for the whole Royal Artillery establishment--officers, men, tumbrils, waggons, horses, guns, and ammunition."
1	Therefore, when Sunday came, the mender of roads was not enchanted (though he said he was) to find that madame was to accompany monsieur and himself to Versailles.
1	Mr. Winkle said nothing, but he fixed his eyes on Grummer, and bestowed a look upon him, which, if he had had any feeling, must have pierced his brain.
1	‘And at other times they say, “Can it never be done without these tricks, Mr Riah?
1	That’s a peculiarity of his.
1	As Nicholas and his sister were by this time compelled to superintend the removal of the few articles of furniture, Miss La Creevy devoted herself to the consolation of the matron, and observed with great kindness of manner that she must really make an effort, and cheer up.
1	Late in the afternoon he awoke, and in some anxiety sent round to Eugene’s lodging hard by, to inquire if he were up yet?
1	I was not so easy now during any reference to the name but that I felt it a relief when Richard, with an exclamation of surprise, hurried away to meet a stranger whom he first descried coming slowly towards us.
1	As each gentleman got through his own personal amount of tea, coffee, bread, butter, salmon, shad, liver, steak, potatoes, pickles, ham, chops, black-puddings, and sausages, he rose up and walked off.
1	When any distinct word has been flung into the air, it has had no sense or sequence.
1	The Study of a Loving Heart    25.
1	“There was another in with Compeyson, as was called Arthur,--not as being so chrisen'd, but as a surname.
1	Now, I am coming to the paper, and mark what I say.
1	Rise, Annie, pray!’ But she did not rise.
1	She held so tight to him, in fact, that the officers were obliged to take ‘em both together.
1	I regret Mrs Boffin.’ ‘I, too, regret that separation very much.
1	The people were by this time pouring forth, as he had seen them with the Ghost of Christmas Present; and walking with his hands behind him, Scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile.
1	I asked him, with a better appearance of composure than I could have thought possible a minute before, whether he had made his feelings known to Agnes.
1	Silent, humane, indispensable in hospital and prison, using his art equally among assassins and victims, he was a man apart.
1	The gentle Judy, having backed her grandfather a little way from the fire, and having shaken him up as usual, and having released his overshadowed eye from its black-velvet extinguisher, Mr. Smallweed again says, "Oh, dear me!
1	She has been told it often enough; and when she IS told it, she only gives me a placid look, as if I was I don't know what--a steeple in the distance," said Caddy with a sudden idea; "and then she shakes her head and says 'Oh, Caddy, Caddy, what a tease you are!'
1	Now, then, Sam, wheel away.’ ‘Hold on, sir,’ said Mr. Weller, invigorated with the prospect of refreshments.
1	‘Come!’ said he, ‘I don’t want to be told about that.
1	you have something to say.
1	One of these was a mere boy of nineteen or twenty, who, though it was yet barely ten o’clock, was drinking gin-and-water, and smoking a cigar- -amusements to which, judging from his inflamed countenance, he had devoted himself pretty constantly for the last year or two of his life.
1	And yet I cannot,” said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again, “see afore me One--and likewise drink to One--without again expressing--May I--may I--?” I said he might, and he shook hands with me again, and emptied his glass and turned it upside down.
1	‘Unintelligible!’ As he watches the spasmodic shoots and darts that break out of her face and limbs, like fitful lightning out of a dark sky, some contagion in them seizes upon him: insomuch that he has to withdraw himself to a lean arm-chair by the hearth—placed there, perhaps, for such emergencies—and to sit in it, holding tight, until he has got the better of this unclean spirit of imitation.
1	He is a kind, excellent, independent-spirited, fine- hearted, hospitable, liberal man (enthusiastic shouts from the poor relations, at all the adjectives; and especially at the two last).
1	Being my limbs, what does it signify?
1	Of course," he said, bringing his chair nearer mine and breaking into his fascinating smile, "of course it's not business.
1	We cannot command our feelings to such an extent as that.’ Miss Tox assented, without being particular as to the intelligibility of the proposition.
1	‘Out with it!’ said Miss Wren, with an arch look.
1	I hope that gentleman will take warning, sir, and will not be offended at my freedom.
1	After that, Mr Feeder not only began to dance as if he meant dancing and nothing else, but secretly to stimulate the music to perform wild tunes.
1	Earrings in his brown ears, white teeth lighting up his grotesque brown face, intensely black hair clustering about his brown throat, a ragged red shirt open at his brown breast.
1	Taken out of harness one day at noon, to feed--if he could find food--he sobbed twelve times, once for every stroke of the bell, and died on her bosom.'
1	Like a well, like a vault, like a tomb, the prison had no knowledge of the brightness outside, and would have kept its polluted atmosphere intact in one of the spice islands of the Indian ocean.
1	He will have his bond, my dear friend."
1	I was so sorry, and yet I was so fond of them and so glad that they were fond of me; I pitied them so much, and yet I felt a kind of pride in their loving one another.
1	But, before we can resolve upon any precise course of action, it will be necessary to see the girl; to ascertain from her whether she will point out this Monks, on the understanding that he is to be dealt with by us, and not by the law; or, if she will not, or cannot do that, to procure from her such an account of his haunts and description of his person, as will enable us to identify him.
1	It was originally chosen for the seat of Government, as a means of averting the conflicting jealousies and interests of the different States; and very probably, too, as being remote from mobs: a consideration not to be slighted, even in America.
1	He is a responsible-looking gentleman dressed in black, portly enough, but strong and active.
1	For the terrors undergone by Mr Dolls that evening when his little parent sat profoundly meditating over her work, and when he imagined himself found out, as often as she changed her attitude, or turned her eyes towards him, there is no adequate name.
1	A moment afterwards they re-entered the house.
1	Not a dead man, I suppose."
1	People in my part of the country say they remember me so, but now I must have this vent under my sense of injury or nothing could hold my wits together.
1	‘Oh--you remember me, I suppose?’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	He then returned to the punch, in the highest state of exhilaration.
1	Perhaps I speak with some little partiality.
1	To those noble qualities I can lay no claim.
1	‘We intend to win everything,’ said he.
1	‘You were saying, Mrs Merdle,’ said Mr Merdle, with his wounded finger in his mouth, ‘that you had a complaint against me?’ ‘A complaint which I could scarcely show the justice of more emphatically, than by having to repeat it,’ said Mrs Merdle.
1	The street was muddy, dirty, and deserted.
1	‘Now get you into that corner and lie down,’ said Gowan, ‘or I’ll take you out and shoot you.’ Lion did as he was ordered, and lay down licking his mouth and chest.
1	then it's a panel, eh?'
1	‘I can easily inquire.’ ‘Leave these papers with my clerk, then,’ said Ralph, producing a small parcel, ‘and tell him to wait till I come home.’ Nicholas cheerfully undertook the errand, and bidding his worthy uncle an affectionate farewell, which that warm-hearted old gentleman acknowledged by a growl, hastened away to execute his commission.
1	A child of excellent abilities, and with strong powers of observation, quick, eager, delicate, and soon hurt bodily or mentally, it seems wonderful to me that nobody should have made any sign in my behalf.
1	Oh yes, he was up.
1	Sir, I have no doubt whatever that Mr. Bounderby will then promote me to young Mr. Tom’s situation.
1	Accepting Lightwood’s proffered hand to help him up, he then put on his coat, and said to Riderhood, ‘Hand me over those spare sculls of yours, and I’ll pull this in to the nearest stairs.
1	Mrs. Wititterly had never thrown off the mask with regard to Sir Mulberry, but when she was more than usually out of temper, attributed the circumstance, as ladies sometimes do, to nervous indisposition.
1	"A family home," he ruminates as he marches along, "however small it is, makes a man like me look lonely.
1	‘You plot among you to wean my heart from her.
1	When he had got so far, it came again into his head that the question was, not what they thought of it, but what she thought of it.
1	Yet Walter so idealised the pretty child whom he had found wandering in the rough streets, and so identified her with her innocent gratitude of that night and the simplicity and truth of its expression, that he blushed for himself as a libeller when he argued that she could ever grow proud.
1	‘It will be necessary, I think,’ he observed, ‘to wind up Mr Dolls, before anything to any mortal purpose can be got out of him.
1	I must not urge them too much; it would rouse suspicion.” “Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued!” “The road is clear, my dearest.
1	When he had finished, she turned her eyes so as to command Miss Murdstone, without otherwise disturbing her attitude, and said: ‘Well, ma’am, have YOU got anything to remark?’ ‘Indeed, Miss Trotwood,’ said Miss Murdstone, ‘all that I could say has been so well said by my brother, and all that I know to be the fact has been so plainly stated by him, that I have nothing to add except my thanks for your politeness.
1	Nothing else in it--no, nothing, nothing!
1	It was when Caddy began to recover that I began to notice a change in my dear girl.
1	‘I waited for a good opportunity.
1	An old eight-day clock, of solemn and sedate demeanour, ticked gravely in one corner; and a silver watch, of equal antiquity, dangled from one of the many hooks which ornamented the dresser.
1	Some few stopped to gaze at Oliver for a moment or two, or turned round to stare at him as they hurried by; but none relieved him, or troubled themselves to inquire how he came there.
1	When there are two parties to a bargain, it is only reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted; is it, my good friend?'
1	Interference on the part of other parties brought me round; but I never asked ‘em to bring me round, nor yet the steamer never asked ‘em to it.
1	Was he one of those two passengers?” “I cannot undertake to say that he was.” “Does he resemble either of these two passengers?” “Both were so wrapped up, and the night was so dark, and we were all so reserved, that I cannot undertake to say even that.” “Mr.
1	I had done it again.
1	It was summer-time, and lovely weather.
1	No, it was not my fault.
1	‘Could I say a few words with you in the next box?’ ‘By all means,’ rejoined Squeers with a grin.
1	I told her I should like it very much, I hoped; but I was a little strange to it at first.
1	Between this, and the room she had called hers, there was a small door of communication, standing partly open.
1	Because they were never asunder.
1	He was a fine swarthy fellow, with dark hair and large moustachios, who rode a-hunting in clothes of Lincoln green, with russet boots on his feet, and a bugle slung over his shoulder like the guard of a long stage.
1	I am still, and I always shall be.
1	‘I am very much obliged to you, indeed,’ said Traddles, on hearing it was to be sent to where he lived, that night.
1	Notably, Lady Tippins has made a series of experiments on her digestive functions, so extremely complicated and daring, that if they could be published with their results it might benefit the human race.
1	You were not to be found.
1	How could such a collection be here, where you see everything except the inside of one little cupboard and a few boxes?
1	Not that I had really thought so, but because my conversational powers were effectually scattered.
1	The vacant apartment to which the bill in the parlour window bore reference, appeared, on inquiry, to be a small back-room on the second floor, reclaimed from the leads, and overlooking a soot-bespeckled prospect of tiles and chimney-pots.
1	A word in your ear, Mrs. Nickleby.
1	That patriotic servant accordingly stuck to his colours (the Standard of four Quarterings), and was a perfect Nelson in respect of nailing them to the mast.
1	I could have done so, and I would, if we had never met, Florence.’ ‘I trust,’ said Cousin Feenix, ambling in at the door, and speaking, half in the room, and half out of it, ‘that my lovely and accomplished relative will excuse my having, by a little stratagem, effected this meeting.
1	Come, come, my young cousins, begin afresh!
1	Stay,’ he added, looking round again.
1	My dear Mrs Chick--may I say Louisa!’ Mrs Chick took Miss Tox’s hand in hers, rested the foot of her wine-glass upon it, repressed a tear, and said in a low voice, ‘God bless you!’ ‘My dear Louisa then,’ said Miss Tox, ‘my sweet friend, how are you now?’ ‘Better,’ Mrs Chick returned.
1	Old Wardle would not hear of his rising, so they made the bed the chair, and Mr. Pickwick presided.
1	I cannot say that they were very like, or that they particularly resembled any flowers that have ever come under my observation; but I knew from the paper round them which was accurately copied, what the composition was.
1	Wegg was a knotty man, and a close-grained, with a face carved out of very hard material, that had just as much play of expression as a watchman’s rattle.
1	‘I never saw such a melting thing in all my life!’ said Richards, who naturally substituted for this child one of her own, inquiring for herself in like circumstances.
1	Traddles still remained, perhaps, but it was very doubtful; and I had not sufficient confidence in his discretion or good luck, however strong my reliance was on his good nature, to wish to trust him with my situation.
1	‘I think it right to suggest it.
1	You are quite--yes--dear me!’ I hoped he was well, and Mrs. Strong too.
1	Mr Perch, who seemed to remember having heard in infancy that there was once a poet of that name, made no objection; but he was much astonished at the Captain’s coming into the City to propose a poet; indeed, if he had proposed to put a poet’s statue up--say Shakespeare’s for example--in a civic thoroughfare, he could hardly have done a greater outrage to Mr Perch’s experience.
1	A second knock brought no reply from within the house; but caused a woman over the way to look out and inquire who that was, awanting Mrs Nubbles.
1	You may, perhaps, be prepared to hear that Mrs. Micawber is in a state of health which renders it not wholly improbable that an addition may be ultimately made to those pledges of affection which--in short, to the infantine group.
1	Take him, and I can bear it better, for your sake!” My earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have been touched with compassion, if she could have rendered me at all intelligible to her own mind.
1	‘A hundred,’ said the little man.
1	If you like to come there, come there.
1	‘You ask me why!’ returned my aunt.
1	She led Florence to a chair beside her, and sat down: Florence looking in her face, quite wondering at its beauty, and willingly leaving her hand in hers.
1	Mr Wegg argued, if an orphan were wanted, was he not an orphan himself; and could a better be desired?
1	‘You know it almost breaks my heart, even to hear you talk of such a thing,’ replied Madame Mantalini.
1	At breakfast next morning, he knew the contents of the latest newspapers received; and mentioned several subjects in connexion with them, on which his opinion had recently been sought by persons of such power and might, that they were only to be obscurely hinted at.
1	He was walking up and down the room, panting, and making himself worse by laboriously fanning himself with her handkerchief, when he turned towards the opening door.
1	‘You!’ He did what he could to muster a smile, and returned, ‘Your fancy.
1	After a short delay, he reappeared, and limping back again, halted midway, and beckoned Nicholas to follow him.
1	He was sitting in his old grey gown and his old black cap, in the sunlight by the window, reading his newspaper.
1	It may be reasonably inferred that our baby will first expire of inanition, as being the frailest member of our circle; and that our twins will follow next in order.
1	‘This time, at least, I will leave nothing unsaid,’ he went on, folding his hands before him, clearly to prevent his being betrayed into any impetuous gesture; ‘this last time at least I will not be tortured with after-thoughts of a lost opportunity.
1	In any part of the house, visitors were usually cognizant of a prevailing mustiness; and in warm weather Miss Tox had been seen apparently writing in sundry chinks and crevices of the wainscoat with the the wrong end of a pen dipped in spirits of turpentine.
1	‘You see, master hadn’t introduced us, then.
1	‘Stop a moment, ma’am,’ said Bob Sawyer; ‘I’m afraid I have not understood you.
1	‘Pon my soul and honour that’s a wise remark.
1	I replied at my own chambers, with Herbert.
1	Let us both try to forget it.
1	The bell was rung again, with some impatience, while the party were in darkness.
1	I whistled and made nothing of going.
1	‘Nay, ma’am,’ said Stephen Blackpool, staunchly protesting against the words that had been used, and instinctively addressing himself to Louisa, after glancing at her face.
1	‘Then you ought to have said it, sir,’ returned Bella, giving him two pulls and one kiss, ‘for you must have thought and meant it.
1	She started--it was only a passing dream.
1	In one of the sunburnt faces I had recognized Mr. Allan Woodcourt, and I had been afraid of his recognizing me.
1	and retires conscience-stricken from the presence.
1	With the candles appeared her maid, with the juvenile dress that was to delude the world to-morrow.
1	‘How do you dare?’ ‘What I mean, Sir, is to speak respectful and without offence, but out, and how I dare I know not but I do!’ said Susan.
1	Sir Leicester seems to wake, though his eyes have been wide open, and he looks intently at Mr. Bucket as Mr. Bucket refers to his watch.
1	We're not going to pick holes in each other's coats, I suppose?"
1	Oh I know she’s going to bring him here!
1	There she sits in his company like a stone, instead of making herself agreeable and getting it easily.
1	‘Capital!’ said Sir Mulberry Hawk, putting the stakes in his pocket.
1	He saw her in his mind, exactly as she was.
1	Fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then; and, in a few minutes, the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour.
1	“Which is Evremonde?” says a man behind him.
1	‘Miss Wardle,’ said Mr. Jingle, with affected earnestness, ‘forgive intrusion--short acquaintance--no time for ceremony--all discovered.’ ‘Sir!’ said the spinster aunt, rather astonished by the unexpected apparition and somewhat doubtful of Mr. Jingle’s sanity.
1	‘Fie for shame.’ ‘Mr Dombey will forgive the partiality of a wife,’ said Mrs Blimber, with an engaging smile.
1	The room was as neat as Janet or my aunt.
1	‘Snug!’ said Quilp, when he had groped his way to the wooden counting-house, and opened the door with a key he carried about with him.
1	This, with hazy remembrances of how he had been carried to some office to ‘confess judgment’ (as he recollected the phrase), and how he had been carried to another office where his life was assured for somebody not wholly unconnected with the sherry trade whom he remembered by the remarkable circumstance that he had a Straduarius violin to dispose of, and also a Madonna, formed the sum and substance of Mr Twemlow’s narrative.
1	He was then, and he is now, very sorry for it.’ ‘But for Mr. Jasper’s well-bred consideration in coming up to me, next day, after service, in the Nave itself, with his gown still on, and expressing his hope that I had not been greatly alarmed or had my rest violently broken, I believe I might never have heard of that disgraceful transaction,’ said the old lady.
1	He has been so horribly frightened in the short interval that his terror seizes the other, who makes a rush at him and asks loudly, "What's the matter?"
1	Accordingly, Mr Dombey produced a list of sundry eastern magnates who were to be bidden to this feast on his behalf; to which Mrs Skewton, acting for her dearest child, who was haughtily careless on the subject, subjoined a western list, comprising Cousin Feenix, not yet returned to Baden-Baden, greatly to the detriment of his personal estate; and a variety of moths of various degrees and ages, who had, at various times, fluttered round the light of her fair daughter, or herself, without any lasting injury to their wings.
1	‘Demmit,’ he cried, in a suffocating voice, ‘it’s little Nickleby!
1	What superior intelligence!’ ‘Keep off, Jeremiah!’ cried the palpitating Affery, taking her apron from her mouth again.
1	Oh, very right indeed,’ said Arthur.
1	He has more leisure for musing in Staple Inn and in the Rolls Yard during the long vacation than at other seasons, and he says to the two 'prentices, what a thing it is in such hot weather to think that you live in an island with the sea a-rolling and a-bowling right round you.
1	‘Why did you call him back?’ ‘He was long enough coming, anyhow,’ grumbled Fledgeby.
1	It is obvious that, having devoted herself from infancy to this one pursuit and study, Miss Brass could know but little of the world, otherwise than in connection with the law; and that from a lady gifted with such high tastes, proficiency in those gentler and softer arts in which women usually excel, was scarcely to be looked for.
1	‘I shall strive t’ see thee agen, Rachael, afore I go, but if not—’ ‘Thou wilt not, Stephen, I know.
1	My darling, don't you be afraid!"
1	But that was always the way with your poor dear papa,--just his way--always wandering, never able to fix his thoughts on any one subject for two minutes together.
1	I am very desirous to serve a friend.” Wemmick tightened his post-office and shook his head, as if his opinion were dead against any fatal weakness of that sort.
1	You know this to be our determination.
1	I was standing alone before the fire, when Dora came stealing softly in, to give me that usual precious little kiss before I went.
1	In short, the poor girl (for what could she know of the criminal intellect, which its own professed students perpetually misread, because they persist in trying to reconcile it with the average intellect of average men, instead of identifying it as a horrible wonder apart) could get by no road to any other conclusion than that he _was_ a terrible man, and must be fled from.
1	‘Never!’ was the valorous reply.
1	All the family!” Lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket, but it was impossible to be there while the wood-sawyer was at work, and not be in his sight.
1	‘Can we have beds here?’ inquired Mr. Pickwick, summoning the waiter.
1	She could scarcely move her head for pain and heaviness, her eyes were strained and sore, and she was very weak.
1	‘Why, he drove a coach down here once,’ said Sam; ‘’lection time came on, and he was engaged by vun party to bring down woters from London.
1	At a sign from Mr. Brownlow, they helped out a third man, and taking him between them, hurried him into the house.
1	Mr Dombey stiff with starch and arrogance; the little image by inheritance, and in unconscious imitation.
1	The hollow crowd, you know, when they see me with the Chicken, and characters of distinction like that, suppose me to be happy; but I’m wretched.
1	‘Oh, dear, yes, Master Copperfield,’ he proceeded, in a soft voice, most remarkably contrasting with the action of his thumb, which did not diminish its hard pressure in the least degree, ‘there’s no doubt of it.
1	One day soon after the appearance of the chair, Miss Havisham suddenly saying to me, with the impatient movement of her fingers, “There, there, there!
1	I took the opportunity of her being from home, to beg to speak to you.” There was a blank silence.
1	I have walked two nights without resting.
1	He takes his place within the carriage, and three other gentlemen follow.
1	Some of the young ladies washed the lettuces for him, and sliced them under his directions.
1	At another time, our parcels would come and go, as easily as in business-like Old England; but now, everything is stopped.” “And do you really go to-night?” “I really go to-night, for the case has become too pressing to admit of delay.” “And do you take no one with you?” “All sorts of people have been proposed to me, but I will have nothing to say to any of them.
1	The servant soon returned, to beg that she would walk upstairs; and following him into an upper room, Miss Maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman of benevolent appearance, in a bottle-green coat.
1	“This friend,” I pursued, “is trying to get on in commercial life, but has no money, and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a beginning.
1	‘You call very early, and how kind that is, my dear!’ pursued Miss Tox.
1	He paid the money for his journey to the country-place he had thought of; and was walking to and fro, alone, looking along the lines of iron, across the valley in one direction, and towards a dark bridge near at hand in the other; when, turning in his walk, where it was bounded by one end of the wooden stage on which he paced up and down, he saw the man from whom he had fled, emerging from the door by which he himself had entered.
1	‘Not much, I fear,’ returned my mother.
1	Then he fell into such unaccountable fits of meditation, with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth; had his eyes attracted in such strange directions; was afflicted with such remarkable coughs; sat so far from the table, and dropped so much more than he ate, and pretended that he hadn't dropped it; that I was heartily glad when Herbert left us for the City.
1	Mr Lammle’s own particular servant behind his chair; the Analytical behind Veneering’s chair; instances in point that such servants fall into two classes: one mistrusting the master’s acquaintances, and the other mistrusting the master.
1	We’ll finish the bottle, to the House, Ned--Walter’s House.
1	An’t you one of the rest!
1	His scanty black trousers displayed here and there those shiny patches which bespeak long service, and were strapped very tightly over a pair of patched and mended shoes, as if to conceal the dirty white stockings, which were nevertheless distinctly visible.
1	You mustn’t tell us about that, here.
1	Promptly the Secretary wrote to the master of that school, and that very evening Bradley Headstone answered in person.
1	Upon my life and honour, I never was so rejoiced, my beloved Copperfield, never!’ I was equally at a loss to express my emotions.
1	Than I'm sorry to say, I've eat your pie.” “God knows you're welcome to it,--so far as it was ever mine,” returned Joe, with a saving remembrance of Mrs. Joe.
1	‘Hold up, Sir!’ This last observation of Mr. Weller’s bore reference to a demonstration Mr. Winkle made at the instant, of a frantic desire to throw his feet in the air, and dash the back of his head on the ice.
1	Then he placed his breakfast before him with great care, and said, “All right, ain't you, Aged P.?” To which the cheerful Aged replied, “All right, John, my boy, all right!” As there seemed to be a tacit understanding that the Aged was not in a presentable state, and was therefore to be considered invisible, I made a pretence of being in complete ignorance of these proceedings.
1	said Charley, putting the light so close to his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire.
1	She had been surprised at first, because she had not thought Edmund a marrying man.
1	He was sensible of the value of appearances as an investment, and liked to dress well; but he drove a bargain for every moveable about him, from the coat on his back to the china on his breakfast-table; and every bargain by representing somebody’s ruin or somebody’s loss, acquired a peculiar charm for him.
1	The boy complying with an indignant look and as much noise as he could make, swung out of the room; and Lightwood went to the window, and leaned there, looking out.
1	I have deliberated, ever since, when and how to destroy it.
1	Frankly and freely, there is no anger in you, Mr. Neville?’ ‘None at all, Mr. Jasper.’  Still, not quite so frankly or so freely; or, be it said once again, not quite so carelessly perhaps.
1	With a plunge of enjoyment, Fledgeby settled himself afresh.
1	‘Nothing would give me greater pleasure,’ replied Mr. Pickwick.
1	But what's done can't be undone.
1	It was old enough now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices.
1	I see Her with a child upon her bosom, who bears my name.
1	Another consequence that he had never foreshadowed, was the implication of an innocent man in his supposed murder.
1	‘When did that person come here, waiter?’ ‘Come down by the night-coach, this morning, sir.’ ‘Humph!
1	At length, Madame Rigaud, in an access of fury that I must ever deplore, threw herself upon me with screams of passion (no doubt those that were overheard at some distance), tore my clothes, tore my hair, lacerated my hands, trampled and trod the dust, and finally leaped over, dashing herself to death upon the rocks below.
1	‘Gentlemen,’ returned Mr. Micawber, ‘do with me as you will!
1	Thou hadst no sleep last night, I can well believe.
1	‘By what right I ask?’ ‘By this right.
1	And in this dress?’ ‘I hoped you would like me better in this dress than any other.
1	‘Why should I seek to change,’ said I, ‘what has been so precious to me for so long!
1	As when I saw my little darling looking up so naturally to those cordial eyes.
1	My poor brother!’ With this speech feelingly reminiscent of her not having been asked to dinner on the day of the first party, Mrs Chick makes great use of her pocket-handkerchief, and falls on Mr Dombey’s neck.
1	‘Why, they’re--over there, my dear,’ said the turnkey, with a vague flourish of his key.
1	The strange sound of his voice thrilled through the whole frame of his child.
1	If there were--Charles Darnay, if there were--” The young man had taken his hand gratefully; their hands were joined as the Doctor spoke: “--any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever, new or old, against the man she really loved--the direct responsibility thereof not lying on his head--they should all be obliterated for her sake.
1	But other subjects began to lay heavy on the Captain’s mind.
1	It was the beginning of a day in June; the deep blue sky unsullied by a cloud, and teeming with brilliant light.
1	Eugene drew a chair to the fire by which he was having his wine and reading the evening paper, and brought a glass, and filled it for good fellowship’s sake.
1	Eatansvill to vit, or I’m a Roman.’ Sam was taken with a troublesome cough, at once, for the purpose of attracting the gentleman’s attention; the gentleman starting at the sound, raised his head and his eyeglass, and disclosed to view the profound and thoughtful features of Mr. Pott, of the Eatanswill _Gazette_.
1	Circumstances undoubtedly prevent my saying that it would afford me any gratification to hear that Mr. Boythorn had favoured my house with his presence, but those circumstances are confined to that gentleman himself and do not extend beyond him."
1	‘I can do nothing for myself, my darling,’ said the grandfather; ‘I don’t know how it is, I could once, but the time’s gone.
1	There was a favourite spot of mine in the park-woods of Chesney Wold where a seat had been erected commanding a lovely view.
1	You’re one of the Patriarchs; you’re a shaky old card; and you can’t be in love with this Lizzie?’ ‘O, sir!’ expostulated Riah.
1	‘My dear young Davy,’ he said, clapping me on the shoulder again, ‘you are a very Daisy.
1	I have been drawing up," he glances at his writing on the table, "an exact account of what I knew of the deceased and how I came to be involved in this unfortunate affair.
1	Mr Dombey assented bitterly; but there was something more in his bitterness, and in his moody way of falling back in the carriage, and looking with knitted brows at the changing objects without, than the failure of that noble educational system administered by the Grinders’ Company.
1	‘Eloped with a half-pay captain,’ repeated Mr. Lillyvick, ‘basely and falsely eloped with a half-pay captain.
1	Our recollections are unfortunately mingled with much that we deplore, and with many actions which we bitterly repent; still in the most chequered life I firmly think there are so many little rays of sunshine to look back upon, that I do not believe any mortal (unless he had put himself without the pale of hope) would deliberately drain a goblet of the waters of Lethe, if he had it in his power.’ ‘Possibly you are correct in that belief,’ said the grey-haired gentleman after a short reflection.
1	Mr Boffin hurried out, and found her on the dark staircase, panting, with a lighted candle in her hand.
1	replied Sikes, with a threatening look.
1	‘As I had always shunned the port of London, I only knew the church through his pointing out its spire from on board.
1	I had no other object than to turn a slight thing, which, to my surprise, seems to trouble you too much, aside.
1	Thinking of his varied fortunes within the last few weeks, and of his rustic boyhood, and of the two periods of his life so strangely brought together across the wide intermediate space; thinking of the murdered man whose image is fresh in his mind; thinking of the lady who has disappeared from these very rooms and the tokens of whose recent presence are all here; thinking of the master of the house upstairs and of the foreboding, "Who will tell him!"
1	You ought to have a couple of active energetic fellows, of gentlemanly manners, to go about.’ Veneering, after cogitation, thinks of Boots and Brewer.
1	He liked him for it.
1	The darkness out of which this light had broken on them gathered around; and the shadow of their guilty brother was in the house where his foot had never trod.
1	‘If you don’t happen to have heard of the time, sir, I tell you that there was a time, when I carried every point in triumph against her mother’s whole family, although they had power and wealth on their side, by my will alone.’ ‘Still,’ rejoined Ralph, as mildly as his nature would allow him, ‘you have not heard me out.
1	"Did you wish to see him, sir?"
1	In a short time Mr. Mivins returned, bearing the sherry, which Mr. Smangle dispensed in two little cracked mugs; considerately remarking, with reference to himself, that a gentleman must not be particular under such circumstances, and that, for his part, he was not too proud to drink out of the jug.
1	Thank you, my dear friend, that'll do.
1	‘And who’s this shaver?’ said one of the gentlemen, taking hold of me.
1	you are the son of Mr Gills the Ships’ Instrument-maker.” “Nephew, Sir,” I said.
1	To keep in the easy road, and keep it at a distance, is object number one with you.'
1	Here is a stain upon the hat of a gentleman in company, that I'll take clean out, before he can order me a pint of ale.'
1	Little Dorrit’s old friend held the inkstand as she signed her name, and the clerk paused in taking off the good clergyman’s surplice, and all the witnesses looked on with special interest.
1	I have every reason to be happy, very happy, now; but then, Harry, I own I should have been happier.'
1	‘He played the audience out tonight.
1	It was a stiff leather purse, with a snap, and had three bright shillings in it, which Peggotty had evidently polished up with whitening, for my greater delight.
1	‘You know you HAVE thought about it, and have thought that, and think so every time you come here.
1	I dare say I am a capricious fellow, David.
1	you know her.’ ‘I should hope so,’ chuckled Mr Toots, with a conscious blush that suffused his whole countenance.
1	Then he started, and said: ‘I beg your pardon, sir.
1	He felt it his duty to remark (he was sure a gentleman of Mr Sparkler’s fine sense would interpret him with all delicacy), that he could not consider this proposal definitely determined on, until he should have had the privilege of holding some correspondence with Mr Merdle; and of ascertaining it to be so far accordant with the views of that eminent gentleman as that his (Mr Dorrit’s) daughter would be received on that footing which her station in life and her dowry and expectations warranted him in requiring that she should maintain in what he trusted he might be allowed, without the appearance of being mercenary, to call the Eye of the Great World.
1	The great day arriving, the good lady put herself under Kate’s hands an hour or so after breakfast, and, dressing by easy stages, completed her toilette in sufficient time to allow of her daughter’s making hers, which was very simple, and not very long, though so satisfactory that she had never appeared more charming or looked more lovely.
1	It was dark now, and torches were kindled.
1	But will you permit me, fairest creature, to ask you one question, in the absence of the planet Venus, who has gone on business to the Horse Guards, and would otherwise--jealous of your superior charms--interpose between us?’ ‘Kate,’ observed Mrs. Nickleby, turning to her daughter, ‘it’s very awkward, positively.
1	When the man is a cordial and an earnest man by nature, and withal is perfectly fresh and genuine, it may be doubted whether he is ever seen to greater advantage than at such a time.
1	Mrs General is always with us, and we speak French and speak Italian, and she takes pains to form us in many ways.
1	The night and the snow came on together, and dismal enough they were.
1	Not the person that shall be nameless.
1	This functionary, being, of course, well used to such scenes; looking upon all kinds of robbery, from petty larceny up to housebreaking or ventures on the highway, as matters in the regular course of business; and regarding the perpetrators in the light of so many customers coming to be served at the wholesale and retail shop of criminal law where he stood behind the counter; received Mr Brass’s statement of facts with about as much interest and surprise, as an undertaker might evince if required to listen to a circumstantial account of the last illness of a person whom he was called in to wait upon professionally; and took Kit into custody with a decent indifference.
1	Now, they’re not a-going—none of ’em—ever to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon.
1	“I was saying to madame, with whom I had the pleasure of chatting when you entered, that they tell me there is--and no wonder!--much sympathy and anger in Saint Antoine, touching the unhappy fate of poor Gaspard.” “No one has told me so,” said Defarge, shaking his head.
1	'Are you going up to the Cripples, Fagin?'
1	The Counting House soon got to be dirty and neglected.
1	Do you guess the reason?’ ‘No,’ the child replied.
1	After praying fervently, and with many bursting tears, for the old man, and the restoration of his peace of mind and the happiness they had once enjoyed, she would lay her head upon the pillow and sob herself to sleep: often starting up again, before the day-light came, to listen for the bell and respond to the imaginary summons which had roused her from her slumber.
1	"Yes," said Caddy, "wild Indians.
1	Howsoever, I don't so much complain of you as of some others, and I'm agreeable to make you a civil answer, though I give notice that I'm not a-going to be drawed like a badger.
1	‘Is it,’ he said, with his attention apparently engrossed by it, ‘yes, or no?’ ‘Mr Headstone, I thank you sincerely, I thank you gratefully, and hope you may find a worthy wife before long and be very happy.
1	As it was still foggy and dark, and as the shop was blinded besides by the wall of Lincoln's Inn, intercepting the light within a couple of yards, we should not have seen so much but for a lighted lantern that an old man in spectacles and a hairy cap was carrying about in the shop.
1	‘Who do you think is going to be married tomorrow?
1	‘Have you finished, Arthur, or have you anything more to say to me?
1	Favour us with your decision as speedily as possible, ma’am.’ With a smile upon her face, and looking at each of the three by turns, Miss Brass took two or three more pinches of snuff, and having by this time very little left, travelled round and round the box with her forefinger and thumb, scraping up another.
1	And at the rate of that handsome sum of money per annum, and at no higher rate, you are to live until the donor of the whole appears.
1	Whereas, and nevertheless, I find myself wrapped round with secrecy and mystery, till my life is a burden to me."
1	He had a great red pipe in his mouth, and was smoking, and staring at the rush-light, in a state of enviable placidity.
1	There were only three conditions of resemblance wanting between these Professors and those.
1	She got up to look at it.
1	If we didn’t want to sell it for the most we can get for it, we shouldn’t do it.
1	Shall we coax our old intriguer to tell us when he saw him last?’ ‘I’ll tell you!’ cried Affery, unstopping her mouth.
1	The great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out again, and the sun was red on the courtyard.
1	This Rokesmith gets acquainted with my affairs, and gets to know that I mean to settle a sum of money on this young lady.
1	He knew Rachael well, for a glance at any one of these groups was sufficient to show him that she was not there.
1	If the scene through which I have just passed has taught me to reflect, and has awakened me to a more anxious and careful sense of duty, why should I wait until the impression has cooled?
1	We are not particular here; is it not so, madame?’ Retiring before him with vicious counter-jerks of his own elbows, Mr Flintwinch had got back into his corner, where he now stood with his hands in his pockets, taking breath, and returning Mrs Clennam’s stare.
1	Sparkler.’ ‘No doubt of it, father; but it doesn’t follow that his mother’s name must be the same.
1	Go through with it while you are about it.
1	“Pretty well is no answer.
1	Indeed, divers servant girls who came to draw water, and sundry little boys who stopped to drink at the ladle, were almost scared out of their senses, by the apparition of Newman Noggs looking stealthily round the pump, with nothing of him visible but his face, and that wearing the expression of a meditative Ogre.
1	The blood horses of them colonists might fling up the dust over me as I was walking; what do I say?
1	You know our dear friend Podsnap?’ Twemlow ought to know the dear friend Podsnap who covered him with so much confusion, and he says he does know him, and Podsnap reciprocates.
1	That’s Blood!” It is an actual matter of fact.
1	‘Does the charm want any words to be said?’ asked Arthur, as he held the paper over the flame.
1	How is SHE?’ said my aunt, sharply.
1	ii.,* the recorded opinions and experiences of distinguished medical professors, French, English, and Scotch, in more modern days, contenting myself with observing that I shall not abandon the facts until there shall have been a considerable spontaneous combustion of the testimony on which human occurrences are usually received.
1	‘So; let me see,’ said Polly, not a little flurried between this earnest scrutiny, her desire to comfort the child, her sudden success, and her very slight confidence in her own powers.
1	Anything like the jocoseness of Mr. Guppy's mother just now, I think I never saw.
1	I am not sufficiently acquainted with such subjects to know whether it is at all remarkable that I almost always dreamed of that period of my life.
1	said the Jew, rising with a menacing look.
1	And I mean always to keep among none but grown-ups till I marry.
1	"The deceased, you know," says Mr. Snagsby, twitching his head and right eyebrow towards the staircase and tapping his acquaintance on the button.
1	Mr. Kenge, therefore, came down to dinner one day, and leaned back in his chair, and turned his eye-glasses over and over, and spoke in a sonorous voice, and did exactly what I remembered to have seen him do when I was a little girl.
1	A wedding is a licensed subject to joke upon, but there really is no great joke in the matter after all;--we speak merely of the ceremony, and beg it to be distinctly understood that we indulge in no hidden sarcasm upon a married life.
1	'Bow to the board,' said Bumble.
1	‘I wish, my dear, you would endeavour to find some topic of conversation in which these gentlemen might take some rational interest.’ ‘But, my love,’ said Mr. Pott, with great humility, ‘Mr.
1	They had several     children, and lived unmolested until the original owner died, when     his heir attempted to regain them; but the magistrate before whom     they were brought, decided that he had no jurisdiction in the case.
1	He turned her full to the light, and looked at her.
1	At this repast, Mr Chuckster exerted his utmost abilities to enchant his entertainers, and impress them with a conviction of the mental superiority of those who dwelt in town; with which view he led the discourse to the small scandal of the day, in which he was justly considered by his friends to shine prodigiously.
1	"You are exceedingly obliging, Sir Leicester, and on behalf of those ladies (who are present) and for myself, I thank you very much."
1	“Estella, dearest Estella, do not let Miss Havisham lead you into this fatal step.
1	Their limbs appear to have struck roots into their breasts and bodies, as aged trees strike roots into the earth.
1	Fur from that.’ We walked again for a while, as before, until he explained: ‘My wishes is, sir, as it shall look, day and night, winter and summer, as it has always looked, since she fust know’d it.
1	Walking between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into the open air.
1	"By the by, Tony, don't forget old Smallweed," meaning the younger of that name.
1	"Much good may it do you!
1	‘Pray don’t do that,’ said he, ‘it’s of no use doing that: it only worries.
1	Suddenly he starts up, wondering whether any other man is near; whether there is another cell like that on either side of him: and listens keenly.
1	"Do you generally put that elderly young gentleman in the same room when he's on a visit here, Miss Summerson?"
1	Pale even to her lips, and with a face that strove for composure until its proud beauty was as fixed as death, Edith looked down upon the weeping girl, and once kissed her.
1	‘Are you badly hurt, my friend?’ he asked the man on the litter, in Italian.
1	‘Do you presume?’ ‘Don’t talk about presuming, Ma, for goodness’ sake.
1	‘Then give it mouth in your own building, will you, if you please?’ said Childers.
1	Allow me to present Mrs Blimber and my daughter; who will be associated with the domestic life of our young Pilgrim to Parnassus Mrs Blimber,’ for the lady, who had perhaps been in waiting, opportunely entered, followed by her daughter, that fair Sexton in spectacles, ‘Mr Dombey.
1	‘She will not take poison, because she had a demd fine husband who might have married two countesses and a dowager--’ ‘Two countesses,’ interposed Madame.
1	Whatever I had within me that was romantic and dreamy, was encouraged by so much story-telling in the dark; and in that respect the pursuit may not have been very profitable to me.
1	I know you too well.
1	But Walter sought him out, and brought him back; and then the Captain’s great apprehension was, that Florence would suffer from this new shock.
1	‘But enough of this, gentlemen,’ said Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz, ‘it is difficult to smile with an aching heart; it is ill jesting when our deepest sympathies are awakened.
1	At the upper end of the room was a table, with a white cloth upon it, well covered with a roast fowl, bacon, ale, and et ceteras; and at the table sat Mr. Tupman, looking as unlike a man who had taken his leave of the world, as possible.
1	It looked as if it had once been a large house of entertainment; but the roof had fallen in, in many places, and the stairs were steep, rugged, and broken.
1	And now that he's thoroughly up to it, let's have some supper, and get a snooze before starting.'
1	‘It’s some time since we met,’ said Mr Meagles, clearing his throat; ‘I hope you have been pretty well, Miss Wade?’ Without hoping that he or anybody else had been pretty well, Miss Wade asked him to what she was indebted for the honour of seeing him again?
1	Never in a debtors' prison?
1	You required a verbal explanation.
1	I therefore got up and put on my clothes, and went out across the yard into the long stone passage, designing to gain the outer courtyard and walk there for the relief of my mind.
1	Am I right or wrong?’ So much had the Captain expressed in his eye, emboldened and incited by Mr Carker’s smiling urbanity, that he felt himself in as fair a condition to put the question, as if he had expressed his sentiments with the utmost elaboration.
1	As to his carrying some apparel with him, if he had really done so--and they were not even sure of that--he might have done so, the Captain argued, to prevent inquiry, to distract attention from his probable fate, or to ease the very mind that was now revolving all these possibilities.
1	There was another old woman watching by the bed; the parish apothecary's apprentice was standing by the fire, making a toothpick out of a quill.
1	Call him Mr Frederick Dorrit.
1	Telescopic Philanthropy We were to pass the night, Mr. Kenge told us when we arrived in his room, at Mrs. Jellyby's; and then he turned to me and said he took it for granted I knew who Mrs. Jellyby was.
1	Some     angry words then passed with one of the proprietors, and a challenge     followed; the friends of both parties tried to arrange the affair,     but failed to do so.
1	You must put it into words,’ he said.
1	You won’t deny it, Lawyer Lightwood?’ ‘Surely not; but you only offer to swear to your suspicion, and I tell you it is not enough to swear to your suspicion.’ ‘Not enough, ain’t it, Lawyer Lightwood?’ he cautiously demanded.
1	I have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes.
1	The gamblers, Isaac List and Jowl, with their trusty confederate Mr James Groves of unimpeachable memory, pursued their course with varying success, until the failure of a spirited enterprise in the way of their profession, dispersed them in various directions, and caused their career to receive a sudden check from the long and strong arm of the law.
1	‘I dare not leave the house alone.
1	It was a pitiful sight to see one of these vehicles deep in the mire; the axle-tree broken; the wheel lying idly by its side; the man gone miles away, to look for assistance; the woman seated among their wandering household gods with a baby at her breast, a picture of forlorn, dejected patience; the team of oxen crouching down mournfully in the mud, and breathing forth such clouds of vapour from their mouths and nostrils, that all the damp mist and fog around seemed to have come direct from them.
1	If he were really not in the habit of drinking rather more than was exactly good for him, he might have brought action against his countenance for libel, and have recovered heavy damages.
1	I will not hear him.
1	Clearing the town in course of time, they began to feel that they were fairly on their way.
1	Once or twice it was comically developed, as in the following case; but this was an amusing incident, and not the rule, or near it.
1	He was succeeded by Pliny, who also fell a victim to his thirst for knowledge.
1	there was something else, and it’s gone out of my head!
1	B. knows a move or two, Ma’am.
1	‘I’d sooner you took my blood than my character.’ ‘Because,’ pursued the Captain calmly, ‘you have heerd, may be, of such a thing as a rope’s end.’ ‘Oh, have I though, Captain?’ cried the taunting Grinder.
1	I should like to know how you speed; though, mind!
1	But they got through the Act with great self-possession; and Mr. Sleary, saving for the first instant, conveyed no more expression into his locomotive eye than into his fixed one.
1	As though he had been called into existence, like a fabulous Familiar, by a magic spell which had failed when required to dismiss him, he stuck tight to Mr. Grewgious’s stool, although Mr. Grewgious’s comfort and convenience would manifestly have been advanced by dispossessing him.
1	I am a spirit.” “And pray, what do you want here?” faltered the tenant.
1	The swift sharp agony struck through him, as he thought of what his son might do.
1	The most comfortable of all the hotels of which I had any experience in the United States, and they were not a few, is Barnum’s, in that city: where the English traveller will find curtains to his bed, for the first and probably the last time in America (this is a disinterested remark, for I never use them); and where he will be likely to have enough water for washing himself, which is not at all a common case.
1	‘And then,’ said the Captain, in his hoarse whisper, and tapping Mr Toots on the chest with the back of his hand, and falling from him with a look of infinite admiration, ‘what follers?
1	At the ceremony Cousin Feenix is depressed, observing, that these are the occasions to make a man think, in point of fact, that he is getting shaky; and his eyes are really moistened, when it is over.
1	It was a cold, dark night.
1	He was greatly excited, horribly fevered, bit his nails down to the quick, spoke in a hard rattling voice, and with lips that were black and burnt up.
1	‘Don’t you see, Lawyer Lightwood?
1	When the ‘three kidney ones,’ which were to be a blind to the conversation, were set before them on three little tin platters, each kidney one ornamented with a hole at the top, into which the civil man poured hot gravy out of a spouted can as if he were feeding three lamps, Flora took out her pocket-handkerchief.
1	There was a chest of drawers with an escritoire top, for Uriah to read or write at of an evening; there was Uriah’s blue bag lying down and vomiting papers; there was a company of Uriah’s books commanded by Mr. Tidd; there was a corner cupboard: and there were the usual articles of furniture.
1	‘Do not talk so,’ said the child.
1	'No,' he said, smiting the table with his fist, 'I do not.
1	The lady of the caravan was in the act of gathering her tea equipage together preparatory to clearing the table, but noting the child’s anxious manner she hesitated and stopped.
1	‘Except that when Pancks told us of your having embarked in this business and with difficulty persuaded us that it was really you I said to Mr F.’s Aunt then we would come and ask you if it would be agreeable to all parties that she should be engaged at our house when required for I know she often goes to your mama’s and I know that your mama has a very touchy temper Arthur--Doyce and Clennam--or I never might have married Mr F. and might have been at this hour but I am running into nonsense.’ ‘It was very kind of you, Flora, to think of this.’ Poor Flora rejoined with a plain sincerity which became her better than her youngest glances, that she was glad he thought so.
1	We have got at the right address at last, though it is written in strange characters truly, and might have been scrawled with the blunt handle of the spade the writer better knows the use of, than a pen.
1	It makes my heart beat,' added Oliver in a low voice, 'as if it was alive, and wanted to speak to me, but couldn't.'
1	Much of my unassisted self, and more by the help of Biddy than of Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt, I struggled through the alphabet as if it had been a bramble-bush; getting considerably worried and scratched by every letter.
1	"I am not acquainted with those shades of names myself, but in a general way I object to the breed."
1	But he knew that he had been sitting a long time by candle-light, when he started up and listened, in a sudden terror.
1	At last Mr. Micawber’s difficulties came to a crisis, and he was arrested early one morning, and carried over to the King’s Bench Prison in the Borough.
1	By a letter in a St. Louis paper of the ‘4th, we notice a terrible     outrage at Burlington, Iowa.
1	He was deadly pale; and the whole place seemed turning round and round.
1	On every piece of waste or common ground, some small gambler drove his noisy trade, and bellowed to the idle passersby to stop and try their chance; the crowd grew thicker and more noisy; gilt gingerbread in blanket-stalls exposed its glories to the dust; and often a four-horse carriage, dashing by, obscured all objects in the gritty cloud it raised, and left them, stunned and blinded, far behind.
1	His further consideration of the point was prevented by Richard's coming back to us in an excited state and hastily representing Mr. Vholes--a sallow man with pinched lips that looked as if they were cold, a red eruption here and there upon his face, tall and thin, about fifty years of age, high-shouldered, and stooping.
1	I wouldn’t answer perhaps,’ he murmured, as if he were only thinking it, ‘for more than one.’ A dangerous quality, if real; and a not less dangerous one, if feigned.
1	I have better than got it, John!’ They were not the less happy for such talk, and home was not the less home for coming after it.
1	The old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a moment, and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve; whereupon, the last-mentioned old gentleman woke up.
1	Richard's entrance stopped the conversation.
1	I--had better ask Doctor Peps if he’ll have the goodness to step upstairs again perhaps.
1	But the truth is, he looked upon the inquiry as a liberty, and said, “What was that to me?” It was then I became quite aware I was intruding: of which I had been fearful before.
1	‘He is hard to me sometimes,’ returned Uriah.
1	I would say that for her, if I was put upon my trial before a Court of Justice.’ ‘Well!
1	The first we've both got; the second you must find us.'
1	‘Thank you,’ said the doctor, ‘thank you.
1	These gifts Mrs Sprodgkin accepted, but still insisted on dutifully remaining in the hall, to curtsey to the Reverend Frank as he came forth.
1	No, because he takes care on her, like a brother, arter dark, and indeed afore dark, and at all times.
1	He crosses with her and begs.
1	If I judged harshly of other people’s mistakes in marriage, it may have been because I had bitter reason to judge harshly of my own.
1	When it comes regularly before this Department, then you must watch it from time to time through this Department.
1	Then, the sea fell, and the dying voice made another feeble effort, and then the sea rose high, and beat its life out, and lashed the roof, and surged among the arches, and pierced the heights of the great tower; and then the sea was dry, and all was still.
1	I give Pirrip as my father's family name, on the authority of his tombstone and my sister,--Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith.
1	My aunt, with whom she gradually became familiar, always called her Little Blossom; and the pleasure of Miss Lavinia’s life was to wait upon her, curl her hair, make ornaments for her, and treat her like a pet child.
1	I assign a separate chapter to this visit; not because I am about to describe it at any great length, but because I remember it as a thing by itself, and am desirous that my readers should do the same.
1	It is for your sake that I wish you to have a--ha--truly refined mind, and (in the striking words of Mrs General) to be ignorant of everything that is not perfectly proper, placid, and pleasant.’ He had been running down by jerks, during his last speech, like a sort of ill-adjusted alarum.
1	What is curious about him is that he sits forward on his chair as if he were, from long habit, allowing space for some dress or accoutrements that he has altogether laid aside.
1	But who can see her as I have seen, who can know what her life has been, and not love her?
1	But at night it had come on to rain in torrents, and all night long it had rained without cessation.
1	I never shall forget that night.
1	He had a hook nose, handsome after its kind, but too high between the eyes by probably just as much as his eyes were too near to one another.
1	‘His impudence, Mr Swiviller!’ said Miss Jane, tossing her head.
1	He gave the name of Brooker.’ ‘I know he did,’ said Ralph; ‘what then?’ ‘What then?
1	yes!--Agnes, sitting on the seat before me, in the same box, with a lady and gentleman beside her, whom I didn’t know.
1	His own words are, that they will clear, or nearly clear, the House, and that no one can lose much.
1	‘Leave the room, Sir.’ ‘Off directly,’ said the unabashed Jingle.
1	In this favourable position of affairs, Noah rose from the ground, and pommelled him behind.
1	Down stairs, therefore, Kit went; and at the bottom of the stairs there was such a kitchen as was never before seen or heard of out of a toy-shop window, with everything in it as bright and glowing, and as precisely ordered too, as Barbara herself.
1	They have passed the outer wall, and stand in the open air--in the street he has so often pictured to himself when hemmed in by the gloomy stones, and which has been in all his dreams.
1	He is happy, and in heaven now.
1	Mr. Squeers sat himself down on the opposite seat to the unfortunate Smike, and, planting his hands firmly on his knees, looked at him for some five minutes, when, seeming to recover from his trance, he uttered a loud laugh, and slapped his old pupil’s face several times--taking the right and left sides alternately.
1	Having read it twice by a great effort, he turns it down so that it shall not be seen and lies moaning.
1	‘I couldn’t desire a more genuine and genial welcome.’ ‘Couldn’t you, though?’ said Mr Toots, still shaking his hand.
1	‘She is right on one point at all events,’ said the old gentleman cheerfully.
1	We went in at the door, which stood open, and into a gloomy room with a low ceiling, on the ground-floor at the back.
1	‘Not much, my dear,’ returned the schoolmaster.
1	‘Well, you look rosy enough, my young friend,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	‘We shall hear something of the fugitives.’ After a lapse of five minutes, consumed in incessant knocking and shouting, an old man in his shirt and trousers emerged from the turnpike-house, and opened the gate.
1	A penny loaf was all they had had that day.
1	'He seems in high spirits and happy,' she said, at length.
1	It was sufficient to know that while they were proceeding, the concourse without still lingered round the house; that boys beat upon the drum with their fists, and imitated Punch with their tender voices; that the office-window was rendered opaque by flattened noses, and the key-hole of the street-door luminous with eyes; that every time the single gentleman or either of his guests was seen at the upper window, or so much as the end of one of their noses was visible, there was a great shout of execration from the excluded mob, who remained howling and yelling, and refusing consolation, until the exhibitors were delivered up to them to be attended elsewhere.
1	The general supposition was that he had committed suicide, and, this appearing to be favoured by all the circumstances of his death, the verdict was to that effect.
1	He stands before her with one hand on a chair-back and the other in his old-fashioned waistcoat and shirt-frill, exactly as he has stood before her at any time since her marriage.
1	I read in it, that I was appointed to do these things.
1	Nancy, appearing much gratified thereby, saluted him cordially.
1	He looked very good-natured and prepossessing, though overpoweringly gay and free, in contrast with the squalid prison.
1	‘That and the bottle are enough for you to carry,’ he says, giving it to Durdles; ‘hand your bundle to me; I am younger and longer-winded than you.’  Durdles hesitates for a moment between bundle and bottle; but gives the preference to the bottle as being by far the better company, and consigns the dry weight to his fellow-explorer.
1	When Mr. Rouncewell's townsman heard of the disclosure, he no more allowed the girl to be patronized and honoured than he would have suffered her to be trodden underfoot before his eyes.
1	Got the books there?’ ‘They are here, sir.’ ‘All right.
1	Now Agnes, my dear, let us attend to these affairs.’ ‘I must do Mr. Micawber the justice to say,’ Traddles began, ‘that although he would appear not to have worked to any good account for himself, he is a most untiring man when he works for other people.
1	By doing all for the best, I hope I may wear them out.’ ‘And wear out too,’ said Bella soothingly, ‘this weakness, Lizzie, in favour of one who is not worthy of it.’ ‘No.
1	repeated Ada as if she were afraid of the name.
1	Try that once, and come to ruin--ruin--ruin!’ ‘Oh dear, dear, I shall never try it,’ said Arthur Gride, appalled by the mention of the word, ‘not for the world.
1	“That I’ll never be a party to the combination o’ the butchers, to keep up the price o’ meat,” says he.
1	The calculations and entries, in his own hand, of which there were many, were bluntly written, and with no very neat precision; but were always plain and directed straight to the purpose.
1	Be sure you always speak well of father.
1	I will not repeat what I said to Richard.
1	‘Then at once you confess yourself desirous to come to terms, do you Boffin?
1	"Chesney Wold, Thomas," rejoins the housekeeper with proud complacency, "will set my Lady up!
1	'This is great happiness to me, great happiness.
1	But I could not help observing that he seemed to think he had hit upon a wonderful expedient for expressing himself in a neat, agreeable, and pointed manner, without the inconvenience of inventing conversation.
1	It was the same with the groves of deserted bedsteads I peeped at, on my way to, and when I was in, my own bed.
1	She said, no, no, no, she could only speak to me so; she must be proud and disdainful everywhere else; she would be humbled and ashamed there, in the only natural moments of her life.
1	On a table near her is a rich bauble of a casket, barred and clasped like an old strong-chest.
1	Our ashes, at a future period, will probably be found commingled in the cemetery attached to a venerable pile, for which the spot to which I refer has acquired a reputation, shall I say from China to Peru?
1	We got ashore among some slippery stones while we ate and drank what we had with us, and looked about.
1	That gentleman was standing with his back to the fire, and his hands under his coat-tails, looking over his white cravat, as unpromisingly as Mr Dombey himself could have looked.
1	When it had climbed higher into the sky, and there was warmth in its cheerful beams, they laid them down to sleep, upon a bank, hard by some water.
1	In the Preface to its next successor, Little Dorrit, I have still to repeat the same words.
1	Dresses, less splendid than the dress she wore, and half-packed trunks, were scattered about.
1	You see the truth is,’ said Traddles, in a whisper, ‘he had changed his name to Mortimer, in consequence of his temporary embarrassments; and he don’t come out till after dark--and then in spectacles.
1	‘That noble dog?’ ‘Faith, dear ladies!’ said Blandois, smiling and shrugging his shoulders, ‘somebody has poisoned that noble dog.
1	Perhaps it impressed me the more then, because it was new to me, but it certainly did not tend to exalt my opinion of, or to strengthen my confidence in, Mr. Jack Maldon.
1	‘Robbers!’ shouted Mr. Pickwick, breaking from Lowten and Perker, and thrusting his head out of the staircase window.
1	You have been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever become acquainted with.
1	You do too much.’ ‘I wish I could do more.’ ‘I know you do, but you overtask your strength.
1	Such changes appear absurd; but they are not so unnatural as they would seem at first sight.
1	While he was thus engaged, Kit made some anxious inquiries about his employers, and whether they had expressed any opinion concerning him; but all he could learn was that Mr Abel had himself broken the intelligence to his mother, with great kindness and delicacy, late on the previous night, but had himself expressed no opinion of his innocence or guilt.
1	Looking down, she recognised Kit, whose endeavours to attract her attention had roused her from her sad reflections.
1	‘His will is found,’ said Mortimer, catching Mrs Podsnap’s rocking-horse’s eye.
1	His favourite and faithful housekeeper stands at his bedside.
1	Will you please come to the understanding that there must be another interview under more favourable circumstances, before the whole case can be submitted?’ ‘I don’t,’ said Lizzie, shaking her head, ‘understand your meaning, Mr Headstone.’ ‘Limit my meaning for the present,’ he interrupted, ‘to the whole case being submitted to you in another interview.’ ‘What case, Mr Headstone?
1	‘You are surprised to see me, Mr Clennam,’ he said, taking the seat which Clennam offered him.
1	Here the rain began to fall so heavily, that it roused him.
1	Step in--Mr Clennam, I think this is the gentleman I was mentioning.’ This gentleman explained the object of his visit to be ‘a tyfling madder ob bithznithz,’ and executed his legal function.
1	The soles had shed themselves bit by bit, and the upper leathers had broken and burst until the very shape and form of shoes had departed from them.
1	Doyce was to go to Southampton to join the small staff of his fellow-travellers; and a coach was at the gate, well furnished and packed, and ready to take him there.
1	This possessed him with the idea that, perhaps, Peg Sliderskew had been apprehended for the robbery, and that Mr. Squeers, being with her at the time, had been apprehended also, on suspicion of being a confederate.
1	They’re not taught at schools or colleges, and we don’t know how to set about it.
1	Who the devil is he?
1	‘Small craft, Mr Toots, but serviceable to my boy!’ ‘Exactly so,’ says Mr Toots.
1	"Quite right, and quite true."
1	But he had not written half-a-dozen words when, reaching over to the inkstand to take a fresh dip, he happened to raise his eyes.
1	‘Mr Wobbler?’ inquired the suitor.
1	Mr. Lorry got his arm securely round the daughter's waist, and held her; for he felt that she was sinking.
1	"Oh, yes, his family is all very fine, Miss Summerson," replied Miss Jellyby; "but what comfort is his family to him?
1	The Doctor had taken care that it should be there--had assured him that it would be there--and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced and read.
1	A wild beast would have been easier turned or soothed than the grave gentleman without a wrinkle in his starched cravat.
1	When we add that the weather-beaten signboard bore the half- obliterated semblance of a magpie intently eyeing a crooked streak of brown paint, which the neighbours had been taught from infancy to consider as the ‘stump,’ we have said all that need be said of the exterior of the edifice.
1	They are good enough to maintain a number of delightful objects for the admiration and pleasure of us poor men; and not to reap all the admiration and pleasure that they yield is to be ungrateful to our benefactors."
1	Not a misfortune in our natural state I dare say, but we are not in a natural state.
1	There is my fidelity to my dear boy after death.
1	Little Dorrit turned at the door to say, ‘God bless you!’ She said it very softly, but perhaps she may have been as audible above--who knows!--as a whole cathedral choir.
1	Finding Nicholas bent upon quitting the society--for he had now determined that, even if no further tidings came from Newman, he would, at all hazards, ease his mind by repairing to London and ascertaining the exact position of his sister--Mr. Crummles was fain to content himself by calculating the chances of his coming back again, and taking prompt and energetic measures to make the most of him before he went away.
1	A certain cold proud man, well known there, was not there, nor was he represented there.
1	The trooper needs to look at him and to separate this sound from that sound before he knows what he has said, but doing this and being a little helped by his mother, he replies, "I must have a very bad memory, indeed, Sir Leicester, if I failed to remember you."
1	The advance from a personal acquaintance with the elder Mr Chivery to an introduction to his amiable wife and disconsolate son, may have been easy; but easy or not, Mr Pancks soon made it.
1	Ask him, is that so.” “It is so,” assented Defarge once more.
1	Mrs. Sparsit’s tea was just set for her on a pert little table, with its tripod of legs in an attitude, which she insinuated after office-hours, into the company of the stern, leathern-topped, long board-table that bestrode the middle of the room.
1	‘You don’t live here alone; do you, Miss?’ asked Sloppy.
1	‘Now!’ Up struck the two fiddles and the one harp, and off went Mr. Pickwick into hands across, when there was a general clapping of hands, and a cry of ‘Stop, stop!’ ‘What’s the matter?’ said Mr. Pickwick, who was only brought to, by the fiddles and harp desisting, and could have been stopped by no other earthly power, if the house had been on fire.
1	He goes a short way, turns back, comes again to the shop of Mr. Krook, and enters it straight.
1	I was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to him with both hands, and said, “If you would kindly please to let me keep upright, sir, perhaps I shouldn't be sick, and perhaps I could attend more.” He gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the church jumped over its own weathercock.
1	It rained now, in a sheet of water.
1	‘Dear Mr. Jingle was not deceiving me.
1	‘Take your own way, mother; share as you please in what you have gained; spend, enjoy, make much of it; and be as happy as you will.
1	Please to ask for _Mrs_ Chivery!’ These instructions, Mr Chivery, who had already let him out, cautiously called through a little slide in the outer door, which he could draw back from within for the inspection of visitors when it pleased him.
1	He turned it off into a yawn, but it began as a yell.
1	“My son, sir,” said the old man, after securing the drawbridge, “rather had it in his mind that you might happen to drop in, and he left word that he would soon be home from his afternoon's walk.
1	But his greatest trials were in the churchyard, which had the appearance of a primeval forest, with a kind of small ecclesiastical wash-house on one side, and a turnpike gate on the other.
1	‘No offence to anybody, Mr. Wickfield.
1	"That," observes Sir Leicester with unspeakable grandeur, for he thinks the ironmaster a little too glib, "must be quite unnecessary."
1	You may be more right there.
1	The gentleman sat down there, drew his chair to the table over against her, and said, in a voice that perfectly corresponded to his appearance, and with a simplicity that was very engaging: ‘Miss Harriet, you cannot be proud.
1	I have associated it, ever since, with the sunny street of Canterbury, dozing as it were in the hot light; and with the sight of its old houses and gateways, and the stately, grey Cathedral, with the rooks sailing round the towers.
1	'We must know how he gets on to-day, by some handy means or other,' said Fagin.
1	'You see,' pursued Mr. Brownlow; 'placing this poor girl entirely out of the question, and supposing it were possible to bring these scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety, what good should we bring about?'
1	‘If it hadn’t been mercifully brought about, that I was to have you to speak to,’ pursued Rachael, ‘times are, when I think my mind would not have kept right.
1	‘I place my reliance on your improved sense of duty, and more correct feeling, and better reflection, Madam,’ said Mr Dombey.
1	She’d do her any kindness in private.
1	Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against the wall.
1	"Exactly so, sir," returned Mr. George, folding his arms upon his breast with perfect self-possession and a little curiosity.
1	If I’m not at home, let any man ask for me at the stage-door.
1	Mr. Pickwick walked on abstractedly, crossed opposite the Mansion House, and bent his steps up Cheapside.
1	‘I could take my oath to that ‘ere black hair and mulberry suit,’ said Mr. Weller; ‘only I never see such a face as that afore.’ As Mr. Weller said this, the man’s features assumed an unearthly twinge, perfectly hideous.
1	And so I told her I had been a poor child myself, and it was according to parishes.
1	How dare you talk about anything else till you have been wished many happy returns of the day, Tim Linkinwater?
1	Will you try him, Miss Nell?
1	‘A dull old house,’ he said, ‘and a monotonous life; but I must have her near me.
1	Her passing through the trial was to make the man she loved with all her heart, triumphant.
1	They could tell, by what she faintly uttered in her dreams, that they were of her journeyings with the old man; they were of no painful scenes, but of people who had helped and used them kindly, for she often said ‘God bless you!’ with great fervour.
1	‘How did this happen?’ he cried, looking wildly about him.
1	‘No, no--oh, not there,’ replied Job, with a quickness very unusual to him, ‘not there.’ ‘What was you a-doin’ there?’ asked Sam, with a sharp glance.
1	His hand shakes, he is nervous, and it falls off.
1	It’s not work, cutting out a pattern isn’t,’ said Miss Jenny, with her busy little scissors already snipping at some paper.
1	‘If you say it’s true, of course I shall,’ said Mr. Tupman.
1	It seemed that I had not been expected so soon, the carrier being much before his usual time.
1	He learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep, from which she would waken, either to recovery and life, or to bid them farewell, and die.
1	'Give him a little air!'
1	I beg your pardon though,’ said Mr Toots, looking up in the Captain’s face as he sat down in a chair by the fire, which the Captain placed for him; ‘you don’t happen to know the Chicken at all; do you, Mr Gills?’ ‘The Chicken?’ said the Captain.
1	We want no babies here,’ said Mr. Kenwigs recklessly.
1	We’ll put up this here deadlight, and take a double turn on the key!’ With these words, the Captain, using his one hand and his hook with the greatest dexterity, got out the shutter of the door, put it up, made it all fast, and locked the door itself.
1	‘There is not,’ said Mr Podsnap, flushing angrily, ‘there is not a country in the world, sir, where so noble a provision is made for the poor as in this country.’ The meek man was quite willing to concede that, but perhaps it rendered the matter even worse, as showing that there must be something appallingly wrong somewhere.
1	Got an engagement at the theayter, with his father, to play the fife in a military piece."
1	The Major then took a very polished and chivalrous farewell of both ladies, which the elder one acknowledged in her usual manner, while the younger, sitting with her face addressed to the window, bent her head so slightly that it would have been a greater compliment to the Major to have made no sign at all, and to have left him to infer that he had not been heard or thought of.
1	‘Have you ever been there?’ ‘No.’ ‘Oh!
1	It was not easy to make out Little Dorrit’s face; she was so retiring, plied her needle in such removed corners, and started away so scared if encountered on the stairs.
1	Did you ever hear a definition of fame, sir?’ ‘I have heard several,’ replied Nicholas, with a smile.
1	Do I never read how they are put off, put off, put off--how they are grudged, grudged, grudged, the shelter, or the doctor, or the drop of physic, or the bit of bread?
1	Do you think you could find your way to Golden Square first?’ ‘Certainly,’ said Nicholas.
1	But in the height of the confusion, a mounted man galloped away to order the relays, and our horses were put to with great speed.
1	‘Go away, go away!’ ‘Come down,’ said Ralph, beckoning him.
1	Not relaxing his own gaze on the fire, but rather strengthening it with a fierce, firm grip upon his elbow-chair, the elder sits for a few moments rigid, and then, with thick drops standing on his forehead, and a sharp catch of his breath, becomes as he was before.
1	Also, I see that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves with them as they come, tramp, tramp!
1	‘But neither is his late partner, whom he denounces, a prepossessing person.
1	Now although Mr. Bucket walks upstairs to the little library within the larger one with the face of a man who receives some scores of letters every day, it happens that much correspondence is not incidental to his life.
1	But not to remain long absent; for Cook, who has the reputation of being extremely good-hearted, says, whatever they do, let ‘em stand by one another now, Towlinson, for there’s no telling how soon they may be divided.
1	‘How he would bother the commissioners!
1	The ceiling of his room is rather low; and the upper part of the door, which is opposite the window, is of glass.
1	A bow gone!’) ‘Morning, morning, morning!’ ‘Appears to be rather a ‘arty old cock, too,’ said Mr Wegg, as before; ‘Good morning to YOU, sir.’ ‘Do you remember me, then?’ asked his new acquaintance, stopping in his amble, one-sided, before the stall, and speaking in a pounding way, though with great good-humour.
1	Mr Dombey, with his bride upon his arm, conducts her through the twenty families of little women who are on the steps, and every one of whom remembers the fashion and the colour of her every article of dress from that moment, and reproduces it on her doll, who is for ever being married.
1	After a short consultation with Dodson & Fogg, the learned Serjeant again turned towards Sam, and said, with a painful effort to conceal his vexation, ‘Now, Mr. Weller, I’ll ask you a question on another point, if you please.’ ‘If you please, Sir,’ rejoined Sam, with the utmost good-humour.
1	‘Shall I e’er forget it, mun?’ replied John Browdie.
1	‘With,’ returned the man, pointing backward over his right shoulder with his right thumb, ‘the T’other Governor?’ ‘I don’t know what you mean.’ ‘Why look here,’ hooking his proposition on his left-hand fingers with the forefinger of his right.
1	It appeared to be something interesting, for every one was pushing and striving to get nearer.
1	"If Mr. Carstone was to give his full mind to it, he would come out very good."
1	Drowned!’ So saying, he blew out the candle, kicked off his shoes, and groped his way up stairs; leaving his delighted young friend in an ecstasy of summersets on the pavement.
1	I demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay.
1	He’s as welcome as flowers in May, or coals at Christmas.
1	I must go home for good.’ ‘Now, don’t be silly,’ Mr Boffin reasoned.
1	‘He has gone.’ ‘I know it,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘and I will follow him.’ ‘Follow him!
1	But, these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach itself from old companions and associations, though enabled to fix itself steadily on one object, and resolved not to be turned aside by any consideration.
1	In those times this young lady was a mere child.
1	He knew my society to be--hum--sought, and his plea might be that he regarded me in the light of a public character.
1	“Hulks!” Joe gave a reproachful cough, as much as to say, “Well, I told you so.” “And please, what's Hulks?” said I.
1	You don’t feel like me, Dan’l; thinks don’t go contrary with you, nor you with them; you had better do it yourself.’ But here Peggotty, who had been going about from one to another in a hurried way, kissing everybody, called out from the cart, in which we all were by this time (Em’ly and I on two little chairs, side by side), that Mrs. Gummidge must do it.
1	To think that I should be drinking his very rum!
1	'She'll take the luggage upstairs the while.
1	‘I happen to know that she is, ma’am,’ said Ralph.
1	Agnes set the glasses and decanters in the same corner, and Mr. Wickfield sat down to drink, and drank a good deal.
1	However, I heard so repeatedly, in the course of our goings to and fro, of a certain Number Twenty Seven, who was the Favourite, and who really appeared to be a Model Prisoner, that I resolved to suspend my judgement until I should see Twenty Seven.
1	This was delightful, and gladdening to the heart of Nathaniel Pipkin.
1	“My wife,” said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: “I have travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called Jacques.
1	Having written to Joe, to offer him consolation, and to assure him that I would come to the funeral, I passed the intermediate days in the curious state of mind I have glanced at.
1	At last, one day the old gen’l’m’n was a-rollin’ along, and he sees a pickpocket as he know’d by sight, a-coming up, arm in arm with a little boy with a wery large head.
1	Mr. Bucket lost no time in transferring this paper, with the dexterity of a conjuror, from Mr. Smallweed to Mr. Jarndyce.
1	Not an instant, my dears!'
1	And I also told you, if you remember, that I was up to the gold spoon look-out.’ ‘I were not up to ’t myseln, sir; I do assure yo.’ ‘Now it’s clear to me,’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘that you are one of those chaps who have always got a grievance.
1	He was overjoyed to have it all arranged and settled next day before noon; and to sit down at evening in the little back parlour with old Sol and Captain Cuttle; and to see the Instrument-maker already reviving, and hopeful for the future, and feeling that the wooden Midshipman was his own again.
1	I looked at him anxiously when we stopped to change, but I knew by his yet graver face as he stood watching the ostlers that he had heard nothing.
1	Think of the pitch-dark nights, the roaring winds, and rolling seas:’ ‘The thunder, lightning, rain, hail, storm of all kinds,’ said the boy.
1	This led us to speak of Mr. Catlin’s gallery, which he praised highly: observing that his own portrait was among the collection, and that all the likenesses were ‘elegant.’  Mr. Cooper, he said, had painted the Red Man well; and so would I, he knew, if I would go home with him and hunt buffaloes, which he was quite anxious I should do.
1	But I know she's got it.
1	We are going to walk with you.
1	cries Mr. Smallweed in a shrill loud voice.
1	I would not forward it, unless I feared the worst.'
1	Miss Twinkleton’s companion in both states of existence, and equally adaptable to either, is one Mrs. Tisher: a deferential widow with a weak back, a chronic sigh, and a suppressed voice, who looks after the young ladies’ wardrobes, and leads them to infer that she has seen better days.
1	You feel quite at home here again, I dare say?
1	Little recked Mr Podsnap of the traps and toils besetting his Young Person.
1	At first, his mind reverted to Defarge, and he thought of finding out the wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city.
1	If people find I have any about me that fit ’em, they can put ’em on and wear ’em, if they like.
1	'You were not awake an hour ago?'
1	The way in which you are resolved and determined to disgrace us on all occasions, is really infamous.
1	If you’ll go your way, we’ll go ours, and so I hope this affair ends to the satisfaction of all parties.’ Mrs Lammle gave him the look of a decidedly dissatisfied party demanding exemption from the category; but said nothing.
1	The stumping approach of Wegg was soon heard behind it, and as it turned upon its hinges he became visible with his hand on the lock.
1	He may sleep on now.
1	“No it doesn't; I assure you it doesn't.
1	Loo,’ but never ‘Lee!’ until we are reduced to the very last extremity, and are in the midst of difficulties, extrication from which appears to be all but impossible.
1	‘Where?’ ‘Mr Clennam,’ returned Mrs Tickit, ‘I was a little heavy in my eyes, being that I was waiting longer than customary for my cup of tea which was then preparing by Mary Jane.
1	I don't think I should have done so, if I had been Miss Havisham.
1	But Coodle knew the danger, and Doodle knew the danger, and all their followers and hangers-on had the clearest possible perception of the danger.
1	He might have read in that one glance that even for its sordid and mercenary influence upon herself, she spurned it, while she claimed its utmost power as her right, her bargain--as the base and worthless recompense for which she had become his wife.
1	Good morning!’ ‘I may depend upon your promptitude, dearest Mr Fledgeby?’ Said Fledgeby, looking back at the door and respectfully kissing his hand, ‘You may depend upon it.’ In fact, Mr Fledgeby sped on his errand of mercy through the streets, at so brisk a rate that his feet might have been winged by all the good spirits that wait on Generosity.
1	You cannot proceed in this affair, Slammer--impossible!’ ‘Quite!’ said the dignified Payne.
1	He had been apprised that the final hour was Three, and he knew he would be summoned some time earlier, inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily and slowly through the streets.
1	You’ve come at last, have you?’ ‘Why have you not sent to me?’ said Ralph.
1	There were certainly no policemen to soothe startled horses, either by sawing at their bridles or flourishing truncheons in their eyes; and I am ready to make oath that no inoffensive persons were knocked violently on the head, or poked acutely in their backs or stomachs; or brought to a standstill by any such gentle means, and then taken into custody for not moving on.
1	I was very young, and had no adviser.
1	Now, I have had an idea, Mortimer, of taking myself and my wife to one of the colonies, and working at my vocation there.’ ‘I should be lost without you, Eugene; but you may be right.’ ‘No,’ said Eugene, emphatically.
1	It was the Parrot, you know.
1	Yet it is an indubitable fact, within the cognizance of this history, that five minutes after he had left the house in the self-same hat, the same descendant of the Scadgerses and connexion by matrimony of the Powlers, shook her right-hand mitten at his portrait, made a contemptuous grimace at that work of art, and said ‘Serve you right, you Noodle, and I am glad of it.’ Mr. Bounderby had not been long gone, when Bitzer appeared.
1	He unbolted the door, called in the bearers, wished us good morning, and with a look full of meaning and a crook of his finger at parting went his way.
1	So when the trooper reappears with his, "Hadn't you better go to bed, miss?"
1	seemed to be made public property on, now, and that every man seemed to think himself free to handle his name as if it was a Street Pump.’ The purport of the meditating was: ‘Here is an instrument.
1	‘Is Morfin here?’ asked Mr Dombey after a short pause, during which Mr Carker had been fluttering his papers, and muttering little abstracts of their contents to himself.
1	Still, the same quiet life went on at the little cottage, and the same cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates.
1	The sergeant ran in first, when we had run the noise quite down, and two of his men ran in close upon him.
1	I don’t mean to be reproachful either.
1	Her gleesome voice and merry laugh were the sweetest music of their home.
1	You would have supposed that I was showing her some wonderful inventions, by her study of them; and if you had seen her, whenever I jingled my housekeeping keys, get up and attend me, certainly you might have thought that there never was a greater imposter than I with a blinder follower than Caddy Jellyby.
1	Yet, what was to be done?
1	You are quite sure of that before we go any further.’ ‘Sir, I am sure on ’t.’ ‘Here’s a gentleman from London present,’ Mr. Bounderby made a backhanded point at Mr. James Harthouse with his thumb, ‘a Parliament gentleman.
1	That miserable man would seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors, when far removed from the scenes of his old offences, and to have lived a peaceable and honest life.
1	His sister, Betsey Trotwood, never would have run away.’ My aunt shook her head firmly, confident in the character and behaviour of the girl who never was born.
1	I tell you, my good Esther, when he and I were on those terms which he found so convenient, we were not on natural terms."
1	Ugly, misshapen, peevish, ill-conditioned, ragged, dirty--but beloved!
1	Our conference was held in the state parlor, which was feebly lighted by one candle.
1	Dependants, to respect us, must be--ha--kept at a distance and--hum--kept down.
1	asked the woman, resting herself against a bank, and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face.
1	D'ye hear?” “I warn't doing no harm,” Young Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek.
1	'And candles,' replied Mrs. Corney, slightly returning the pressure.
1	But he let it go, and it closed with a loud noise.
1	"It draws," says Jo, "as heavy as a cart."
1	He shall not, through any suppression of mine, be informed of a part of it, and kept in ignorance of another part of it.
1	He fervently replied that indeed indeed they would have been.
1	She wondered what he was thinking of, as he looked at Maggy and her.
1	"I was saying, what do you think NOW," pursues Mr. Guppy, "of enlisting?"
1	“Would it be much out of the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two towers?” “No, miss,” answered Mr. Cruncher.
1	They had run from drunkards.
1	Talking all the way, he followed Mr. Giles upstairs; and while he is going upstairs, the reader may be informed, that Mr. Losberne, a surgeon in the neighbourhood, known through a circuit of ten miles round as 'the doctor,' had grown fat, more from good-humour than from good living:  and was as kind and hearty, and withal as eccentric an old bachelor, as will be found in five times that space, by any explorer alive.
1	‘What’s to do here, thou yoong dogs?’ ‘Squeers is in prison, and we are going to run away!’ cried a score of shrill voices.
1	I said I never would believe that it was your doing.’ ‘That was right!’ said the child eagerly.
1	But if he had any taste for walking, or should wish at any time to break into a trot, he might sometimes find it a little difficult to keep step with your mother.
1	‘Indeed, sir,’ said I, ‘her affairs are so changed, that I wished to ask you whether it would be possible--at a sacrifice on our part of some portion of the premium, of course,’ I put in this, on the spur of the moment, warned by the blank expression of his face--‘to cancel my articles?’ What it cost me to make this proposal, nobody knows.
1	But, your bringing-up was different from mine; mine was a real thing, by George!
1	As it is, I don’t think I can do with anythin’ under a female markis.
1	And it surely cannot be a little thing that causes you so much uneasiness.
1	"Do you wish to hold any conversation with me in private?"
1	I was willing to do anything to relieve Mr. James from his difficulty, and to restore harmony between himself and an affectionate parent, who has undergone so much on his account.
1	One young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his cap for him; and another was so obliging as to put his hands in his pockets, in order that, as he was very tired, he might not have the trouble of emptying them, himself, when he went to bed.
1	Her cold supreme indifference--his own unquestioned attribute usurped--stung him more than any other kind of treatment could have done; and he determined to bend her to his magnificent and stately will.
1	He was a gaunt, sallow young man, with hollow cheeks, and a chin almost as black as Mr. Murdstone’s; but there the likeness ended, for his whiskers were shaved off, and his hair, instead of being glossy, was rusty and dry.
1	"But I don't ask what you think of myself; I ask what you think of the prison."
1	She looked up in Tom’s face, and smiled through her tears.
1	‘She will speak differently in a little time.’ I don’t know what he would have said in answer.
1	Physician’s knock astonished Bar; but, as he immediately suspected that somebody had come to tell him that somebody else was robbing him, or otherwise trying to get the better of him, he came down promptly and softly.
1	Here, also, Mr Wegg instantly underwent the remarkable experience of having his hat twitched off his head and thrown out of a window, which was opened and shut for the purpose.
1	But you know what I know, Jack, and it may not be so very easy as it seems, after all.
1	As often as Mr Dorrit let down the glass and looked back at him (which was very often), he saw him smoking John Chivery out, it is true, but still generally standing up the while and looking about him, like a man who had his suspicions, and kept upon his guard.
1	There was a sudden bump--a loud crash- -away rolled a wheel, and over went the chaise.
1	So with the churchyard on a branch of the solitary way to the night’s sleeping-place.
1	The lady turned aside her head.
1	But can I permit the film of a silly proceeding on the part of Caddy (from whom I expect nothing else) to interpose between me and the great African continent?
1	But, the watchful little dressmaker had been vigilant as ever in her watch, and she now came up and touched Lightwood’s arm as he looked down at his friend, despairingly.
1	If he mean this ironically, it may be truer than he thinks.
1	No, no, no,’ cried the old woman, shaking her head and laughing; for her daughter had started up, ‘not now; it’s too far off; it’s by the milestone, where the stones are heaped;--to-morrow, deary, if it’s fine, and you are in the humour.
1	What material?’ ‘Fanny,’ returned Mrs General, ‘at present forms too many opinions.
1	good gracious Arthur!--pray excuse me--old habit--Mr Clennam far more proper--what a country to live in for so long a time, and with so many lanterns and umbrellas too how very dark and wet the climate ought to be and no doubt actually is, and the sums of money that must be made by those two trades where everybody carries them and hangs them everywhere, the little shoes too and the feet screwed back in infancy is quite surprising, what a traveller you are!’ In his ridiculous distress, Clennam received another of the old glances without in the least knowing what to do with it.
1	"I am sorry to learn that the same state of mind has got this Gridley into new troubles and that he is in hiding," said my guardian.
1	Who is this in pain!” And I used to cry out, “O my blessed children, it’s poor me.
1	'Don't scruple to answer freely, man.
1	I thank you for disclosing your schemes, which I am now prepared for.
1	One comfort that she had under the Ordeal by General was more sustaining to her, and made her more grateful than to a less devoted and affectionate spirit, not habituated to her struggles and sacrifices, might appear quite reasonable; and, indeed, it may often be observed in life, that spirits like Little Dorrit do not appear to reason half as carefully as the folks who get the better of them.
1	Within a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side.
1	Behind the most ancient part of Holborn, London, where certain gabled houses some centuries of age still stand looking on the public way, as if disconsolately looking for the Old Bourne that has long run dry, is a little nook composed of two irregular quadrangles, called Staple Inn.
1	'Very curious, indeed,' observed the doctor.
1	His whole material and immaterial life is wonderfully strange; his death, the strangest thing of all.
1	Then I went to bed too.
1	Bounderby,’ she went on in a steady, straight way, without regarding this, ‘asks me to marry him.
1	cried a voice from below, in reply to a whistle from the Dodger.
1	I forget, too, at what hour the gates were opened in the morning, admitting of my going in; but I know that I was often up at six o’clock, and that my favourite lounging-place in the interval was old London Bridge, where I was wont to sit in one of the stone recesses, watching the people going by, or to look over the balustrades at the sun shining in the water, and lighting up the golden flame on the top of the Monument.
1	But judging from the looks on you,’ retorted Riderhood, completely ridding himself of his grass, and drawing his sleeve across his mouth, ‘you’ve made ekally sure afore, and have got disapinted.
1	‘Ask the favour of the lady’s name.’ The lady’s name is Lammle.
1	I am looking at the fire.’ ‘You seem to find more to look at in it than ever I could find,’ said Tom.
1	Moreover, there were places in the mill in which they could deposit these things without injury; and there were conveniences for washing.
1	I mentioned to you some time ago, I think, that the young lady whose intended husband was murdered is daughter to a clerk of mine?’ ‘Yes, you told me that,’ said Podsnap; ‘and by-the-bye, I wish you would tell it again here, for it’s a curious coincidence--curious that the first news of the discovery should have been brought straight to your table (when I was there), and curious that one of your people should have been so nearly interested in it.
1	And when I’m too deaf, and too lame, and too blind, and too mumbly for want of teeth, to be of any use at all, even to be found fault with, than I shall go to my Davy, and ask him to take me in.’ ‘And, Peggotty,’ says I, ‘I shall be glad to see you, and I’ll make you as welcome as a queen.’ ‘Bless your dear heart!’ cried Peggotty.
1	But competition, competition--new invention, new invention--alteration, alteration--the world’s gone past me.
1	He stood with his lovely burden in his arms, gazing vacantly on the countenances of his friends, without the slightest attempt at recognition or explanation.
1	I’ve led her on to tell her secret she supposed we were alone; and you were by, God forgive me.’ ‘You led her on!
1	My little woman has a very active mind, sir."
1	“Not on any account,” returned Herbert; “but a public-house may keep a gentleman.
1	‘Your mother-in-law, Sammy,’ said Mr. Weller, ‘and the red-nosed man, my boy; and the red-nosed man.
1	‘Good Heaven, Mr. Traddles!’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘to think that I should find you acquainted with the friend of my youth, the companion of earlier days!
1	But not to-day is George so occupied.
1	‘He’s a man of his word, and it’s my opinion he’ll do it, miss.
1	She did not say so, however, as she gave him her hand.
1	Of these, some were found crying under hedges and in such places, frightened at the solitude.
1	Have you considered what it is to undermine the confidence that should subsist between my daughter and myself?
1	Mr. Peartree may justify it to the grasp of _his_ mind thus to do his republican utmost to bring an appointed officer into contempt.
1	The thought occurred to me as I sat down in another room, before a girl, blind, deaf, and dumb; destitute of smell; and nearly so of taste: before a fair young creature with every human faculty, and hope, and power of goodness and affection, inclosed within her delicate frame, and but one outward sense—the sense of touch.
1	‘Pooh, pooh!--nothing more easy--blackguard boy--lovely woman--fat boy horsewhipped--you believed--end of the matter--all comfortable.’ Whether the probability of escaping from the consequences of this ill- timed discovery was delightful to the spinster’s feelings, or whether the hearing herself described as a ‘lovely woman’ softened the asperity of her grief, we know not.
1	And as Mr. George informed us that Gridley's mind had run on Mr. Jarndyce all the afternoon after hearing of their interview in the morning, I wrote a hasty note in pencil to my guardian to say where we were gone and why.
1	And now the stars faded, and the day glimmered, and standing in the carriage, looking back, he could discern the track by which he had come, and see that there was no traveller within view, on all the heavy expanse.
1	Don't let my brother know."
1	Take her away, my dear John.
1	You mean, do I feel as if I were settling down?"
1	It may be the custom to allow such things in this house, but it’s not the kind of behaviour that I’ve been used to see displayed, and so I don’t mind telling you, Kenwigs.
1	The finger-marks are something whiter for the instant, but he walks on at her side.
1	Susan encouraged herself with a final twitch, and went in.
1	‘Upon my word, it’s quite extraordinary!’ ‘Open the door,’ said Quilp, ‘I’ve got him here.
1	"That was the time, sir," answers Tony, faintly adjusting his whiskers.
1	‘My love,’ said I to Dora, ‘what have you got in that dish?’ I could not imagine why Dora had been making tempting little faces at me, as if she wanted to kiss me.
1	And my remark was—for I couldn’t think of a better one—that I thought it must be just as hard upon those who were starved, whether the others were a million, or a million million.
1	Thus engaged, with her right elbow supported by her left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in, but coughed just one grain of cough.
1	The request was no sooner preferred, than granted.
1	‘Is that the young man you saw in the lane, whom you told me about, this morning?’ Mr. Martin, who, as it has already appeared, was a man of few words, looked at Sam Weller, nodded his head, and growled forth, ‘That’s the man.’ Mr. Weller, who was never proud, gave a smile of friendly recognition as his eyes encountered those of the surly groom, and admitted in courteous terms, that he had ‘knowed him afore.’ ‘And this is the faithful creature,’ exclaimed Mr. Ben Allen, ‘whom I had nearly suffocated!--Mr.
1	Matters being brought to this so far satisfactory pass, and time being on the wane, Mrs. Bagnet proposes a departure.
1	Of dozing women-drunkards especially, you shall come upon such specimens there, in the morning sunlight, as you might seek out of doors in vain through London.
1	‘I must try to give expression to what is in my mind; it shall and must be spoken.
1	“And you get me wittles.” He tilted me again.
1	I’ve had trouble enough to find you, and shouldn’t have found you, if I hadn’t seen you slipping along the street overnight, and watched you till you was safe housed.
1	Nicholas had not the least objection in the world, but on the contrary was rather pleased to have an opportunity of talking on the subject which occupied his thoughts; so, he sat down again, and (his sanguine imagination warming as he spoke) entered into a fervent and glowing description of all the honours and advantages to be derived from his appointment at that seat of learning, Dotheboys Hall.
1	We once knew two famous coachmen (they are dead now, poor fellows) who were twins, and between whom an unaffected and devoted attachment existed.
1	Thus in the case of Paul.
1	I have no more of what they call character, my dear, than a canary-bird, but I know I am trustworthy.’ The wayward, playful, affectionate nature, giddy for want of the weight of some sustaining purpose, and capricious because it was always fluttering among little things, was yet a captivating one.
1	Demmit, let me go.’ At this crisis of his ravings Mr. Mantalini made a pluck at the breakfast knife, and being restrained by his wife’s grasp, attempted to dash his head against the wall--taking very good care to be at least six feet from it.
1	Not because I was squeezed in at an acute angle of the tablecloth, with the table in my chest, and the Pumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was not allowed to speak (I didn't want to speak), nor because I was regaled with the scaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls, and with those obscure corners of pork of which the pig, when living, had had the least reason to be vain.
1	There'd be a pretty shine made if I was to go a-wisitin THEM, I think.
1	‘I have the honour to address Miss Dombey, I believe?’ said the gentleman, with a most persuasive smile.
1	As soon as we were out of doors, Egbert, with the manner of a little footpad, demanded a shilling of me on the ground that his pocket-money was "boned" from him.
1	I had far better stay at home!’ The agonised way in which she poured this out, as if it burst of itself from her suppressed heart, made it difficult for Clennam to keep the tears from his eyes as he saw and heard her.
1	To which he mildly answered, ‘Yes, I think I can, my dear.’ ‘Then,’ said Mrs Wilfer, with solemn indignation, ‘I would recommend you, if you have a human feeling, to retire to bed.’ ‘Thank you, my dear,’ he replied; ‘I think it IS the best place for me.’ And with these unsympathetic words very gladly withdrew.
1	‘Has he been living with--?’ ‘Ah, sir!’ interposed Squeers, confronting him again.
1	), dived under all the furniture, and wound a long iron chain, that dangled from his neck, round legs of chairs and tables, and then tugged at it until his eyes became unnaturally visible, in consequence of their nearly starting out of his head; and when he growled at Mr Toots, who affected familiarity; and went pell-mell at Towlinson, morally convinced that he was the enemy whom he had barked at round the corner all his life and had never seen yet; Florence was as pleased with him as if he had been a miracle of discretion.
1	It was into a place of this kind that Mr. Ralph Nickleby gazed, as he sat with his hands in his pockets looking out of the window.
1	The old man raked the fire together with an old stair-rod, and having trimmed his smoky lamp (for it was night), with the stem of his pipe, put it in his mouth again.
1	Bill, Bill, for dear God's sake, for your own, for mine, stop before you spill my blood!
1	It was not in reason to be expected that he should; if he could have lightly forgotten it, he could never have conceived it, or had the patience and perseverance to work it out.
1	‘Winkle,’ echoed Mr. Pott; and the ceremony of introduction was complete.
1	If I was to tell some that he knows, and has spotted and cheated with, where to find him--’ ‘Will you hold your tongue, Misses Brown?’ interrupted the miserable Grinder, glancing quickly round, as though he expected to see his master’s teeth shining at his elbow.
1	She slowly, very slowly, broke into a laugh, and pointed at Emily with her hand, as if she were a sight of shame for gods and men.
1	Withers believed she was in her own room.
1	Mr. Bucket makes a leg and comes forward, passing his familiar demon over the region of his mouth.
1	"You used to teach girls," she said, "If you could only have taught me, I could have learnt from you!
1	The wildest would do her bidding--she had a tender way with them, indeed she had!’ Kit had no power to speak.
1	‘I doen’t know, sir,’ he replied.
1	‘Oh, Lord!’ he said, shaking his head, ‘that’s the school where they broke the boy’s ribs--two ribs--a little boy he was.
1	He shrunk behind the curtains, and called out very loudly-- ‘Ha-hum!’ That the lady started at this unexpected sound was evident, by her falling up against the rushlight shade; that she persuaded herself it must have been the effect of imagination was equally clear, for when Mr. Pickwick, under the impression that she had fainted away stone-dead with fright, ventured to peep out again, she was gazing pensively on the fire as before.
1	The Marchioness dealt, turned up a knave, and omitted to take the usual advantage; upon which Mr Swiveller called out as loud as he could--‘Two for his heels!’ The Marchioness jumped up quickly and clapped her hands.
1	The room resumed its shadowy terrors, the moment she left it; and she had no more power to divest herself of these vague impressions of dread, than if they had been stone giants, rooted in the solid earth.
1	You are not a stranger, John.’ ‘Thank you, sir, I am sure--Miss;’ here Young John turned the great hat round and round upon his left-hand, like a slowly twirling mouse-cage; ‘Miss Amy quite well, sir?’ ‘Yes, John, yes; very well.
1	Mr Rokesmith, that girl has often seen herself in a pitiful and poor light since, but never in so pitiful and poor a light as now, when the mean tone in which she answered you--sordid and vain girl that she was--has been echoed in her ears by Mr Boffin.’ He kissed her hand again.
1	Be that how it might, he had with pains gradually worked the boy into his own school, and procured him some offices to discharge there, which were repaid with food and lodging.
1	But I mean a cost.
1	I am so happy with him.
1	This gave me courage to protest most vehemently that I loved Dora better than I could tell, or anyone believe; that all my friends knew how I loved her; that my aunt, Agnes, Traddles, everyone who knew me, knew how I loved her, and how earnest my love had made me.
1	You have your gentleman-friends, you know, and they’ll serve you with as much of the article as you want.
1	I’ll hear all I don’t know, and say all I know.
1	I do not charge it upon you.’ The Manager replied, with that mute action of his bristling mouth, ‘Oh, you don’t charge it upon me!’ and bade him go on.
1	One afternoon, late in the month of February, I came ashore at the wharf at dusk.
1	‘What is a proctor, Steerforth?’ said I.
1	At length the dish was lifted on the table, and mugs of ale having been previously set round, little Nell ventured to say grace, and supper began.
1	A little more, in truth, and it will be all extinguished for Sir Leicester; and the damp door in the mausoleum which shuts so tight, and looks so obdurate, will have opened and received him.
1	The green coat had been a smart dress garment in the days of swallow-tails, but had evidently in those times adorned a much shorter man than the stranger, for the soiled and faded sleeves scarcely reached to his wrists.
1	Here, they fell to reviewing the origin and progress of their acquaintance, as men sometimes do, and tracing out the little events by which it was most strongly marked, came at last to Miss Cecilia Bobster.
1	There was a kind of film or flicker on her face, which at first he took to be the fitful firelight; but, on a second look, he saw that she was weeping.
1	There’s no harm done.’ ‘I looked for single motives in everyone,’ said Mr. Wickfield, ‘and I was satisfied I had bound him to me by motives of interest.
1	I did so on accounts of your looking too hard at what I had in tow, as if you was suspicious, and on accounts of your holding on to the gunwale of my boat.” I says to him, “Gaffer, I know it.” He says to me, “Rogue Riderhood, you are a man in a dozen”--I think he said in a score, but of that I am not positive, so take the lowest figure, for precious be the obligations of a Alfred David.
1	It will not be true.
1	The grounds were more than an acre and a quarter in extent, and they were filled with people!
1	Wishing to embrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching Joe, I should have to begin quite at the beginning, I said, “Ah!
1	When I came off my last voyage.’ ‘Then you have not been to sea lately?’ ‘No.
1	They are very tender to each other at dusky street-corners, and Towlinson has visions of leading an altered and blameless existence as a serious greengrocer in Oxford Market.
1	‘No, Jeremiah; I have felt it before.
1	Nobody came near me until late at night.
1	'He won't stir till it's all safe.
1	Again tenderly wrapping her mantle about her, and taking her on his arm (though, but for her visit, he was almost too weak to walk), Arthur led Little Dorrit down-stairs.
1	A bargain was struck with Fagin, that if Oliver was got back he should have a certain sum; and he was to have more for making him a thief, which this Monks wanted for some purpose of his own.'
1	Show me Mrs Dombey, and I’ll show you my Alice’s first cousin.’ Harriet glanced from the old woman to the lustrous eyes intent upon her face, and derived corroboration from them.
1	But, he was girdled still with Bradley’s iron ring, and the rivets of the iron ring held tight.
1	What do you say;’ Mr. Bounderby, with his hat in his hand, gave a beat upon the crown at every little division of his sentences, as if it were a tambourine; ‘to his being seen—night after night—watching the Bank?—to his lurking about there—after dark?—To its striking Mrs. Sparsit—that he could be lurking for no good—To her calling Bitzer’s attention to him, and their both taking notice of him—And to its appearing on inquiry to-day—that he was also noticed by the neighbours?’ Having come to the climax, Mr. Bounderby, like an oriental dancer, put his tambourine on his head.
1	‘Will you let him go like that, when you can wring money from him?
1	‘What ought I to do then, Agnes?’ I inquired, after looking at the fire a little while.
1	If his progress downward had been attended with difficulties and uncertainty, his journey back was infinitely more perplexing.
1	Sleep is what you want, afore all other things, and may you be able to show yourself smart with that there balsam for the still small woice of a wounded mind!
1	Their decease made no impression on the other flies out promenading, who looked at them in the coolest manner (as if they themselves were elephants, or something as far removed), until they met the same fate.
1	“Very easily said!” remarked Camilla, amiably repressing a sob, while a hitch came into her upper lip, and her tears overflowed.
1	You have been dreaming again!’ The time being come for the renewal of his acquaintance with the Meagles family, Clennam, pursuant to contract made between himself and Mr Meagles within the precincts of Bleeding Heart Yard, turned his face on a certain Saturday towards Twickenham, where Mr Meagles had a cottage-residence of his own.
1	You have now a--hum--a great position to support.
1	'It seems to go right through one,' added the old man, touching his side.
1	‘No,’ said Mr Dombey, with magnificent indifference.
1	And if I had, I shouldn’t know how to do it.’ ‘I am far from being clear as to the last particular,’ returned Mortimer, with great composure, ‘that I have much advantage over you.’ ‘I hate,’ said Eugene, putting his legs up on the opposite seat, ‘I hate my profession.’ ‘Shall I incommode you, if I put mine up too?’ returned Mortimer.
1	Richard had received a similar letter and had made a similar response.
1	Mr. Jellyby," said Mr. Kenge, "is--a--I don't know that I can describe him to you better than by saying that he is the husband of Mrs.
1	‘We always, in this house, propose a month--an initiatory month.
1	with which the Dianas concluded.
1	They travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak, and lying by until the twilight fell.
1	‘Where did it happen?’ ‘It happened,’ returned the man, with a ruminative air, as he drew his right hand across his chin, and dipped the other in the pocket of his rough outer coat, ‘it happened somewhere about here as I reckon.
1	‘Then,’ said my aunt, after a rest, ‘there’s Dick.
1	My daughter Dora having, unhappily, no mother, Miss Murdstone is obliging enough to become her companion and protector.’ A passing thought occurred to me that Miss Murdstone, like the pocket instrument called a life-preserver, was not so much designed for purposes of protection as of assault.
1	I never thought that I had a curious couple of guardians, in my aunt and Mr. Dick.
1	He went into Mr. Barkis’s room like light and air, brightening and refreshing it as if he were healthy weather.
1	His tears were soon dried, much sooner than on the former occasion; and he was presently afterwards very high with his valet, as a way of righting himself for having shed any.
1	But he is soon relieved by her saying she is very glad to have been there again, and by her talking quite cheerfully about it all, as they walked on by the sea.
1	What with motions for new trials, and in arrest of judgment, and what not, a prisoner might be here for twelve months, I take it, might he not?’ ‘Well, I guess he might.’ ‘Do you mean to say that in all that time he would never come out at that little iron door, for exercise?’ ‘He might walk some, perhaps—not much.’ ‘Will you open one of the doors?’ ‘All, if you like.’ The fastenings jar and rattle, and one of the doors turns slowly on its hinges.
1	'I should think not,' said Mrs. Mann, who had of course laughed very much at Mr. Bumble's humour.
1	‘Beware of that here, or you’re a lost rascal,’ and he smiled again, and again cautioned him with his forefinger.
1	At Blaze and Sparkle's the jewellers and at Sheen and Gloss's the mercers, it is and will be for several hours the topic of the age, the feature of the century.
1	Like the adjoining habitation, it held such old articles of furniture as were absolutely necessary, and had its stack of fire-wood.
1	‘I lead the life of an owl.’ ‘You stripped me of the greater part of all I ever had,’ said my aunt.
1	Rather baulked, Mr Riderhood evasively remarked, with an innocent air, that he believed the T’other Governor had asked him summa’t.
1	"I know no more, ma'am, than the dead," she replied, glancing compassionately at him.
1	Then Martha arose, and gathering her shawl about her, covering her face with it, and weeping aloud, went slowly to the door.
1	Her books, her music, and her daily teachers, were her only real companions, Susan Nipper and Diogenes excepted: of whom the former, in her attendance on the studies of her young mistress, began to grow quite learned herself, while the latter, softened possibly by the same influences, would lay his head upon the window-ledge, and placidly open and shut his eyes upon the street, all through a summer morning; sometimes pricking up his head to look with great significance after some noisy dog in a cart, who was barking his way along, and sometimes, with an exasperated and unaccountable recollection of his supposed enemy in the neighbourhood, rushing to the door, whence, after a deafening disturbance, he would come jogging back with a ridiculous complacency that belonged to him, and lay his jaw upon the window-ledge again, with the air of a dog who had done a public service.
1	John assented, and he crept back in the shadow of the wall to his own lodging.
1	‘Well?’ said Miss Betsey, coming back to her chair, as if she had only been taking a casual look at the prospect; ‘and when do you expect--’ ‘I am all in a tremble,’ faltered my mother.
1	Your conduct has always been of the most delicate and obliging description.
1	There is no better among my people at home; no better among your people.’ ‘Granted.
1	And I’ll slip those after him that shall talk too much; that won’t be shook away; that’ll hang to him like leeches, and slink arter him like foxes.
1	How often did Oliver start from his bed that night, and stealing out, with noiseless footstep, to the staircase, listen for the slightest sound from the sick chamber!
1	‘Save the man!’ cried Mr. Grewgious.
1	The first scene, in which there was nobody particular, passed off calmly enough, but when Miss Snevellicci went on in the second, accompanied by the phenomenon as child, what a roar of applause broke out!
1	Oliver did as he was desired.
1	She has had two sons, of whom the younger ran wild, and went for a soldier, and never came back.
1	You Bob Gliddery there, put the chain upon the door and get ye down to your supper.’ With an alacrity that seemed no less referable to the pepperer fact than to the supper fact, Bob obeyed, and his boots were heard descending towards the bed of the river.
1	‘What have you got there, Sir?’ ‘This,’ returned Mr Dombey, ‘is some cold preparation of calf’s head, I think.
1	We’ll go down this way, as you may like to see the yard, and it’s all in the road.
1	‘I am sorry for that.
1	Let’s rinse our mouths with a drop of burnt sherry; the last-comer shall stand it, Mivins shall fetch it, and I’ll help to drink it.
1	"It can't last for ever," returned Richard with a fierceness kindling in him which again presented to me that last sad reminder.
1	Here, in a corner my indentures were duly signed and attested, and I was “bound”; Mr. Pumblechook holding me all the while as if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold, to have those little preliminaries disposed of.
1	Thou know’d ‘un first, Tilly, didn’t thou?’ ‘I couldn’t help knowing Fanny Squeers, John,’ returned his wife; ‘she was an old playmate of mine, you know.’ ‘Weel,’ replied John, ‘dean’t I say so, lass?
1	It hasn't declared anything in heaven knows how many years."
1	‘If you had told him who you were; if you had given him your card, and found out, afterwards, that his station or character prevented your fighting him, it would have been bad enough then; upon my soul it would have been bad enough then.
1	And besides,' said Mr. Bumble, his teeth chattering as he spoke, 'Mr.
1	The Secretary inquired on what terms?
1	‘Hold there, you and your philanthropy,’ cried the smiling landlady, nodding her head more than ever.
1	‘How is it possible, sir, that you ever can come right when you’re always wrong?
1	As to himself, Mr Sparkler conveyed to the Dorrit family that he was going, on rather particular business, wherever they were going.
1	How does this happen?” “Citizen Doctor,” said the first, reluctantly, “he has been denounced to the Section of Saint Antoine.
1	‘I cannot walk tonight, Newman,’ returned Nicholas, hurriedly.
1	‘My dear, it’s not my fault,’ said the gentleman.
1	She was exactly the same as when they had parted, just as handsome, just as scornful, just as repressed.
1	The great point of our agreement is yet to come.
1	Mrs. Pardiggle wrote a letter of introduction to my guardian in behalf of her eloquent friend Mr. Gusher.
1	I also desire to live in amity with my professional brethren.
1	While they were thus employed, the matron, who had been impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her stupor, joined them by the fire, and sharply asked how long she was to wait?
1	How do you like the law, Mr. Micawber?’ ‘My dear Copperfield,’ he replied.
1	None of your live languages for Miss Blimber.
1	'You keep ready, and leave the rest to me.'
1	I cannot make up my mind.’ ‘Nor I,’ said Mr. Grewgious.
1	‘This very night, sir,’ replied Job Trotter.
1	B. fifty thousand times!’ ‘Do not interrupt, rude man!’ said Cleopatra.
1	"At the foot of the same chair there lies a dirty bit of thin red cord that they tie up pens with.
1	You shall have the books.'
1	He then put up the pocket-book and set the candle a little aside, after peering round it into the darkness at Joe and me, to ascertain which was which.
1	You could not have so outdone yourself, I hope, without being wonderfully well.’ ‘I _am_ wonderfully well.’ ‘Nothing unequal,’ says the Minor Canon, with a smooth motion of his hand: ‘nothing unsteady, nothing forced, nothing avoided; all thoroughly done in a masterly manner, with perfect self-command.’ ‘Thank you.
1	Enough love might have been wrung out of me, metaphorically speaking, to drown anybody in; and yet there would have remained enough within me, and all over me, to pervade my entire existence.
1	He told Ada, in his most ingenuous way, that he had not come to make any secret inroad on the terms she had accepted (rather too implicitly and confidingly, he thought) from Mr. Jarndyce, that he had come openly to see her and to see me and to justify himself for the present terms on which he stood with Mr. Jarndyce.
1	My aunt and Agnes were there, busily making some little extra comforts, in the way of dress, for the children.
1	The mother had moaned in her sleep and moved.
1	When the company disperse--by which time Mr and Mrs Veneering have had quite as much as they want of the honour, and the guests have had quite as much as THEY want of the other honour--Mortimer sees Twemlow home, shakes hands with him cordially at parting, and fares to the Temple, gaily.
1	Out-of-the-way villages there, they tell me.
1	It was pleasant to observe how kind they were to him and how there appeared to be a general impression among them that frequently calling him "Old Chap" was likely to revive his spirits.
1	His thoughts, more incoherent, dragged him more unmercifully after them--as if a wretch, condemned to such expiation, were drawn at the heels of wild horses.
1	"It's so pretty, George," cries Mrs. Bagnet, turning it on all sides and holding it out at arm's length, "that it seems too choice for me."
1	I know of several cases such as I describe, my Lady, and I think they indicate to me my own course now."
1	Cold, wet, and    fatigue are sufficient causes for my being found dead, but    I shall die of others, though I suffer from these.
1	‘At last poor father said that he had given no satisfaction again, and never did give any satisfaction now, and that he was a shame and disgrace, and I should have done better without him all along.
1	I know it to be unnecessary and calculated to awaken speculation, doubt, rumour, I don't know what, in the house.
1	‘This here’s old Sol Gills’s nevy Wal’r.
1	The men who had turned back were among the group; and its central figures were Mr. Jasper and Mr. Crisparkle.
1	There were indeed four sides to the counting-house, but he avoided that one where the window was, deeming it probable that Quilp would be looking out of it.
1	don’t!’ I sought to recollect what she had said, when I had spoken to her on that former night, of her affection needing no return.
1	I should lose my place, and get indicted for a conspiracy, or some such thing; that’s all I should take by my motion.’ ‘There’s somethin’ in that,’ said Sam, ruminating; ‘there’s somethin’ in that.’ ‘If I knew any respectable gentleman who would take the matter up,’ continued Mr. Trotter.
1	He cast his small eyes, first on Mr. Weller, and then on Mr. Muzzle, but said nothing.
1	“Hear this!” he helplessly exclaimed to the elements.
1	‘I will restore to you what I have withheld from you.
1	A visible effect was produced immediately, several jurymen beginning to take voluminous notes with the utmost eagerness.
1	It is my turn again, Mrs Lammle.
1	I had not been conscious of it.
1	And lest this last consideration--no mean or secondary one with Sir Mulberry--should sound strangely in the ears of some, let it be remembered that most men live in a world of their own, and that in that limited circle alone are they ambitious for distinction and applause.
1	The moment I heard this, and had it corroborated by the matron--excellent references and unimpeachable character--I got the address, my dear, and posted off again.’ ‘Like the dear good Tox, you are!’ said Louisa.
1	I will carry it into no blood but my own; and the reproach shall rest alone on me.'
1	"Now, before I turn my horse's head homewards, brother, I will ask you--if you'll be so good--to look over a letter for me.
1	I’m sure I have!’ ‘My brother,’ pursues Mrs Chick profoundly, ‘is so peculiar--so strange a man.
1	A letter, under date Portsmouth, from a colonist of the name of Provis, asking for the particulars of your address, on behalf of Magwitch.
1	Speak!” “What else could I do?” “You did that, and that would be enough, without more.
1	“They are,” Mr. Lorry whispered the words, glancing fearfully round at the locked room, “murdering the prisoners.
1	But his spirit was roused at last; the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire.
1	Moved by the gentle beauty of the scene, the prince sank upon the green turf, and bathed his swollen feet in his tears.
1	But you’ll bear in mind about the money, as theer’s at all times some laying by for him?’ Reminding him of the fact, that Mr. Peggotty derived a steady, though certainly a very moderate income from the bequest of his late brother-in-law, I promised to do so.
1	I felt reluctant to be present, when Mr. Peggotty first met his sister and Ham; and made Mr. Omer my excuse for lingering behind.
1	Mr. Squeers then proceeded to open a miscellaneous collection of letters; some enclosing money, which Mrs. Squeers ‘took care of;’ and others referring to small articles of apparel, as caps and so forth, all of which the same lady stated to be too large, or too small, and calculated for nobody but young Squeers, who would appear indeed to have had most accommodating limbs, since everything that came into the school fitted him to a nicety.
1	‘But what,’ said Bella, as she watched the carving of the fowls, ‘makes them pink inside, I wonder, Pa!
1	He is easily moved to tears; is gentle, submissive, and broken-spirited.
1	From this bed Captain Cuttle daily rose thenceforth, and clapped on his glazed hat at six o’clock in the morning, with the solitary air of Crusoe finishing his toilet with his goat-skin cap; and although his fears of a visitation from the savage tribe, MacStinger, were somewhat cooled, as similar apprehensions on the part of that lone mariner used to be by the lapse of a long interval without any symptoms of the cannibals, he still observed a regular routine of defensive operations, and never encountered a bonnet without previous survey from his castle of retreat.
1	‘Oh, Cap’en Cuttle, Cap’en Cuttle, do you dare to look me in the face, and not be struck down in the berth!’ The Captain, who looked anything but daring, feebly muttered ‘Stand by!’ ‘Oh I was a weak and trusting Fool when I took you under my roof, Cap’en Cuttle, I was!’ cried Mrs MacStinger.
1	Tom looked down in hers, and smiled through his.
1	Mrs Plornish was particularly ingenious in this art; and attained so much celebrity for saying ‘Me ope you leg well soon,’ that it was considered in the Yard but a very short remove indeed from speaking Italian.
1	I shall trust my remembrances then, my sweet nurse, in your hands, and I well know they couldn’t be in better.
1	It was so delicious to see the clouds about his bright face clearing, and to see him so heartily pleased, and to know, as it was impossible not to know, that the source of his pleasure was the goodness which was tortured by condemning, or mistrusting, or secretly accusing any one, that I saw the tears in Ada's eyes, while she echoed his laugh, and felt them in my own.
1	Volumnia's finishing the sentence restores her to favour.
1	‘Cap’en Cuttle,’ said Mrs MacStinger, ‘if you would wish to heal up past animosities, and to see the last of your friend, my ‘usband, as a single person, we should be ‘appy of your company to chapel.
1	In an upper room of one of these houses--a detached house of fair size, ruinous in other respects, but strongly defended at door and window: of which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already described--there were assembled three men, who, regarding each other every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation, sat for some time in profound and gloomy silence.
1	Resolved, as your discriminating good sense perceives, that if you was to have a sap--pur--IZE, it should be a complete one!
1	I could say nothing in reply; for who could offer hope, or consolation, to the abject being before me?
1	He was buried in London, at the church of Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields.
1	In the drawing-room of which mansion, there presently entered to them the most remarkable girl Mr. James Harthouse had ever seen.
1	The great house, dumb as to all that had been suffered in it, and the changes it had witnessed, stood frowning like a dark mute on the street; baulking any nearer inquiries with the staring announcement that the lease of this desirable Family Mansion was to be disposed of.
1	So, to the Three Magpies as before: where Mrs Boffin and Miss Bella were handed out, and whence they all went on foot to Mrs Betty Higden’s.
1	Sam thought it was, too, but he held his peace.
1	Before parting at the Physician’s door, they both looked up at the sunny morning sky, into which the smoke of a few early fires and the breath and voices of a few early stirrers were peacefully rising, and then looked round upon the immense city, and said, if all those hundreds and thousands of beggared people who were yet asleep could only know, as they two spoke, the ruin that impended over them, what a fearful cry against one miserable soul would go up to Heaven!
1	You’ll be all the better for it, if you do.’ The Marchioness, in saying these words, brought a little table to the bedside, took her seat at it, and began to work away at the concoction of some cooling drink, with the address of a score of chemists.
1	Far into the night she sat alone, by the sinking blaze, in dark and threatening beauty, watching the murky shadows looming on the wall, as if her thoughts were tangible, and cast them there.
1	I tell you what,’ said Codlin, ‘for all his having a kind of way with him that you’d be very apt to like, I’m the real, open-hearted man.
1	As Arthur came over the stile and down to the water’s edge, the lounger glanced at him for a moment, and then resumed his occupation of idly tossing stones into the water with his foot.
1	And a beautiful world we live in, when it _is_ possible, and when many other such things are possible, and not only possible, but done--done, see you!--under that sky there, every day.
1	You all go out so much; you all go out so much.’ This was to keep up the ceremony and pretence of his having no idea that Amy herself went out by the day to work.
1	Lady Clubber took a telescopic view of Mrs. Smithie and family through her eye-glass and Mrs. Smithie stared in her turn at Mrs. Somebody-else, whose husband was not in the dockyard at all.
1	Yet the cold was merciful, for it was the cold night air and the rain that restored me from a swoon on the stones of the causeway.
1	In some of the vessels at anchor all hands were busily engaged in coiling ropes, spreading out sails to dry, taking in or discharging their cargoes; in others no life was visible but two or three tarry boys, and perhaps a barking dog running to and fro upon the deck or scrambling up to look over the side and bark the louder for the view.
1	May ‘Yes, Jenny, yes.’ But Riah glanced towards the door, as if he thought his principal might appear there, unseasonably.
1	In capital B’s and H’s most of the girls under Miss Peecher’s tuition were half a year ahead of every other letter in the alphabet.
1	But since you mention me so pointedly, I will acknowledge that I should like to impart to you a little of my--come, sir, you are disposed to call it insensibility, and I am sure I have no objection--say insensibility--a little of my insensibility."
1	There is not a drop of Tom's corrupted blood but propagates infection and contagion somewhere.
1	Good-night, Polly!’ Mrs Pipchin by this time looms dark in her black bombazeen skirts, black bonnet, and shawl; and has her personal property packed up; and has her chair (late a favourite chair of Mr Dombey’s and the dead bargain of the sale) ready near the street door; and is only waiting for a fly-van, going to-night to Brighton on private service, which is to call for her, by private contract, and convey her home.
1	In this conjunction Mr Toots remained, greatly disturbing the congregation, who felt it impossible to avoid looking at him, until his feelings overcame him again, when he departed silently and suddenly.
1	At length Tim Linkinwater came back--provokingly cool, and with papers in his hand, and a pen in his mouth, as if nothing had happened.
1	The bed itself was covered with an old patch-work counterpane.
1	As she stood in her garden, holding up her little lantern to light me back, I thought her observation of me had an anxious air again; but I was too much occupied in pondering on what she had said, and too much impressed--for the first time, in reality--by the conviction that Dora and I had indeed to work out our future for ourselves, and that no one could assist us, to take much notice of it.
1	Everybody (except Bishop, who had no suspicion of it) knew perfectly well that this dinner had been eaten and drunk, specifically to the end that Lord Decimus and Mr Merdle should have five minutes’ conversation together.
1	I therefore pleaded another engagement; and observing that Mrs. Micawber’s spirits were immediately lightened, I resisted all persuasion to forego it.
1	May I mention something?’ ‘Oh, please don’t be practical!’ said Dora, coaxingly.
1	So, the time came for him to bid Lucie good night, and they separated.
1	This is what I meant when I said in my note that I had a great favour and a great assistance to beg of you.
1	That’s your name.’ At these words, I observed the gentleman more attentively.
1	‘Who says man and wife are bad company?
1	Miss Squeers and the miller’s daughter, being fast friends, had covenanted together some two years before, according to a custom prevalent among young ladies, that whoever was first engaged to be married, should straightway confide the mighty secret to the bosom of the other, before communicating it to any living soul, and bespeak her as bridesmaid without loss of time; in fulfilment of which pledge the miller’s daughter, when her engagement was formed, came out express, at eleven o’clock at night as the corn-factor’s son made an offer of his hand and heart at twenty-five minutes past ten by the Dutch clock in the kitchen, and rushed into Miss Squeers’s bedroom with the gratifying intelligence.
1	There are very few harmless circumstances that would not seem full of perilous meaning, so considered.
1	Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust!
1	‘What is the matter with the men!
1	His household dread him too much to approach a subject on which he is resolutely dumb; and the only person who dares question him, he silences immediately.
1	A few slight indications of a rather petted and capricious manner, which I observed in the Beauty, were manifestly considered, by Traddles and his wife, as her birthright and natural endowment.
1	Damme, I’ll throttle you!” ‘It is by no means improbable that old Lobbs would have carried his threat into execution, in the excess of his rage, if his arm had not been stayed by a very unexpected apparition: to wit, the male cousin, who, stepping out of his closet, and walking up to old Lobbs, said-- ‘“I cannot allow this harmless person, Sir, who has been asked here, in some girlish frolic, to take upon himself, in a very noble manner, the fault (if fault it is) which I am guilty of, and am ready to avow.
1	There is much good in it; there are many good and true people in it; it has its appointed place.
1	I believe you there!’ ‘But I love you dearly, Fred,’ said the child.
1	The man shook his fist, as he uttered these words incoherently.
1	The day came, but not the bridegroom.
1	When they had walked a little further: ‘You were going to speak to me,’ said the Secretary, with the shadow so long on him quite thrown off and cast away, ‘about Lizzie Hexam.
1	In the breast of the coat he stowed the bristling hair and whisker, in a moment, as the favouring wind went with him down a solitary place that it had swept clear of passengers.
1	One cannot say that it is all anxiety or all weariness; yet it is both, and like ungrown despair."
1	The last was a S,--Swubble, I named him.
1	‘Your speaking countenance,’ said Wegg, ‘being answered to its satisfaction, only asks then, “What have you found?” Why, I hear it say the words!’ ‘Well?’ retorted Venus snappishly, after waiting in vain.
1	Above stairs, the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away; for the doctor was in high spirits; and however fatigued or thoughtful Harry Maylie might have been at first, he was not proof against the worthy gentleman's good humour, which displayed itself in a great variety of sallies and professional recollections, and an abundance of small jokes, which struck Oliver as being the drollest things he had ever heard, and caused him to laugh proportionately; to the evident satisfaction of the doctor, who laughed immoderately at himself, and made Harry laugh almost as heartily, by the very force of sympathy.
1	The justice says, ‘I choose to think this man a runaway:’ and locks him up.
1	So day after day she, and my darling, and my little maid Charley, and a milliner out of the town, and I, sat hard at work, as pleasantly as possible.
1	‘Brayvo; wery pretty!’ said Sam, when the red-nosed man having finished, pulled his worn gloves on, thereby thrusting his fingers through the broken tops till the knuckles were disclosed to view.
1	If the father of the late John Harmon had but left his money unconditionally to his son, and if his son had but lighted on this loveable girl for himself, and had the happiness to make her loving as well as loveable!
1	At length, when they had played a great many rubbers and drawn pretty freely upon the case-bottle, Mr Quilp warned his lady to retire to rest, and that submissive wife complying, and being followed by her indignant mother, Mr Swiveller fell asleep.
1	"I don't know that, sir!"
1	‘It seems they got a cognovit out of her, for the amount of ‘em, directly after the trial.’ ‘By Jove!’ said Perker, taking both hands out of his pockets, and striking the knuckles of his right against the palm of his left, emphatically, ‘those are the cleverest scamps I ever had anything to do with!’ ‘The sharpest practitioners I ever knew, Sir,’ observed Lowten.
1	I tried it with the load upon my leg (and that made me think afresh of the man with the load on HIS leg), and found the tendency of exercise to bring the bread and butter out at my ankle, quite unmanageable.
1	I have tramped about the country, pet, and I know what I know.
1	I don’t want a wife and family.
1	She had not been consulted on the question, any more than on the question of her coming into these terrestrial parts, to want a name.
1	We had now got into the month of March.
1	‘I got at him,’ pursued Fledgeby, feeling for his whisker, ‘by degrees.
1	I would that I knew on whom he has the claim of birth: I might wring something from his sense of shame, if he were dead to every tie of nature.’ ‘Indeed!’ said Ralph.
1	Mrs Boffin suggested advertisement in the newspapers, requesting orphans answering annexed description to apply at the Bower on a certain day; but Mr Boffin wisely apprehending obstruction of the neighbouring thoroughfares by orphan swarms, this course was negatived.
1	As at present, Major Bagstock, when they enable me to take a hand with you.’ It might be only the false mouth, so smooth and wide; and yet there seemed to lurk beneath the humility and subserviency of this short speech, a something like a snarl; and, for a moment, one might have thought that the white teeth were prone to bite the hand they fawned upon.
1	Be sure that is a hospitable house with inmates to be affectionately remembered always, where they have the open door and pretty show of plants within, and where the child with laughing eyes is peeping out of window at the little dog below.
1	I have been very happy with her for some years: too happy, perhaps.
1	‘Mightn’t exactly want to do it, my dear,’ returned Miss Wren; ‘but a lot of gunpowder among lighted lucifer-matches in the next room might almost as well be here.’ ‘He is a very strange man,’ said Lizzie, thoughtfully.
1	As I sat looking fixedly at him and the sun's rays descended, softly shining through the leaves upon his bare head, I felt as if the brightness on him must be like the brightness of the angels.
1	These kisses for a blessing on your head!
1	My sorrow may bear involuntary witness against you at the judgement Throne; but my angry thoughts or my reproaches never will, I know!
1	“Have you brought his indentures with you?” asked Miss Havisham.
1	The pen dropped from Darnay's fingers on the table, and he looked about him vacantly.
1	‘God save you, master,’ said the old cottager in a thin piping voice; ‘are you travelling far?’ ‘Yes, Sir, a long way’--replied the child; for her grandfather appealed to her.
1	You don't object to an aged parent, I hope?” I really thought he was still speaking of the fowl, until he added, “Because I have got an aged parent at my place.” I then said what politeness required.
1	Coax him to use his influence with the Jew.
1	‘Widders, Sammy,’ replied Mr. Weller, slightly changing colour.
1	"Did your ladyship," says Mr. Guppy, "ever happen to hear of Miss Barbary?"
1	Indeed, I may say that I was a man of business when a boy.” “See what a place you fill at seventy-eight.
1	"I share those feelings," he returned.
1	Elsewise, the world got up at eight, shaved close at a quarter-past, breakfasted at nine, went to the City at ten, came home at half-past five, and dined at seven.
1	When the door yielded, and he rushed in, what did he see there?
1	‘That affair of the first bond for four thousand five hundred pounds has not taken the course that was expected, Spiker,’ said Mr. Gulpidge.
1	I answer that it's in my nature to do it, under wrong, and I must do it.
1	For instance, if he took his supper after a hard day, to the Dead March in Saul, his food might be likely to sit heavy on him.
1	He had done wonders before, but now he began to powder away like a raving mad giant.
1	This is a secret expedition.
1	I wonder--’ Such a vista of wonder opened out before her, that she sat looking up at the stars, quite lost, until Maggy was querulous again, and wanted to get up and walk.
1	I was speaking of Provis.
1	What d’ye think it was all for?’ ‘For another tea-drinkin’, perhaps,’ said Sam.
1	I am informed of that fact because--which I mention in confidence--I know it in the way of my profession at Kenge and Carboy's.
1	Besides he had no comfort in being there without us, and had nobody to talk to or enjoy himself with.’ ‘That was it, you know,’ interposed the same small quiet voice that had spoken once before.
1	‘Master sent me over with the chay-cart, to carry your luggage up to the house.
1	The apprentices were the queerest little people.
1	The finale concluded, the dancers promenaded the room, and Mr. Tupman and his companion stationed themselves in a corner to observe the company.
1	They work so much more than they need--they make so much more than they can eat--they are so incessantly boring and buzzing at their one idea till Death comes upon them--that don’t you think they overdo it?
1	Like some other mothers, whom I have known in the course of my life, Mrs. Markleham was far more fond of pleasure than her daughter was.
1	If we could have gone off in the midst of that last burst, we should have started triumphantly: but to lie here, two hours and more in the damp fog, neither staying at home nor going abroad, is letting one gradually down into the very depths of dulness and low spirits.
1	You will come home in the holidays, and be a better boy.’ ‘Clara!’ Miss Murdstone repeated.
1	‘Aye, aye,’ replied Mr. Pickwick; and on they went, as briskly as need be.
1	As these ruffians turned and turned, their matted locks now flung forward over their eyes, now flung backward over their necks, some women held wine to their mouths that they might drink; and what with dropping blood, and what with dropping wine, and what with the stream of sparks struck out of the stone, all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and fire.
1	I never saw her, except upon a baggage-waggon, when she wasn't washing greens!"
1	‘First of all clear that off, and then you’ll see what’s next.’ The small servant needed no second bidding, and the plate was soon empty.
1	Give me your nose sir!’ ‘No!
1	We had Tim in to face him at first, and Tim was at him, sir, before you could say “Jack Robinson.”’ ‘How can I ever thank you for all the deep obligations you impose upon me every day?’ said Nicholas.
1	‘Oh, so tranquil!’ cried the little creature, smiling.
1	Are you ready to come, my dear friend?"
1	She'll never die quiet till you come, mistress.'
1	"My dear sir," said Scrooge, quickening his pace, and taking the old gentleman by both his hands.
1	Pouring out these cries, and accompanying them with violent gesticulation, the boy actually threw himself, single-handed, upon the strong man, and in the intensity of his energy and the suddenness of his surprise, brought him heavily to the ground.
1	You haven’t got polished leather boots on,’ pouting, with one shoulder raised.
1	So, the pie was brought down, and the worthy Mr Boffin exercised his patience until Wegg, in the exercise of his knife and fork, had finished the dish: only profiting by the opportunity to inform Wegg that although it was not strictly Fashionable to keep the contents of a larder thus exposed to view, he (Mr Boffin) considered it hospitable; for the reason, that instead of saying, in a comparatively unmeaning manner, to a visitor, ‘There are such and such edibles down stairs; will you have anything up?’ you took the bold practical course of saying, ‘Cast your eye along the shelves, and, if you see anything you like there, have it down.’ And now, Mr Wegg at length pushed away his plate and put on his spectacles, and Mr Boffin lighted his pipe and looked with beaming eyes into the opening world before him, and Mrs Boffin reclined in a fashionable manner on her sofa: as one who would be part of the audience if she found she could, and would go to sleep if she found she couldn’t.
1	It was a politic course of proceeding, and one which could not fail to redound to his advantage in every point of view, since the very circumstance of his having extorted from Ralph Nickleby his real design in introducing his niece to such society, coupled with his extreme disinterestedness in communicating it so freely to his friend, could not but advance his interests in that quarter, and greatly facilitate the passage of coin (pretty frequent and speedy already) from the pockets of Lord Frederick Verisopht to those of Sir Mulberry Hawk.
1	If, while our bodies grow old and withered, our hearts could but retain their early youth and freshness, of what avail would be our sorrows and sufferings!
1	And who have you to thank for all this, Edith?’ ‘You, mother; you.’ ‘Then put your arms round my neck, and kiss me; and show me, Edith, that you know there never was a better Mama than I have been to you.
1	I have no softness there, no--sympathy--sentiment--nonsense.” What was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and looked attentively at me?
1	When he had shown himself and talked a little while, he withdrew with his pocket-instrument, and went bobbing down the cabin, among men of six feet high and upwards, like a light-house walking among lamp-posts.
1	A crop of grass would grow in the chinks of the stone pavement outside Lincoln's Inn Hall, but that the ticket-porters, who have nothing to do beyond sitting in the shade there, with their white aprons over their heads to keep the flies off, grub it up and eat it thoughtfully.
1	I thought it best to bring a sum of money for the purpose.’ ‘Thank you, sir, thank you.
1	Why could not I, going up to bed with my basket of keys, stop to sit down by her fire and accommodate myself for a little while to her, at least as well as to anybody else, and not trouble myself about the harmless things she said to me?
1	As often as the person of the house worked her way round to it--even as soon as he saw that it was coming--he collapsed in an extra degree.
1	It was so precious to me that I look back on these trifles, now, with an aching heart.
1	‘It can’t have been a petrefaction.’ ‘Memoirs of General John Reid, commonly called The Walking Rushlight, sir?
1	Do not think or speak of disparity between us, for there is none, except in all my many imperfections.
1	Since she had begun to work beyond the walls, she had found it necessary to conceal where she lived, and to come and go as secretly as she could, between the free city and the iron gates, outside of which she had never slept in her life.
1	I do not hope that any love and duty I may render in return, will ever make me worthy of your priceless confidence; but with all this knowledge fresh upon me, I can lift my eyes to this dear face, revered as a father’s, loved as a husband’s, sacred to me in my childhood as a friend’s, and solemnly declare that in my lightest thought I have never wronged you; never wavered in the love and the fidelity I owe you!’ She had her arms around the Doctor’s neck, and he leant his head down over her, mingling his grey hair with her dark brown tresses.
1	If she hadn’t stood my friend, sir, I should have been shut up, to lead a dismal life these many years.
1	I only wish I had the command of a clipping privateer to begin with and could carry off the Chancellor and keep him on short allowance until he gave judgment in our cause.
1	My eyes were dim and so were Mr. Peggotty’s; but I repeated in a whisper, ‘With the tide?’ ‘People can’t die, along the coast,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘except when the tide’s pretty nigh out.
1	Mr. Sawyer, being a bachelor, had only one tumbler in the house, which was assigned to Mr. Winkle as a compliment to the visitor, Mr. Ben Allen being accommodated with a funnel with a cork in the narrow end, and Bob Sawyer contented himself with one of those wide-lipped crystal vessels inscribed with a variety of cabalistic characters, in which chemists are wont to measure out their liquid drugs in compounding prescriptions.
1	The other half served for a kitchen, and was fitted up with a stove whose small chimney passed through the roof.
1	‘Now ain’t this capital?’ inquired that jolly personage, when the work of destruction had commenced.
1	"Now, Charley," said I after letting her go on for a little while, "if I am to be ill, my great trust, humanly speaking, is in you.
1	‘It’s difficult to impart the receipt for it, sir,’ returned Venus, ‘because, however particular you may be in allotting your materials, so much will still depend upon the individual gifts, and there being a feeling thrown into it.
1	Does he send clothes on in advance of him?
1	This vehement conjuration the old gentleman accompanies with such a thrust at his granddaughter that it is too much for his strength, and he slips away out of his chair, drawing Mr. Tulkinghorn with him, until he is arrested by Judy, and well shaken.
1	I assure you it never does.’ The Dowager here made a smiling obeisance, rather to the room than to any one in it, and therewith took a final farewell of Papa and Mama Meagles.
1	I knew that the care of it, and the hard duty of preparing his mother to receive it, could only rest with me; and I was anxious to discharge that duty as faithfully as I could.
1	‘Does SHE look like the mother of six?’ ‘Quite ridiculous,’ cried the doctor.
1	Vidth and visdom, Sammy, alvays grows together.’ As Mr. Weller delivered this infallible maxim--the result of many years’ personal experience and observation--he contrived, by a dexterous twist of his body, to get the bottom button of his coat to perform its office.
1	However probable it was to him, she had heard of no such thing.
1	Therefore, what I say to you, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, is, don't you go and let yourself be put out of the way because of my knowing anything of your family affairs."
1	The rest of the madwomen seemed to understand the joke perfectly (not only in this case, but in all the others, except their own), and be highly amused by it.
1	Now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door, except that it was very large.
1	The woman hastily lifts up her eyes as if she would deny that her injury is referable to such a cause.
1	Make up your mind quick, Thquire.
1	You’ll make out that there’s a speck of something or another there, and you’ll know it’s me, and you’ll come down that cause’ay to me.
1	What power of cannon might it take to shake that rusty old man out of his immovable composure?
1	"If it's a point of conspiracy, you needn't take the trouble to mention it.
1	But it came about in this way.
1	‘Mr Boffin’s speeches were detestable to me, shocking to me,’ said Bella, startling that gentleman with another stamp of her little foot.
1	The window-shutters were closed; the street was empty; not a soul had awakened to the business of the day.
1	A further account has been published by Dr. Howe, since the report from which I have just quoted.
1	In the vestry the fire was smoking; and an over-aged and over-worked and under-paid attorney’s clerk, ‘making a search,’ was running his forefinger down the parchment pages of an immense register (one of a long series of similar volumes) gorged with burials.
1	Susan, with an hysterical explosion that was as much a laugh as a sob, and as much a sob as a laugh, answered, ‘Mr Toots!’ The smile that appeared on Florence’s face passed from it in a moment, and her eyes filled with tears.
1	What do you see written there?’ The waiter read: ‘Datchery.’ ‘Now you know my name,’ said the gentleman; ‘Dick Datchery.
1	Therefore Flora said, though still not without a certain boastfulness and triumph in her legacy, that Mr F.’s Aunt was ‘very lively to-day, and she thought they had better go.’ But Mr F.’s Aunt proved so lively as to take the suggestion in unexpected dudgeon and declare that she would not go; adding, with several injurious expressions, that if ‘He’--too evidently meaning Clennam--wanted to get rid of her, ‘let him chuck her out of winder;’ and urgently expressing her desire to see ‘Him’ perform that ceremony.
1	It may be that I should have done better by keeping out of the net into which my destiny has worked me, but I think not, though I dare say you will soon hear, if you have not already heard, a very different opinion.
1	I am a citizen of the world.’ His theatrical air, as he stood with one arm on his hip within the folds of his cloak, together with his manner of disregarding his companion and addressing the opposite wall instead, seemed to intimate that he was rehearsing for the President, whose examination he was shortly to undergo, rather than troubling himself merely to enlighten so small a person as John Baptist Cavalletto.
1	‘Do you know will he be long, sir?’ asked Miss Squeers, with bashful hesitation.
1	The unusual apparition was followed by another bonnet.
1	Is the man born yet, is the spade wrought yet?
1	‘What do you think of this request, Mr. Jinks?’ murmured Mr. Nupkins.
1	These were not easily disposed of; the good Captain being a mighty slow, gruff reader, and frequently stopping at a hard word to give himself such encouragement as ‘Now, my lad!
1	He therefore resolved that he would take advantage of that evening’s freedom to go down to Clennam and Co.’s, easily to be found by the direction set forth in the handbill; and see the place, and ask a question or two there himself.
1	It is not a scene to be forgotten, but it is scarcely one, I think (at all events, as I saw it), to remember with much pleasure, or to covet the looking-on again, in after-life.
1	But they take me on; and Mr. Chillip talks to me; and when we get home, puts some water to my lips; and when I ask his leave to go up to my room, dismisses me with the gentleness of a woman.
1	If these flattering attentions to herself were not sufficient proofs, Sir Mulberry’s confidential friend had suffered the secret to escape him in so many words.
1	‘Can you one?’ inquired the old lady.
1	‘Shall I order a private room, Sir?’ inquired Sam, when they reached the Bush.
1	The man who lay on the ledge of the grating was even chilled.
1	This is to be my little wife!” And she says, half bold and half shy, and half a laughing and half a crying, “Yes, Uncle!
1	Mrs MacStinger in retort, looked at her all over.
1	Before descending into the bowels of the ship, we had passed from the deck into a long narrow apartment, not unlike a gigantic hearse with windows in the sides; having at the upper end a melancholy stove, at which three or four chilly stewards were warming their hands; while on either side, extending down its whole dreary length, was a long, long table, over each of which a rack, fixed to the low roof, and stuck full of drinking-glasses and cruet-stands, hinted dismally at rolling seas and heavy weather.
1	The idea of a girl with a really fine head of hair, having to do it by one flat candle and a few inches of looking-glass!’ ‘You caught George Sampson with it, Bella, bad as your means of dressing it are.’ ‘You low little thing.
1	But, now I believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them, and that they have no part in His mercies.
1	‘Death of my soul!’ he exclaimed.
1	I could forgive him a great deal for doing, with such promptitude, so exactly what I would have done myself!’ Mrs Sparkler was in the full glow of her gratification, when a double knock was heard at the door.
1	Mr John, I am not quite a stranger here.
1	"That's the message," observes Sir Leicester.
1	Mr. Browlow was no less surprised, although his astonishment was not expressed in the same eccentric manner.
1	'Here's somebody wants to see you, to ask you some questions, I suppose.
1	Supple to twist and turn as the Rogue has ever been, he is sufficiently rigid now; and not without much shuffling of attendant feet, and tilting of his bier this way and that way, and peril even of his sliding off it and being tumbled in a heap over the balustrades, can he be got up stairs.
1	I only entreat you to believe, my favourite child, that I have meant to do right.’ He said it earnestly, and to do him justice he had.
1	When such as I, who have no certain roof but the coffinlid, and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse, set our rotten hearts on any man, and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all our wretched lives, who can hope to cure us?
1	Be this as it may, another light was obtained, and Tom was conducted through a maze of rooms, and a labyrinth of passages, to the apartment which had been prepared for his reception, where the girl bade him good-night and left him alone.
1	Imposing on you to give their Grubbers nothing but blame, and to give them nothing but credit!
1	Take mine, Miss Dombey.’ ‘No, no, no,’ said Florence, checking him in the act of impetuously pulling off his own.
1	The great man--the rich relation--the unmarried uncle--who had it in his power to make Morleena an heiress, and the very baby a legatee--was offended.
1	True pride wouldn’t have schoolmasters brought here, like doctors, to look at a bad case.
1	The roads were very heavy for the horses, but the pathway was generally good, so we alighted and walked up all the hills, and liked it so well that we prolonged our walk on the level ground when we got to the top.
1	Quietly, quietly, all the lines of the plan of the great Castle melted one after another.
1	Reflecting on the absurdity of giving way to such feelings, however, he trimmed the light again, and read as follows:-- ‘Yes!--a madman’s!
1	Her next, to go back, and to enter; and this second impulse held her in irresolution on the staircase.
1	You see that I am composed, and is it nothing to me?’ She resumed her steady voice and manner as she said the latter words, and added presently: ‘Not wholly estranged.
1	You have as good a head for understanding such things as I have met with.’ ‘A totally uneducated one, I am sorry to add,’ said Clennam.
1	Peggotty’s promised letter--what a comfortable letter it was!--arrived before ‘the half’ was many weeks old; and with it a cake in a perfect nest of oranges, and two bottles of cowslip wine.
1	At six o’clock every mornin’ they let’s go the ropes at one end, and down falls the lodgers.
1	What I have to do is to respect them, to wish to be admitted to their friendship, to look up at the eminence on which they are placed from my lowlier station--for, whether viewed as tobacco or viewed as the lock, I well know it is lowly--and ever wish them well and happy.’ There really was a genuineness in the poor fellow, and a contrast between the hardness of his hat and the softness of his heart (albeit, perhaps, of his head, too), that was moving.
1	"For there ARE chords, Jobling--" Mr. Jobling begs pardon again.
1	She went to sleep with a little bracelet he had given her clasped upon her arm.
1	“You have just come down?” said Mr. Drummle, edging me a little away with his shoulder.
1	"Nineteen," repeats my Lady thoughtfully.
1	What is it you are not?
1	It’ll begin to be carted off to-morrow.’ ‘Have you been out to take leave of your old friend, sir?’ asked Silas, jocosely.
1	'It's a long time,' said Mr. Bumble.
1	A question now arises, with relation to his nose.’ ‘Flat,’ said Mrs Jiniwin.
1	‘I know her well.’ ‘Look at the broken scull.
1	Nor was it relieved by any glimpse of the little creature who had brought him there.
1	Sir Matthew Pupker takes the chair, and three members of Parliament are positively coming.
1	Now tell me, my love.
1	"Jo," whispers the law-stationer softly as the boy lingers on the step.
1	‘I declare,’ she sobbed, ‘I never was so cut up since your mama and my papa not Doyce and Clennam for this once but give the precious little thing a cup of tea and make her put it to her lips at least pray Arthur do, not even Mr F.’s last illness for that was of another kind and gout is not a child’s affection though very painful for all parties and Mr F. a martyr with his leg upon a rest and the wine trade in itself inflammatory for they will do it more or less among themselves and who can wonder, it seems like a dream I am sure to think of nothing at all this morning and now Mines of money is it really, but you must know my darling love because you never will be strong enough to tell him all about it upon teaspoons, mightn’t it be even best to try the directions of my own medical man for though the flavour is anything but agreeable still I force myself to do it as a prescription and find the benefit, you’d rather not why no my dear I’d rather not but still I do it as a duty, everybody will congratulate you some in earnest and some not and many will congratulate you with all their hearts but none more so I do assure you from the bottom of my own I do myself though sensible of blundering and being stupid, and will be judged by Arthur not Doyce and Clennam for this once so good-bye darling and God bless you and may you be very happy and excuse the liberty, vowing that the dress shall never be finished by anybody else but shall be laid by for a keepsake just as it is and called Little Dorrit though why that strangest of denominations at any time I never did myself and now I never shall!’ Thus Flora, in taking leave of her favourite.
1	‘As I was coming out,’ said Mr Toots, ‘the young woman, in the most unexpected manner, took me into the pantry.’ The Captain seemed, for the moment, to object to this proceeding; and leaning back in his chair, looked at Mr Toots with a distrustful, if not threatening visage.
1	It is distant about a hundred and twenty miles from Cincinnati, but there is a macadamised road (rare blessing!)
1	We found our old lodging vacant, and in half an hour were quietly established there, as if we had never gone away.
1	Occupied with such thoughts as these, and a crowd of others all tending to the same point, I continued to pace the street for two long hours; at length the rain began to descend heavily, and then over-powered by fatigue though no less interested than I had been at first, I engaged the nearest coach and so got home.
1	‘It is so,’ the Secretary admitted.
1	I have reason to know that a local friend of ours (on whom I beg to bestow a passing but a hearty malediction, with the kind permission of my reverend friend) sneaks to and fro, and dodges up and down.
1	Waiting until they were all tolerably quiet and composed again, Nicholas, who stood in need of some rest after his long journey, retired to his own room, and throwing himself, dressed as he was, upon the bed, fell into a sound sleep.
1	And here he gave another impudent look, which made Tom very wroth, because as you all know, gentlemen, to hear an old fellow, who ought to know better, talking about these things, is very unpleasant--nothing more so.
1	An excited imagination might suppose that there was something in them so terrific as to drive the rest of the composition, not only the attendant big-legged boys, but the clouds and flowers and pillars too--in short, the very body and soul of Allegory, and all the brains it has--stark mad.
1	They must have powerful motives for a secret residence, or be reduced to a destitute condition indeed, who seek a refuge in Jacob's Island.
1	Why do you listen?’ asked the lady.
1	We now turned into another narrow street.
1	George has frequently told me before that he's a Lincolnshire man, and I says to my old Lignum that night, 'Lignum, that's his mother for five and for-ty pound!'"
1	‘I don’t know whether you happen to have read many books of African Travel, Mr Rokesmith?’ said R. W. ‘I have read several.’ ‘Well, you know, there’s usually a King George, or a King Boy, or a King Sambo, or a King Bill, or Bull, or Rum, or Junk, or whatever name the sailors may have happened to give him.’ ‘Where?’ asked Rokesmith.
1	The only utterance with which he indulged his sorrow, was the frequent exclamation that his brother was gone, alone; that they had been together in the outset of their lives, that they had fallen into misfortune together, that they had kept together through their many years of poverty, that they had remained together to that day; and that his brother was gone alone, alone!
1	I dare say he don’t.
1	‘Come, Miss Trotwood,’ said Mr. Wickfield.
1	I felt for my old self as the dead may feel if they ever revisit these scenes.
1	‘Who is it?’ cried Sam again.
1	Rumour, always flying bat-like about Cook's Court and skimming in and out at everybody's windows, does say that Mrs. Snagsby is jealous and inquisitive and that Mr. Snagsby is sometimes worried out of house and home, and that if he had the spirit of a mouse he wouldn't stand it.
1	‘Yes, Sir, and supper,’ added Pott.
1	How many old recollections, and how many dormant sympathies, does Christmas time awaken!
1	"It's not convenient," said Scrooge, "and it's not fair.
1	"He is a fine young soldier now, Mr. George, by the name of Carstone.
1	When I look at you,’ said the lawyer, quitting his stool, and standing before the fire with his back towards it, ‘I am reminded of the sweetest little face that ever my eyes beheld.
1	The object of this new liking was not among his myrmidons.
1	“Make the best of it, my dear sir,” said Stryver; “say no more about it; thank you again for allowing me to sound you; good night!” Mr. Lorry was out in the night, before he knew where he was.
1	‘Though as to master,’ said he, glancing again at Rachael, ‘not master onny more.
1	Oh, my fellow-countrymen, what warning but this did I give you?
1	The Bar had no more tenderness or poetry in it, than the bar of a public-house.
1	"On the contrary, it seems to do you good, miss, judging from your appearance."
1	Now you know me, don't you?"
1	Shall I remind you that I am not, and that I never was, anything but the friend whom you agreed to trust?
1	A wave as of triumph?
1	Have you lurked to my house fifty times, and slept sound in a corner when you had no other bed but the paving-stones, and do you talk to me like this!
1	That time, to which he has so long, and certainly with great constancy, looked forward, is now come.
1	"I have got it here, sir."
1	'What a pity, Bill, my dear, that there's none quite ready to be done.'
1	Sedate and solemn were the score of rubbers in which Mr. Pickwick and the old lady played together; uproarious was the mirth of the round table.
1	he asks in an insinuating tone.
1	'So, you're going on to Lower Halliford, are you?'
1	In our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink, and I know we talked too much.
1	‘Well, Trot,’ she began, ‘what do you think of the proctor plan?
1	Arrived at the table, she took her rigid seat, after favouring Mr Sampson with a glare for himself, which caused the young gentleman to retire to his place in much confusion.
1	He had already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name he had relinquished, was the one condition--fully intelligible now--that her father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he had still exacted on the morning of their marriage.
1	It was the face of Florence, and through all the terrified avoidance it expressed, there was pity in it, sorrow, a grateful tender memory.
1	"This woman understands me," Mr. Tulkinghorn thinks as she lets her glance fall again.
1	Nothing was the better for it, or thought of being so.
1	That is his employer, gentlemen.
1	It’s amazing what places they used to put the guineas in, wrapped up in rags.
1	And let me remind you that the door is standing open, and your young friend waiting for you on the stairs.’ ‘When I accompanied that youth here, sir, I did so with the purpose of adding, as a man whom you should not be permitted to put aside, in case you put him aside as a boy, that his instinct is correct and right.’ Thus Bradley Headstone, with great effort and difficulty.
1	‘Pray,’ said Kate, in great confusion, while these preliminaries were in course of completion.
1	We had other visitors besides Ada.
1	Durdles taps, that wall represented by that hammer, and says, after good sounding: “Something betwixt us!”  Sure enough, some rubbish has been left in that same six-foot space by Durdles’s men!’ Jasper opines that such accuracy ‘is a gift.’ ‘I wouldn’t have it at a gift,’ returns Durdles, by no means receiving the observation in good part.
1	I overheard that he began to ask the drivers of coaches and other vehicles coming towards us what passengers they had seen in other coaches and vehicles that were in advance.
1	Here were the rotten beam, the sinking arch, the sapped and mouldering wall, the lowly trench of earth, the stately tomb on which no epitaph remained--all--marble, stone, iron, wood, and dust--one common monument of ruin.
1	Here are the other passengers.
1	‘Glad to hear it, Thquire.
1	Sam had put up the steps, and was preparing to jump upon the box, when he felt himself gently touched on the shoulder; and, looking round, his father stood before him.
1	He went, like the rain, among the just and unjust, doing all the good he could, and neither proclaiming it in the synagogues nor at the corner of streets.
1	I go to seek an hotel!’ But, there his eyes encountered Cavalletto, who was still at his post.
1	‘Dombey,’ said the Major, ‘I’m glad to see you.
1	It’s rather a good name, I think, sir.’ ‘A very good name, indeed,’ said Mr. Pickwick, wholly unable to repress a smile.
1	‘Our friend had a remote connexion with that event,’ said the Major, ‘and all the credit that belongs to her, J.
1	'Wait quietly only one instant, while I speak to aunt.'
1	He had a glass and bottle in his hand, and was in the act of drinking.
1	Here, all the light clouds of the more solemn part of the proceedings passed away; every face shone forth joyously; and nothing was to be heard but congratulations and commendations.
1	I have nothing to do with it indeed!’ Kit looked at her with his eyes stretched wide; and opened and shut his mouth a great many times; but couldn’t get out one word.
1	Then they go upstairs, Mr. Weevle heavily, and Mr. Guppy (for it is he) very lightly indeed.
1	At last Mrs. Micawber resolved to move into the prison, where Mr. Micawber had now secured a room to himself.
1	“Of course, there can be no objection to your being sorry for him, and I'd put down a five-pound note myself to get him out of it.
1	He had meant to go away to-day, but clung to this tie in the house as the last and only thing left to him.
1	‘I feel it as a wery high compliment, sir; it’s a wery honorable thing to them, as they knows how to reward merit werever they meets it.
1	I don’t think I could have done more, then, without letting my hold on father go; but they sometimes lie heavy on my mind.
1	And reassured, "Since that's the case--" "Yes!
1	Personally, or by letter, you will always find me here, sir, with my shoulder to the wheel."
1	The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in advance, and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry took, as though he dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself about here, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over his shoulder, took out a key.
1	He has mastered papa’s weaknesses, fostered them, and taken advantage of them, until--to say all that I mean in a word, Trotwood,--until papa is afraid of him.’ There was more that she might have said; more that she knew, or that she suspected; I clearly saw.
1	I’m struck of a heap, and can’t do it,’ he said, impatiently.
1	And what’s this in dancing-shoes?
1	“I want to know no more than I know.
1	Your habit of interrupting without having the least thing in the world to say, distracts one.
1	“Why,” the attorney said to me one day, “if I wanted this office to give me two or three thousand pounds instead of take it, I couldn’t have more trouble about it.” “You are right, old fellow,”  I told him, “and in future you’ll know that we have something to do here.”’ The pleasant young Barnacle finished by once more laughing heartily.
1	Bray and his daughter were sitting there alone.
1	Bob said he didn't believe there ever was such a goose cooked.
1	‘Let us have some of your best wine to-day, waiter,’ said old Wardle, rubbing his hands.
1	And I called him a quantity of names;’ shaking her head over her work, and dropping tears.
1	So, by degrees he calmed into the better state, when he could raise his thoughts much higher, and draw comfort down.
1	Very uncomfortable.’ ‘They’re all on ‘em men as has met vith some disappointment in life,’ said Mr. Weller, senior.
1	Others rather inclined to the belief that he had projected some distant tour, and was at present occupied in effecting the preliminary arrangements; but this again was stoutly denied by Sam himself, who had unequivocally stated, when cross-examined by Mary, that no new journeys were to be undertaken.
1	Mr. Pickwick was excited and indignant.
1	What, in the name of the Father of Lies, own father to yourself, was you called at that time?” “Barsad,” said another voice, striking in.
1	‘Are you going?’ said Miss Sophy, whose heart sank within her at the result of her stratagem, but who affected a light indifference notwithstanding.
1	There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes on the hearth.
1	I have no design whatever.
1	Mr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the journey, and had brought with them, besides travelling cloaks and wrappers, bread and meat, wine, and hot coffee.
1	Its width is so contracted at one point, indeed, that they are obliged to warp round by means of a rope.
1	We bestow a fragment of our minds upon you, sir, you see!"
1	Is he quite heartbroken?’ Miss Tox was of a tender nature, and there was something in this appeal that moved her very much.
1	‘It ain’t right of you to ask it, Miss Floy, for you know I can’t refuse you, but Mrs Richards and me will see what can be done, if Mrs Richards likes, I may wish, you see, to take a voyage to Chaney, Mrs Richards, but I mayn’t know how to leave the London Docks.’ Richards assented to the proposition.
1	It is one of those nooks where a few smoky sparrows twitter in smoky trees, as though they called to one another, ‘Let us play at country,’ and where a few feet of garden-mould and a few yards of gravel enable them to do that refreshing violence to their tiny understandings.
1	After this, he stirred the fire; after that, he rubbed his hands and looked at Sam.
1	There was something in the picture of Mr. Turveydrop bestowing his deportment on Mr. Jellyby that quite took my fancy.
1	'I hope,' said Mr. Bumble, looking about him with great ruefulness, as Mr. Grimwig disappeared with the two old women: 'I hope that this unfortunate little circumstance will not deprive me of my porochial office?'
1	A few hampers, half-a-dozen broken bottles, and such-like rubbish, may be thrown there, when the tenant first moves in, but nothing more; and there they remain until he goes away again: the damp straw taking just as long to moulder as it thinks proper: and mingling with the scanty box, and stunted everbrowns, and broken flower-pots, that are scattered mournfully about--a prey to ‘blacks’ and dirt.
1	To see him splitting away at that pace, and cutting round the corners, and knocking up again' the posts, and starting on again as if he was made of iron as well as them, and me with the wipe in my pocket, singing out arter him--oh, my eye!'
1	It was a wretched little shop, with a roof that any man standing in it could touch with his hand; little better than a cellar or cave, down three steps.
1	The confidences of lovely women are not to be slighted.
1	On one—a shop, which never has anything in the window, and never has the door open—is painted in large characters, ‘THE CITY LUNCH.’  At another, which looks like a backway to somewhere else, but is an independent building in itself, oysters are procurable in every style.
1	No struggle, no consciousness of peril, no entreaty—and yet I never saw _that_ before.’ With a start.
1	If ever delay was dangerous, it's dangerous now; and if ever you couldn't afterwards forgive yourself for causing it, this is the time.
1	When we got to our journey’s end, our first pursuit was to look about for a little lodging for Peggotty, where her brother could have a bed.
1	The many sounds become so deadened that the change is like putting cotton in the ears, or having the head thickly muffled.
1	‘No, Bitzer,’ continued Mrs. Sparsit, ‘say an individual, and I will hear you; say Mr. Thomas, and you must excuse me.’ ‘With the usual exception, ma’am,’ said Bitzer, trying back, ‘of an individual.’ ‘Ah—h!’  Mrs. Sparsit repeated the ejaculation, the shake of the head over her tea-cup, and the long gulp, as taking up the conversation again at the point where it had been interrupted.
1	I think we had better talk about this, really, Ada.
1	He gazed for a few seconds in the face; then stooped to kiss it--oh, how tenderly!--and drew a handkerchief before it.
1	"I've had the pleasure of seeing you before.
1	The men in the carpet caps go on tumbling the furniture about; and the gentlemen with the pens and ink make out inventories of it, and sit upon pieces of furniture never made to be sat upon, and eat bread and cheese from the public-house on other pieces of furniture never made to be eaten on, and seem to have a delight in appropriating precious articles to strange uses.
1	He sees my Lady pretty often, too; and he and she are as composed, and as indifferent, and take as little heed of one another, as ever.
1	She still preserved her proud manner, but there was a touch of softness in her voice, as she answered: ‘I justify nothing.
1	Is that a bag?’ he looked hard at it; sooth to say, it required hard looking at to be seen at all in a dimly lighted room: ‘and is it your property, my dear?’ ‘Yes, sir.
1	How it is so, is no matter; that is my story, and I keep my story to myself.
1	His broad chest heaves with pleasure.
1	It had been mentioned at the Daybreak, she remarked, on the authority of the journals, that he had been kept in prison for his own safety.
1	Now I know ye did.
1	As to the latter, when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in “the Captain's” pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards.
1	I much prefer it as it is.’ Miss Tox, with head bent down, still clipped among the plants.
1	It was one of those scenes of life and animation, caught in its very brightest and freshest moments, which can scarcely fail to please; for if the eye be tired of show and glare, or the ear be weary with a ceaseless round of noise, the one may repose, turn almost where it will, on eager, happy, and expectant faces, and the other deaden all consciousness of more annoying sounds in those of mirth and exhilaration.
1	But when we got into a warm room in an excellent hotel and sat down, comfortably washed and dressed, to an early breakfast (for it was too late to think of going to bed), Deal began to look more cheerful.
1	In the course of the dinner and the sitting which succeeded it, Mr. Pott descending, for a few moments, to domestic topics, informed Mr. Pickwick that the air of Eatanswill not agreeing with his lady, she was then engaged in making a tour of different fashionable watering-places with a view to the recovery of her wonted health and spirits; this was a delicate veiling of the fact that Mrs. Pott, acting upon her often- repeated threat of separation, had, in virtue of an arrangement negotiated by her brother, the lieutenant, and concluded by Mr. Pott, permanently retired with the faithful bodyguard upon one moiety or half part of the annual income and profits arising from the editorship and sale of the Eatanswill _Gazette_.
1	But the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this; and the man in faded black, mounting the breach first, produced his plunder.
1	‘I’ll go upon my walk at once,’ said Walter, ‘and then I shall be out of the way, Captain Cuttle.’ ‘Take a good long ‘un, my lad!’ replied the Captain, calling after him.
1	What could it do, his boy had asked him.
1	This is my frugal breakfast.
1	At least, he ain’t a hated rival,’ said Mr Toots, stopping short, on second thoughts, and taking away his hand; ‘what should I hate him for?
1	‘Sir,’ rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, ‘say no more.
1	The present Barnacle, holding Mr Clennam’s card in his hand, had a youthful aspect, and the fluffiest little whisker, perhaps, that ever was seen.
1	Strong mental agitation and disturbance was no novelty to him, even before his late sufferings.
1	Not the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his back, but those to which his face was addressed.
1	Am I never to hear the last of this?
1	He never looked so serene as he did then.
1	But when Florence, taking down his pipe from the mantel-shelf gave it into his hand, and entreated him to smoke it, the good Captain was so bewildered by her attention that he held it as if he had never held a pipe, in all his life.
1	Suddenly, he took the desperate resolution to going back to London.
1	‘There,’ said Squeers, when he had quite done; ‘rub away as hard as you like, you won’t rub that off in a hurry.
1	‘Where have you worked all your life?’ ‘Mostly underground, Sir, ‘till I got married.
1	Let’s wet it, in a mouth-fill of rum and milk, T’otherest Governor.’ Bradley assenting, went with him into an early public-house, haunted by unsavoury smells of musty hay and stale straw, where returning carts, farmers’ men, gaunt dogs, fowls of a beery breed, and certain human nightbirds fluttering home to roost, were solacing themselves after their several manners; and where not one of the nightbirds hovering about the sloppy bar failed to discern at a glance in the passion-wasted nightbird with respectable feathers, the worst nightbird of all.
1	His head was sunk upon his bosom; and he slumbered again.
1	Discovering his mistake after a while, he appeared to grow rather sleepy and discontented, and had more than once suggested the propriety of an immediate departure, when the door opened, and the child herself appeared.
1	By dint of alternate threats, promises, and bribes, the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake the commission.
1	He had no sooner adopted this resolution, than he conveyed as much honesty into his face as it was capable of expressing, and sympathised with Mr Swiveller exceedingly.
1	Onward they bore, amidst the roaring mass of water, with a speed and force which nothing could resist; and striking the stem of the foremost vessel, crushed her beneath their keel.
1	Let 'em knock me well about the head.
1	'There was two of 'em in it,' continued Blathers; 'and they had a boy with 'em; that's plain from the size of the window.
1	'Put your head out of the winder,' replied Sikes.
1	But Conveyancing and he had made such a very indifferent marriage of it that they had separated by consent—if there can be said to be separation where there has never been coming together.
1	‘And without anticipating any of the points which you, as a man of business, have of course reserved, I am free to say to you that I think something may come of this.
1	The listener’s blood ran colder now than ever it had done in frost and snow, but he knocked again.
1	Next Mrs. Crupp said it was clear she couldn’t be in two places at once (which I felt to be reasonable), and that ‘a young gal’ stationed in the pantry with a bedroom candle, there never to desist from washing plates, would be indispensable.
1	'She goes abroad to-night,' said Fagin, 'and on the right errand, I'm sure; for she has been alone all day, and the man she is afraid of will not be back much before daybreak.
1	‘Now, Joe!’ And Joe having been at length awakened, the two friends departed in Mr. Wardle’s carriage, which in common humanity had a dickey behind for the fat boy, who, if there had been a footboard instead, would have rolled off and killed himself in his very first nap.
1	‘It may be a sacrifice,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘to immure one’s-self in a Cathedral town; but surely, Mr. Copperfield, if it is a sacrifice in me, it is much more a sacrifice in a man of Mr. Micawber’s abilities.’ ‘Oh!
1	He went round to our children, one after another, as if he wath a theeking for a child he know’d; and then he come to me, and throwd hithelf up behind, and thtood on hith two forelegth, weak ath he wath, and then he wagged hith tail and died.
1	Finding such clerk on Wemmick's post that morning, I knew what was going on; but I was not sorry to have Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick together, as Wemmick would then hear for himself that I said nothing to compromise him.
1	I ask you, do YOU mean to tell me?’ Mr Lammle falls silent again, and they walk as before.
1	The Captain’s visage on these occasions presented one of the finest examples of combination and succession of expression ever observed.
1	‘But,’ he said, looking Mr Dorrit in the face for the first time, and immediately afterwards dropping his eyes to the buttons of Mr Dorrit’s waistcoat; ‘if we speak of attractions, your daughter ought to be the subject of our conversation.
1	The last Lord Chancellor handled it neatly, when, correcting Mr. Blowers, the eminent silk gown who said that such a thing might happen when the sky rained potatoes, he observed, "or when we get through Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Mr. Blowers"--a pleasantry that particularly tickled the maces, bags, and purses.
1	At a short distance from this building is another called the Alms House, that is to say, the workhouse of New York.
1	Having dined as plainly as the establishment and the Courier would let him, and having taken a short sleep by the fire for his better recovery from Mrs Finching, he set out in a hackney-cabriolet alone.
1	I tell this lightly, but it was no light thing to me.
1	He’s no public offender, bless you, now!
1	“You know, Pip,” said Joe, solemnly, with his last bite in his cheek, and speaking in a confidential voice, as if we two were quite alone, “you and me is always friends, and I'd be the last to tell upon you, any time.
1	After several relapses into business-absorption, Mr. Lorry had become the Doctor's friend, and the quiet street-corner was the sunny part of his life.
1	That he laboured under some mental or bodily indisposition, and that it was one of no slight kind so to affect a man like him, was sufficiently shown by his haggard face, jaded air, and hollow languid eyes: which he raised at last with a start and a hasty glance around him, as one who suddenly awakes from sleep, and cannot immediately recognise the place in which he finds himself.
1	Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands.
1	Bella was so fluttered by the request, and by the short narrative he had feelingly given her, that there never was a more timely smelling-bottle than John’s knock.
1	On the profits of his intrepidity, Mrs Sparkler and Mrs Merdle, inhabiting different floors of the genteel little temple of inconvenience to which the smell of the day before yesterday’s soup and coach-horses was as constant as Death to man, arrayed themselves to fight it out in the lists of Society, sworn rivals.
1	Veneering pervades the legislative lobbies, intent upon entrapping his fellow-legislators to dinner.
1	I say we went over, but I was pushed over by Pumblechook, exactly as if I had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick; indeed, it was the general impression in Court that I had been taken red-handed; for, as Pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd, I heard some people say, “What's he done?” and others, “He's a young 'un, too, but looks bad, don't he?” One person of mild and benevolent aspect even gave me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent young man fitted up with a perfect sausage-shop of fetters, and entitled TO BE READ IN MY The Hall was a queer place, I thought, with higher pews in it than a church,--and with people hanging over the pews looking on,--and with mighty Justices (one with a powdered head) leaning back in chairs, with folded arms, or taking snuff, or going to sleep, or writing, or reading the newspapers,--and with some shining black portraits on the walls, which my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and sticking-plaster.
1	My stay in Philadelphia was very short, but what I saw of its society, I greatly liked.
1	“It must be forty feet high,” said they, grimly; and never moved.
1	I recollect when I was a very young child having a fancy that the reflection of the moon in water was a path to Heaven, trodden by the spirits of good people on their way to God; and this old feeling often came over me again, when I watched it on a tranquil night at sea.
1	Which?’ ‘Chicken,’ returned Mr Toots, ‘your expressions are coarse, and your meaning is obscure.’ ‘Why, then, I tell you what, Master,’ said the Chicken.
1	The Captain put down the paper, took off his spectacles, and brought his eyes to bear on the deserter.
1	Whether he had really been to any one, or whether he had been all that time traversing the streets, was never known.
1	I asked him how he liked his profession.
1	Florence endeavoured to believe that the Captain was right; but the Nipper, with her arms tight folded, shook her head in resolute denial, and had no more trust in Bunsby than in Mr Perch himself.
1	I can do poor Arthur no good now, that I see; and you needn’t be afraid of me.
1	said Mr. Bumble, filled with dismal thoughts.
1	He knew that she would not insist upon his leaving her.
1	We see Blood in a nose, and we know it.
1	Do not tell me that I had, tonight of all nights in my life!’ ‘You might have been well married,’ said her mother, ‘twenty times at least, Edith, if you had given encouragement enough.’ ‘No!
1	‘I have presumed,’ said Mr Carker, ‘to solicit an interview, and I have ventured to describe it as being one of business, because--’ ‘Perhaps you are charged by Mr Dombey with some message of reproof,’ said Edith ‘You possess Mr Dombey’s confidence in such an unusual degree, Sir, that you would scarcely surprise me if that were your business.’ ‘I have no message to the lady who sheds a lustre upon his name,’ said Mr Carker.
1	It is only this moment broached; and naturally I hurry to you the moment it _is_ broached.’ ‘Your marriage, Fanny?’ ‘My precious child,’ said Fanny, ‘don’t anticipate me.
1	Is there anything you want that would lessen the hardship of this confinement?"
1	And vegetable marrows likewise.’ ‘Confound his impudence!’ said Nicholas, firing immediately.
1	‘I’ll teach you manners, my fine fellow, one of these fine mornings.’ ‘Thank’ee,’ said Sam.
1	You are more beautiful in anger than in repose.
1	The simple fact was, that Oliver, instead of possessing too little feeling, possessed rather too much; and was in a fair way of being reduced, for life, to a state of brutal stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he had received.
1	Sleep came upon me as it came on many other outcasts, against whom house-doors were locked, and house-dogs barked, that night--and I dreamed of lying on my old school-bed, talking to the boys in my room; and found myself sitting upright, with Steerforth’s name upon my lips, looking wildly at the stars that were glistening and glimmering above me.
1	Hence, Mr. Snagsby, at last hearing the cock at the little dairy in Cursitor Street go into that disinterested ecstasy of his on the subject of daylight, says, drawing a long breath, though the most patient of men, "I thought you was dead, I am sure!"
1	‘The place of their retreat is indeed discovered,’ he said, ‘at last.
1	Is Master Snawley to come along with us?’ ‘No, no, no,’ replied Smike, drawing back, and clinging to Nicholas.
1	You see us here, quiet in our own home; our anxieties set at rest, our home restored to us; and knowing that, dear Trotwood, you know all.’ ‘All, Agnes?’ said I.
1	‘Wasn’t it a curious thing that they should run in little Altro’s head?
1	Major C. Gally, Commander of the battalion, resenting     this, called at the office and demanded the author’s name; that of     Mr. P. Arpin was given to him, who was absent at the time.
1	Down Easters and Johnny Cakes can follow if they please.
1	‘It has been my lot,’ he observed, ‘to meet, in the diversified panorama of human existence, with an occasional oasis, but never with one so green, so gushing, as the present!’ At another time I should have been amused by this; but I felt that we were all constrained and uneasy, and I watched Mr. Micawber so anxiously, in his vacillations between an evident disposition to reveal something, and a counter-disposition to reveal nothing, that I was in a perfect fever.
1	Her patience is unexhausted by hours.
1	‘I am obliged,’ continued Madame Mantalini, ‘since our late misfortunes, to pay Miss Knag a great deal of money for having her name in the business, and I really cannot afford to encourage him in all his wastefulness.
1	He had given so few signs of reason, that a by-word went among his companions that his brain had been frozen up in a mighty frost which prevailed at St John’s, New Brunswick, at the period of his birth there, and had never thawed from that hour.
1	The English customer was not without his reflections then, that it might be a good deed to seize that arm, lift it, and strike under it sharp and deep.
1	“O, Lord!” This was the only retort--except glass or crockery--that the heavy creature was capable of making; but, I became as highly incensed by it as if it had been barbed with wit, and I immediately rose in my place and said that I could not but regard it as being like the honorable Finch's impudence to come down to that Grove,--we always talked about coming down to that Grove, as a neat Parliamentary turn of expression,--down to that Grove, proposing a lady of whom he knew nothing.
1	You must endeavour, sir, to change it.
1	Nor, how there were echoes all about her, sweet in her ears, of the many times her father had told her that he found her more devoted to him married (if that could be) than single, and of the many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed to divide her love for him or her help to him, and asked her “What is the magic secret, my darling, of your being everything to all of us, as if there were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried, or to have too much to do?” But, there were other echoes, from a distance, that rumbled menacingly in the corner all through this space of time.
1	‘I drink to you, Bazzard; Mr. Edwin, success to Mr. Bazzard!’ ‘Success to Mr. Bazzard!’ echoed Edwin, with a totally unfounded appearance of enthusiasm, and with the unspoken addition: ‘What in, I wonder!’ ‘And May!’ pursued Mr. Grewgious—‘I am not at liberty to be definite—May!—my conversational powers are so very limited that I know I shall not come well out of this—May!—it ought to be put imaginatively, but I have no imagination—May!—the thorn of anxiety is as nearly the mark as I am likely to get—May it come out at last!’ Mr. Bazzard, with a frowning smile at the fire, put a hand into his tangled locks, as if the thorn of anxiety were there; then into his waistcoat, as if it were there; then into his pockets, as if it were there.
1	He has a very knowing look, but that he always has.
1	But I’ll provide for her!
1	"I am a mortal," Scrooge remonstrated, "and liable to fall."
1	Besides coming every Saturday or Sunday and remaining with us until Monday morning, he sometimes rode out on horseback unexpectedly and passed the evening with us and rode back again early next day.
1	‘“Now,” said the figure, glancing at the hunting-knife, “are you ready for me?” ‘“Not quite,” rejoined the baron; “I must finish this pipe first.” ‘“Look sharp then,” said the figure.
1	Do hear my words, and let me save you yet, for better things.'
1	Can I say of her innocent and girlish beauty, that it faded, and was no more, when its breath falls on my cheek now, as it fell that night?
1	Some wildly passionate ideas of the river dissolve under the spell of the moonlight on the Cathedral and the graves, and the remembrance of his sister, and the thought of what he owes to the good man who has but that very day won his confidence and given him his pledge.
1	‘Well you see,’ said Mr Inspector, ‘it was a question of making a move.
1	Working at his chambers in the Temple, with a busy aspect, and his hair (where he is not bald) made more rebellious than ever by the constant friction of his lawyer’s-wig, I come, in a later time, upon my dear old Traddles.
1	Much as Peggotty would have disliked such a service, I believe she would have retained it, for my sake, in preference to the best upon earth.
1	‘Ah!’ rejoined the man, taking his handkerchief out of his hat and wiping his face, ‘he always will, you know.
1	'I know what it was,' said Mr. Giles; 'it was the gate.'
1	He had an odd momentary appearance upon him of having forgotten his hat, when Mr. Sapsea now touched it; and he clapped his hand up to his head as if with some vague expectation of finding another hat upon it.
1	He became aware of that again.
1	It was accordingly settled that Mr. Tupman, Mr. Winkle, and Mr. Snodgrass, should all wear fancy-dresses.
1	‘I suppose you’ve heard what’s going forward, Mr. Weller?’ said Mrs. Bardell.
1	He dwelt on this: and said several times that unless they tried to assimilate themselves to their conquerors, they must be swept away before the strides of civilised society.
1	Mann, I am going to London.'
1	He waylays the smaller boys to punch their unprotected heads, and calls challenges after me in the open streets.
1	The eldest boy ran out to fetch some milk, the second dragged two stools towards the door, and the youngest crept to his mother’s gown, and looked at the strangers from beneath his sunburnt hand.
1	Overpowered, notwithstanding his late prolonged slumbers, by the fatigues of the last few days, the dwarf lost no time in creeping to his dainty house, and was soon dreaming in his hammock.
1	That I am greatly dissatisfied with it.
1	'No more of it for me, thank 'ee, Fagin,' replied Mr. Chitling; 'I've had enough.
1	Mr. Gregsbury reflected, blew his nose, threw himself further back in his chair, came forward again, leaning his elbows on the table, made a triangle with his two thumbs and his two forefingers, and tapping his nose with the apex thereof, replied (smiling as he said it), ‘I deny everything.’ At this unexpected answer, a hoarse murmur arose from the deputation; and the same gentleman who had expressed an opinion relative to the gammoning nature of the introductory speech, again made a monosyllabic demonstration, by growling out ‘Resign!’ Which growl being taken up by his fellows, swelled into a very earnest and general remonstrance.
1	It was ridiculous enough to know what an embarrassing meeting it would be, and how we never could pretend to have an inclination of our own, either of us.
1	The hermit Secretary, who creeps up and down the back stairs, and is never seen!’ ‘I don’t know about his creeping up and down the back stairs,’ said Bella, rather contemptuously, ‘further than knowing that he does no such thing; and as to his never being seen, I should be content never to have seen him, though he is quite as visible as you are.
1	On the steps of a church, awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils, stands the Spy and prison-sheep.
1	She would not consent to leave him anywhere but in his own room, and she saw him lie down in his clothes upon his bed, and covered him with her own hands.
1	‘Only me, Quilp,’ replied a woman’s voice.
1	Pray, pray!’  She trembled, and was excessively agitated; getting behind Rachael, when Rachael tried to reassure her; and not seeming to know what she was about.
1	If you’re happy or merry ever, you come here to say, along with that chap, that you’re sorry for it.
1	A change had been gradually stealing over her, in the time of her loneliness and sorrow.
1	If I shake and tremble, as we pass the gallows, don't you mind, but hurry on.
1	This dialogue made us all uneasy, and me very uneasy.
1	All that can be imparted, he can impart.
1	How the Circumlocution Office, in a Minute, number eight thousand seven hundred and forty, ‘saw no reason to reverse the decision at which my lords had arrived.’ How the Circumlocution Office, being reminded that my lords had arrived at no decision, shelved the business.
1	Towards the last, I could understand some few syllables that she said to me, by placing my ear close to her lips.
1	She sat sobbing and murmuring behind it, that, if I was uneasy, why had I ever been married?
1	I’m glad your eyes are red with crying.
1	“Alexandre Manette,” said Defarge in his ear, following the letters with his swart forefinger, deeply engrained with gunpowder.
1	Captain Cuttle, then, with great respect and admiration, raised the hand of Florence to his lips, and standing off a little (for the island was not large enough for three), beamed on her from the soap and water like a new description of Triton.
1	‘Not about money, I hope?
1	Sir Mulberry, conceiving that he had silenced him effectually, could not suppress his triumph, or forbear from following up what he conceived to be his advantage.
1	We arranged that Herbert should not come home to dinner before going to Mill Pond Bank that evening; that he should not go there at all to-morrow evening, Tuesday; that he should prepare Provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house, on Wednesday, when he saw us approach, and not sooner; that all the arrangements with him should be concluded that Monday night; and that he should be communicated with no more in any way, until we took him on board.
1	It was difficult to believe that a night so long to me, could be short to anybody else.
1	‘The day before yesterday,’ said Newman, ‘your uncle received this letter.
1	Let him take that well to heart,’ said Mr. Grewgious.
1	As he spoke, he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his companion, carefully, as though unwilling that the chinking of money should be heard without.
1	said Charlotte, bursting into a hearty laugh, in which she was joined by Noah; after which they both looked scornfully at poor Oliver Twist, as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest corner of the room, and ate the stale pieces which had been specially reserved for him.
1	don’t, Mr. Weller.’ ‘Don’t what, my dear?’ said Sam.
1	Of a sudden, in the height of his misery, he puts Mr. before it.
1	This perhaps in some sort arose from Mr Podsnap’s blushing young person being, so to speak, all cheek; whereas there is a possibility that there may be young persons of a rather more complex organization.
1	‘One thing more,’ he said.
1	He stood looking at the gentleman, therefore, with a frightened, self-convicted, and remorseful air.
1	cries Mrs. Snagsby from the stairs.
1	Paul, come here!’ The child obeyed: and Mr Dombey took him on his knee.
1	"You do," she said very shortly.
1	I suppose I’m no worse than anybody else;’ or, reckless of all moral obligations, answered boldly ‘Yes:’ and with some irritation too, as though they would add, ‘I should like to know what you see in _me_, sir, particularly, to justify suspicion!’ Notwithstanding this high tone of courage and confidence, I could not but observe that very few remained long over their wine; and that everybody had an unusual love of the open air; and that the favourite and most coveted seats were invariably those nearest to the door.
1	At length one of those rich relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had been sacrificed, as others are often--it is no uncommon case--died, and to repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning, left him his panacea for all griefs--Money.
1	Heavy in figure, movement, and comprehension,--in the sluggish complexion of his face, and in the large, awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as he himself lolled about in a room,--he was idle, proud, niggardly, reserved, and suspicious.
1	She brought her young husband home one day, and they and their young fledglings have their nest upstairs.
1	‘Or possibly,’ said the man with the camp-stool, ‘the gentleman’s second may feel himself affronted with some observations which fell from me at an early period of this meeting; if so, I shall be happy to give him satisfaction immediately.’ Mr. Snodgrass hastily professed himself very much obliged with the handsome offer of the gentleman who had spoken last, which he was only induced to decline by his entire contentment with the whole proceedings.
1	His name, and crime, and term of suffering, are unknown, even to the officer who delivers him his daily food.
1	The sight of her in her beauty, almost changed into a woman without his knowledge, may have struck out some such moments even in his life of pride.
1	It may be so, to such as you who know no righteousness, and no appointment except Satan’s.
1	‘Ah, Richards!’ said Mrs Chick, with a sigh.
1	She had only a bruise or two about her,--nothing for a tramp,--but the backs of her hands were lacerated, and the question was, Was it with finger-nails?
1	I ought first to explain to your ladyship," Mr. Guppy sits on the edge of a chair and puts his hat on the carpet at his feet, "that Miss Summerson, whose image, as I formerly mentioned to your ladyship, was at one period of my life imprinted on my 'eart until erased by circumstances over which I had no control, communicated to me, after I had the pleasure of waiting on your ladyship last, that she particularly wished me to take no steps whatever in any manner at all relating to her.
1	In the evening I was so much worse that I resolved to prepare Charley, with which view I said, "You're getting quite strong, Charley, are you not?'
1	'They shall understand that, ma'am; they shall be acquainted with the true state of the case,' said Mr. Bumble.
1	"Possession is nothing to me.
1	How to turn a penny.
1	This is merely in passing.
1	He'd start up from a stone coffin, to come in my way!'
1	Secondly, though Mr. Jarndyce's glance as he withdrew it rested for but a moment on me, I felt as if in that moment he confided to me--and knew that he confided to me and that I received the confidence--his hope that Ada and Richard might one day enter on a dearer relationship.
1	If he shut out the sight, there came the room with every well-known object--some, indeed, that he would have forgotten, if he had gone over its contents from memory--each in its accustomed place.
1	I would have done so again today; but Uriah was too quick for me.
1	‘With your usual happy discrimination, my dear Paul,’ resumed Mrs Chick, ‘you have hit the point at once.
1	Are they, though?’ she said.
1	Did the phantom of such a woman flit about him on his ride; true to the reality, and obvious to him?
1	‘Let them open the door.
1	All over, that is to say, for the time being.
1	“Halloa!” said he, “young fellow!” Halloa being a general observation which I had usually observed to be best answered by itself, I said, “Halloa!” politely omitting young fellow.
1	Your manners have been of that silent and sullen and hangdog kind, that, upon my life and soul, I have been ashamed of you, Sydney!” “It should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar, to be ashamed of anything,” returned Sydney; “you ought to be much obliged to me.” “You shall not get off in that way,” rejoined Stryver, shouldering the rejoinder at him; “no, Sydney, it's my duty to tell you--and I tell you to your face to do you good--that you are a devilish ill-conditioned fellow in that sort of society.
1	The debauchery gained its height; glasses were dashed upon the floor by hands that could not carry them to lips; oaths were shouted out by lips which could scarcely form the words to vent them in; drunken losers cursed and roared; some mounted on the tables, waving bottles above their heads and bidding defiance to the rest; some danced, some sang, some tore the cards and raved.
1	The others, looking in as the first one looked, shriek and fly too, and there is an alarm in the street.
1	"She's a lovely woman, too, she really is," says Mr. Bucket, coming back to Mercury.
1	'But not the less my niece,' cried Mrs. Maylie, folding the fainting girl in her arms; 'not the less my dearest child.
1	The rat, the worm, and the action of the damp, had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood; and a considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the water; while the remainder, tottering and bending over the dark stream, seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion, and involving itself in the same fate.
1	The nature of their several kinds of insanity was made known to me in the same way, and we left each of them in high good humour.
1	Through a whole year, the famous House of Dombey and Son had fought a fight for life, against cross accidents, doubtful rumours, unsuccessful ventures, unpropitious times, and most of all, against the infatuation of its head, who would not contract its enterprises by a hair’s breadth, and would not listen to a word of warning that the ship he strained so hard against the storm, was weak, and could not bear it.
1	He was still the same gentle, attached, affectionate creature that he had been when pain and suffering had wasted his strength, and when he was dependent for every slight attention, and comfort on those who tended him.
1	That I sometimes struggled with real people, in the belief that they were murderers, and that I would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good, and would then sink exhausted in their arms, and suffer them to lay me down, I also knew at the time.
1	God forgive this wretched man!'
1	‘Reg’lar good land that,’ interposed another fat man.
1	At this unexpected stroke of success Susan Nipper dismounted from the coach with all speed, took Walter’s arm, and set off at a breathless pace on foot; leaving the coach there to await their return.
1	"As if it were not natural for him to do so, guardian; as if he could write to a better friend!"
1	“Pretty witness,” he muttered, looking down into his glass.
1	The husband carried a lantern, from which, however, no light yet shone; and trudged on, a few paces in front, as though--the way being dirty--to give his wife the benefit of treading in his heavy footprints.
1	‘Not so much with her, as with her audiences,’ replied Mr. Crummles.
1	The place in Lincolnshire is all alive.
1	I’m as good a man as you, and better.
1	He played with her as a child when in that yard a child she played.
1	At last, a gossip of Mrs Nubbles’s, who had accompanied her to chapel on one or two occasions when a comfortable cup of tea had preceded her devotions, furnished the needful information, which Kit had no sooner obtained than he started off again.
1	All the girls say: Serve him right, and hope it hurt him, and wish he had been quite choked.’ The two youthful figures, side by side, but not now arm-in-arm, wander discontentedly about the old Close; and each sometimes stops and slowly imprints a deeper footstep in the fallen leaves.
1	Jarndyce would readily do it again, but I have the epicure-like feeling that I would prefer a novelty in help, that I would rather," and he looked at Richard and me, "develop generosity in a new soil and in a new form of flower."
1	Quickening their steps to get clear of all the roar and riot, they at length passed through the town and made for the race-course, which was upon an open heath, situated on an eminence, a full mile distant from its furthest bounds.
1	She was introduced as Miss Dartle, and both Steerforth and his mother called her Rosa.
1	‘Toss it in at the window here, and go your ways,’ said Quilp, interrupting her, ‘or I’ll come out and scratch you.’ ‘No, but please, Quilp--do hear me speak,’ urged his submissive wife, in tears.
1	‘I have brought him a little something to eat,’ said the good woman.
1	I’ll give it you this afternoon, Sam.’ ‘You’re wery good, sir,’ replied Mr. Weller.
1	In the stone face over the great window of the bed-chamber where the murder was done, two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose, which everybody recognised, and which nobody had seen of old; and on the scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the crowd to take a hurried peep at Monsieur the Marquis petrified, a skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute, before they all started away among the moss and leaves, like the more fortunate hares who could find a living there.
1	‘I will not hesitate any longer, Mr Wrayburn.
1	He seemed quite amazed himself at the manner in which it opened up to view the sources of the taciturn delight he had had in eating Sunday dinners in that parlour for ten years.
1	'I defy you to do it!'
1	He will talk about business, and won’t give away his time for nothing.
1	to the sheet, and gently lifted it away.
1	“'Gentlemen,' said I, 'pardon me; but I usually inquire who does me the honour to seek my assistance, and what is the nature of the case to which I am summoned.'
1	"Why, Caddy, my dear," said I, "what beautiful flowers!"
1	‘I know it, to my disappointment and regret.
1	Well then; he has nothing to get by it, has he?’ ‘Nothing, Heaven knows!’ ‘Very well then,’ said the boy; ‘that’s something in his favour, and a great thing.
1	Ferdinand Barnacle laughed, and said oh yes, he believed so.
1	That's why.” Mindful of the secret, Darnay with great difficulty checked himself, and said: “You may not understand the gentleman.” “I understand how to put _you_ in a corner, Mr. Darnay,” said Bully Stryver, “and I'll do it.
1	Across the hall, and down the steps, Ralph led her too; nor did he withdraw his hand until she was seated in the coach.
1	‘When I think,’ said he, ‘of the many years--many in thy short life--that thou has lived with me; of my monotonous existence, knowing no companions of thy own age nor any childish pleasures; of the solitude in which thou has grown to be what thou art, and in which thou hast lived apart from nearly all thy kind but one old man; I sometimes fear I have dealt hardly by thee, Nell.’ ‘Grandfather!’ cried the child in unfeigned surprise.
1	The great man withdrew his eyes after a few minutes, and added: ‘Shall we be justified in leaving our wounded friend to the care of the ladies?’ ‘You cannot leave me in better hands,’ said Mr. Tupman.
1	Her gentle tapping at the door producing no response, she opens it and peeps in; seeing no one there, takes possession.
1	I announce to you that we are arrived at our last sitting on our little business.
1	She was up (and, as I believe to this hour, looking for that man) before anybody in the house was stirring.
1	When the appointed night came, I said to Charley as soon as I was alone, "Go and knock at Mr. Jarndyce's door, Charley, and say you have come from me--'for the letter.'"
1	‘He won’t be a Chancery prisoner wery long, Sir,’ replied Roker, turning his hat round, so as to get the maker’s name right side upwards, as he looked into it.
1	I am not going to spend at this rate, to please you, or anybody.
1	The old man overheard, and laughed.
1	‘Then all I need observe, is,’ said the Captain, ‘that you know a angel, and are chartered a angel.’ Mr Toots instantly seized the Captain’s hand, and requested the favour of his friendship.
1	‘My dear Edith,’ said the other, ‘I cannot help it.
1	As ugly and withered as one of the fantastic carvings on the under brackets of the stall seats, as malignant as the Evil One, as hard as the big brass eagle holding the sacred books upon his wings (and, according to the sculptor’s representation of his ferocious attributes, not at all converted by them), she hugs herself in her lean arms, and then shakes both fists at the leader of the Choir.
1	A man with a great puffed head and forehead, swelled veins in his temples, and such a strained skin to his face that it seemed to hold his eyes open, and lift his eyebrows up.
1	He was either taking refreshment in the bosom just mentioned, or he was tearing through the country at from twenty-five to fifty miles an hour, or he was sleeping after his fatigues.
1	Eh?’ ‘Feeder,’ returned Mr Toots.
1	I have many friends in America, and feel a grateful interest in the country.
1	People are always calling other people something.
1	We lived much as before, in reference to our scrambling household arrangements; but I had got used to those, and Dora I was pleased to see was seldom vexed now.
1	Here's a ring!” I acted in the capacity of backer, or best-man, to the bridegroom; while a little limp pew-opener in a soft bonnet like a baby's, made a feint of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins.
1	I asked Joe whether he had heard if any of the other relations had any legacies?
1	Her teacher gives her a new object, for instance, a pencil, first lets her examine it, and get an idea of its use, then teaches her how to spell it by making the signs for the letters with her own fingers: the child grasps her hand, and feels her fingers, as the different letters are formed; she turns her head a little on one side like a person listening closely; her lips are apart; she seems scarcely to breathe; and her countenance, at first anxious, gradually changes to a smile, as she comprehends the lesson.
1	Catching sight of Walter, Captain Cuttle dropped the property into the bottom of the boat with perfect unconcern, being evidently oblivious of its existence, and pulling off the glazed hat hailed him lustily.
1	The rosy children opposite run past with hoops.
1	Though the just Heaven knows that I am innocent of any.
1	‘Quite a matter of form.

1	I shall think of it with a melancholy satisfaction when I wake up in the night.
1	In point of fact, we were playing at Puss in the Corner.
1	It was a long room, with crimson-covered benches, and wax candles in glass chandeliers.
1	Do you believe that I was earnest in all that?’ ‘I do!
1	‘Haven’t you yourself declared that the fellow has heaped provocations, insults, and affronts on you, or something to that effect?
1	Mr. Pott darted a look of contempt, which might have withered an anchor.
1	How many pictures of new journeys over pleasant country, of resting-places under the free broad sky, of rambles in the fields and woods, and paths not often trodden--how many tones of that one well-remembered voice, how many glimpses of the form, the fluttering dress, the hair that waved so gaily in the wind--how many visions of what had been, and what he hoped was yet to be--rose up before him, in the old, dull, silent church!
1	Among the votaries of TERPSICHORE, who disported themselves until Sol gave warning for departure, Wilkins Micawber, Esquire, Junior, and the lovely and accomplished Miss Helena, fourth daughter of Doctor Mell, were particularly remarkable.’ I was looking back to the name of Doctor Mell, pleased to have discovered, in these happier circumstances, Mr. Mell, formerly poor pinched usher to my Middlesex magistrate, when Mr. Peggotty pointing to another part of the paper, my eyes rested on my own name, and I read thus: ‘My Dear Sir, ‘Years have elapsed, since I had an opportunity of ocularly perusing the lineaments, now familiar to the imaginations of a considerable portion of the civilized world.
1	Seated at table in the act of drinking, Mr Dorrit still saw him through his wine-glass, regarding him with a cold and ghostly eye.
1	"How do you do, Mr. Vholes?
1	Mr Garland then related to him, how he had a brother (of whom he would remember to have heard him speak, and whose picture, taken when he was a young man, hung in the best room), and how this brother lived a long way off, in a country-place, with an old clergyman who had been his early friend.
1	The modest sunflower and hollyhock were depicted as flourishing with great luxuriance on this rustic dwelling, while a quantity of dense smoke issuing from the chimney indicated good cheer within, and also, perhaps, that it had not been lately swept.
1	‘A score,’ cried my aunt, with a kind of indignant pride.
1	Make it your own time.
1	Don’t be tempted into twitting me with the past knowledge that you have of me, because it is identical with the past knowledge that I have of you, and in twitting me, you twit yourself, and I don’t want to hear you do it.
1	The centre of the street door was perfectly covered with a great brass-plate, on which was engraved ‘Mrs.
1	Now!’ If there were any sound at all, it was so slight that she must have fallen into a confirmed habit of listening for sounds; but Mr Dorrit believed he did hear a something, like the falling of dry leaves.
1	I am screaming out loud all the time I write and so is my brother which takes off my attention rather and I hope will excuse mistakes.
1	My hopes and fears are both fulfilled to-night.
1	‘Then he has no business to do it,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.
1	If you have come here to thank me, it was not necessary.
1	In the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual harmless ways of life were changed.
1	The truth was, that she had objected to me as an expensive companion who did Herbert no good, and that, when Herbert had first proposed to present me to her, she had received the proposal with such very moderate warmth, that Herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the state of the case to me, with a view to the lapse of a little time before I made her acquaintance.
1	But you are such a little oddity!
1	Mr. Wickfield held it for a little while in his, with his head bowed down.
1	As we were close to Camilla then, I would have stopped as a matter of course, only Miss Havisham wouldn't stop.
1	If his period of confinement have been very long, the prospect of release bewilders and confuses him.
1	Thus it had been brought about that she now sat in her corner of the luxurious carriage with her little patient hands folded before her, quite displaced even from the last point of the old standing ground in life on which her feet had lingered.
1	This device I executed successfully.
1	My duty prosperously ended, all between us is ended."
1	Wot is it, besides fish, as they sometimes ketches in rivers?
1	Markham was the singer, and he sang ‘When the heart of a man is depressed with care’.
1	That matter I place in your hands.
1	I hope you may do better, yet; I hope you may correct yourself.’ Here he ended the dialogue, which had been carried on in a low voice, in a corner of the outer office, by passing into Mr. Spenlow’s room, and saying aloud, in his smoothest manner: ‘Gentlemen of Mr. Spenlow’s profession are accustomed to family differences, and know how complicated and difficult they always are!’ With that, he paid the money for his licence; and, receiving it neatly folded from Mr. Spenlow, together with a shake of the hand, and a polite wish for his happiness and the lady’s, went out of the office.
1	But I alighted at the Halfway House, and breakfasted there, and walked the rest of the distance; for I sought to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways, and to leave it in the same manner.
1	But they never blushed upon a change in the new manner of her thought and speech towards her daughter.
1	When you say THEY say, what do you mean?
1	If her faithful slate had had the latent qualities of sympathetic paper, and its pencil those of invisible ink, many a little treatise calculated to astonish the pupils would have come bursting through the dry sums in school-time under the warming influence of Miss Peecher’s bosom.
1	I remember almost hoping that some better change was possible within me.
1	‘’Cept Mullins’s Meadows,’ observed the fat man solemnly.
1	Still, when the sun is on them, do they shine and glow like molten gold.
1	Sir Leicester writes upon the slate.
1	That time has not arrived; but here, with not fame won, and no young vision realised, I offer you the heart so long your own, and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the offer.'
1	Sometimes in his rage he would take me for one of them, and come at me, mouthing as if he were going to tear me in pieces; then, remembering me, just in time, would dive into the shop, and lie upon his bed, as I thought from the sound of his voice, yelling in a frantic way, to his own windy tune, the ‘Death of Nelson’; with an Oh!
1	‘Bravo!’ cried Eugene, rising too.
1	‘The quarter’s notice,’ said Mr. Wititterly, with the gravity of a man on the right side, ‘is not yet half expired.
1	If ever that boy returns to this house, sir, I'll eat my head.'
1	He sat himself down with a threatening swagger, and said: ‘Give me a bottle of wine.
1	The Captain argued that his present security was too profound and wonderful to endure much longer; he knew that when the wind stood in a fair quarter, the weathercock was seldom nailed there; and he was too well acquainted with the determined and dauntless character of Mrs MacStinger, to doubt that that heroic woman had devoted herself to the task of his discovery and capture.
1	The moon is rising, and where she sits there is a little stream of cold pale light, in which her head is seen.
1	I have observed his face to be not the face of a true friend of the Republic.
1	But the night covered it, and no one knew.
1	Then there emerged from the house, Mrs. Pott, who would have looked very like Apollo if she hadn’t had a gown on, conducted by Mr. Winkle, who, in his light-red coat could not possibly have been mistaken for anything but a sportsman, if he had not borne an equal resemblance to a general postman.
1	May it soon terminate happily!
1	‘Dear me!’ said Brass, slapping all his pockets, one after another, and looking into his desk, and under it, and upon it, and wildly tossing the papers about, ‘the note, Mr Richard, sir, the five-pound note--what can have become of it?
1	on the contrary, don’t I see every reason why I shouldn’t?
1	Besides, Jack, you are such a conscientious master, and require so much, that I believe you make her afraid of you.
1	There was now as eager a set towards the shore beneath the house as there had been from it; and it was only on the first boat of the rush coming in that it was known what had occurred.
1	To these various attentions, Mr Swiveller submitted in a kind of grateful astonishment beyond the reach of language.
1	You had better go first with Master Paul, Richards.
1	I felt so sleepy, that I knew if I lost sight of anything for a moment, I was gone.
1	I have always lived quiet, and secret, Josiah, my dear.
1	they pass into the great room with the painted ceiling and find him standing before the fire.
1	‘By the heavy coach from the city, Sir.’ ‘Are your places taken?’ ‘They are, sir,’ replied Job.
1	But on he went before them, always at the same distance, and the same rate.
1	Some of the craftiest scoundrels that ever walked this earth, or rather--for walking implies, at least, an erect position and the bearing of a man--that ever crawled and crept through life by its dirtiest and narrowest ways, will gravely jot down in diaries the events of every day, and keep a regular debtor and creditor account with Heaven, which shall always show a floating balance in their own favour.
1	cried Ada, sinking on her knees beside it.
1	So, they were always looking at palatial residences in the best situations, and always very nearly taking or buying one, but never quite concluding the bargain.
1	I had pretended with myself that there was nothing of this taint in the arrangement; but when I went up to my little room on this last night, I felt compelled to admit that it might be so, and had an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me in the morning.
1	In the name of--of brimstone, why?"
1	What are you melting vith now?
1	She said her lady was but poorly, and kept her own room a good deal.
1	‘I knew you would come to him, and I followed you,’ said Rokesmith.
1	It’s better to understand these things at once.
1	"Therefore, I have told him many times that he really should be more careful, both in justice to himself and in justice to others.
1	‘Let me tell your fortune, my pretty lady,’ said the old woman, munching with her jaws, as if the Death’s Head beneath her yellow skin were impatient to get out.
1	After our early dinner, I strolled out alone, purposing to finish off the marshes at once, and get them done with.
1	‘He has never said a word to me about it.
1	He had visited the houses of the poor in the various districts of London, and had found them destitute of the slightest vestige of a muffin, which there appeared too much reason to believe some of these indigent persons did not taste from year’s end to year’s end.
1	Right or wrong, Rumour was very busy; and Lord Decimus, while he was, or was supposed to be, in stately excogitation of the difficulty, lent her some countenance by taking, on several public occasions, one of those elephantine trots of his through a jungle of overgrown sentences, waving Mr Merdle about on his trunk as Gigantic Enterprise, The Wealth of England, Elasticity, Credit, Capital, Prosperity, and all manner of blessings.
1	‘Don’t leave me out, Nickleby,’ cried a sharp-faced gentleman, who was sitting on a low chair with a high back, reading the paper.
1	What do you want?” “I am going to London, Miss Pocket,” said I, “and want to say good-bye to Miss Havisham.” I was not expected, for she left me locked in the yard, while she went to ask if I were to be admitted.
1	I have spoken with my two wards, Neville and Helena Landless, on the subject of their defective education, and they give in to the plan proposed; as I should have taken good care they did, whether they liked it or not.”’ ‘And it is another most extraordinary thing,’ remarked the Minor Canon in the same tone as before, ‘that these philanthropists are so given to seizing their fellow-creatures by the scruff of the neck, and (as one may say) bumping them into the paths of peace.—I beg your pardon, Ma dear, for interrupting.’ ‘“Therefore, dear Madam, you will please prepare your son, the Rev.
1	Mrs Merdle was at home, and was in her nest of crimson and gold, with the parrot on a neighbouring stem watching her with his head on one side, as if he took her for another splendid parrot of a larger species.
1	His looks were starched, but his white neckerchief was not, and its long limp ends straggled over his closely-buttoned waistcoat in a very uncouth and unpicturesque fashion.
1	He has just passed out under the gateway.
1	A double 1--all, everything--a cobbler’s weapon.
1	‘I am improving my legal knowledge, Master Copperfield,’ said Uriah.
1	Mr. Sapsea has a bottle of port wine on a table before the fire—the fire is an early luxury, but pleasant on the cool, chilly autumn evening—and is characteristically attended by his portrait, his eight-day clock, and his weather-glass.
1	I am resolute and immoveable.
1	‘I want to speak to Florence, if you please,’ he said.
1	He was father’s partner, and father broke with him, and now he revenges himself.
1	How strongly will you have it?’ He threw out the lees of his glass on the ground, so that they nearly spattered Cavalletto.
1	She seemed to have followed Florence some little way at all events, for she had lost her breath; and this made her uglier still, as she stood trying to regain it: working her shrivelled yellow face and throat into all sorts of contortions.
1	‘I went into the wrong shop, fust, last Thursday,’ said Riderhood.
1	He took his usual seat, she took hers, and he began his meal.
1	"He must have a profession; he must make some choice for himself.
1	It was a spectre in his house, and haunted him night and day.
1	'Where can he have come from!'
1	Mr. Spenlow and I falling into this conversation, prolonged it and our saunter to and fro, until we diverged into general topics.
1	Smite Thou my debtors, Lord, wither them, crush them; do Thou as I would do, and Thou shalt have my worship: this was the impious tower of stone she built up to scale Heaven.
1	The shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package was received!
1	Finally, with a deep long sigh, he took the shoe up, and resumed his work.
1	Now, merciful Heaven be thanked for that old time, enabling me, without a wasted moment, to have got the boat afloat again, and to row back against the stream!
1	‘I begin to infer, from your manner, and these appearances, Marchioness,’ said Richard after a pause, and smiling with a trembling lip, ‘that I have been ill.’ ‘You just have!’ replied the small servant, wiping her eyes.
1	In that low and marshy spot, the fog filled every nook and corner with a thick dense cloud.
1	He said yes, but asked me for some of my “gentleman's linen” to put on in the morning.
1	But it is not so bad, as you in England take it to be.
1	I am very much obliged to you indeed, gentlemen, for your patronage, and also for your recommendations, gentlemen, whenever additional assistance in waiting is required.
1	Habitations, fences, domesticated animals, men, women, children, and the soil that bore them--all worn out.
1	‘Why not?’ ‘To be sure!’ said Brass.
1	"Both houses are your home, my dear," said he, "but the older Bleak House claims priority.

1	There was a form between it and her, the outline strongly developed against the light, which caused her to stop abruptly.
1	The distress of the mother was now painful to behold; for, although she had feared that she should not be recognised, the painful reality of being treated with cold indifference by a darling child, was too much for woman’s nature to bear.
1	I knew the limekiln as well as I knew the old Battery, but they were miles apart; so that, if a light had been burning at each point that night, there would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two bright specks.
1	Outside his own domain, and unprotected, he was a very sheep for the shearers.
1	There must be no will but his.
1	They were always 'My husband, my father, and my brother!
1	The birds began to stir and chirp.
1	Miss Skiffins's brother conducted the negotiation.
1	One horse fell three times in this first stage, and trembled so and was so shaken that the driver had to dismount from his saddle and lead him at last.
1	I am so tired sometimes,’ said little Paul, warming his hands, and looking in between the bars of the grate, as if some ghostly puppet-show were performing there, ‘and my bones ache so (Wickam says it’s my bones), that I don’t know what to do.’ ‘Ay!
1	"Of course, Esther," he said, "you don't understand this Chancery business?"
1	Will you go my way with me, when it is quite dark?
1	For their two faces were alone with the other flowers.
1	She stood for some moments looking round the room.
1	Does that come next?’ asked Miss Jenny with a look of close attention.
1	He saw the gash; knew that the mare had darted off at a wild mad gallop; a hundred lights danced in his eyes, and he felt himself flung violently upon the ground.
1	The brightness of the shops where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy as they passed.
1	Many, who only came to the house on state occasions, hardly knew who Florence was, and said, going home, ‘Indeed, was that Miss Dombey, in the corner?
1	Nicholas, having carefully copied the address of Mr. Squeers, the uncle and nephew issued forth together in quest of that accomplished gentleman; Nicholas firmly persuading himself that he had done his relative great injustice in disliking him at first sight; and Mrs. Nickleby being at some pains to inform her daughter that she was sure he was a much more kindly disposed person than he seemed; which, Miss Nickleby dutifully remarked, he might very easily be.
1	Mr. Bucket Allegory looks pretty cool in Lincoln's Inn Fields, though the evening is hot, for both Mr. Tulkinghorn's windows are wide open, and the room is lofty, gusty, and gloomy.
1	Mr. Snagsby takes the opportunity of slightly turning his head to glance over his shoulder at his little woman and to make apologetic motions with his mouth to this effect: "Tul-king-horn--rich--in-flu-en-tial!"
1	Dedicated to the different hotels in this city.’ There are three principal theatres.
1	God, how the sun poured down upon the very spot!
1	‘Open the door.’ ‘Wait one instant,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	‘Thank you, no; I don’t want any more.’ This was in reference to another menace of attention from his recovered friend.
1	Mr Towlinson has proposed the happy pair; to which the silver-headed butler has responded neatly, and with emotion; for he half begins to think he is an old retainer of the family, and that he is bound to be affected by these changes.
1	Put the everlasting stove in the midst; hot, and suffocating, and vaporous, as a witch’s cauldron.
1	Some little commotion was occasioned in Fleet Street, by the pleasantry of the eight gentlemen in the flank, who persevered in walking four abreast; it was also found necessary to leave the mottled-faced gentleman behind, to fight a ticket-porter, it being arranged that his friends should call for him as they came back.
1	By corresponding degrees she sank into a chair, then upon her knees, then upon the ground beside the bed, drawing the coverlet with her, half to hide her shamed head and wet hair in it, and half, as it seemed, to embrace it, rather than have nothing to take to her repentant breast.
1	An old, old man and woman, with their children and their children's children, and another generation beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.
1	‘How dare you then,’ said the lodger, ‘Eh?’ To this, Dick made no other reply than by inquiring whether the lodger held it to be consistent with the conduct and character of a gentleman to go to sleep for six-and-twenty hours at a stretch, and whether the peace of an amiable and virtuous family was to weigh as nothing in the balance.
1	‘E ope you no fright,’ said Mrs Plornish then, interpreting Mr Pancks in a new way with her usual fertility of resource.
1	But no,’ he added, ‘your face tells quite another story.’ ‘I am afraid it is a selfish revelation that you see there, then,’ she answered.
1	The love of trade is assigned as a reason for that comfortless custom, so very prevalent in country towns, of married persons living in hotels, having no fireside of their own, and seldom meeting from early morning until late at night, but at the hasty public meals.
1	“Do you take tea, or coffee, Mr. Gargery?” asked Herbert, who always presided of a morning.
1	"Yes, and he--yes, it was Snagsby," said Mr. Weevle, altering the construction of his sentence.
1	"I don't understand what you mean," said I, wondering.
1	Are you certain?’ My aunt finished eating the piece of toast on which she was then engaged, looking me full in the face all the while; and then setting her glass on the chimney-piece, and folding her hands upon her folded skirts, replied as follows: ‘Trot, my child, if I have any object in life, it is to provide for your being a good, a sensible, and a happy man.
1	What’s the use of talking about it!’ returned Tom, chafing his face on his coat-sleeve, as if to mortify his flesh, and have it in unison with his spirit.
1	And so, Lady Tippins, quite undetermined whether today is the day before yesterday, or the day after to-morrow, or the week after next, fades away; and Mortimer Lightwood and Eugene fade away, and Twemlow fades away, and the stoney aunt goes away--she declines to fade, proving rock to the last--and even the unknowns are slowly strained off, and it is all over.
1	It’s very gratifying and agreeable to me, I am sure; but don’t you think you could do better?
1	'I have been prompt enough this time.
1	"Like you, Esther, but useless, and so NOT like you!"
1	But Volumnia the fair, being subject to the prevalent complaint of boredom and finding that disorder attacking her spirits with some virulence, ventures at length to repair to the library for change of scene.
1	Will you be so good as to confront me with that genius?’ He held the door in his hand, as though he were quite ready to shut her out again if she failed.
1	Mrs. Mann gave him a thousand embraces, and what Oliver wanted a great deal more, a piece of bread and butter, less he should seem too hungry when he got to the workhouse.
1	‘But there shall not be an end of it.
1	But none on my accounts,’ said Mrs Bangham.
1	You might suppose him to be an ogre from what he says, and I believe he has the reputation of one with some people.

1	Also, within doors, Mr Inspector was at his studies as of yore.
1	Walter waved his hand in assent, and went his way.
1	‘I will ascertain that myself without loss of time,’ said Nicholas.
1	It’s a thing to be thankful for, indeed, that Miss Dorrit is not here to know it.’ Arthur thought she looked at him with particular expression.
1	He was along with me, sir, down at Saint Albans, ill, and a young lady, Lord bless her for a good friend to me, took pity on him when I durstn't, and took him home--" Allan shrinks back from him with a sudden horror.
1	‘Miss Amy, I know very well that your family is far above mine.
1	He carried it in a masterly manner, and, not breathed even then, stood looking down upon the river.
1	In this strife I have almost repulsed and crushed my better angel into a demon.
1	The Doctor looked on her, henceforth, as steadfastly as she on him.
1	"Just so," observes the stationer with his confirmatory cough.
1	Steerforth continued his protection of me, and proved a very useful friend; since nobody dared to annoy one whom he honoured with his countenance.
1	"Never, little woman," he replied.
1	From Mr. Bounderby I have received every acknowledgment of my social station, and every recognition of my family descent, that I could possibly expect.
1	The darkness and the silence of the tomb were around her: no mother’s smile called forth her answering smile, no father’s voice taught her to imitate his sounds:—they, brothers and sisters, were but forms of matter which resisted her touch, but which differed not from the furniture of the house, save in warmth, and in the power of locomotion; and not even in these respects from the dog and the cat.
1	Of her once more stopping, and looking back, and hurrying to Agnes, and giving Agnes, above all the others, her last kisses and farewells.
1	You and I and Joe would have wanted nothing then, and Joe and I would perhaps have gone partners when I was out of my time, and I might even have grown up to keep company with you, and we might have sat on this very bank on a fine Sunday, quite different people.
1	‘I only know that I’m a heavy sleeper at first, and a light one towards morning; and if Mr Gills had come through the shop near daybreak, though ever so much on tiptoe, I’m pretty sure I should have heard him shut the door at all events.’ On mature consideration of this evidence, Captain Cuttle began to think that the Instrument-maker must have vanished of his own accord; to which logical conclusion he was assisted by the letter addressed to himself, which, as being undeniably in the old man’s handwriting, would seem, with no great forcing, to bear the construction, that he arranged of his own will to go, and so went.
1	Say only one, upon your knees, with me, and we will talk till morning.'
1	And Mrs. Micawber was just the same.
1	“If you had been born such, would you have been here now?
1	But that was nothing to this.
1	I cannot consent to get up, in this state of uncertainty.
1	I think you were sent to me by Heaven.” “Or you to me,” says Sydney Carton.
1	You’re in a hurry?’ ‘Yes, I am,’ said Kit, looking from one to the other in great surprise.
1	‘You are, any day,’ said Kit, ‘--and so’s your mother.’ Poor Barbara!
1	‘You _shall _make it, sir,’ said the grave man.
1	In consequence of which we have at once, Sociability (I should go melancholy mad without Mrs Boffin), Fashion, and Comfort.
1	I don't mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail.
1	He was a dreamer in such wise, because he was a man who had, deep-rooted in his nature, a belief in all the gentle and good things his life had been without.
1	I will inquire myself in the morning.
1	‘Yes,’ said Kit, ‘worse luck!’ ‘You should say better luck, I think,’ returned his mother, ‘because Miss Nelly won’t have been left alone.’ ‘Ah!’ said Kit, ‘I forgot that.
1	"'Tis only a letter of instructions, sir.
1	‘“It was,” cried the elder lady, weeping bitterly.
1	Singularly low, as if instead of being so close beside him, it were at a distance.
1	Most people know what sort of places commercial rooms usually are.
1	Perhaps you will be so kind as to tell my sister the rest.’ ‘There is very little to tell,’ said Mrs Merdle, reviewing the breadth of bosom which seemed essential to her having room enough to be unfeeling in, ‘but it is to your sister’s credit.
1	Would you mind toasting this sausage for the Aged P.?” I said I should be delighted to do it.
1	My affections,’ said Miss Tox--‘but, Louisa, this is madness!’ and departed from the room.
1	Let me fill your glass.
1	Thus, the attorney of Bevis Marks sat, and wrote, and hummed, for a long time, except when he stopped to listen with a very cunning face, and hearing nothing, went on humming louder, and writing slower than ever.
1	The man came back, in great haste, bringing the coachman with him, who said he had been at home and in bed, since ten o’clock.
1	‘Rokesmith,’ said Mr Boffin one evening when they were all in his room again, and he and the Secretary had been going over some accounts, ‘I am spending too much money.
1	‘Consequently,’ said Mr. Grewgious, ‘Mr.
1	‘How de do, Sir Barnet?’ Mr Toots would answer, ‘What a surprising thing that I should see you here!’ Mr Toots, in his sagacity, always said this, as if, instead of that being Sir Barnet’s house, it were some deserted edifice on the banks of the Nile, or Ganges.
1	Now that I have begun, I will have some definite reason, some responsible statement, something in the nature of a real answer, from those people.’ ‘You will not,’ returned Doyce, shaking his head.
1	"Why, Mr. Carstone," said Mrs. Badger, "is very well and is, I assure you, a great acquisition to our society.
1	You know what Ma is, Esther," she returned.
1	Any one of these scouts used to think nothing of politely assisting an old lady in black out of a vehicle, killing any proctor whom she inquired for, representing his employer as the lawful successor and representative of that proctor, and bearing the old lady off (sometimes greatly affected) to his employer’s office.
1	You will be good enough to bring me no reply.
1	But I should like to!’ ‘I am equally sure you would not.’ ‘Not even like to?
1	I heard the noise of the feet behind, and redoubled my speed.
1	Often and often we pursued these debates until the clock pointed to midnight, and the candles were burning down.
1	She used to feed them, Sir.
1	In her moral character, it is beautiful to behold her continual gladness, her keen enjoyment of existence, her expansive love, her unhesitating confidence, her sympathy with suffering, her conscientiousness, truthfulness, and hopefulness.’ Such are a few fragments from the simple but most interesting and instructive history of Laura Bridgman.
1	Whether I was to do it or not, ma’am, I did it.
1	He never converses when not professionally consulted.
1	‘Dear me--ah!’ This reflection was echoed by all present, who said ‘Ah!’ first, and ‘dear me,’ afterwards.
1	‘Oh, he’s a deal better, sir,’ said Mrs Plornish.
1	Old Joe can give you nothing but camp fare, you see.’ ‘Very excellent fare, Major,’ replied his guest; and not in mere politeness either; for the Major always took the best possible care of himself, and indeed ate rather more of rich meats than was good for him, insomuch that his Imperial complexion was mainly referred by the faculty to that circumstance.
1	There’th nothing comfortable to tell; why unthettle her mind, and make her unhappy?”  Tho, whether her father bathely detherted her; or whether he broke hith own heart alone, rather than pull her down along with him; never will be known, now, Thquire, till—no, not till we know how the dogth findth uth out!’ ‘She keeps the bottle that he sent her for, to this hour; and she will believe in his affection to the last moment of her life,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.
1	I hope it’s Sir Mulberry--I think it must be Sir Mulberry!’ And then her thoughts flew back to her old predictions, and the number of times she had said, that Kate with no fortune would marry better than other people’s daughters with thousands; and, as she pictured with the brightness of a mother’s fancy all the beauty and grace of the poor girl who had struggled so cheerfully with her new life of hardship and trial, her heart grew too full, and the tears trickled down her face.
1	And you'll ease my friend Bagnet's mind, and his family's mind, a good deal if you'll just mention to him what our understanding is."
1	Allan Woodcourt pauses to look after him and note all this, with a shadowy belief that he has seen the boy before.
1	There was some discomfiture in his tone as he resumed, though he tried to conceal it.
1	Janet was drafted into the service of Mrs. Strong, where I saw her every day.
1	My dear girl is with her father; and if you'll wait till she comes down, I'll make you known to her, and then we'll go upstairs.
1	The leap from that knowledge to the inference that Miss Twinkleton set herself to teach _her_ something, was easy.
1	To be the friend of Swiveller you must reject all circumstantial evidence, all reason, observation, and experience, and repose a blind belief in the bookcase.
1	At this high point, Miss Knag’s friendship remained for three whole days, much to the wonderment of Madame Mantalini’s young ladies who had never beheld such constancy in that quarter, before; but on the fourth, it received a check no less violent than sudden, which thus occurred.
1	As the muffins disappear, little by little, the black shelves and nooks and corners begin to appear, and Mr Wegg gradually acquires an imperfect notion that over against him on the chimney-piece is a Hindoo baby in a bottle, curved up with his big head tucked under him, as he would instantly throw a summersault if the bottle were large enough.
1	that I should have been fooling here!’ Accompanying these words with an impatient stamp upon the ground, he tore himself from the manager’s detaining grasp, and darting rapidly down the street was out of sight in an instant.
1	He lies there, dressed in shirt and trousers, with bare feet.
1	I asked him what he thought Ham’s state of mind was, in reference to the cause of their misfortunes?
1	But when I found the child was not less fond of me, and drew its soft hand over my face with a kind of pitying protection in its touch, that soon set me up again.
1	The determined reticence of Jasper, however, was not to be so approached.

1	‘You will be a friend to me, won’t you?’ ‘I hope so.
1	Mr Pancks would be now reduced to saying as he booked the case, ‘Well!

1	"Nor ever will be," says my Lady.

1	Thus they continued to ask each other who called so loud, over and over again; and when Smike had that by heart Nicholas went to another sentence, and then to two at a time, and then to three, and so on, until at midnight poor Smike found to his unspeakable joy that he really began to remember something about the text.
1	Of cliffs and buildings, and a windmill, and a church, becoming more and more visible upon it.
1	Badly enough at first, but better now.’ ‘And here have I,’ said Sloppy, in something of a self-reproachful tone, ‘been a learning and a learning, and here has Mr Boffin been a paying and a paying, ever so long!’ ‘I have heard what your trade is,’ observed Miss Wren; ‘it’s cabinet-making.’ Mr Sloppy nodded.
1	‘Finish your dinner, and walk out with me.
1	He faintly wipes his forehead with his handkerchief and gasps.
1	They turned round to the left, a short way past the public-house; and then, taking a right-hand road, walked on for a long time: passing many large gardens and gentlemen's houses on both sides of the way, and stopping for nothing but a little beer, until they reached a town.
1	My mother has a little property, which takes the form of a small life annuity, upon which she lives in an independent though unassuming manner in the Old Street Road.
1	It was a maxim with Mr Brass that the habit of paying compliments kept a man’s tongue oiled without any expense; and, as that useful member ought never to grow rusty or creak in turning on its hinges in the case of a practitioner of the law, in whom it should be always glib and easy, he lost few opportunities of improving himself by the utterance of handsome speeches and eulogistic expressions.
1	He is, as it were suddenly, grown very old.
1	To this compliment Miss Sally replied, that she had a relish for the amusement, and had no intention to forego its gratification.
1	She watched and waited months for a seamstress.
1	Cheerless and comfortless, boastfully and doggedly rich, there the room stared at its present occupants, unsoftened and unrelieved by the least trace of any womanly occupation.
1	‘It’s all in training, Sir,’ said Sam.
1	But whatever she looked at; sun, moon, stars, or bracelet; she looked no more at the Major.
1	‘Is it any harm?’ asked Little Dorrit, smiling.
1	‘My friend Dombey, Ma’am,’ returned the Major, ‘may be devoted to her in secret, but a man who is paramount in the greatest city in the universe--’ ‘No one can be a stranger,’ said Mrs Skewton, ‘to Mr Dombey’s immense influence.’ As Mr Dombey acknowledged the compliment with a bend of his head, the younger lady glancing at him, met his eyes.
1	Is it the Virgin of Bevis?’ ‘What an amazing flow of spirits!’ cried Brass.
1	So much the greater must have been the solitude of her heart, and her need of some one on whom to bestow it.
1	‘And this,’ he said, at last, ‘is an English boot, is it?
1	It was not strong enough to impell him to sacrifice himself and spare her, but it was a strong emotion.
1	She doesn’t seem so desolate.
1	Hot punch is a pleasant thing, gentlemen--an extremely pleasant thing under any circumstances--but in that snug old parlour, before the roaring fire, with the wind blowing outside till every timber in the old house creaked again, Tom Smart found it perfectly delightful.
1	Mr Swiveller and his partner played several rubbers with varying success, until the loss of three sixpences, the gradual sinking of the purl, and the striking of ten o’clock, combined to render that gentleman mindful of the flight of Time, and the expediency of withdrawing before Mr Sampson and Miss Sally Brass returned.
1	They all think so.’ ‘Well, I suppose they do,’ says Edwin, meditating aloud.
1	Young as she was when her mama died, she remembered how the tears would come into her eyes when she spoke of him and of the noble generosity of his character, which she had said was to be trusted above all earthly things; and Ada trusted it.
1	She was up in my study, Peggotty said: which it was her pride to keep in readiness and order for me.
1	Darkness had fallen on him in its place.
1	‘Misses Brown!’ exclaimed the Grinder, ‘let go, will you?
1	It is immensely received in turf-circles.
1	‘Try a little something green,’ said Young John, handing him the basket.
1	She was its very light and life.
1	‘Cases there are,’ said Mrs Merdle, delicately crooking the little finger of her favourite hand, and making her remarks neater by that neat action; ‘cases there are where a man is not young or elegant, and is rich, and has a handsome establishment already.
1	‘And how is your friend, the faithful Digby?’ ‘Digby!’ said Nicholas, forgetting at the instant that this had been Smike’s theatrical name.
1	‘You’re a steady Hand, and I was not mistaken.
1	The single exception to this rule perhaps was Mr Carker, who now smiled among the company, and who, as he stood in the circle that was gathered about Mrs Dombey--watchful of her, of them, his chief, Cleopatra and the Major, Florence, and everything around--appeared at ease with both divisions of guests, and not marked as exclusively belonging to either.
1	The murderer swung lifeless against the wall; and the boy, thrusting aside the dangling body which obscured his view, called to the people to come and take him out, for God's sake.
1	It was abandoned as soon as tried, and he wore his grizzled hair cut short.

1	“And has left me,” answered the nephew, “bound to a system that is frightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to execute the last request of my dear mother's lips, and obey the last look of my dear mother's eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to redress; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain.” “Seeking them from me, my nephew,” said the Marquis, touching him on the breast with his forefinger--they were now standing by the hearth--“you will for ever seek them in vain, be assured.” Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face, was cruelly, craftily, and closely compressed, while he stood looking quietly at his nephew, with his snuff-box in his hand.
1	Didn't he owe us immense sums, all round?
1	‘What news have you brought me?
1	In another moment, he stood, fixed and immovable with folded arms, regarding his nephew with a scowl; while Kate and Miss La Creevy threw themselves between the two, to prevent the personal violence which the fierce excitement of Nicholas appeared to threaten.
1	'I must have a full suit of mourning, Fagin, and a hatband, to wisit him in, afore he sets out upon his travels.

1	Stephen Blackpool in the parlour.
1	On the first crash of the eminent Mr Merdle’s decease, many important persons had been unable to determine whether they should cut Mrs Merdle, or comfort her.
1	Mr. Jarndyce, who is desirous to aid any work that is considered likely to be a good work and who is much sought after by philanthropists, has, I believe, a very high opinion of Mrs.
1	O Heaven forgive you, father, stop!”  And he stopped, and the dog was bloody, and father lay down crying on the floor with the dog in his arms, and the dog licked his face.’ Louisa saw that she was sobbing; and going to her, kissed her, took her hand, and sat down beside her.
1	His insolence of self-importance dilated as he saw this alteration in her.
1	It is impossible to describe how Mr. Bucket gets her out, but he accomplishes that feat in a manner so peculiar to himself, enfolding and pervading her like a cloud, and hovering away with her as if he were a homely Jupiter and she the object of his affections.
1	I was three-and-twenty years of age.
1	You are in mourning for some near relation?’ ‘For my father,’ answered Kate.
1	He even suspected the mystery of the gloved hand, and held it all the longer in his own for that suspicion.
1	Did you ever buy anything of him?’ With piercing eagerness.
1	That one seemed inclined to turn back, but the other, in which Edith recognised enough that was like herself to strike her with an unusual feeling, not quite free from fear, came on; and then they came on together.
1	But in travelling about, out of the large cities—as I have remarked in former parts of these volumes—I was quite oppressed by the prevailing seriousness and melancholy air of business: which was so general and unvarying, that at every new town I came to, I seemed to meet the very same people whom I had left behind me, at the last.
1	On approaching nearer, Bella discerned that the refection had the appearance of a small cottage-loaf and a pennyworth of milk.
1	The doctor and the debtor ran down-stairs, leaving the turnkey to return to the lock, and made for the debtor’s room.
1	At all events, he hoped so, and therefore tried to believe it.
1	The mandate was obeyed; and the indignant Mr. Brownlow was conveyed out, with the book in one hand, and the bamboo cane in the other:  in a perfect phrenzy of rage and defiance.
1	Its expression had lost nothing of its beauty; but it was changed; and there was an anxious haggard look about the gentle face, which it had never worn before.
1	That boy, my good sir, would break his neck with pleasure, and deprive his parents of their chief comfort--and between ourselves, when you come to see him at hare and hounds, taking the fence and ditch by the finger-post, and sliding down the face of the little quarry, you’ll never forget it.
1	Supposing his head had been held down under water for a while.
1	Who would be enchanted to serve you; who would be so true, so zealous, and so faithful every day!
1	but all the rejection of sin, and all the war against it, in which I had been bred?’ She laid her wrathful hand upon the watch on the table.
1	Shall we drink a toast, Mr. Noggs?’ ‘Ah!’ said Newman, eyeing his little glass impatiently.
1	He noticed that his companion stood at the window with the air of an affable and accessible Sovereign, and that, when any of his people in the yard below looked up, his recognition of their salutes just stopped short of a blessing.
1	He jumped up, and the leaden eyes which twinkled behind his mountainous cheeks leered horribly upon the food as he unpacked it from the basket.
1	Upon that, Mr Rugg fell to work; and Arthur, retaining no property to himself but his clothes and books, and a little loose money, placed his small private banker’s-account with the papers of the business.
1	He softly pushed the book over to me, as Provis stood smoking with his eyes on the fire, and I read in it:-- “Young Havisham's name was Arthur.
1	It was another world, where sin and sorrow never came; a tranquil place of rest, where nothing evil entered.
1	‘It was at Mr. Creakle’s, my son tells me, that you first became acquainted,’ said Mrs. Steerforth, as she and I were talking at one table, while they played backgammon at another.
1	The tired company had broken up, and all the rest were gone to bed except the young lady’s father, who dozed in his chair by the fire.
1	They were consigned to me, with him, at the--” He dropped his voice, there was a flutter among the military lanterns, and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm in uniform, the eyes connected with the arm looked, not an every day or an every night look, at monsieur with the white head.
1	It was generally considered, indeed, that she had been due some time, and ought to have fallen long ago; but she had kept her life, and her situation, with an ill-conditioned tenacity that occasioned much offence and disappointment.
1	‘I refer you to my attorney, Sir; Mr. Perker, of Gray’s Inn,’ said he.
1	‘Is it a kind of a spluttering somewhere?’ said the dressmaker, with an inquiring look.
1	He took it in his, holding me lightly with his arm, and looking down into my face with the same genuine freshness and faithfulness of manner--the old protecting manner which had made that house my home in a moment--said, "You have wrought changes in me, little woman, since the winter day in the stage-coach.
1	“You little coarse monster, what do you think of me now?” “I shall not tell you.” “Because you are going to tell upstairs.
1	After that, love, bliss and rapture; rapture, love and bliss.
1	Yes.’ ‘Further, I am a gentleman of the softest and sweetest disposition, but who, if trifled with, becomes enraged.
1	‘What of her?’ ‘Why, sir,’ returned Dick, ‘between Miss Sophia Wackles and the humble individual who has now the honor to address you, warm and tender sentiments have been engendered, sentiments of the most honourable and inspiring kind.
1	But I should take it as a great favour if you would not press it without urgent occasion.’ Now, it could not be said that there WAS urgent occasion, for Lightwood retained no other affairs in his hands than such as still lingered and languished about the undiscovered criminal, and such as arose out of the purchase of the house.
1	But I do mind,’ said Fanny, ‘and so will you, Pet, when I enlighten you.
1	If you will let me go with you, Walter, I will go to the world’s end without fear.
1	Now, you see, that makes his good lady very uneasy in her mind, and me too, for whereas I'm a harum-scarum sort of a good-for-nought that more kicks than halfpence come natural to, why he's a steady family man, don't you see?
1	‘Listen,’ said Arthur, very seriously.
1	The agony on the shore increased.
1	I know it was a good squeeze, because, being very plump, whenever she made any little exertion after she was dressed, some of the buttons on the back of her gown flew off.
1	‘I--ha--thought it was Young John!’ said Mr Dorrit.
1	There was an empty niche from which some old statue had fallen or been carried away hundreds of years ago, and she was thinking what strange people it must have looked down upon when it stood there, and how many hard struggles might have taken place, and how many murders might have been done, upon that silent spot, when there suddenly emerged from the black shade of the arch, a man.
1	“No,” said he, with a glance of surprise: “who else should there be?
1	And so you chance to find, you know," Mr. Bucket went on, stooping over him with an air of cheerful raillery which Mr. Smallweed by no means reciprocated, "and so you chance to find, you know, a paper with the signature of Jarndyce to it.
1	Know then that I had, and that I have--do you understand me?
1	No one was stirring in the house.
1	But I cannot tell you at this time, and I cannot tell you here.
1	Well!’ Hearing this mention of their old friend’s name, the four Miss Kenwigses gathered round Nicholas, open eyed and mouthed, to hear more.
1	Equally hard up for a remark.’ ‘Somebody said something,’ returned Mrs Merdle.
1	‘But let me take you to your own rest, for you must need it.’ With that Mr. Grewgious helped her to get her hat on again, and hung upon his arm the very little bag that was of no earthly use, and led her by the hand (with a certain stately awkwardness, as if he were going to walk a minuet) across Holborn, and into Furnival’s Inn.
1	‘Not here.’ ‘But we have so little time to make so much of, and I have come so far, and am altogether so devoted, and distracted.
1	‘Thank you, my dear,’ he said, as if she had spoken; ‘I am all right, my dear.
1	I was still in this state of expectation, and had been, for nearly a week; when I left the Doctor’s one snowy night, to walk home.
1	You know that you made my life unhappy by your pursuit of me.
1	We must make proper inquiries into his statements, in justice to him as well as to ourselves, and if they are confirmed--as I feel assured they will be--we must assist him, we must assist him, brother Ned.’ ‘It is enough, my dear brother, that you say we should,’ returned the other.
1	A handsome mince-pie had been made yesterday morning (which accounted for the mincemeat not being missed), and the pudding was already on the boil.
1	On the day of judgment.
1	I wish he’d make a bonfire of his violoncello, and burn his music-books in it.’ ‘You respect nobody, Carker, I think,’ said Mr Dombey.
1	Mr Plornish, who had a small share in a small builder’s business in the neighbourhood, said, trowel in hand, on the tops of scaffolds and on the tiles of houses, that people did tell him as Mr Merdle was _the_ one, mind you, to put us all to rights in respects of that which all on us looked to, and to bring us all safe home as much as we needed, mind you, fur toe be brought.
1	And God knows I do!” echoed Biddy.
1	‘My brother.’ Mr. Tracy Tupman resumed his former position; and Mr. Wardle, accompanied by a surgeon, entered the room.
1	He was taken to Bow Street, as well as I remember, on the completion of his fifteenth journey; when four-and-sixpence, and a second-hand fife which he couldn’t play, were found upon his person.
1	‘Good day, sir,’ said my aunt, ‘and good-bye!
1	'I am not afraid,' said Oliver in a low voice, as he relinquished Mr. Brownlow's hand.
1	And don’t be thankful to us (for we never thought of it), but to Mr Rokesmith.’ The letter was written, and read to her, and given to her.
1	On similar grounds he never beheld an inmate at any one of its windows but he touched his hat.
1	"I hope I may turn out so," said I, "but I am much afraid of it, guardian."
1	I have been called in,’ he replied.
1	‘What will you take, sir?
1	Never let us be parted any more!’ His head, now grey, was encircled by her arm; and he groaned to think that never, never, had it rested so before.
1	When they reached the gate of the Fleet, the cavalcade, taking the time from the plaintiff, gave three tremendous cheers for the defendant, and, after having shaken hands all round, left him.
1	“And you in brown!” she said, indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry; “couldn't you tell her what you had to tell her, without frightening her to death?
1	For the question at issue is only a question of costs, a mere bud on the forest tree of the parent suit, and really will come to a settlement one of these days.
1	‘Will you leave a message for him?’ ‘When do you think he’ll be back?’ inquired the stranger.
1	It was dark in the morning, when I got upon the coach at the inn door.
1	In the interval, Miss Havisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of the most beautiful jewels from her dressing-table into Estella's hair, and about her bosom and arms; and I saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick eyebrows, and raise them a little, when her loveliness was before him, with those rich flushes of glitter and color in it.
1	‘Harriet,’ he said, detaining it in his.
1	No, sir,’ said Mr Venus.
1	He started on the entrance of the stranger, and rose feebly to his feet.
1	She had never been so handsome, in his eyes.
1	It will depend on you, and it could depend on no better man.
1	‘And what was it like?’ inquires Veneering.
1	“All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet, are always turning up,” said Miss Pross.
1	When any sharp sense of its being empty smote upon her, she could kneel beside it, and pray GOD--it was the pouring out of her full heart--to let one angel love her and remember her.
1	Yet every dim little star revolving about her, from her maid to the manager of the Italian Opera, knows her weaknesses, prejudices, follies, haughtinesses, and caprices and lives upon as accurate a calculation and as nice a measure of her moral nature as her dressmaker takes of her physical proportions.
1	“I know that what is said between you and me goes no further.” I asked him if he had ever seen Miss Havisham's adopted daughter, Mrs. Bentley Drummle.
1	T’other day when I touched his coat in the street, he looked round as if I was a toad.
1	‘Yes,’ said Nicholas, ‘to Golden Square.
1	A final word before I go.
1	I hope there may turn out to be no why not.
1	As it was, I thought as little of it as I might.
1	Could I raise a crowd of old company about you to-morrow morning, that would follow you to ruin like copies of your own shadow, and do you turn on me with your bold looks!
1	"I have come to bring you home, dear brother!"
1	First, will your ladyship allow me to ask you whether you have had any strange visitors this morning?
1	The Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt may be resolved into the following synopsis.
1	One day she failed to come, for the first time.
1	He didn't precisely remember where it was.
1	‘A little humouring of Pussy’s points!
1	‘It was then, when the love of two dead people who had been nearest and dearest to his heart, was all transferred to this slight creature; when her face, constantly before him, reminded him, from hour to hour, of the too early change he had seen in such another--of all the sufferings he had watched and known, and all his child had undergone; when the young man’s profligate and hardened course drained him of money as his father’s had, and even sometimes occasioned them temporary privation and distress; it was then that there began to beset him, and to be ever in his mind, a gloomy dread of poverty and want.
1	"But she had a large heart!"
1	What would you have?” They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night, and then rode forward again when all the town was asleep.
1	I am only your friend and distant kinsman.
1	The green damp hung upon the low walls; the tracks of the snail and slug glistened in the light of the candle; but all was still as death.
1	‘I wouldn’t have sat up all night alone with Betsey Jane!’ said Mrs Wickam, ‘not if you’d have put Wickam into business next morning for himself.
1	Mr. Lillyvick stood higher than ever; for he had shown his power; hinted at his property and testamentary intentions; gained great credit for disinterestedness and virtue; and, in addition to all, was finally accommodated with a much larger tumbler of punch than that which Newman Noggs had so feloniously made off with.
1	But unwilling to hazard the responsibility, she let me in, and presently brought the sharp message that I was to “come up.” Everything was unchanged, and Miss Havisham was alone.
1	His face, remarkable for a brown solidity, brightened as he shook hands with Uncle and nephew; but he seemed to be of a laconic disposition, and merely said: ‘How goes it?’ ‘All well,’ said Mr Gills, pushing the bottle towards him.
1	‘It includes it: yes,’ said Mr Dombey.
1	We went our way too, which was to Lincoln's Inn, as quickly as possible.
1	You know it is professionally arranged beforehand in all cases that are tried what facts the witnesses are to prove.
1	I did not come back, and they have passed unspoiled into my place.
1	At the same time far be it from me to--hum--to put upon the fine feelings by which my partial friends are actuated, the slight of scrupling to admit that those offerings are--hum--highly acceptable.
1	It was the very next night.
1	Even when she was quite a child, she was the Agnes whom we know,’ said I.
1	‘It’s no reason, Arthur,’ said the old woman, bending over him to whisper, ‘that because I am afeared of my life of ‘em, you should be.
1	Some were standing; some seated.
1	‘I shouldn’t have thought it.’ Not in the least looking at them, but looking at Little Dorrit.
1	From time to time, one man would whisper to his neighbour, or a little group would whisper together, and then the whisperers would nod fiercely to each other, or give their heads a relentless shake, as if they were bent upon doing something very desperate, and were determined not to be put off, whatever happened.
1	Now, Mr. Tulkinghorn is, in a manner, part and parcel of the place, and besides, is supposed to have made Mrs. Rouncewell's will.
1	Do not give way so bitterly, dear friend, don’t.
1	You have heard something, I des-say, of a change in my expectations, Master Copperfield,--I should say, Mister Copperfield?’ As he sat on my sofa, with his long knees drawn up under his coffee-cup, his hat and gloves upon the ground close to him, his spoon going softly round and round, his shadowless red eyes, which looked as if they had scorched their lashes off, turned towards me without looking at me, the disagreeable dints I have formerly described in his nostrils coming and going with his breath, and a snaky undulation pervading his frame from his chin to his boots, I decided in my own mind that I disliked him intensely.
1	‘“Flasher--ten guineas to five, Boffer kills himself.” Within what time shall we say?’ ‘A fortnight?’ suggested Wilkins Flasher, Esquire.
1	‘Who is a very old friend of my poor Uncle’s, and a most excellent man, Sir,’ pursued Walter, raising his eyes with a look of entreaty in the Captain’s behalf, ‘was so good as to offer to come with me, which I could hardly refuse.’ ‘No, no, no;’ observed the Captain complacently.
1	‘He’d write letters by the ream, if it was a capital offence!’ Mr. Micawber, without hearing her, went on.
1	So quiet, that when her father rose to take his leave, she looked round with a start, as if she had forgotten his being there.
1	Is that YOUR knowledge of life?
1	I may sell THEM, though I should be sorry to see the neighbourhood deprived of ‘em too.
1	I confess that I looked upon this as a very painful exhibition, and one by no means flattering to the national standard of honesty and honour.
1	A moment afterwards, he was as fawning and as humble as ever.
1	The general feeling seems to be that it's a blessing Mr. Krook warn't made away with first, mingled with a little natural disappointment that he was not.
1	How then, my queen?’ ‘On that night, when, emboldened by the scene you had assisted at, you dared come to my room and speak to me,’ she said, ‘what passed?’ He shrugged his shoulders, and laughed ‘What passed?’ she said.
1	‘Don’t call me by that name!
1	If I was to be informed, I should despair of understanding, and I'd rather not be told."
1	Thus Traddles and I found them at nightfall, assembled on the wooden steps, at that time known as Hungerford Stairs, watching the departure of a boat with some of their property on board.
1	‘Yes,’ replied a couple of shrill voices.
1	While his eyes were on the paper, he felt that the eyes of Mr Flintwinch and of Mrs Clennam were on him.
1	The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation.
1	With the Cathedral crypt he is better acquainted than any living authority; it may even be than any dead one.
1	Also to standby, as much as possible.
1	Greatly interested in his proceedings, Mr Swiveller observed him closely.
1	And make haste.’ Dick complied, his eyes wandering all the time from the temple on the table, which seemed to do everything, to the great trunk which seemed to hold everything.
1	She sank into Mr. Bumble's arms; and that gentleman in his agitation, imprinted a passionate kiss upon her chaste nose.
1	‘Let them take me at once.’ ‘Yes, but,’ said Mr Rugg, getting between him and the door, ‘hear reason, hear reason.
1	It was indeed a well; and the clear fresh stream was running at his feet.
1	Come!’ ‘No, no,’ rejoined Smike, falling back a few steps.
1	Who did it?’ ‘It is only I, Jasper.
1	The sun went down and the stars peeped out, the Tower turned from its own proper colours to grey and from grey to black, the room became perfectly dark and the end of the cigar a deep fiery red, but still Mr Quilp went on smoking and drinking in the same position, and staring listlessly out of window with the doglike smile always on his face, save when Mrs Quilp made some involuntary movement of restlessness or fatigue; and then it expanded into a grin of delight.
1	Miss Pross and he divided the night into two watches, and observed him at intervals from the adjoining room.
1	You’ll fall down and kill yourself, I know you will.’ ‘Now, pray don’t alarm yourself, my dear,’ said Mr. Pickwick soothingly.
1	‘Shut the door, sir!’ said Mr Boffin.
1	But I must have the information first, and judge for myself of its value.’ ‘Do you know nothing more powerful than money?’ asked the younger woman, without rising, or altering her attitude.
1	‘Not the slightest danger of that, ma’am,’ replied Bob Sawyer.
1	‘_I_ persuaded her,’ he said, with an edifying air of superiority.
1	It made no difference in me.
1	If we were in a more primitive state, if we lived under roofs of leaves, and kept cows and sheep and creatures instead of banker’s accounts (which would be delicious; my dear, I am pastoral to a degree, by nature), well and good.
1	'I took it for you, Noah, dear,' rejoined Charlotte.
1	The city is the seat of the local parliament of Virginia; and in its shady legislative halls, some orators were drowsily holding forth to the hot noon day.
1	For the rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard, from which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and coaches, on a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two miles and a half of public street and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any.
1	"Seven years dead," mused Scrooge.
1	‘I never heard of such a thing.
1	Thus attired, the Master of the Ceremonies, in strict discharge of the important duties of his all-important office, planted himself in the room to receive the company.
1	The whole household were amazed to see me, without any notice, at that time in the morning, and so accompanied; and their surprise was not diminished by my inquiries.
1	How was it!” As the concentrated expression returned to his forehead, he seemed to become conscious that it was in hers too.
1	The Colonel is produced, but is not at all near the thing.
1	“All things have worked together as they have fallen out.
1	"Better to say nothing of the sort, Rick, because I don't mean it."
1	I fell asleep worn out, and when I awoke I cried afresh to think that I was back in the world with my load of trouble for others.
1	"Why, you are worse than I thought you," says Mr. Tulkinghorn, muttering reproof to his watch.
1	At present I would prefer to see you anything rather than a friend, to me, or to anyone in whom I feel an interest.’ Once more he laid his hand upon my shoulder; and then taking his flute and a few books from his desk, and leaving the key in it for his successor, he went out of the school, with his property under his arm.
1	He could not sufficiently give utterance to his regret that he had not himself found a clue to this.
1	Could they bow down in prayer, and when all Heaven turned to hear them, bring the dark shade of sadness on one angel’s face?
1	Riderhood had done the deed, and entrapped her father.
1	“If thou be changed into this shape by the will of God,” say the seers to the enchanted, in the wise Arabian stories, “then remain so!
1	The visitors had had a minute or two to look about them, when the door opened and Miss Wade came in.
1	You see me in the plight in which I came out of the packet within this half-hour.
1	"Do as much by me in return."
1	I feel, on these premises, as if I was a bear—with the cramp—in a youthful Cotillon.’ His ungainliness gave him enough of the air of his simile to set Rosa off laughing heartily.
1	I have told you, over and over again when we have had a tiff, that you wanted to make everything go down before you, but I wouldn’t go down before you--that you wanted to swallow up everybody alive, but I wouldn’t be swallowed up alive.
1	We went upstairs to the first floor, still seeing no other furniture than the dirty footprints.
1	Mrs Pipchin herself is next handed in, and grimly takes her seat.
1	“Doctor Manette,” said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on the arm, “the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine.
1	As he knew the house well, he conducted Arthur to it by the way that showed it to the best advantage.
1	She has been expressing her anxiety that you should return in time.
1	It was most intolerably dirty; for it was Monday morning; and it had been tenanted by six drunken people, who had been locked up, elsewhere, since Saturday night.
1	It was nearly ten o’clock when he heard a knocking at the door, and still sat quiet as before, as if he could not even bring his thoughts to bear upon that.
1	They may--or they may not--have some reference to a subject which may--or may not--have cast its shadow on my existence."
1	As often as he put anything into his mouth, whether for eating or drinking, the face of the Marchioness lighted up beyond all description; but whenever he gave her one or other of these tokens of recognition, her countenance became overshadowed, and she began to sob.
1	More than that, I tell you--and I tell this gentleman, and these young ladies, if they are friends of yours--that if I took my wrongs in any other way, I should be driven mad!
1	Will you return with me and show him that you already know it?
1	To see Miss Mowcher standing over him, looking at his rich profusion of brown hair through a large round magnifying glass, which she took out of her pocket, was a most amazing spectacle.
1	There’s the light out--never mind--you know the way--straight on!’ Quilp had slily shaded the light by holding it against his breast, and now stood chuckling and shaking from head to foot in a rapture of delight, as he heard the lawyer stumbling up the yard, and now and then falling heavily down.
1	I’ve been treating ‘em all round.--Eh, Miss Dorrit?’ ‘Very generous of you,’ she returned, noticing another of the quick looks between the two.
1	He imagines that he must have seen it in some hospital or refuge, still, cannot make out why it comes with any special force on his remembrance.
1	I should ask Mrs. Gradgrind’s pardon for strong expressions, but that she knows very well I am not a refined character.
1	‘Not by any means,’ replied the old lord, ‘or you would have left it long ago.’ ‘You naughty creature,’ said the lively lady, poking the peer with her parasol; ‘I won’t have you talk so.
1	As I went up to my airy old room, the grave shadow of the staircase seemed to fall upon my doubts and fears, and to make the past more indistinct.
1	‘It’s a very extraordinary thing,’ she said, ‘a most extraordinary thing, that they should have invited Miss La Creevy.
1	On his return up-stairs, the rest of the guests soon dispersed, and he was left alone.
1	Don’t wait here out o’ compliment to me,’ said Sam, as the groom wheeled in the barrow, and prepared to shut the gate.
1	On our going downstairs again, Mrs. Jellyby asked me whether this troublesome business was really to take place next Wednesday.
1	If Lightwood could have seen the face which kept him awake, staring and listening in the darkness outside the door as he spoke of it, he might have been less disposed to sleep, through the remainder of the night.
1	Why, what but too many cooks should hinder you from having a dozen lawyers if the gentleman recommended them to you."
1	She says, says Em’ly, “Theer’s home!” she says.
1	When you come in here of an evening, and look round you, and notice anything on a shelf that happens to catch your fancy, mention it.’ Wegg, who had been going to put on his spectacles, immediately laid them down, with the sprightly observation: ‘You read my thoughts, sir.
1	I see him myself, with his eye at the counting-house keyhole, which being patent is impervious.
1	So immensely astounded was Mr Merdle by the entrance of Bar with such a reference in his mouth, that Bar explained himself to have been quoting Gay.
1	‘Many and many is the circuit this pony has gone,’ said Mr. Crummles, flicking him skilfully on the eyelid for old acquaintance’ sake.
1	Burning with curiosity to know what proceedings were afoot, he resolved to pounce upon Kit’s mother as the person least able to resist his arts, and consequently the most likely to be entrapped into such revelations as he sought; so taking an abrupt leave of Mr Swiveller, he hurried to her house.
1	To hear him say all this with unimaginable energy, one might have thought him the angriest of mankind.
1	It wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until the Bank closed.
1	I was heavier at heart when I packed up such of my books and clothes as still remained there to be sent to Dover, than I cared to show to Uriah Heep; who was so officious to help me, that I uncharitably thought him mighty glad that I was going.
1	The Captain also related how the intelligence of Walter’s supposed fate had first made him acquainted with Mr Toots, and how there was solemn treaty and compact between them, that Mr Toots should be mute upon the subject of his love.
1	‘No, no, Dan’l,’ she returned, ‘I shan’t be that.
1	Plenty will come in, but none can help.
1	cried Oliver; 'how kind of you to say so!'
1	With my head in its present state, I couldn’t remember the mere names of half the facts you have got to attend to.’ ‘That’s the reason!’ pouted Louisa.
1	I am quite an Infidel about it, and shall never be converted.
1	"Oh, not so bad as me," says Jo.
1	‘Put the bottle by with the rest,’ said Rigaud.
1	Say you are sure before I go away, Ma?"
1	It is a world of disappointment:  often to the hopes we most cherish, and hopes that do our nature the greatest honour.
1	‘“Leave the lamp,” said the baron.
1	‘For it’s after hours and I am all alone, my dear,’ he explained, ‘and am having--as I sometimes do when they are all gone--a quiet tea.’ Looking round the office, as if her father were a captive and this his cell, Bella hugged him and choked him to her heart’s content.
1	His body was much bent, and his face was wrinkled and yellow.
1	But it was not always thus with Mr Chick.
1	This being before breakfast, rather disposed me, I confess, to nausea; but looking attentively at one of the expectorators, I plainly saw that he was young in chewing, and felt inwardly uneasy, himself.
1	Mr. Folair having obligingly confided these particulars to Nicholas, left him to mingle with his fellows; the work of personal introduction was completed by Mr. Vincent Crummles, who publicly heralded the new actor as a prodigy of genius and learning.
1	I will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour, and be ready as soon as you are.'
1	He remains in that attitude after they, are spoken, as if in a kind of fascination attendant on his strong interest in the youthful spirit that he loves so well.
1	‘There ain’t anything the matter, is there?’ ‘No, no, mother,’ replied Wardle; ‘he says there’s a snowdrift, and a wind that’s piercing cold.
1	Would you like it?’ ‘I should like it, for it is lonely here; but I am afraid you will feel the cold too much.’ ‘I don’t mind cold.
1	Nicholas hardly dared to look out of the window; but he did so, and the very first object that met his eyes was the wretched Smike: so bedabbled with mud and rain, so haggard and worn, and wild, that, but for his garments being such as no scarecrow was ever seen to wear, he might have been doubtful, even then, of his identity.
1	We are ready!” So we all put our pocket-handkerchiefs to our faces, as if our noses were bleeding, and filed out two and two; Joe and I; Biddy and Pumblechook; Mr. and Mrs. Hubble.
1	I hope it may not,’ said the Secretary in a lower voice, ‘be the result of the false accusation which has been retracted.’ When they had passed on a little further without speaking, Bella, after stealing a glance or two at the Secretary, suddenly said: ‘Oh, Mr Rokesmith, don’t be hard with me, don’t be stern with me; be magnanimous!
1	None in the old days when the innocent perished with the guilty, a thousand to one?
1	‘By George!’ replied the keeper, shaking his head so emphatically that he was obliged to frown to keep his hat on.
1	It can never, never, give me any feeling but pleasure to see you.
1	‘Look here, Riah,’ said Fledgeby, mollified by these self-approving considerations.
1	It is true.’ He laughed again, and whistled the burden of the tune he had sung at the door.
1	Eh?’ Sam stole a look at the inquirer.
1	'It is so pretty,' replied Oliver.
1	‘Mr Henry Gowan.’ ‘Ah, to be sure!’ cried Clennam with unusual vivacity, ‘Yes!--I forgot him.’ ‘As I mentioned, you may remember,’ said Daniel Doyce, ‘he is always there on Sunday.’ ‘Yes, yes,’ returned Clennam; ‘I remember now.’ Daniel Doyce, still wiping his forehead, ploddingly repeated.
1	But he was great of soul.
1	Stupidly dozing, or communing with her incapable self about nothing, she sat for a little while with her hands at her ears, and her head resting on them.
1	I will therefore, if you please, go my way, leaving you to yours.
1	With limbs huddled together, head bowed down, arms crossed upon the breast, and fingers tightly clenched, it rocked to and fro upon its seat without a moment’s pause, accompanying the action with the mournful sound he had heard.
1	That ain't like being worn out.
1	‘It is Madame Mantalini,’ said Kate.
1	You see his wish was not forgotten.’ Nothing more passed at the time, but that night, as Nicholas sat beside his bed, Smike started from what had seemed to be a slumber, and laying his hand in his, prayed, as the tears coursed down his face, that he would make him one solemn promise.
1	I will not say what consideration I might give to that point myself, Mr. Copperfield, if I were unfettered.
1	The Doctor’s was a mighty fine house, fronting the sea.
1	After some discussion, in which all three took an active part, it was decided that Nancy should repair to the Jew's next evening when the night had set in, and bring Oliver away with her; Fagin craftily observing, that, if he evinced any disinclination to the task, he would be more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in his behalf, than anybody else.
1	In these and her clean dress originated a fable that she was well to do in the world: one might say, for her station, rich.
1	Wot do you say to another o’ the same dimensions?’ ‘I would rather not, I am much obliged to you, Sir,’ replied Job--‘much rather not.’ ‘Vell, then, wot do you say to some wittles?’ inquired Sam.
1	Don’t tell me’--said Sampson, shaking his head, and working with both his hands as if he were clearing away ten thousand cobwebs.
1	Whichever way I turn, I am undone.
1	Your plate was stowed away among the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good polish in a day or two.
1	She had such an exquisite little nosegay in her hand.
1	Come and hear Miss Wade!’ How could I engage their attentions, when my heart was burning against these ignorant designs?
1	I have said that they were truly happy; and without strong affection and humanity of heart, and gratitude to that Being whose code is Mercy, and whose great attribute is Benevolence to all things that breathe, happiness can never be attained.
1	Framed and glazed upon the wall behind the dingy little bar, was another Pegasus—a theatrical one—with real gauze let in for his wings, golden stars stuck on all over him, and his ethereal harness made of red silk.
1	On the very first evening after our arrival, Mr. Barkis appeared in an exceedingly vacant and awkward condition, and with a bundle of oranges tied up in a handkerchief.
1	And then, with his right hand at his lips, repeated thoughtfully, ‘a Teapot, a Teapot’, and glanced over the books on the floor, as if he knew there was something interesting connected with a teapot, somewhere among them.
1	Nickleby!’ cried Sir Mulberry Hawk, as his friend looked back, and stared him in the face.
1	My worst enemies--every man has his enemies, Sir, and I have mine--never accused me of being meek.
1	What I want your grand-daughter for, is to point ‘em out to the company; they would be soon learnt, and she has a way with her that people wouldn’t think unpleasant, though she does come after me; for I’ve been always accustomed to go round with visitors myself, which I should keep on doing now, only that my spirits make a little ease absolutely necessary.
1	And for that, too, his nose shall be put to the grindstone.’ ‘How do you propose to do it, Mr Wegg?’ ‘To put his nose to the grindstone?
1	And now, that the false Rob had brought distrust, treachery, and meanness into the very parlour, which was a kind of sacred place, Captain Cuttle felt as if the parlour might have gone down next, and not surprised him much by its sinking, or given him any very great concern.
1	He argued with Henry that the dog had been already poisoned when he changed so, and sprang at him.
1	Mr. Sharp was the first master, and superior to Mr. Mell.
1	After the first few days, Little Dorrit happened one morning to assist at these attentions.
1	Indeed her sense of touch is now so exquisite, that having been acquainted with a person once, she can recognise him or her after almost any interval.
1	The lady with whom Estella was placed, Mrs. Brandley by name, was a widow, with one daughter several years older than Estella.
1	‘I have always taken an annual present into account.’ ‘My dear tutor,’ said I (now, really, without any nonsense), ‘to whom I owe more obligations already than I ever can acknowledge--’ ‘No, no,’ interposed the Doctor.
1	The church with the slender spire, that stands on the top of the hill now, was not there then to tell me the time.
1	He saw it; and though his expression did not change, she knew he saw it.
1	‘Now, come, Liz; don’t let us quarrel: let us be reasonable and talk this over like brother and sister.
1	‘He was crossing you and wheedling you, I saw; and you were soft wax in his hands, I saw.
1	I might not have been prepared to give the little creature a very kind reception, if, on her removing the umbrella, which her utmost efforts were unable to shut up, she had shown me the ‘volatile’ expression of face which had made so great an impression on me at our first and last meeting.
1	What are you thinking of, Trot?’ I was thinking of all that had been said.
1	‘I should like to see his poem,’ said Mr. Snodgrass.
1	What gallery in the world can produce the counterpart of that?’ As the smiling gentleman thus spake, he pointed through a doorway to where Mr Dombey and Edith were standing alone in the centre of another room.
1	‘All the symptoms aggerawated,’ replied Mr. Weller, shaking his head.
1	A crowd had flocked in from the Court House, and a voice from among them called out to the landlord, ‘Colonel!
1	Perhaps fifty times as good.
1	We all remained silent, and occupied with our own reflections (my aunt drying her eyes, and now sobbing convulsively, and now laughing and calling herself a fool); until I spoke.
1	Little Dorrit sat down in a golden chair, made quite giddy by these rapid interruptions.
1	To my dear boy?’ ‘Dear!’ repeated Mr. Gradgrind.
1	There was a melancholy wind, and the marshes were very dismal.
1	She was the only person who could have stood between me and the silent Tomb, and she did it, in a manner to command my everlasting admiration.
1	And isn’t it pleasant to know that the good will be done with the poor sad child’s own money?’ ‘Yes; and it’s pleasant to know that you are Mrs Boffin,’ said her husband, ‘and it’s been a pleasant thing to know this many and many a year!’ It was ruin to Mrs Boffin’s aspirations, but, having so spoken, they sat side by side, a hopelessly Unfashionable pair.
1	By eight o’clock next morning, the traveller is at the end of his journey, which is performed by steamboat upon Lake Ontario, calling at Port Hope and Coburg, the latter a cheerful, thriving little town.
1	She requested them to be seated; and declining to take a seat herself, at once anticipated any introduction of their business.
1	Insomuch that his heart had just now swelled and the tears had come into his eyes when he had looked round the room and thought, "I was the great patron of Coavinses, and his little comforts were MY work!"
1	That done, she once more reminded him of their compact and gaily parted from him.
1	He takes from a locked press a peculiar-looking pipe, which he fills—but not with tobacco—and, having adjusted the contents of the bowl, very carefully, with a little instrument, ascends an inner staircase of only a few steps, leading to two rooms.
1	Shadows on the wall have caught your whispers, and brought them to my ear; the sight of the persecuted child has turned vice itself, and given it the courage and almost the attributes of virtue.
1	It chanced that they derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main building, but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about that.
1	Sometimes the broken reply was, “Wait!
1	Now, my dear Paul, come upstairs with me.’ Mr Dombey, who, besides being generally influenced by his sister for the reason already mentioned, had really faith in her as an experienced and bustling matron, acquiesced; and followed her, at once, to the sick chamber.
1	He has been so good as take his tea with us, and we are thankful to him for his company, also to you, sir, for your notice.’ ‘Ma’am,’ returned Mr. Micawber, with a bow, ‘you are very obliging: and what are you doing, Copperfield?
1	Pray tell me about him!
1	Walking along the street, reflecting upon the probability of something turning up (of which I am at present rather sanguine), I find a young but valued friend turn up, who is connected with the most eventful period of my life; I may say, with the turning-point of my existence.
1	You remember that spice-box, Kate?’ ‘Perfectly well, mama.’ ‘I shouldn’t think you did, Kate,’ returned Mrs. Nickleby, in a severe manner, ‘talking about it in that cold and unfeeling way!
1	I took my leave of Mr. Micawber, for the time, charging him with my best remembrances to all at home.
1	The portmanteaus and carpet-bags have been stowed away, and Mr. Weller and the guard are endeavouring to insinuate into the fore- boot a huge cod-fish several sizes too large for it--which is snugly packed up, in a long brown basket, with a layer of straw over the top, and which has been left to the last, in order that he may repose in safety on the half-dozen barrels of real native oysters, all the property of Mr. Pickwick, which have been arranged in regular order at the bottom of the receptacle.
1	At first he remained stock still; then hurried after her.
1	I am deeply obliged to you for your encouragement and patronage, but it was papa who asked for it.
1	We could have seen what he was about, if he had carried a light one.
1	the Holidays When the Midsummer vacation approached, no indecent manifestations of joy were exhibited by the leaden-eyed young gentlemen assembled at Doctor Blimber’s.
1	‘I am extremely happy to hear it.
1	‘True,’ said Jingle, nodding his head.
1	The more she clung to it, the more the dear dead child was in her thoughts: but as if the last time she had seen her father, had been when he was sleeping and she kissed his face, she always left him so, and never, in her fancy, passed that hour.
1	Presently, the chateau began to make itself strangely visible by some light of its own, as though it were growing luminous.
1	As so much time has passed, and as you spoke only this morning of my being so well again, perhaps you expect me to renew the subject.
1	She would say, ‘Take a salamander,’ as if a general should command a private to catch a Tartar.
1	‘Well, sir, to tell you the truth, I don’t know what to say to you.’ ‘Say nothing,’ returned Mr Rokesmith; ‘allow me to call on you in a few days.
1	‘Floy, did I ever see Mama?’ ‘No, darling, why?’ ‘Did I ever see any kind face, like Mama’s, looking at me when I was a baby, Floy?’ He asked, incredulously, as if he had some vision of a face before him.
1	For some moments not a word was spoken.
1	“But you are not English,” said the wood-sawyer, “though you wear English dress?” “Yes,” said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder.
1	‘Then you won’t have none tomorrow.
1	There were twenty churches close together, clamouring for people to come in.
1	Notoriety, notoriety, is the thing.
1	All this time Mr Chuckster had been standing at the door, and the small servant had been afraid to approach.
1	His health beginning to fail at the expiration of that time, the surgeon recommended that he should work occasionally in the garden; and as he liked the notion very much, he went about this new occupation with great cheerfulness.
1	It is the manner of communicating these diseases; it is the subtle way in which they go about.
1	Why, the husband sends back word that the medicine won't suit his wife's complaint, and so she shan't take it--says she shan't take it, sir!
1	‘I like to see sturdy patriotism, on whatever side it is called forth--and so it’s a spirited contest?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ said the little man, ‘very much so indeed.
1	And nothing can be more laudable.
1	Is it that the carpets and the cushions are too soft and noiseless, so that those who move or repose among them seem to act by stealth?
1	Think of Stephen, think of Stephen, think of Stephen!’ By an earnest repetition of this entreaty, poured out in all the agony of such a moment, Sissy at last brought her to be silent, and to look at her with a tearless face of stone.
1	Then, he sat himself down on a chair opposite to me; rested an arm on each knee; and, leaning forward very much, took from the ground, by a great effort, the specimen of metropolitan workmanship which I had just pulled off: whistling, pleasantly, as he did so.
1	Dead, I have found them when they might have slighted my name, and passed greedily over my grave to ease and wealth, lingering by the way, like single-hearted children, to recall their love for me when I was a poor frightened child.
1	And that Mr Boffin has not treated him well?’ ‘Has treated him most shamefully, dear Pa!’ cried Bella with a flashing face.
1	It is fair enough, perhaps, that you should pay her some, if she can help you to what you want to know.
1	In due sequence Mr Flintwinch appeared; on whose entrance the visitor rose from his chair, laughing loud, and folded him in a close embrace.
1	‘Not the slightest fear, Sir,’ interposed the hostler.
1	I call them the Wards in Jarndyce.
1	They passed the day in the country, and the Doctor was quite restored.
1	Poet, Sir?’ ‘My friend Mr. Snodgrass has a strong poetic turn,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	Her lips were a little parted, as if her heart beat faster than usual.
1	Why, to say the truth, both have taken a little out of me to-day, my dear, but that was to be expected.
1	‘On my way to--where I am going.’ ‘Church Street, Smith Square, by Mill Bank,’ repeated Miss Peecher, in her own thoughts.
1	asked the old lady, after a pause.
1	‘I tell you, I wish such things were more common than they are, and more easily done.
1	And now, if you please, gentlemen, I wish to know--I demand to know; I have the right--what you have to say to me, which justifies such a tone as you have assumed, and that underhand interference in my affairs which, I have reason to suppose, you have been practising.
1	There’ll be mischief done at sea, I expect, before long.’ It was a murky confusion--here and there blotted with a colour like the colour of the smoke from damp fuel--of flying clouds, tossed up into most remarkable heaps, suggesting greater heights in the clouds than there were depths below them to the bottom of the deepest hollows in the earth, through which the wild moon seemed to plunge headlong, as if, in a dread disturbance of the laws of nature, she had lost her way and were frightened.
1	‘Ay,’ returned the schoolmaster gaily, ‘for many a merry year to come, I hope.
1	‘What can that be?’ Agnes laid aside her work, and replied, folding her hands upon one another, and looking pensively at me out of those beautiful soft eyes of hers: ‘I believe he is going to enter into partnership with papa.’ ‘What?
1	I know I am affectionate.
1	I had no time for verification, no time for selection, no time for anything, for I had no time to spare.
1	Not as she is, but as she was when she first came here?” She was seated on the ground, with her arms on the ragged chair, and her head leaning on them.
1	I haven’t always occupied my present station of life.
1	‘What names, sir?’ said the man at the door.
1	This time he does touch her with his outstretched hand.
1	ha!’ With this fortifying assurance, he stole past a street-door, on which Nicholas caught a glimpse of a brass plate, with ‘BOBSTER,’ in very large letters; and, stopping at the area-gate, which was open, signed to his young friend to descend.
1	At length, she said, in a trembling voice: 'I hope not, Oliver.
1	He was readmitted to the presence of Barnacle junior, and found that young gentleman singeing his knees now, and gaping his weary way on to four o’clock.
1	A man stumbled against him as he turned away, who mumbled some maudlin apology.
1	‘In some high respects, Mr Eugene Wrayburn,’ said Bradley, answering him with pale and quivering lips, ‘the natural feelings of my pupils are stronger than my teaching.’ ‘In most respects, I dare say,’ replied Eugene, enjoying his cigar, ‘though whether high or low is of no importance.
1	‘She will be a treasure to the man she marries, sir,’ said Mr. Kenwigs, half aside; ‘I think she’ll marry above her station, Mr. Lumbey.’ ‘I shouldn’t wonder at all,’ replied the doctor.
1	Such was the hour when Clennam stopped at the corner, observing the girl and the strange man as they went down the street.
1	‘When he first came into my way--that the day had never dawned upon me, and he had met me being carried to my grave!--I had been brought up as virtuous as you or any lady, and was going to be the wife of as good a man as you or any lady in the world can ever marry.
1	There was a long hard time when I kept far from me the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant of its worth.
1	You have got a twist in that bone, to the best of my belief.
1	As he paces the leads with his eyes most probably as high above his thoughts as they are high above the earth, he is suddenly stopped in passing the window by two eyes that meet his own.
1	We waited half an hour, walking up and down, but there were no signs of him.
1	‘It’s a new coat,’ said Mr. Tupman, as the stranger surveyed himself with great complacency in a cheval glass; ‘the first that’s been made with our club button,’ and he called his companions’ attention to the large gilt button which displayed a bust of Mr. Pickwick in the centre, and the letters ‘P.
1	A bird of the air?
1	For the streets were so full of dense brown smoke that scarcely anything was to be seen.
1	"It is with exquisite pleasure, guardian--with a heart full of thanks."
1	What more the letter told me needs not to be repeated here.
1	What a companion you were!’ ‘Companion?
1	‘If the dog’s teeth have entered the leg, Sir--’ began Carker, with a display of his own.
1	When the time drew near for retiring, Mr. Bounderby took a glass of water.
1	What a novel illustration of the tender laws of England!
1	It was succeeded by a moment’s pause.
1	So they looked, so would he; so she, his weeping child, who should say when!
1	The gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this explanation; but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from Mr. Limbkins.
1	No portrait that I have ever seen of anyone has been half so replete with those qualities.
1	What I happened to find there, about their secret way of coming and going, without you--which was strange--led to my suspecting something wrong.
1	‘I have heard it remarked that she was a very fine woman, Mr. Weller,’ said Pell, in a sympathising manner.
1	Fagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking home a visitor at that unseasonable hour; and, indeed, muttered something about having no fire; but his companion repeating his request in a peremptory manner, he unlocked the door, and requested him to close it softly, while he got a light.
1	And it was now, about little Lucie's sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound, as of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising.
1	Come in!” and the Spy presented himself.
1	‘What I have come down to be, since I first saw you in this house!
1	The cries of the two elder MacStingers, and the wailing of young Alexander, who may be said to have passed a piebald childhood, forasmuch as he was black in the face during one half of that fairy period of existence, combined to make this visitation the more awful.
1	He was thought to have gone, but he was hiding.
1	Going along the passage, with the mingled consciousness and helplessness of a dream, he heard Mr Dombey’s door shut again, as Mr Carker came out: and immediately afterwards that gentleman called to him.
1	Pleasant sheds tears deserving her own name, and her sweet delusion is at its height.
1	‘The Weir’s there, and you’ll have to come back, you know.’ Without taking the least notice, Bradley leaned his body against a post, in a resting attitude, and there rested with his eyes cast down.
1	exclaimed Sikes, turning a look of excessive surprise on his companion.
1	I shouldn’t like to have it known that she was so much attached to me.
1	‘Why, my dear Sir, our friend’s in an unpleasant position--very much so.
1	"He is very weak," said the trooper in a low voice.
1	It's my old girl that advises.
1	Fifteen shillings!’ After carefully reading the dingy scrap of paper handed to him, and as carefully tucking it into his waistcoat pocket, Eugene tells out the money; beginning incautiously by telling the first shilling into Mr Dolls’s hand, which instantly jerks it out of window; and ending by telling the fifteen shillings on the seat.
1	Taking a pace or two over the stone floor, he came back to the table and finished what he had to say.
1	‘You are fairly in for it,’ said the jolly host.
1	Sincerely, honestly, indeed, Mr. Spenlow, I never thought so, before.
1	Might I ask you to take care of her until she is in the coach?’ ‘Miss Dombey,’ returned Mr Toots, ‘you really do me an honour and a kindness.
1	cries Mrs. Bagnet, looking at him curiously.
1	“Brute, ass!” and snap at me like a dragon.’ This was true enough; though the question which Newman anticipated, was, in fact, upon Ralph’s lips at the moment.
1	Expectation and excitement extend further yet, and take a wider range.
1	The purpose he had brought home to his native country, and had ever since kept in view, was, with her greatest determination, defeated by his mother herself, at the time of all others when he feared that it pressed most.
1	It certainly did seem that the whelp yielded to this influence.
1	“Clearly plots,” said Jacques Three.
1	And only because I am anxious for the family credit.’ ‘To the winds with the family credit!’ cried the old man, with great scorn and indignation.
1	‘I could wish,’ said Mr Toots, ‘to take this opportunity, Miss Dombey, if I might, of entering into a word of explanation.
1	Now, do be more practical.’ She had been practical enough with him, in suffering and striving for him; but she only laid her hand upon his shoulder--not reproachfully--and tapped it twice or thrice.
1	I don’t wish to alarm Mrs. Kenwigs; but I hope they haven’t come from any jail or hospital, and brought away a fever or some unpleasantness of that sort, which might be catching for the children.’ Mrs. Kenwigs was so overpowered by this supposition, that it needed all the tender attentions of Miss Petowker, of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, to restore her to anything like a state of calmness; not to mention the assiduity of Mr. Kenwigs, who held a fat smelling-bottle to his lady’s nose, until it became matter of some doubt whether the tears which coursed down her face were the result of feelings or SAL VOLATILE.
1	I can desire no more.
1	Thinking, perhaps, as he rode, that even this trivial sketch had been made and delivered to its owner, as if it had been bargained for and bought.
1	Dear boy, I done it!” I tried to collect my thoughts, but I was stunned.
1	But, whether she was afraid of singing before people, or was out of voice that evening, it was certain that she couldn’t sing at all.
1	Mr Swiveller pulled off his coat, and folded it up with great elaboration, staring at Miss Sally all the time; then put on a blue jacket with a double row of gilt buttons, which he had originally ordered for aquatic expeditions, but had brought with him that morning for office purposes; and, still keeping his eye upon her, suffered himself to drop down silently upon Mr Brass’s stool.
1	The imprisoned air, the imprisoned light, the imprisoned damps, the imprisoned men, were all deteriorated by confinement.
1	you alone are to blame, are you, sir?’ said Mr. Magnus; ‘I--I--see through this, sir.
1	I had not the least belief, in the outset of this story, that the unknown was anything but a delusion of Mr. Dick’s, and one of the line of that ill-fated Prince who occasioned him so much difficulty; but after some reflection I began to entertain the question whether an attempt, or threat of an attempt, might have been twice made to take poor Mr. Dick himself from under my aunt’s protection, and whether my aunt, the strength of whose kind feeling towards him I knew from herself, might have been induced to pay a price for his peace and quiet.
1	‘Well, sir,’ said Mr. Omer, removing his pipe, that he might rub his chin: ‘I tell you truly, I shall be glad when her marriage has taken place.’ ‘Why so?’ I inquired.
1	‘I have no patience’ (which indeed was the truth).
1	‘Miss Arabella Allen,’ said Sam.
1	No line was indicated by any contrivance, but she wrote straight and freely.
1	He is a kind of man--by George!--that has caused me more restlessness, and more uneasiness, and more dissatisfaction with myself than all other men put together.
1	I ses 'yes' I ses.
1	How else COULD he be disappointed?
1	"I am not sure, my dear girl, but that it may be wise and specious to preserve that outward indifference.
1	I began to be really afraid of him now and looked at him with the greatest astonishment.
1	But in the general tumbling up of the family, his tumbling out in life somewhere, was a thing to transact itself somehow.
1	Give my love to your aunt, George dear, and implore her not to curse the viper that has crossed your path and blighted your existence.
1	We are liable to be tumbled out neck and crop at a moment's notice.
1	The fulfilment of the second has not yet arrived.
1	Being by this time a perfect Fury and a complete success, she made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked.
1	Ours is a Copious Language, and Trying to Strangers.
1	The search continued for five days.
1	I would tell him before breakfast.
1	‘I regarded myself as a refuge, for her, from the dangers and vicissitudes of life.
1	But to no purpose; for still no trace of Edwin Drood revisited the light of the sun.
1	The late Compeyson having been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return, and being so determined to bring him to book, I do not think he could have been saved.
1	‘I shall know,’ replied the bold mild man, ‘when I have heard your Ludship tell it.’ With that, he leaned back in his chair and smiled at the ceiling, as knowing it by heart, and being already tickled.
1	‘Why will it vex itself, and twist its little face into bewitching nutcrackers?’ said Mantalini, putting his left arm round the waist of his life and soul, and drawing her towards him with his right.
1	The bat skimmed in fantastic flights through the heavy air, and the ground was alive with crawling things, whose instinct brought them forth to swell and fatten in the rain.
1	As his look wandered over the papers again and he passed his two hands over his head, I noticed how sunken and how large his eyes appeared, how dry his lips were, and how his finger-nails were all bitten away.
1	Now it was Ada, now one of my old Reading friends from whom I could not believe I had so recently parted.
1	I make an agreement with my son Watt to-day that on this day twelvemonth he shall marry as pretty and as good a girl as you have seen in all your travels.
1	To be sure, I don't know why I shouldn't be wished a hundred mile away, for I have not much to do with all this!"
1	I bought it of an individual that he gave it to, and that lived here after him.
1	‘O me, O me, my lungs is weak, my lungs is bad!
1	For how does it stand?
1	A pleasant journey to you.
1	‘I don’t know how he came or why, my dear,’ rejoined Mrs Nubbles, dismounting with her son’s assistance, ‘but he has been a terrifying of me out of my seven senses all this blessed day.’ ‘He has?’ cried Kit.
1	Is that so?’ ‘Yes, ma’am; indeed it is.
1	The atrocity in its full extent no longer exists, but there is enough of it left to give rise to occurrences that make the heart bleed.
1	‘Who have you got in this here conweyance?’ ‘Stand back,’ said Mr. Grummer, whose dignity, like the dignity of a great many other men, had been wondrously augmented by a little popularity.
1	It must not be supposed (or it would be a gross injustice to Mr Quilp) that he was tortured by any disinterested anxiety on behalf of either.
1	He had raised his fork to his lips, and was on the very point of opening his mouth for the reception of a piece of beef, when the hum of many voices suddenly arose in the kitchen.
1	I could not afford to lose him, but you will bring him safe back.’ ‘Well!
1	There was nothing of high mark in this.
1	There were three young women in adjoining cells, all convicted at the same time of a conspiracy to rob their prosecutor.
1	Let us walk.’ ‘But you will be so tired, my love.’ ‘Oh no!
1	To do Ralph Nickleby justice, he seldom practised this sort of dissimulation; but he understood those who did, and therefore suffered Bray to say, again and again, with great vehemence, that they were jointly doing a very cruel thing, before he again offered to interpose a word.
1	Probably you came over with the delayed mail that brings the advice.’ ‘That I came over with the delayed mail, sir,’ returned Mr Blandois, passing his white hand down his high-hooked nose, ‘I know to the cost of my head and stomach: the detestable and intolerable weather having racked them both.
1	But you had better ask Edward if you want to know.’ ‘I wonder he doesn’t call,’ said Little Dorrit after thinking a moment.
1	I smoke on srub and water, myself,’ said Mr. Omer, taking up his glass, ‘because it’s considered softening to the passages, by which this troublesome breath of mine gets into action.
1	He thought of the times he had seen the brother and sister together in deep converse over one of his own old college books; now, in the rimy mornings, when he made those sharpening pilgrimages to Cloisterham Weir; now, in the sombre evenings, when he faced the wind at sunset, having climbed his favourite outlook, a beetling fragment of monastery ruin; and the two studious figures passed below him along the margin of the river, in which the town fires and lights already shone, making the landscape bleaker.
1	She did not want to speak to her of this--she could not, remembering to whom she was opposed--but she wished, in one silent and affectionate embrace, to assure her that she felt it all, and thanked her.
1	Now, whether the shake had jumbled the fat boy’s faculties together, instead of arranging them in proper order, or had roused such a quantity of new ideas within him as to render him oblivious of ordinary forms and ceremonies, or (which is also possible) had proved unsuccessful in preventing his falling asleep as he ascended the stairs, it is an undoubted fact that he walked into the sitting-room without previously knocking at the door; and so beheld a gentleman with his arms clasping his young mistress’s waist, sitting very lovingly by her side on a sofa, while Arabella and her pretty handmaid feigned to be absorbed in looking out of a window at the other end of the room.
1	"My amiable child," murmured Mr. Turveydrop, adjusting his cravat.
1	‘Probably it will not,’ says Mrs Lammle, with a certain hardened manner upon her, that makes Twemlow shrink, ‘have surprised you so much as some others, after what passed between us at the house which is now turned out at windows.
1	‘Aha!’ said the fat boy.
1	So he descended the stair again, and, crossing the Close, paused at the great western folding-door of the Cathedral, which stood open on the fine and bright, though short-lived, afternoon, for the airing of the place.
1	‘’It ’im agin!’ cried the boy, as the poor creature leaped; ‘and made a dint in his wool.’ ‘Let him be!’ said Mr. Datchery.
1	Now send me out feet foremost!'"
1	“You are a little depressed, too,” said madame, whose quick eyes had never been so intent on the accounts, but they had had a ray or two for him.
1	‘If I was so inclined, the loneliness of this situation--you’ll excuse my speaking so free--would put it out of my power, in four and twenty hours; but I ain’t at all.
1	‘You’re wanted inside here.’ ‘Has Mr Abel forgotten anything, I wonder?’ said Kit as he dismounted.
1	‘What is the matter?’ exclaimed Nicholas, running to support her.
1	Paul and Florence went out in the meantime on the beach with Wickam--who was constantly in tears--and at about noon Mrs Pipchin presided over some Early Readings.
1	‘Quilp offers me this place, which he says he can insure me,’ resumed Dick after a thoughtful silence, and telling off the circumstances of his position, one by one, upon his fingers; ‘Fred, who, I could have taken my affidavit, would not have heard of such a thing, backs Quilp to my astonishment, and urges me to take it also--staggerer, number one!
1	It was not with me then, as it was in later life, when I fell into the society of the Passions, and compared them with Collins and Wopsle, rather to the disadvantage of both gentlemen.
1	The bookcase, glazed and locked, repudiated all familiarities.
1	‘Rachael, young woman; you know who this is?’ ‘It’s Mrs. Pegler,’ said Rachael.
1	Of which, to do her justice, she was wholly innocent, in thought, word, or deed.
1	The funeral had evidently taken place that day, for attached to his hat, which he still retained on his head, was a hatband measuring about a yard and a half in length, which hung over the top rail of the chair and streamed negligently down.
1	‘Why, you know, sir,’ returned Brass, venturing to be more familiar: ‘--the fact is, sir, that any allusion to these little combinings together, of friends, for objects in themselves extremely laudable, but which the law terms conspiracies, are--you take me, sir?--best kept snug and among friends, you know.’ ‘Eh!’ said Quilp, looking up with a perfectly vacant countenance.
1	I took advantage of the moment--I had sought one from the first--to leave the room, after beseeching Estella's attention to her, with a movement of my hand.
1	‘Louisa, Louisa.’ ‘You are quite another father to Louisa, sir.’  Mrs. Sparsit took a little more tea; and, as she bent her again contracted eyebrows over her steaming cup, rather looked as if her classical countenance were invoking the infernal gods.
1	The extreme disquietude of the old housekeeper's manner in saying this, her broken words, and her wringing of her hands make a powerful impression on Mrs. Bagnet and would astonish her but that she refers them all to her sorrow for her son's condition.
1	In the difficulty of hearing anything but wind and waves, and in the crowd, and the unspeakable confusion, and my first breathless efforts to stand against the weather, I was so confused that I looked out to sea for the wreck, and saw nothing but the foaming heads of the great waves.
1	"Look here," says Tony, recoiling.
1	And this is his wife, Mrs.
1	You don't know how well!"
1	And when I say so, you may trust to my being right, sir, for I have made it my business to study my high connexion and to be able to wind it up like a clock, sir."
1	I have made some advances out of pocket to accommodate these unpleasantnesses, but I necessarily look to being repaid, for I do not pretend to be a man of capital, and I have a father to support in the Vale of Taunton, besides striving to realize some little independence for three dear girls at home.
1	At the moment of my arrival, he had just finished putting somebody's hat into black long-clothes, like an African baby; so he held out his hand for mine.
1	The Jew was no sooner alone, than his countenance resumed its former expression of anxiety and thought.
1	'The reason of all this,' replied Fagin.
1	"It's just as likely as not," said Bob, "one of these days; though there's plenty of time for that, my dear.
1	If they wos a pair o’ patent double million magnifyin’ gas microscopes of hextra power, p’raps I might be able to see through a flight o’ stairs and a deal door; but bein’ only eyes, you see, my wision ‘s limited.’ At this answer, which was delivered without the slightest appearance of irritation, and with the most complete simplicity and equanimity of manner, the spectators tittered, the little judge smiled, and Serjeant Buzfuz looked particularly foolish.
1	He could turn cramp-bones into chessmen; fashion Roman chariots from old court cards; make spoked wheels out of cotton reels, and bird-cages of old wire.
1	Her mother’s picture was gone with the rest of the moveables, and on the mark where it had been, was scrawled in chalk, ‘this room in panel.
1	The unhappy collector looked piteously at his wife, as if to see whether there was any one trait of Miss Petowker left in Mrs. Lillyvick, and finding too surely that there was not, begged pardon of all the company with great humility, and sat down such a crest-fallen, dispirited, disenchanted man, that despite all his selfishness and dotage, he was quite an object of compassion.
1	‘From Sir Mulberry,’ replied Pyke.
1	The glazed hat made quite a show in the sun with its glistening, and the Captain continued to wave it until he could be seen no longer.
1	You have heard the dreadful nonsense he has been guilty of this night, and the manner in which he has gone on with that poor unfortunate little old maid.
1	‘I remember well.’ ‘Then I tell you what,’ says the Captain, leaning back in his chair, and composing his chest for a prodigious roar.
1	‘Sit thee down, master, in the elbow chair,’ said the old man, knocking his stick upon the brick floor, and trying to do so sharply.
1	Some are such little creatures, that the stairs are of Lilliputian measurement, fitted to their tiny strides.
1	I recommend you to take yourself off, and be talked to presently, you fool!
1	They ran to the window, downstairs, and into the street.
1	When the haughty beauty had concluded, she arose, and receiving Mr Dombey’s thanks and compliments in exactly the same manner as before, went with scarcely any pause to the piano, and began there.
1	She was a woman of about forty, I supposed,--but I may have thought her younger than she was.
1	A man yet dark and muddy, in long swollen sodden boots and a hat like them, was called out of a boat and whispered with Mr. Bucket, who went away with him down some slippery steps--as if to look at something secret that he had to show.
1	Do nothing for me; that’s all.
1	She hired a crossing-sweeping boy to show it her.
1	‘I’m sure I feel it myself, in my humble way,’ Mr Perch went on to say, with a shake of his head, ‘in a manner I couldn’t have believed if I hadn’t been called upon to undergo.
1	He was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before.
1	Really I didn’t know that I had.
1	‘Very lucky I had the presence of mind to avoid them,’ thought Mr. Snodgrass with a smile, and walking on tiptoe to another door near the bedside; ‘this opens into the same passage, and I can walk quietly and comfortably away.’ There was only one obstacle to his walking quietly and comfortably away, which was that the door was locked and the key gone.
1	Your letter is like you, and what could I say of it that would be higher praise than that?
1	My Lady trifles with the screen and makes them glitter more, again with that expression which in other times might have been so dangerous to the young man of the name of Guppy.
1	He had repeatedly said he would have Mr. Crisparkle’s life.
1	He only seemed to contrast his present cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over.
1	Smike had made good speed while Nicholas was absent, and with his help everything was soon ready for their departure.
1	But his desire was to the utmost to satisfy Society (whatever that was), and take up all its drafts upon him for tribute.
1	For a whole week after the happy arrival of Mr. Winkle from Birmingham, Mr. Pickwick and Sam Weller were from home all day long, only returning just in time for dinner, and then wearing an air of mystery and importance quite foreign to their natures.
1	‘You have done me an unmerited service.
1	It is, perhaps, hardly in the nature of woman to receive such attentions as the Major once lavished upon myself without betraying some sense of obligation.
1	And the parlour couldn’t bear straighter either.
1	‘We’d have had a young gentleman to meet you, if we had known you were coming,’ retorted Master Kidderminster, nothing abashed.
1	But we mustn’t talk about that over here.’ ‘Why not?’ ‘Oh, egad!’ said Mr Meagles, shaking his head very seriously, ‘he must hide all those things under lock and key when he comes over here.
1	All things, however, were in their places; all was quiet; and he lay asleep, his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow, and his hands lying quiet on the coverlet.
1	He trusted he had not lowered himself in the good opinion of his friends by this frank confession of his faults; and he hoped the promptness with which he had resented the last unmanly outrage on his feelings, to which he had referred, would reinstate him in their good opinion, if he had.
1	The door opening, without any note of preparation, and apparently of itself, the hard glazed hat in question skimmed into the room like a bird, and alighted heavily at the Captain’s feet.
1	The child looked around her, with that solemn feeling with which we contemplate the work of ages that have become but drops of water in the great ocean of eternity.
1	They were come into the High Street, where the prison stood, when a voice cried, ‘Little mother, little mother!’ Little Dorrit stopping and looking back, an excited figure of a strange kind bounced against them (still crying ‘little mother’), fell down, and scattered the contents of a large basket, filled with potatoes, in the mud.
1	She gives me nothing but reproaches, my Lady, for all I have done for her.
1	Not that its arrival brought me either; for, then I was worse than ever, and began haunting the coach-office in Wood Street, Cheapside, before the coach had left the Blue Boar in our town.
1	On one of these occasions, when they had both been perfectly quiet for a long time, and Mr Dombey only knew that the child was awake by occasionally glancing at his eye, where the bright fire was sparkling like a jewel, little Paul broke silence thus: ‘Papa!
1	That’s what a man of his character ought to have done, it would be argueyfied,’ said the Deputy Lock, cunningly harping on the strong string of her terror; ‘he ought to have handed her over safe to the Parish.
1	“What did you say?” “You can bear a little more light?” “I must bear it, if you let it in.” (Laying the palest shadow of a stress upon the second word.)
1	He was always foremost among them.
1	I have seen it displayed with such success, that I have encountered some fine ladies and gentlemen who might as well have been born caterpillars.
1	“What else can be the consequence,” said Herbert, in explanation, “if he will cut the cheese?
1	‘I don’t mean to preach; but I hope,’ says the doctor, gravely shaking his head, ‘that this escape may have a good effect upon you, Riderhood.’ The patient’s discontented growl of a reply is not intelligible; his daughter, however, could interpret, if she would, that what he says is, he ‘don’t want no Poll-Parroting’.
1	There was now so evident a faltering upon him, expressive of indecision whether or no he should express his having heard himself referred to, that Mr Milvey spoke to him.
1	If my time had run out, it would have left me still at the height of my perplexities, I dare say.
1	Let us pass to the second,’ said Clennam, smiling her agitation away, making the blaze shine upon her, and putting wine and cake and fruit towards her on the table.
1	I have no hope of its being untrue, but at least I may verify it.” Mr. Jaggers nodded.
1	When I had got into bed, and lay there footsore, weary, and wretched, I found that I could no more close my own eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus.
1	Thus, the little circle remained, on the most amicable and agreeable footing, until the Monday morning, when Nicholas withdrew himself from it for a short time, seriously to reflect upon the state of his affairs, and to determine, if he could, upon some course of life, which would enable him to support those who were so entirely dependent upon his exertions.
1	Being a great reader of all kinds of literature (and never at all apologetic for that weakness), he sat down comfortably to read.
1	‘This is unfortunate,’ said Rokesmith.
1	Mr. Muzzle opened one half of the carriage gate, to admit the sedan, the captured ones, and the specials; and immediately slammed it in the faces of the mob, who, indignant at being excluded, and anxious to see what followed, relieved their feelings by kicking at the gate and ringing the bell, for an hour or two afterwards.
1	'Here is another letter,' said Mrs. Maylie, pausing to reflect; 'but whether to send it now, or wait until I see how Rose goes on, I scarcely know.
1	As the Captain sat, and smoked, and looked at Florence, God knows what impossible pictures, in which she was the principal figure, presented themselves to his mind.
1	He gives me the cold shoulder on this very matter as if he had had nothing to do with it, instead of being the first to propose it.
1	‘I have put the words close to my heart.
1	“'If you remember,'” said Carton, dictating, “'the words that passed between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it.
1	"My friend the law-stationer's good lady, over there," says Mr. Bucket, luring Mrs. Snagsby forward with the finger.
1	Blameless as I was, and knew that I was, in reference to any wrong she could possibly suspect me of, I shrunk before her strange eyes, quite unable to endure their hungry lustre.
1	‘If the young man comes to be a teacher here, let him understand, at once, that we don’t want any foolery about the boys.
1	An actress’s Reading of a chambermaid, a dancer’s Reading of a hornpipe, a singer’s Reading of a song, a marine painter’s Reading of the sea, the kettle-drum’s Reading of an instrumental passage, are phrases ever youthful and delightful.)
1	Home, in its best sense, was for me no more.
1	I hope he does, I am sure."
1	I WILL see her when I please.
1	‘The very house I live in,’ sighed the poor gentleman, ‘may be taken from me tomorrow.
1	Unfortunately for, the experimental philosophy of the female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a similar result usually attended the operation of _her_ system; for at the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want and cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by accident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this.
1	'Oh, you little un-grate-ful, mur-de-rous, hor-rid villain!'
1	‘I don’t know what to make of it,’ said Miss La Creevy.
1	What is to be expected of, or by, such profligates?” “Is it not--forgive me; I have begun the question on my lips--a pity to live no better life?” “God knows it is a shame!” “Then why not change it?” Looking gently at him again, she was surprised and saddened to see that there were tears in his eyes.
1	These she put on, out on the staircase, first shutting and locking the door and taking away the key.
1	That was their meeting, their conversation, and their parting.
1	They violate equally the justice that should belong to Christians, and the restraints that should belong to gentlemen.
1	I never commit myself hastily in any affair, and from what I see of this, I by no means like the appearance of it.
1	Supposing it confined within reasonable limits, I would always encourage this kind of pride, as a worthy element of self-respect, in any person I employed; and should no more be deterred from doing so, because some wretched female referred her fall to a love of dress, than I would allow my construction of the real intent and meaning of the Sabbath to be influenced by any warning to the well-disposed, founded on his backslidings on that particular day, which might emanate from the rather doubtful authority of a murderer in Newgate.
1	‘You’ll have to introduce one for the phenomenon, so you’d better make a PAS DE DEUX, and save time.’ ‘There’s nothing easier than that,’ said Mr. Lenville, observing the disturbed looks of the young dramatist.
1	At length he bethought himself of a widowed cousin, divers times removed, of Mr. Bazzard’s, who had once solicited his influence in the lodger world, and who lived in Southampton Street, Bloomsbury Square.
1	He can’t help his likings and dislikings, perhaps.
1	‘By no means,’ said Mr. Spenlow.
1	Mr. and Mrs. Squeers at Home Mr. Squeers, being safely landed, left Nicholas and the boys standing with the luggage in the road, to amuse themselves by looking at the coach as it changed horses, while he ran into the tavern and went through the leg-stretching process at the bar.
1	A small square of carpet in the middle of the room, a few articles of furniture that evidently did not belong to the room, and a disorder of trunks and travelling articles, formed the whole of her surroundings.
1	"My son," said he, "it's two o'clock.
1	‘I expect him every instant, sir,’ said Arabella.
1	‘My brother Ned is a fine fellow, a great fellow!’ exclaimed brother Charles as he shut the door and returned to Nicholas.
1	One of them, the actual exhibitor no doubt, was a little merry-faced man with a twinkling eye and a red nose, who seemed to have unconsciously imbibed something of his hero’s character.
1	Mr. Tom Roker, the gentleman who had accompanied Mr. Pickwick into the prison, turned sharp round to the right when he got to the bottom of the little flight of steps, and led the way, through an iron gate which stood open, and up another short flight of steps, into a long narrow gallery, dirty and low, paved with stone, and very dimly lighted by a window at each remote end.
1	‘Can I do anything more, sir?’ I thanked him and said, No; but would he take no dinner himself?
1	His legs, which, being long, were afflicted with weakness, graced a pair of Oxford- mixture trousers, made to show the full symmetry of those limbs.
1	“Is he changed?” Miss Havisham asked her.
1	I had come in with an idea of distinguishing myself rather, conceiving that I was very well prepared; but it turned out to be quite a mistake.
1	Even Tommy Screwzer,--a man of an extremely bilious habit, with whom my friend Gay is probably acquainted--cannot say a syllable in disputation of the fact.’ Florence felt, more than ever, that there was something to come; and looked earnestly for it.
1	They glided into the places where Jeremiah had left them; and Clennam, stepping forward as that old gentleman returned, informed him that he had accidentally extinguished the candle.
1	‘Such an inconvenient staircase and so many corner-stairs Arthur,’ whispered Flora, ‘would you object to putting your arm round me under my pelerine?’ With a sense of going down-stairs in a highly-ridiculous manner, Clennam descended in the required attitude, and only released his fair burden at the dining-room door; indeed, even there she was rather difficult to be got rid of, remaining in his embrace to murmur, ‘Arthur, for mercy’s sake, don’t breathe it to papa!’ She accompanied Arthur into the room, where the Patriarch sat alone, with his list shoes on the fender, twirling his thumbs as if he had never left off.
1	Did you never hear your poor dear papa speak of the young lady who was the daughter of the old lady who boarded in the same house that he boarded in once, when he was a bachelor--what was her name again?
1	‘Again I think I may say, that’s not impossible.
1	“See arter the TIMES, Thomas; let me look at the MORNIN’ HERALD, when it’s out o’ hand; don’t forget to bespeak the CHRONICLE; and just bring the ‘TIZER, vill you:” and then he’d set vith his eyes fixed on the clock, and rush out, just a quarter of a minit ‘fore the time to waylay the boy as wos a-comin’ in with the evenin’ paper, which he’d read with sich intense interest and persewerance as worked the other customers up to the wery confines o’ desperation and insanity, ‘specially one i-rascible old gen’l’m’n as the vaiter wos always obliged to keep a sharp eye on, at sich times, fear he should be tempted to commit some rash act with the carving-knife.
1	It came out in Miss Peecher the schoolmistress, watering the flowers in the little dusty bit of garden attached to her small official residence, with little windows like the eyes in needles, and little doors like the covers of school-books.
1	'It is hard,' said the good doctor, turning away as he spoke; 'so young; so much beloved; but there is very little hope.'
1	“How do I know it, Handel?
1	I am sorry to have disturbed you.’ The glare of his eyes settled down into a look of recognition, and he moved a chair or two, to make a way to the fireside.
1	Sissy and Rachael helped themselves out of the smoke by the usual means, and were put down at a station about midway between the town and Mr. Bounderby’s retreat.
1	The Reverend Frank accordingly directed the notice of one of the attendants to him, by saying: ‘There is a person outside who seems to be really ill, and to require some help, though he says he does not.’ Lightwood had by this time secured their places, and the departure-bell was about to be rung.
1	"Your servant, gentlemen; I've been dozing.
1	Cousin Feenix rises, when the company have breakfasted, and the servants have left the room; and wonderfully young he looks, with his white wristbands almost covering his hands (otherwise rather bony), and the bloom of the champagne in his cheeks.
1	The narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time, and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it.
1	When they reached the passage, he laid his finger on his lip, and drawing close to the girl, said, in a whisper.
1	This getting off is all very well in its way, and it tells with such an anatomical Pump as this one,’ pointing out Mr Venus, ‘but it won’t do with a Man.
1	he said, laying the bundle on the table.
1	Miss Murdstone was between Dora and me in the pew; but I heard her sing, and the congregation vanished.
1	‘Ay, ay?’ cried the Captain, lifting up his bushy eyebrows a little.
1	It appears to me, that, under my humble roof, there’s hardly opening enough for a lady of your genius in other people’s affairs.’ Mrs. Sparsit gave him a look of the darkest scorn, and said with great politeness, ‘Really, sir?’ ‘I have been thinking it over, you see, since the late affairs have happened, ma’am,’ said Bounderby; ‘and it appears to my poor judgment—’ ‘Oh!
1	'She sold it,' cried Monks, with desperate eagerness; 'did she sell it?
1	Looking round, he discovered that the individual who resorted to this mode of catching his attention was no other than Mr. Wardle’s favourite page, better known to the readers of this unvarnished history, by the distinguishing appellation of the fat boy.
1	Adieu, you old man, grey.
1	'That's what it is, sir,' replied the constable, coughing with great violence; for he had finished his ale in a hurry, and some of it had gone the wrong way.
1	Nicholas bowed his acknowledgments, and was unfeignedly glad to see the cloth laid.
1	‘Then if I row up under the Fellowship and lay there, no need to whistle.
1	In that event, no doubt, he would establish the Jarndyce Institution and the Summerson Almshouses, and a little annual Corporation Pilgrimage to St. Albans.
1	‘What d’ye mean, eh?’ ‘Merely that your kind face and manner--both so unlike any I have ever seen--tempted me into an avowal, which, to any other stranger in this wilderness of London, I should not have dreamt of making,’ returned Nicholas.
1	Then I will tell you why.
1	"My instructions are that this boy is to move on."
1	‘Never!’ and, by way of showing that he had no desire to be questioned further, he drew a chair close to that of the spinster aunt and sat down.
1	The policeman, with becoming humility, related how he had taken the charge; how he had searched Oliver, and found nothing on his person; and how that was all he knew about it.
1	‘You hear this, girl?’ said Mr Dombey sternly to the black-eyed.
1	But he said to me aside in a meek voice: ‘I am well aware, Master Copperfield, that Miss Trotwood, though an excellent lady, has a quick temper (indeed I think I had the pleasure of knowing her, when I was a numble clerk, before you did, Master Copperfield), and it’s only natural, I am sure, that it should be made quicker by present circumstances.
1	‘They must not, indeed,’ rejoined Nicholas firmly, as he prepared to leave the house.
1	She fancied once that he spoke wildly, and at random; for on her saying she regretted not to have seen him when she had been there before that morning, he at first replied that he had been to see her, and directly afterwards seemed to wish to recall that answer.
1	His Uncle and he lay under a great obligation to Mr Dombey, which was of Walter’s own soliciting.
1	Finding all gentle remonstrance useless, Mr. Pickwick at length yielded a reluctant consent to his taking lodgings by the week, of a bald-headed cobbler, who rented a small slip room in one of the upper galleries.
1	'To be sure you can, and the sooner you go the better, Tom; so make up your loss at once, and don't lose any more time.
1	She stopped before a shabby little house, as closely shut up as a house that was full of cracks and crevices could be.
1	‘I said,’ he began, ‘when I saw you last, that there was something unexplained, which might perhaps influence you.
1	The sister may have sometimes sadly thought that if she had remained with him, the companion and friend she had been once, he might have escaped the crime into which he had fallen.
1	Mr Merdle didn’t want him, and was put out of countenance when the great creature looked at him; but inappeasable Society would have him--and had got him.
1	But as yet, the neighbourhood was shy to own the Railroad.
1	While it was preparing, I went to Satis House and inquired for Miss Havisham; she was still very ill, though considered something better.
1	Even taking into account what he was before, he is--hum--sadly broken!’ His supper, which was brought to him there, and spread upon the little table where he had seen her working, diverted his attention.
1	Dost thou know thot?’ ‘Oh, ah!
1	Many people are singularly like each other.
1	‘How it lightens my heart, even in such a strange meeting and parting, to hear this!’ ‘Strange words in my own ears,’ said Edith, ‘and foreign to the sound of my own voice!
1	I watched him when you were laying on to little Bolder this afternoon.
1	He wandered on again, irresolute and undecided, and oppressed with the fear of another solitary night.
1	‘Very well,’ said Mrs. Micawber.
1	I--I--came,’ said Ralph, speaking more slowly, and with harsher emphasis, ‘I came to say how grieved I am that any relative of mine, although disowned by me, should have inflicted such punishment on you as--’ ‘Punishment!’ interposed Sir Mulberry.
1	He had turned into the narrow and steep street from which the court of enclosure wherein the house stood opened, when another footstep turned into it behind him, and so close upon his own that he was jostled to the wall.
1	As the old gentleman said this in a low voice:  more to himself than to his companion:  and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards: Oliver sat quite still.
1	‘But nothing can come of this subject now, and let us have done with it in the Devil’s name.’ ‘Agreed,’ returned Quilp, ‘agreed on my part readily.
1	It was but a day gone, and Joe had brought the tears into my eyes; they had soon dried, God forgive me!
1	Nor were the happy effects of this prescription of a transitory nature, as, notwithstanding that the distance was greater, and the journey longer, than the single gentleman had anticipated, she did not awake until it was broad day, and they were clattering over the pavement of a town.
1	Here’s a wenerable old lady a-- lyin’ on the carpet waitin’ for dissection, or galwinism, or some other rewivin’ and scientific inwention.’ ‘I forgot,’ exclaimed Mr. Ben Allen.
1	Along with the figure-head of Hope,’ said the Captain, ‘there’s a anchor; but what’s the good of my having a anchor, if I can’t find no bottom to let it go in?’ Captain Cuttle said this rather in his character of a sagacious citizen and householder, bound to impart a morsel from his stores of wisdom to an inexperienced youth, than in his own proper person.
1	Natur,’ said Mr. Squeers, solemnly, ‘is more easier conceived than described.
1	He rambled through the scenes of his old pursuits--through many where Florence lost him as she listened--sometimes for hours.
1	Making an inquiry or two about him in the town, I soon heard what company he was in and was coming among the brick-fields to look for him when I observed you bringing him home here."
1	Dinnot tell me thou bean’t, efther yon chap at schoolmeasther’s,” says I.
1	Mr Toots, to whom the question seemed perplexing, suggested ‘Cook ‘em.’ But Mr Baps did not appear to think that would do.
1	I saw you looking at it yesterday.
1	"I don't know," says Jo, staring moodily at the veil, "nothink about no papers.
1	If you will communicate your business to Mr Chuckster yonder, you will receive every attention.’ ‘Gentlemen,’ said Brass, laying his right hand on his waistcoat, and looking towards the father and son with a smooth smile--‘Gentlemen, I appeal to you--really, gentlemen--consider, I beg of you.
1	I know him!” He darkly closed an eye at Mr. Jaggers's name, and shook his head.
1	And Traddles, firing up as if he were plunging into a Parliamentary Debate, really did come out nobly: confirming me in good round terms, and in a plain sensible practical manner, that evidently made a favourable impression.
1	He spoke in a slushy voice, as if much mud had washed into his throat.
1	I have the honour to attend court regularly.
1	There’s a little summer-house overlooking the river, where we might take a glass of this delicious liquor with a whiff of the best tobacco--it’s in this case, and of the rarest quality, to my certain knowledge--and be perfectly snug and happy, could we possibly contrive it; or is there any very particular engagement that peremptorily takes you another way, Mr Swiveller, eh?’ As the dwarf spoke, Dick’s face relaxed into a compliant smile, and his brows slowly unbent.
1	Such is the wild idea that flutters through her mind.
1	"You have my free consent--a small gift from such a mother to her injured child!--but do not tell me of it.
1	I saw it.’ ‘To be sure it was in the open street,’ she observed, after a few moments of less and less angry reflection.
1	Nor could any such spectator fail to know in his own breast, that these men, through their very delusions, showed great qualities, susceptible of being turned to the happiest and best account; and that to pretend (on the strength of sweeping axioms, howsoever cut and dried) that they went astray wholly without cause, and of their own irrational wills, was to pretend that there could be smoke without fire, death without birth, harvest without seed, anything or everything produced from nothing.
1	‘Except when he’s elevated, Bob’s the quietest creature breathing.’ Here a prolonged imitation of a key-bugle broke upon the ear, succeeded by cheers and screams, all of which evidently proceeded from the throat and lungs of the quietest creature breathing, or in plainer designation, of Mr. Bob Sawyer himself.
1	Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness, was not its strangest quality.
1	You lodge yourself of your own accord in a house with a drunken--tailor, I suppose--or something of the sort, and a little crooked antic of a child, or old person, or whatever it is, and then you talk as if you were drawn or driven there.
1	But Mr Tite Barnacle was a buttoned-up man, and consequently a weighty one.
1	She was looking wonderfully well when I quitted it.’ ‘Mrs Merdle,’ said Mr Merdle, ‘is generally considered a very attractive woman.
1	‘And _I’ll_ take care,’ said Mr. Jingle internally; and they entered the house.
1	The life is more than she can bear.
1	And to breakfast with whom but his near neighbours, the Lammles of Sackville Street, who have imparted to him that he will meet his distant kinsman, Mr Fledgely.
1	And when the petition had been read and was about to be adopted, there came forward the Irish member (who was a young gentleman of ardent temperament,) with such a speech as only an Irish member can make, breathing the true soul and spirit of poetry, and poured forth with such fervour, that it made one warm to look at him; in the course whereof, he told them how he would demand the extension of that great boon to his native country; how he would claim for her equal rights in the muffin laws as in all other laws; and how he yet hoped to see the day when crumpets should be toasted in her lowly cabins, and muffin bells should ring in her rich green valleys.
1	A woman more angry, passionate, reckless, and revengeful never lived.
1	Hence, when Miss La Creevy, admitted by a girl who was cleaning the house, made her way to the sitting-room, she found Mrs Nickleby and Kate in tears, and Ralph just concluding his statement of his nephew’s misdemeanours.
1	It was from the lips of such a tutor, that the child learnt her easy task.
1	As soon as he had seen your friend here, safe in a coach with you, he hurried off to where he heard this,' replied the doctor, 'and mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place in the outskirts agreed upon between them.'
1	Not bad quarters, either," says Mr. George, looking round again.
1	Hearing Pet’s name among them, Clennam called out, ‘She is here, with me.’ There was some little wondering and laughing until they came up; but as soon as they had all come together, it ceased, and Pet glided away.
1	After gliding past the sombre maze of boughs for a long time, we come upon an open space where the tall trees are burning.
1	And in the nod and in the firm set of her mouth, there was a vigour of purpose not to be doubted.
1	The burden of proof lay with Mr. Alfred Jingle; and he produced his evidence that very day at dinner.
1	Not so gaily, but that the brilliant furniture seemed to stare her out of countenance as if it insisted on being compared with the dingy furniture at home.
1	I was not wholly indifferent, for I had a hope of being pleasant and useful to Tom.
1	Crossing this bridge, on my way back, I saw a notice painted on the gate, cautioning all persons to drive slowly: under a penalty, if the offender were a white man, of five dollars; if a negro, fifteen stripes.
1	‘Have you many scholars, sir?’ she asked.
1	As the question had no bearing, near or remote, on any foregone or subsequent transaction, I consider it to have been thrown out, like her previous approaches, in general conversational condescension.
1	Warmer, but almost as dismal.
1	‘We can never be too cautious,’ said Mr Brass.
1	‘You know, Copperfield,’ he said, in my ear (I did not turn my head), ‘you’re in quite a wrong position’; which I felt to be true, and that made me chafe the more; ‘you can’t make this a brave thing, and you can’t help being forgiven.
1	Miss Wickfield, if you have any love for your father, you had better not join that gang.
1	But he did not take his eyes off the robber, for an instant, during this action; and now that they sat over against each other, face to face, he looked fixedly at him, with his lips quivering so violently, and his face so altered by the emotions which had mastered him, that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back his chair, and surveyed him with a look of real affright.
1	Should the Skimpole have refused the note?
1	The precious child is safe in bed?” “And sleeping soundly.” “That's right; all safe and well!
1	At last, it came to a close; and the fire which had been lighted in the best parlour having by this time burnt up, they adjourned thither, to hear what Nicholas had to tell.
1	But when Walter told him what was really the matter, Captain Cuttle, after a moment’s reflection, started up into full activity.
1	It was past in a moment, and I listened again, and heard the footstep stumble in coming on.
1	‘Everybody who is at all acquainted with theatrical matters knows what a host of shabby, poverty-stricken men hang about the stage of a large establishment--not regularly engaged actors, but ballet people, procession men, tumblers, and so forth, who are taken on during the run of a pantomime, or an Easter piece, and are then discharged, until the production of some heavy spectacle occasions a new demand for their services.
1	She stole away to bed as quickly as she could, and when she was alone, gave free vent to the sorrow with which her breast was overcharged.
1	Behind dingy blind and curtain, in upper story and garret, skulking more or less under false names, false hair, false titles, false jewellery, and false histories, a colony of brigands lie in their first sleep.
1	You must go.’ ‘I would rather not,’ she said to the Doctor.
1	‘Bazzard!’ said Mr. Grewgious, suddenly turning to him.
1	That was a fatal blow.
1	Well: go along with you!’ ‘Do you know anything more,’ said I, standing composedly before her--she had patted me on the shoulder, and sat down in my chair--‘of that attachment of Agnes?’ She looked up in my face a little while, before replying: ‘I think I do, Trot.’ ‘Are you confirmed in your impression?’ I inquired.
1	Mama, forgive me when I say that it was you who first presented to my mind the thought that anyone could wrong me, and wrong him, by such a cruel suspicion.’ ‘Me!’ cried Mrs. Markleham.
1	‘Now, godmother,’ she went on, ‘I particularly wish to ask you what has taken place here, since I left the wolf here?
1	Is there any light a-comin?"
1	In a little while he came.
1	Near to that part of the Thames on which the church at Rotherhithe abuts, where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of close-built low-roofed houses, there exists the filthiest, the strangest, the most extraordinary of the many localities that are hidden in London, wholly unknown, even by name, to the great mass of its inhabitants.
1	There was not one gleam of interest, parental recognition, or relenting in it.
1	“Light those torches.” As one of the soldiers, who carried a basket in lieu of a gun, went down on his knee to open it, my convict looked round him for the first time, and saw me.
1	"My Lady is looking charmingly well," says Mrs. Rouncewell with another curtsy.
1	When she was a child she understood all her lessons before her masters taught them to her; and when she was grown up, she was the wonder of the world.
1	Fanny was delighted to hear him express the opinion.
1	‘Ask Mr Feeder, if you please, Toots,’ said the Doctor, ‘to prepare a few introductory volumes for Mr Dombey’s son, and to allot him a convenient seat for study.
1	‘Come!’ said she, accepting the offer of my hand to help her over the fender, and looking wistfully up into my face, ‘you know you wouldn’t mistrust me, if I was a full-sized woman!’ I felt that there was much truth in this; and I felt rather ashamed of myself.
1	There was life, and no more.
1	I think--but I really can’t say, sir.
1	At a little distance, stood Mr. Tupman with indignant countenance, carefully held back by his two younger friends; at the farther end of the room were Mr. Nupkins, Mrs. Nupkins, and Miss Nupkins, gloomily grand and savagely vexed.
1	‘No vay at all?’ inquired Sam.
1	"You don't mean that, I am sure?"
1	What’s in them stone jars, young touch-and-go?’ ‘Beer in this one,’ replied the boy, taking from his shoulder a couple of large stone bottles, fastened together by a leathern strap--‘cold punch in t’other.’ ‘And a wery good notion of a lunch it is, take it altogether,’ said Mr. Weller, surveying his arrangement of the repast with great satisfaction.
1	And there would be no Circuit to go.
1	He’s hurt so very bad, sir, that we donno how to get him up.’ They all consulted together, and looked anxiously at the surgeon, as he asked some questions, and shook his head on receiving the replies.
1	If he was to make so bold as say a word to me, I should slap his face.’ Her own was as red as ever I saw it, or any other face, I think; but she only covered it again, for a few moments at a time, when she was taken with a violent fit of laughter; and after two or three of those attacks, went on with her dinner.
1	Dick looked rather pale and foolish when he glanced at the direction, and still more so when he came to look at the inside, observing that it was one of the inconveniences of being a lady’s man, and that it was very easy to talk as they had been talking, but he had quite forgotten her.
1	‘Cert’nly they are, Sir,’ replied Sam; ‘but the turnkeys knows beforehand, and gives the word to the wistlers, and you may wistle for it wen you go to look.’ By this time, Job had tapped at a door, which was opened by a gentleman with an uncombed head, who bolted it after them when they had walked in, and grinned; upon which Job grinned, and Sam also; whereupon Mr. Pickwick, thinking it might be expected of him, kept on smiling to the end of the interview.
1	And drew a long breath.
1	‘Though, by-the-bye, I suppose it was one of that family that pinted me out?’ ‘No.
1	Of course I was in love with little Em’ly.
1	"Ah, but I don't know," replies Jo, shaking his head fearfully, "as he DON'T hear."
1	That, knowing what I do, you dare not tempt me further,’ said Nicholas, ‘and by this better right; that those I serve, and with whom you would have done me base wrong and injury, are her nearest and her dearest friends.
1	There are six children, and they never come unless the phenomenon plays.’ It would have been difficult for any party, family, or otherwise, to have visited the theatre on a night when the phenomenon did NOT play, inasmuch as she always sustained one, and not uncommonly two or three, characters, every night; but Nicholas, sympathising with the feelings of a father, refrained from hinting at this trifling circumstance, and Mr Crummles continued to talk, uninterrupted by him.
1	‘“You will never leave me,” murmured the young lady.
1	Come sundry rooks, from various quarters of the sky, back to the great tower; who may be presumed to enjoy vibration, and to know that bell and organ are going to give it them.
1	It was wonderful to see his face shining at us out of a thin cloud of these delicate fumes, as he stirred, and mixed, and tasted, and looked as if he were making, instead of punch, a fortune for his family down to the latest posterity.
1	Do not fear, Mr Boffin, that I shall contaminate the premises which your gold has bought, with MY lowly pursuits.
1	‘We’ll try and find out.’ Mrs. Squeers, being out of breath with her exertions, complied.
1	"You don't mean--" Mr. Jobling begins.
1	He is much too deep for me.
1	"In reference," proceeds the Chancellor with extra distinctness, "to the young girl and boy, the two young people"--Mr. Tangle crushed--"whom I directed to be in attendance to-day and who are now in my private room, I will see them and satisfy myself as to the expediency of making the order for their residing with their uncle."
1	She looked at me, with some fluttering wonder in her face.
1	‘YOUR varnish is fading.’ Mrs Boffin descended and went in.
1	After remaining here a couple of days I bound myself to a rigid adherence to the plan I had laid down so recently, and resolved to set forward on our western journey without any more delay.
1	There were, within sight, an auctioneer’s and fire-agency office, a corn-factor’s, a linen- draper’s, a saddler’s, a distiller’s, a grocer’s, and a shoe-shop--the last-mentioned warehouse being also appropriated to the diffusion of hats, bonnets, wearing apparel, cotton umbrellas, and useful knowledge.
1	“Dare I ask you to explain?” “I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had not been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet would have sent me to some fortress indefinitely.” “It is possible,” said the uncle, with great calmness.
1	‘Be careful what you say, old boy, for this is a serious matter.
1	It would be impossible to experience a similar set of sensations, in any other circumstances, unless perhaps in attempting to go up to the top of St. Paul’s in an omnibus.
1	He looked back when he had got the street-door open.
1	‘The noose, sir?’ retorted Mr. Lillyvick.
1	Forasmuch as they hang in my memory by only this one slender thread, I don't know what they did, except that they forbore to remove me.
1	Manners fit for a crown!
1	Those interests are now paramount in this office.
1	Shall I tell you on what accusation?
1	Florence, after hesitating an instant, complied.
1	We were both very much surprised, coming higher up, to find my outer door standing open (which I had shut) and to hear voices inside.
1	He undid it slowly, leering and laughing at me, before he began to turn them over, and threw it there.
1	I was looking at her with pleasure and admiration, when suddenly the growl swelled into a roar again, and a frightful bumping noise was heard above, as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it through the ceiling to come at us.
1	That, Mr. Lorry,” said Mr. Cruncher, wiping his forehead with his arm, as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his discourse, “is wot I would respectfully offer to you, sir.
1	‘Brother Ned,’ said Mr. Cheeryble, tapping with his knuckles, and stooping to listen, ‘are you busy, my dear brother, or can you spare time for a word or two with me?’ ‘Brother Charles, my dear fellow,’ replied a voice from the inside, so like in its tones to that which had just spoken, that Nicholas started, and almost thought it was the same, ‘don’t ask me such a question, but come in directly.’ They went in, without further parley.
1	‘See, my dear,’ taking her to the open window, ‘where they live!
1	So now Mr Gowan, like that worn-out old coffin which never was Mahomet’s nor anybody else’s, hung midway between two points: jaundiced and jealous as to the one he had left: jaundiced and jealous as to the other that he couldn’t reach.
1	There were a few articles of clothing for herself to carry, and a few for him; old garments, such as became their fallen fortunes, laid out to wear; and a staff to support his feeble steps, put ready for his use.
1	‘It is him,’ said Mr Wegg, ‘and he is capable of it.
1	The soldiers were in front of us, extending into a pretty wide line with an interval between man and man.
1	Tell your other friend to get his head painted for the sign of some public-house, and to get it done by a sign-painter.
1	Please take Julia Mills and me and Jip to Putney!’ So they went, very soon after the funeral.
1	‘I am all right, Sir,’ replied Mr. Stiggins, in a tone in which ferocity was blended with an extreme thickness of utterance; ‘I am all right, Sir.’ ‘Oh, very well,’ rejoined Mr. Anthony Humm, retreating a few paces.
1	If a man can’t pay his debts, he dies of a broken heart, and his widow’s a martyr.’ ‘Some people, I believe, have no hearts to break,’ observed Nicholas, quietly.
1	These were not the only members of the Dorrit family who turned it to account.
1	Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house.
1	"Drink put him in the hospital, guv'ner, and the hospital put him--in a glass-case, I HAVE heerd," Phil replies mysteriously.
1	And she is, no doubt.
1	‘What he has on his mind.’ ‘I ought first to see for myself that he has something on his mind, I think,’ said Clennam.
1	Mr List’s squint assumed a portentous character, which seemed to threaten a prolongation of this controversy, when his companion, who had been looking sharply at the old man, put a timely stop to it.
1	Also, when we played at cards Miss Havisham would look on, with a miserly relish of Estella's moods, whatever they were.
1	To this manoeuvre he accordingly resorted.
1	Finding by degrees, however, that I was sober, and (I hope) that I was a modest young gentleman, Mrs. Waterbrook softened towards me considerably, and inquired, firstly, if I went much into the parks, and secondly, if I went much into society.
1	‘There’s Jennings, little Bolder, Graymarsh, and what’s his name.’ ‘So there is,’ rejoined Squeers.
1	‘There was a girl called Alice Marwood.
1	Whether Bella might have noted anything more, if she had been less afraid of him, she could not determine; but it was all inexplicable to her, and not the faintest flash of the real state of the case broke in upon her mind.
1	The truth is, he wrote to me under a sort of protest while unable to write to you with any hope of an answer--wrote coldly, haughtily, distantly, resentfully.
1	They have descended a gentle slope, and enter upon a level, as compact and dry as a solid block of marble, two miles long.
1	His account of both was quite satisfactory to Wardle--as almost any other account would have been, for the good old gentleman was overflowing with hilarity and kindness--and a handsome portion having been bestowed upon Emily, the marriage was fixed to take place on the fourth day from that time--the suddenness of which preparations reduced three dressmakers and a tailor to the extreme verge of insanity.
1	I want particularly to know all about her.’ ‘I’ll take care, Sir,’ said the boy.
1	In half an hour, Mr. Pickwick was seated at a very satisfactory dinner; and in three-quarters Mr. Weller returned with the intelligence that Mr. Charles Fitz-Marshall had ordered his private room to be retained for him, until further notice.
1	"At least there is no opposition to YOU," Volumnia asserts with confidence.
1	So with the three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail coach; they were mysteries to one another, as complete as if each had been in his own coach and six, or his own coach and sixty, with the breadth of a county between him and the next.
1	Will you have the kindness to put my compliments into the first little parcel you’re sending that way, sir, and say that I would have sent ‘em before, only I was afraid they might be broken in the wagon, sir?’ ‘Don’t overwhelm the gentlemen with ordinary civilities when you see he’s anxious to have something to drink,’ said the gentleman with the whiskers, with a jocose air.
1	I hardly know what to liken them to, or how to describe them.
1	But he said you and I began it, and as he had me there--for we did--I put our acquaintance on the old footing.
1	‘I’m not a going to keep you, even, above an hour,’ said Mrs Brown.
1	‘Sir,’ said Mr Rugg, taking him by the hand, ‘you are a young man that it does one good to come across.
1	and Mrs. M’Choakumchild never make any mistakes themselves, I suppose, Sissy?’ ‘O no!’ she eagerly returned.
1	But she had never seen so singular a smile as that upon this lady’s face.
1	“If, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong to-night, I shall make sure that you've been praying again me, and I shall work you for it just the same as if I seen you do it.” The dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head.
1	‘Too early, no!’ replied Miss Sophy.
1	Meantime the fools bring grist to my mill, so let them live out their day, and the longer it is, the better.’ These agreeable reflections occurred to Ralph Nickleby, as sundry small caresses and endearments, supposed to be unseen, were exchanged between the objects of his thoughts.
1	Will you grant me time--any length of time?
1	You may do so with some reason, or you may do so with no reason, but he cannot be convicted on your suspicion.’ ‘Haven’t I said--I appeal to the T’other Governor as my witness--haven’t I said from the first minute that I opened my mouth in this here world-without-end-everlasting chair’ (he evidently used that form of words as next in force to an affidavit), ‘that I was willing to swear that he done it?
1	‘Mr Richard, sir, we should fall to work cheerfully, and not in a despondent state.
1	First, the--ha--the distinguished happiness and--ha--privilege which I now enjoy and appreciate; secondly, the arrangement--hum--the laying out, that is to say, in the best way, of--ha, hum--my money.’ ‘Well, sir,’ said Mr Merdle, after turning his tongue again, ‘if I can be of any use to you in that respect, you may command me.’ Mr Dorrit’s speech had had more hesitation in it than usual, as he approached the ticklish topic, for he was not perfectly clear how so exalted a potentate might take it.
1	Proposing then, this flight--not this flight, but the flight you thought it--you told me that in the having given you that meeting, and leaving you to be discovered there, if you so thought fit; and in the having suffered you to be alone with me many times before,--and having made the opportunities, you said,--and in the having openly avowed to you that I had no feeling for my husband but aversion, and no care for myself--I was lost; I had given you the power to traduce my name; and I lived, in virtuous reputation, at the pleasure of your breath.’ ‘All stratagems in love---’ he interrupted, smiling.
1	Ain’t he, pretty?’--or, when he got downstairs, making another trial at that verse of Lovely Peg.
1	At that instant-- ‘Little Kate Nickleby!’ cried the voice behind him.
1	She was going to leave it in a fortnight; the child couldn’t recommend her to another, she supposed?
1	Liar, scoundrel, dastard, thief!’ ‘I come here,’ said Nicholas in a low deep voice, ‘to save your victim if I can.
1	Beside him stood a glass of reeking hot pine-apple rum-and-water, with a slice of lemon in it; and every time the red-nosed man stopped to bring the round of toast to his eye, with the view of ascertaining how it got on, he imbibed a drop or two of the hot pine-apple rum-and-water, and smiled upon the rather stout lady, as she blew the fire.
1	The old wintry branches of chandeliers in the room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while we were out, and Miss Havisham was in her chair and waiting for me.
1	It was four in the afternoon--that is, the vulgar afternoon of the sun and the clock--and Mrs. Wititterly reclined, according to custom, on the drawing-room sofa, while Kate read aloud a new novel in three volumes, entitled ‘The Lady Flabella,’ which Alphonse the doubtful had procured from the library that very morning.
1	His first impression was confirmed.
1	The girl performed her office with such expedition, that in a very few minutes the coach was ready.
1	I could have no other motive, Trot, in keeping anything from you.’ ‘I know that well,’ said I.
1	It was an edifying spectacle, the young man in his easy chair taking his coffee, and the old man with his grey head bent, standing awaiting his pleasure.
1	Who’s got to say anything agin it?
1	All right behind, and full inside?’ ‘All right, old feller,’ replied the embarrassed gentleman.
1	An interview with Mr. Perker, next day, more than confirmed Mr. Weller’s statement; and Mr. Pickwick was fain to prepare for his Christmas visit to Dingley Dell, with the pleasant anticipation that some two or three months afterwards, an action brought against him for damages sustained by reason of a breach of promise of marriage, would be publicly tried in the Court of Common Pleas; the plaintiff having all the advantages derivable, not only from the force of circumstances, but from the sharp practice of Dodson & Fogg to boot.
1	The Dodger said nothing, but he smoothed Oliver's hair over his eyes, and said he'd know better, by and by; upon which the old gentleman, observing Oliver's colour mounting, changed the subject by asking whether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning?
1	‘I can’t help it, indeed, sir,’ rejoined the boy, crying.
1	It is enough for me to know in my own heart that I am not going to--’ having imprudently got into a sentence without providing a way out of it, Miss Lavinia was constrained to close with ‘going to it’.
1	Not that I need mention it, for it hardly seems to belong to anything.
1	You signified to me, when I called t’other morning, that you were.
1	Unsought, he never came, all day, between the morning and the night.
1	See how taut the line is!’ ‘I must have it up,’ said Mr Inspector.
1	Here, guard, pick up that gentleman’s carving-knife.” ‘As quickly as my uncle said the words, the guard appeared at the coach window, with the gentleman’s sword in his hand.
1	Lead him off!’ and I saw, from behind my aunt, a sort of hurried battle-piece, in which the donkey stood resisting everybody, with all his four legs planted different ways, while Janet tried to pull him round by the bridle, Mr. Murdstone tried to lead him on, Miss Murdstone struck at Janet with a parasol, and several boys, who had come to see the engagement, shouted vigorously.
1	The other may be taste; but this is reason.
1	Your dear friend followed me to my retreat, and was very droll on the severance of the connection; though he was sorry, too, for the excellent people (in their way the best he had ever met), and deplored the necessity of breaking mere house-flies on the wheel.
1	'There is somebody else who should not be forgotten, by the bye,' said Mr. Brownlow, ringing the bell.
1	Thoroughly overpowered with the notion of Mr. Chitling being the victim of the tender passion, Master Bates threw himself back in his chair with such violence, that he lost his balance, and pitched over upon the floor; where (the accident abating nothing of his merriment) he lay at full length until his laugh was over, when he resumed his former position, and began another laugh.
1	‘And he can hardly believe it, either,’ said Sampson, when he returned, ‘nor nobody will.
1	Back again it stole to the window--then turned its head towards her.
1	Come the roll of wheels and a violent ringing at the bell.
1	I never was so much afraid of anyone.

1	She thought of all that was perverted and debased within her, no less than without: of modest graces of the mind, hardened and steeled, like these attractions of the person; of the many gifts of the Creator flung to the winds like the wild hair; of all the beautiful ruin upon which the storm was beating and the night was coming.

1	Ralph makes one last Appointment--and keeps it Creeping from the house, and slinking off like a thief; groping with his hands, when first he got into the street, as if he were a blind man; and looking often over his shoulder while he hurried away, as though he were followed in imagination or reality by someone anxious to question or detain him; Ralph Nickleby left the city behind him, and took the road to his own home.

1	Arthur Gride had enrobed himself in his marriage garments of bottle-green, a full hour before Mrs. Sliderskew, shaking off her more heavy slumbers, knocked at his chamber door; and he had hobbled downstairs in full array and smacked his lips over a scanty taste of his favourite cordial, ere that delicate piece of antiquity enlightened the kitchen with her presence.
1	I wanted to give you a delightful sap--pur--IZE!’ Having thus elongated and emphasized the word Surprise, Mr Wegg shook his friend and brother by both hands, and then clapped him on both knees, like an affectionate patron who entreated him not to mention so small a service as that which it had been his happy privilege to render.

1	The city had entirely vanished.
1	Mr. Squeers is in town, and attends daily, from one till four, at the Saracen’s Head, Snow Hill.
1	I never could have thowt the old boat would have been so strange!’ From some pocket in his breast, he took out, with a very careful hand a small paper bundle containing two or three letters or little packets, which he laid upon the table.
1	I think that's all I can give you to know him by.
1	The figure was now within the chamber, and she, still dumb--quite dumb, and almost senseless--stood looking on.
1	I have not the influence I want to have, I cannot stop some dreadful things I try to stop, but I go on in the hope and trust that the time will come.
1	'I _did not_,' replied Mr. Brownlow, rising too; 'but within the last fortnight I have learnt it all.
1	‘Wery nice things, if they’re managed properly, Sir,’ replied Mr. Weller; ‘but wen you don’t want to be seen, I think they’re more useful arter the candle’s gone out, than wen it’s alight.’ Mr. Pickwick appeared struck by Sam’s remarks, for he put the lantern into his pocket again, and they walked on in silence.
1	John Jasper invites the boy with a beck of his head to follow him (feeling it hopeless to drag him, or coax him), and crosses to the iron railing where the Stony (and stoned) One is profoundly meditating.
1	As they are both very bad and the water is worse, I ask for brandy; but it is a Temperance Hotel, and spirits are not to be had for love or money.
1	I was told I was an orphan.
1	‘I will not,’ said Fanny, without answering the question, ‘submit to be mother-in-lawed by Mrs General; and I will not submit to be, in any respect whatever, either patronised or tormented by Mrs Merdle.’ Little Dorrit laid her hand upon the hand that held the bottle of sweet water, with a still more anxious look.
1	I forgot myself.’ Mr Venus knowingly cocked his shock of hair, as rather thinking Mr Wegg had remembered himself, in respect of appearing without any disguise.
1	He awoke in the morning, much refreshed; and having taken half an hour’s exercise at the flute, and graciously received a notice to quit from his landlady, who had been in waiting on the stairs for that purpose since the dawn of day, repaired to Bevis Marks; where the beautiful Sally was already at her post, bearing in her looks a radiance, mild as that which beameth from the virgin moon.
1	I had the pleasure, on this occasion, of renewing the acquaintance of Master Micawber, whom I found a promising boy of about twelve or thirteen, very subject to that restlessness of limb which is not an unfrequent phenomenon in youths of his age.
1	This knapsack is new, and he bought it in the High Street yesterday.
1	‘It seems egotistical to begin by saying so much about myself,’ he resumed, ‘but whatever I say to you seems, even in my own ears, below what I want to say, and different from what I want to say.
1	“Do you suppose,” Mr. Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in his bright eye, as it looked kindly at her, “that Doctor Manette has any theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to the cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his oppressor?” “I don't suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me.” “And that is--?” “That she thinks he has.” “Now don't be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am a mere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business.” “Dull?” Miss Pross inquired, with placidity.
1	If the suddenness of her calamity, and the whirling wheels of the time, had stunned the Doctor's daughter into awaiting the result in idle despair, it would but have been with her as it was with many.
1	We were all to meet in the old boathouse that night.
1	"Or, my juvenile friends," says Chadband, descending to the level of their comprehension with a very obtrusive demonstration in his greasily meek smile of coming a long way downstairs for the purpose, "if the master of this house was to go forth into the city and there see an eel, and was to come back, and was to call unto him the mistress of this house, and was to say, 'Sarah, rejoice with me, for I have seen an elephant!'
1	He started by and by as if he were just then awakened, and asked who that was, and what was the matter?
1	When Mr. Bumble had laughed a little while, his eyes again encountered the cocked hat; and he became grave.
1	Nothing of the kind here, sir.
1	A gentleman has a glass of punch before him to which he is just about to set his lips, when another gentleman comes and collars that glass of punch, without a “with your leave”, or “by your leave”, and carries that glass of punch away.
1	He couldn’t make anything of it though, so he got into bed, covered himself up warm, and fell asleep.
1	Perhaps I am,’ sighed the first-floor lodger.
1	‘You are quite right,’ said Serjeant Buzfuz aloud, with affected composure.
1	‘Well, I shouldn’t wonder if it was,’ returned the old man doubtfully.
1	Edmunds started back, for he knew him well; many a time he had watched him digging graves in the churchyard.
1	The condemned felon has as good a yard for air and exercise in Newgate, as the insolvent debtor in the Marshalsea Prison.
1	It was a good thing to draw it back, and rub his nose very hard with it, if he thought Miss Sally was going to look up, and to recompense himself with more hardy flourishes when he found she was still absorbed.
1	In whose sly look and watchful manner; in whose false mouth, stretched but not laughing; in whose spotless cravat and very whiskers; even in whose silent passing of his soft hand over his white linen and his smooth face; there was something desperately cat-like.
1	They were black, cold rooms; and seemed to be in mourning, like the inmates of the house.
1	"He does it with the best intention," observed Caddy, "but it hasn't the effect he means, poor fellow!"
1	I then descried Mr. and Mrs. Hubble; the last-named in a decent speechless paroxysm in a corner.
1	“Dear me!” said Mr. Pocket, Junior.
1	“Play the game out.” Saving for the one weird smile at first, I should have felt almost sure that Miss Havisham's face could not smile.
1	Sang to her, as congenial melody, “Evening Bells”.
1	That’s the truth.’ ‘When do the prisoners take exercise?’ ‘Well, they do without it pretty much.’ ‘Do they never walk in the yard?’ ‘Considerable seldom.’ ‘Sometimes, I suppose?’ ‘Well, it’s rare they do.
1	Having done so with tenderness, the Reverend Septimus turned to again, countering with his left, and putting in his right, in a tremendous manner.
1	The same Sydney, with the same luck.
1	Difficulties had arisen in the construction of this machine, simple as it was; requisites had been found wanting, and messages had had to go and return.
1	'Well, they were separated,' said Monks, 'and what of that?'
1	Possessing in yourself, Tony, all that is calculated to charm the eye--" "Oh!
1	I entreat, I order you!’ ‘Good Heaven, aunt!’ said I.
1	They are rare, but not at an end.’ ‘Mr Clennam?
1	At eight o’clock, the shelves being taken down and put away and the tables joined together, everybody sat down to the tea, coffee, bread, butter, salmon, shad, liver, steak, potatoes, pickles, ham, chops, black-puddings, and sausages, all over again.
1	you’ll think very differently in another five minutes,’ said Matilda.
1	As yet the worry of the newly-stopped whirling and grinding on the part of the money-mills seemed to linger in the air, and the quiet was more like the prostration of a spent giant than the repose of one who was renewing his strength.
1	‘What’s the office?’ replied that gentleman from his couch.
1	Leaving home very early in the morning, I got to London by stage-coach in such good time that I got to Newman Street with the day before me.
1	“He went out before I went off.
1	If ever the Rights of Women, and all that kind of thing, are properly attended to, it will be through her powerful intellect--Susan, my dear!’ said Mr Toots, looking abruptly out of the windows ‘pray do not exert yourself!’ ‘My dear,’ said Mrs Toots, ‘I was only talking.’ ‘But, my love,’ said Mr Toots, ‘pray do not exert yourself.
1	The very barristers’ wigs are ill-powdered, and their curls lack crispness.
1	What I am, my father was; and my sister is; and my brother is.
1	“What item was it you were at, Wemmick, when Mr. Pip came in?” But I could not submit to be thrown off in that way, and I made a passionate, almost an indignant appeal, to him to be more frank and manly with me.
1	She goes down without answering or looking behind her.
1	I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure of a young woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had shrunk to skin and bone.
1	The weak husband and the father--the father that is yet to be--relents.
1	Yet, I have nothing else to tell; unless, indeed, I were to confess (which might be of less moment still) that no one can ever believe this Narrative, in the reading, more than I have believed it in the writing.
1	'Yes, I am,' replied the man, who seemed a little the worse--or better, as the case might be--for drinking; 'and not slow about it neither.
1	"Thank you; like you, like you," said Richard.
1	Then, from behind a distant hill, the noble sun rose up, driving the mists in phantom shapes before it, and clearing the earth of their ghostly forms till darkness came again.
1	When the family have retired to rest, we shall come out of the kitchen, and the young lady out of her bedroom.
1	But!--no person can tell me nothing of him, Rigaud.
1	"If you please, miss," said the little girl in a soft voice, "I am Charley."
1	It was late--past eleven o’clock.
1	But night-time in this dreadful spot!--night, when the smoke was changed to fire; when every chimney spirited up its flame; and places, that had been dark vaults all day, now shone red-hot, with figures moving to and fro within their blazing jaws, and calling to one another with hoarse cries--night, when the noise of every strange machine was aggravated by the darkness; when the people near them looked wilder and more savage; when bands of unemployed labourers paraded the roads, or clustered by torch-light round their leaders, who told them, in stern language, of their wrongs, and urged them on to frightful cries and threats; when maddened men, armed with sword and firebrand, spurning the tears and prayers of women who would restrain them, rushed forth on errands of terror and destruction, to work no ruin half so surely as their own--night, when carts came rumbling by, filled with rude coffins (for contagious disease and death had been busy with the living crops); when orphans cried, and distracted women shrieked and followed in their wake--night, when some called for bread, and some for drink to drown their cares, and some with tears, and some with staggering feet, and some with bloodshot eyes, went brooding home--night, which, unlike the night that Heaven sends on earth, brought with it no peace, nor quiet, nor signs of blessed sleep--who shall tell the terrors of the night to the young wandering child!
1	It WAS one!’  This repetition with extraordinary vehemence, and the snarl of a wolf.
1	He scarcely speaks again, until he takes leave of her, at the gate of the Nuns’ House.
1	I shall but win back my own, and it’s all for thee, my darling.’ ‘God help us!’ cried the child.
1	You can put them to some other poor boy's use.” I took out my purse.
1	They led him through a paved room under the court, where some prisoners were waiting till their turns came, and others were talking to their friends, who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard.
1	‘What do you say?’ A watchful pause.
1	But the forge was a very short distance off, and I went towards it under the sweet green limes, listening for the clink of Joe's hammer.
1	There have been years for me as well as you, and there has been wretchedness for me as well as you.
1	The intelligence was no sooner received than the whole party hurried across the street, and began to fight their way into court--a preparatory ceremony, which has been calculated to occupy, in ordinary cases, from twenty-five minutes to thirty.
1	Mrs General was the daughter of a clerical dignitary in a cathedral town, where she had led the fashion until she was as near forty-five as a single lady can be.
1	As the old gentleman inhabited the highest story of the palace, where he might have practised pistol-shooting without much chance of discovery by the other inmates, his younger niece had taken courage to propose the restoration to him of his clarionet, which Mr Dorrit had ordered to be confiscated, but which she had ventured to preserve.
1	Two distinct knocks, sir, will produce the slavey at any time.
1	you will be amused with this _fellow’s_ audacity.’ Terrible emphasis was laid upon ‘thing’ and ‘fellow’; and the faces of both editors began to glow with defiance.
1	Which gate did you come to?” I told him.
1	Are these the usual changes of your malady, madame?’ There was a struggle in her maimed arm as she twisted it away, but there was none in her face.
1	But there was no harm in his way of saying this: it was said laughingly, and to beguile the time.” Any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed, will be unconsciously imitated by the spectators.
1	I shall never be better than I am.
1	I told her that I was going to be married to my guardian and that we had been engaged some time.
1	'Oliver,' cried Fagin, beckoning to him.
1	‘My landlady is subject to some slight attacks of mental derangement,’ remarked Bob Sawyer, with a ghastly smile; ‘I fear I must give her warning.’ ‘No, don’t,’ said Ben Allen.
1	You ought to know it's enough to drive a person wild to hear you.
1	‘I’ll dance with the widow,’ said the stranger.
1	A place where few people care to go about alone, where a maid screams if an ash drops from the fire, takes to crying at all times and seasons, becomes the victim of a low disorder of the spirits, and gives warning and departs.
1	No one could, if I did not.
1	There were already a pretty large sprinkling of spectators in the gallery, and a numerous muster of gentlemen in wigs, in the barristers’ seats, who presented, as a body, all that pleasing and extensive variety of nose and whisker for which the Bar of England is so justly celebrated.
1	‘Now, my dear Dora, you must know that I never said that!’ ‘You said, I wasn’t comfortable!’ cried Dora.
1	Mrs General, replying to the envoy, as she set down her empty coffee-cup, that she was willing at once to proceed to Mr Dorrit’s apartment, and spare him the trouble of coming to her (which, in his gallantry, he had proposed), the envoy threw open the door, and escorted Mrs General to the presence.
1	Upon my honour, you have no conception what my feelings are.
1	We had walked but a little way together, when he said, without looking at me: ‘Mas’r Davy, have you seen her?’ ‘Only for a moment, when she was in a swoon,’ I softly answered.
1	what’s the matter?’ said Mrs. Cluppins.
1	We said yes, as she seemed to expect us to say so.
1	He’s going to meet that precious Major first, and I must say if I was acquainted with any Major myself (which Heavens forbid), it shouldn’t be a blue one!’ ‘Hush, Susan!’ urged Florence gently.
1	But not being umble yourself, you don’t judge well, perhaps, for them that are.
1	I may feel--nay, know--that after having so far overcome my repugnance towards Mr and Mrs Boffin as to receive them under this roof, and to consent to your daughter Bella’s,’ here turning to her husband, ‘residing under theirs, it were well if your daughter Bella,’ again turning to her husband, ‘had profited in a worldly point of view by a connection so distasteful, so disreputable.
1	Do you really feel sure that you can answer for him so confidently?’ The perplexed and perplexing look vanished.
1	In one of these rooms, seated, calmly, and quite as a matter of course, among a throng of mad-women, black and white, were the physician’s wife and another lady, with a couple of children.
1	If the boots I wore at that period could only be produced and compared with the natural size of my feet, they would show what the state of my heart was, in a most affecting manner.
1	'Why did I eat spring lamb at eighteen pence a pound, my honest friend?'
1	The wretched ignorance with which Jupe clung to this consolation, rejecting the superior comfort of knowing, on a sound arithmetical basis, that her father was an unnatural vagabond, filled Mr. Gradgrind with pity.
1	Mr. Wardle paused too, and insensibly released his hold of the carving-knife, which remained inserted in the beef.
1	“I observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to conceal themselves.
1	It occurred to Arthur that a far more elaborate and taking show of business--such as the records of the Circumlocution Office made perhaps--might be far less serviceable, as being meant to be far less intelligible.
1	"The bank, the factory, or the house?"
1	They may hunt the whole country-side, while the raindrops are pattering round their inactivity.
1	So he said, with truth, ‘I’m more leetsome, Rachael, under ’t, than I could’n ha believed.’  It was not her part to make his burden heavier.
1	He took himself to Staple Inn, but not to P. J. T. and Mr. Grewgious.
1	The little that remains to their historian to relate, is told in few and simple words.
1	‘And now, Sir,’ said the Major, ‘you and Dombey have the devil’s own amount of business to talk over.’ ‘By no means, Major,’ observed Mr Dombey.
1	"Are he and the pretty girl engaged, Mr.
1	‘I would rather have approached my respected father by candlelight, as a theme requiring a little artificial brilliancy; but we will take him by twilight, enlivened with a glow of Wallsend.’ He stirred the fire again as he spoke, and having made it blaze, resumed.
1	After what has happened, and after his recovery, I find it difficult to imagine any such violent sounding of that string again.
1	I have a little party of--of--gentlemen with whom I am connected in business just now, at my house tomorrow; and your mother has promised that you shall keep house for me.
1	I have not an idea how much.
1	I must be particularly careful, if it were only for his satisfaction, to take myself well to task and have a regular wind-up of this business now."
1	Indeed, as he eagerly sparkled at them from the cellarage before mentioned, he seemed a kind of cannon loaded to the muzzle with facts, and prepared to blow them clean out of the regions of childhood at one discharge.
1	It is likely to be noticed.
1	He likes to pass the churchyard with a swelling air of proprietorship, and to encourage in his breast a sort of benignant-landlord feeling, in that he has been bountiful towards that meritorious tenant, Mrs. Sapsea, and has publicly given her a prize.
1	Her thoughts were not idle while she was thus employed; when she returned and was seated beside the old man in one corner of the tent, tying her flowers together, while the two men lay dozing in another corner, she plucked him by the sleeve, and slightly glancing towards them, said, in a low voice-- ‘Grandfather, don’t look at those I talk of, and don’t seem as if I spoke of anything but what I am about.
1	"Well, little woman," said he, shutting up his book, "if you have accepted the trust, there can be no harm in it."
1	May I suggest that somebody up-stairs, in the dark, is becoming energetically curious to know what is going on here?’ This reference to Mrs Clennam’s voice reminded Mr Flintwinch to step into the hall and call up the staircase.
1	‘We are quite safe now, and have nothing to fear indeed, dear grandfather,’ she said.
1	‘Do not, if you please, put suppositions betwixt my lips where none such have been imparted by myself.
1	“There was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention, for I had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs.
1	I have been here many a time when, but for you and the work you gave me, we should have wanted everything.’ ‘We,’ repeated Mrs Clennam, looking towards the watch, once her dead husband’s, which always lay upon her table.
1	I believe duelling is one of his Majesty’s most undoubted prerogatives, Mr. Jinks?’ ‘Expressly stipulated in Magna Charta, sir,’ said Mr. Jinks.
1	I turned my head aside, and it was gone.
1	Others again, opening the white-hot furnace-doors, cast fuel on the flames, which came rushing and roaring forth to meet it, and licked it up like oil.
1	"Shan't I give you a piece of anything at all, miss?"
1	I could not help wondering in my own mind, as I contemplated the boiled leg of mutton before me, previous to carving it, how it came to pass that our joints of meat were of such extraordinary shapes--and whether our butcher contracted for all the deformed sheep that came into the world; but I kept my reflections to myself.
1	and is laid hands on--and there's nothin'!
1	There’s no hurry--shall we say this afternoon?’ ‘Say Friday morning,’ returned the old man.
1	I felt as if the room had chilled me.
1	‘We came,’ repeated Mrs. Micawber, ‘and saw the Medway.
1	‘And was he not called Blandois?’ ‘No!’ said Mr Baptist.
1	I can recommend it for your purpose, sir, because it really is extra super.
1	We apply ourselves to find out, Mr Lightwood, and we find that your friend, this Mr Eugene Wrayburn, here, pays.
1	For some time she strenuously refused to grant Mr. Winkle the interview Sam had so pathetically requested; but at length, when the conversation threatened to be interrupted by the unwelcome arrival of a third party, she hurriedly gave him to understand, with many professions of gratitude, that it was barely possible she might be in the garden an hour later, next evening.
1	He walked me up to my room slowly and gravely--I am certain he had a delight in that formal parade of executing justice--and when we got there, suddenly twisted my head under his arm.
1	Reddening the snowy streets with the prevailing Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them, as they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye, they carried him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived.
1	After a few thoughtful turns in the Painted Ground, which, as it was now dark, was nearly deserted, he intimated to Mr. Weller that he thought it high time for him to withdraw for the night; requesting him to seek a bed in some adjacent public-house, and return early in the morning, to make arrangements for the removal of his master’s wardrobe from the George and Vulture.
1	What did we think she, Tattycoram, might have been if she had been caressed and cared for in her childhood, like her young mistress?
1	The population is migratory, usually disappearing on the verge of quarter-day, and generally by night.
1	I hesitated once, debating with myself, whether, if I had the power of saying ‘Yes’ or ‘No,’ I would allow it to be tried in certain cases, where the terms of imprisonment were short; but now, I solemnly declare, that with no rewards or honours could I walk a happy man beneath the open sky by day, or lie me down upon my bed at night, with the consciousness that one human creature, for any length of time, no matter what, lay suffering this unknown punishment in his silent cell, and I the cause, or I consenting to it in the least degree.
1	Nothing in the whole adventure, not even the upset, had disturbed the calm and equable current of Mr. Pickwick’s temper.
1	‘What more, Mary Anne?’ ‘They must find it rather dull and dark, Miss Peecher, for the parlour blind’s down, and neither of them pulls it up.’ ‘There is no accounting,’ said good Miss Peecher with a little sad sigh which she repressed by laying her hand on her neat methodical boddice, ‘there is no accounting for tastes, Mary Anne.’ Charley, entering the dark room, stopped short when he saw his old friend in its yellow shade.
1	Where can I possibly move to, sir, more nor I do move!"
1	Upon my word, I can only answer, because you are so much improved.’ ‘No, Pa. Because I am so thankful and so happy!’ Here she choked him until her long hair made him sneeze, and then she laughed until she made him laugh, and then she choked him again that they might not be overheard.
1	“But when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in, at least you led me on?” said I.
1	The man was sixty, by years, and Heaven knows how old by imprisonment, so that his having any look approaching to mirth or contentment, was singular enough.
1	Bless you, it would be a shock that the generality of parties mightn’t recover, to say “Omer and Joram’s compliments, and how do you find yourself this morning?”--or this afternoon--as it may be.’ Mr. Omer and I nodded at each other, and Mr. Omer recruited his wind by the aid of his pipe.
1	"I don't suspect anything more than I know, William," returns the other gravely.
1	‘But not you, governor, not you,’ he went on, stolidly shaking his head.
1	My father was Swiss--Canton de Vaud.
1	If you understand,’ said Mr. Omer, after rubbing his chin again, and smoking a little, ‘what I mean in a general way by the expression, “A long pull, and a strong pull, and a pull altogether, my hearties, hurrah!” I should say to you, that that was--in a general way--what I miss in Em’ly.’ Mr. Omer’s face and manner went for so much, that I could conscientiously nod my head, as divining his meaning.
1	It was in the state of my own feelings, I added bashfully: to clench the explanation.
1	You can hardly make the best of me if I don't.
1	I would then take a sheet of paper, and write across the top of it, in a neat hand, the heading, “Memorandum of Pip's debts”; with Barnard's Inn and the date very carefully added.
1	‘What’s this!’ said Martha, in a whisper.
1	I like the plan of sending ‘em with the peel on; there’s a charm in drawing a potato from its native element (if I may so express it) to which the rich and powerful are strangers.
1	I make no claim to be considered a person of superior intellect--though I believe some people have been extraordinary enough to consider me so; one so little humoured as I am, would very soon be disabused of any such notion; but I trust I am not a downright fool.
1	‘I knew it could never be, I felt too sure of that, before I asked!
1	‘They include, I presume, correspondence?’ ‘Good,’ interposed Mr. Gregsbury.
1	While we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal, the Jack--who was sitting in a corner, and who had a bloated pair of shoes on, which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon, as interesting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of a drowned seaman washed ashore--asked me if we had seen a four-oared galley going up with the tide?
1	He rode near Mr Dombey’s house; and falling into a walk as he approached it, looked up at the windows The window where he had once seen Florence sitting with her dog attracted his attention first, though there was no light in it; but he smiled as he carried his eyes up the tall front of the house, and seemed to leave that object superciliously behind.
1	Some people fancy all these little dainties together (and sweet preserves beside), by way of relish to their roast pig.
1	Do you know, Mr. Nickleby,’ said Mrs. Browdie, with her archest smile, ‘that I really think Fanny Squeers was very fond of you?’ ‘I am very much obliged to her,’ said Nicholas; ‘but upon my word, I never aspired to making any impression upon her virgin heart.’ ‘How you talk!’ tittered Mrs. Browdie.
1	“Yes, my dear,” said I, “but such marriages do not always turn out the happiest.”’ ‘I question that, mind!’ interposed Mr. Pickwick warmly.
1	Whenever that undecided Prince had to ask a question or state a doubt, the public helped him out with it.
1	But she saw Susan shake hands with the servants all round, and turn once to look at her old home; and she saw Diogenes bound out after the cab, and want to follow it, and testify an impossibility of conviction that he had no longer any property in the fare; and the door was shut, and the hurry over, and her tears flowed fast for the loss of an old friend, whom no one could replace.
1	I should have no power of keeping you against his wish, and he would have no difficulty, at any time, in finding Mr. Thomas Gradgrind of Coketown.
1	Would he like his debts paid and his house furnished, and a few bank notes for shaving paper if he shaves at all?
1	I told Arthur when he first come home to stand up against you.
1	‘Here am I,’ said Pancks, pursuing his argument with the weekly tenant.
1	Walk me, walk me!” I made out from this, that the work I had to do, was to walk Miss Havisham round and round the room.
1	And now I am going seriously to tell you--let me see how many--four secrets.
1	I wish that she could have seen us in our prosperity, and shared it, and had the happiness of knowing how dearly we loved her in it, as we did when we were two poor boys; but that was not to be.
1	The story of his pure soul was exactly what Mr. Attorney-General had described it to be--perhaps, if it had a fault, a little too exactly.
1	And though she thought as a child herself, and did not perhaps sufficiently consider to what a bright and happy existence those who die young are borne, and how in death they lose the pain of seeing others die around them, bearing to the tomb some strong affection of their hearts (which makes the old die many times in one long life), still she thought wisely enough, to draw a plain and easy moral from what she had seen that night, and to store it, deep in her mind.
1	A dwelling where a fire has been.
1	Without expressing his concurrence in this sentiment, Mr Swiveller after a few moments of abstraction inquired which way Kit was driving, and, being informed, declared it was his way, and that he would trespass on him for a lift.
1	He wore very short trousers, and black cotton stockings, which, like the rest of his apparel, were particularly rusty.
1	no!’ cried Emily, clasping her hands together.
1	If we should both continny as we are, why then HERE we are, and give us a kiss, old lady.’ Mrs Boffin who, perpetually smiling, had approached and drawn her plump arm through her lord’s, most willingly complied.
1	Strokes, thick and heavy, rattled upon the door and lower window-shutters as he ceased to speak, and a loud huzzah burst from the crowd; giving the listener, for the first time, some adequate idea of its immense extent.
1	But at an expense of threepence I soon refreshed myself completely; and, being in better spirits then, limped seven miles upon my road.
1	When I come to think of it, I'm not at all sure that I wasn't his most particular friend; for we used to stop and speak whenever we met.
1	Tell that little man behind, to shut the door.’ ‘Shut the door, can’t you?’ said Mr Codlin, turning gruffly to his friend.
1	Unquestionably there were but few things to put away, if there had been one; but, however few in number, or small in individual amount, still, remnants of loaves and pieces of cheese, and damp towels, and scrags of meat, and articles of wearing apparel, and mutilated crockery, and bellows without nozzles, and toasting-forks without prongs, do present somewhat of an uncomfortable appearance when they are scattered about the floor of a small apartment, which is the common sitting and sleeping room of three idle men.
1	She merely bowed; and bending over some plants that stood near, waited in silence for him to proceed.
1	This man perfectly comprehended that he hated his rival with his strongest and worst forces, and that if he tracked him to Lizzie Hexam, his so doing would never serve himself with her, or serve her.
1	I believe there never was anybody with such an imperturbable countenance when she chose.
1	If there is a man chock full of science in the world, it’s old Sol Gills.
1	‘Why not have, for once in a way, a bottle of sherry wine?’ ‘Well, Ma’am,’ rejoined the Captain, ‘if you’d be so good as take a glass or two, I think I would try that.
1	The fat boy assisted Mary to a little, and himself to a great deal, and was just going to begin eating when he suddenly laid down his knife and fork, leaned forward in his chair, and letting his hands, with the knife and fork in them, fall on his knees, said, very slowly-- ‘I say!
1	On the contrary, the other three--knaves and gamesters by their trade--while intent upon their game, were yet as cool and quiet as if every virtue had been centered in their breasts.
1	Papa, potatoes, poultry, prunes, and prism are all very good words for the lips: especially prunes and prism.
1	She said, after a pause, in no place long.
1	Though why this should concern you so much, I don't know."
1	But, the instant he was on the other side of it, Wegg clutched Venus with both hands, and said in a choking whisper, as if he were being strangled: ‘Mr Venus, he must be followed, he must be watched, he mustn’t be lost sight of for a moment.’ ‘Why mustn’t he?’ asked Venus, also strangling.
1	There was great alarm at first, until it was found that she was in a swoon, and that the swoon was yielding to the usual means of recovery; when the Doctor, who had lifted her head upon his knee, put her curls aside with his hand, and said, looking around: ‘Poor Annie!
1	It makes me cold to remember them.
1	Eh, Mr. Edwin?’ ‘I called, sir, before going down, as an act of attention.’ ‘Of attention!’ said Mr. Grewgious.
1	‘You’re to walk upstairs then, please,’ said the man.
1	“Now my young friend,” my guardian began, as if I were a witness in the box, “I am going to have a word or two with you.” “If you please, sir.” “What do you suppose,” said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at the ground, and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling,--“what do you suppose you are living at the rate of?” “At the rate of, sir?” “At,” repeated Mr. Jaggers, still looking at the ceiling, “the--rate--of?” And then looked all round the room, and paused with his pocket-handkerchief in his hand, half-way to his nose.
1	As he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit, in which he looked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of, I next discussed with him what dress he should wear.
1	"Pray tell us the story," says Watt in a half whisper.
1	Tell me, Jack,’ the young fellow then flows on: ‘do you really and truly feel as if the mention of our relationship divided us at all?
1	A long suburb of red brick houses--some with patches of garden-ground, where coal-dust and factory smoke darkened the shrinking leaves, and coarse rank flowers, and where the struggling vegetation sickened and sank under the hot breath of kiln and furnace, making them by its presence seem yet more blighting and unwholesome than in the town itself--a long, flat, straggling suburb passed, they came, by slow degrees, upon a cheerless region, where not a blade of grass was seen to grow, where not a bud put forth its promise in the spring, where nothing green could live but on the surface of the stagnant pools, which here and there lay idly sweltering by the black road-side.
1	‘Now, Mr. Jinks,’ said the magistrate, ‘swear Grummer.’ Grummer was sworn directly; but as Grummer wandered, and Mr. Nupkins’s dinner was nearly ready, Mr. Nupkins cut the matter short, by putting leading questions to Grummer, which Grummer answered as nearly in the affirmative as he could.
1	Here and there, were drops of its blood and life, but they scarcely coloured the stream of desperate adventurers which sets that way for profit and for pay.
1	When Smike came to the assault upon himself in the hackney coach, he hastily deposited the mug upon the table, and limped up and down the room in a state of the greatest excitement, stopping himself with a jerk, every now and then, as if to listen more attentively.
1	Mrs. Crummles trod the pavement as if she were going to immediate execution with an animating consciousness of innocence, and that heroic fortitude which virtue alone inspires.
1	"Let us see him here and have done with it.
1	Day after day, and often when he wakes up in the middle of the night, he thinks of these two men until he is almost distracted.
1	Turning round to look about them when they had got thus far, they saw, among some ruined buildings at a distance, one single solitary light.
1	After some days of inquiry and research, Arthur Clennam became convinced that the case of the Father of the Marshalsea was indeed a hopeless one, and sorrowfully resigned the idea of helping him to freedom again.
1	A bare lopsided weatherbeaten pole was planted in the ashes there, and had been there many a year.
1	Am I in love again?
1	‘How sauce?’ ‘I can cut my bread so--like a melon.
1	Pray see him when you get there.
1	At length brother Ned and Tim Linkinwater came back together, when Tim instantly walked up to Nicholas and whispered in his ear in a very brief sentence (for Tim was ordinarily a man of few words), that he had taken down the address in the Strand, and would call upon him that evening, at eight.
1	‘--“in forlorn search of intelligence of my dear boy, I knew that if you were acquainted with my design, you would thwart it, or accompany me; and therefore I kept it secret.
1	‘And if it’s bitter cold for you, up in the chancel, with a lot of live breath smoking out about you, what the bitterness is to Durdles, down in the crypt among the earthy damps there, and the dead breath of the old ’uns,’ returns that individual, ‘Durdles leaves you to judge.—Is this to be put in hand at once, Mr. Sapsea?’ Mr. Sapsea, with an Author’s anxiety to rush into publication, replies that it cannot be out of hand too soon.
1	what then?’ muttered Thomas Codlin.
1	As I rose to quit the room, a pretty little child of one of the attendants came running in to greet its father.
1	Gelen box num seven, not go sleep here, gome.’ He sat in the same place as the day died, looking at the dull houses opposite, and thinking, if the disembodied spirits of former inhabitants were ever conscious of them, how they must pity themselves for their old places of imprisonment.
1	"Oh, dear, you are too modest.
1	You might as well flop as meditate.
1	It appears impossible for mademoiselle to roll the letter "r" sufficiently in this word, notwithstanding that she assists her energetic delivery by clenching both her hands and setting all her teeth.
1	For, he had been seen by many persons, wandering about on that side of the city—indeed on all sides of it—in a miserable and seemingly half-distracted manner.
1	She was a good, good woman!
1	‘All this that I say of you is true of me as well, Eddy.
1	But how do I know if he lies?
1	I looked up with a flush upon my face and remorse in my heart, but Mr. Mell’s eyes were fixed on Steerforth.
1	I have the pleasure of being acquainted with Mr. Tulkinghorn--at least we move when we meet one another--and if it had been any business of that sort, I should have gone to him."
1	As his unusual emotion subsided, these misgivings gradually melted away, though so much of their shadow remained behind, that he was constant in his resolution to look closely after Richards himself, without appearing to do so.
1	But my dear Ned Cuttle, why didn’t you write?’ The astonishment depicted in the Captain’s features positively frightened Mr Toots, whose eyes were quite fixed by it, so that he could not withdraw them from his face.
1	His horse had slipped, and he had been thrown.
1	I was much confused by his speaking to me about it, but he would.
1	Though it’s the hardest part of my business, and would be, even if my back were not bad and my legs queer.’ He looked at her as not understanding what she said.
1	To Fanny, and to--hum--the rest of the--ha--great world.’ Little Dorrit thought of the competition that was to be entered upon, and assented very softly.
1	They were assembled in Cleopatra’s room.
1	“Colonel, to you!” said Wemmick; “how are you, Colonel?” “All right, Mr. Wemmick.” “Everything was done that could be done, but the evidence was too strong for us, Colonel.” “Yes, it was too strong, sir,--but I don't care.” “No, no,” said Wemmick, coolly, “you don't care.” Then, turning to me, “Served His Majesty this man.
1	We knew full well that her fervent heart was as full of affection and gratitude towards her cousin John as it had ever been, and we acquitted Richard of laying any injunctions upon her to stay away; but we knew on the other hand that she felt it a part of her duty to him to be sparing of her visits at our house.
1	Yes; playing cribbage with herself at the table.
1	While I was very ill, the way in which these divisions of time became confused with one another distressed my mind exceedingly.
1	"You said that before, my dear Richard."
1	Yet it did seem (though not to him, for he saw nothing of it) as if fantastic hope could take as strong a hold as Fact.
1	How many a summer hour have I known to be but blissful minutes to him in the cricket-field!
1	"I never heard of such a thing!
1	He had taken these lists from the drawer of the prisoner's desk.
1	The litter stopped under a lamp before it had passed him half-a-dozen paces, for some readjustment of the burden; and, the crowd stopping too, he found himself in the midst of the array.
1	The slight bait so skilfully thrown out by Ralph, on their first interview, was dangling on the hook yet.
1	She struggled and implored by turns until twelve o'clock had struck, and then, wearied and exhausted, ceased to contest the point any further.
1	‘Now, be a good-tempered Eddy, and pretend.
1	She was determined to have his arm, and the Major’s too.
1	Over the doorway is a wooden effigy, about half life-size, representing Mr. Sapsea’s father, in a curly wig and toga, in the act of selling.
1	‘Yes, I should think so!
1	Mr. Bumble opened his eyes; read the advertisement, slowly and carefully, three several times; and in something more than five minutes was on his way to Pentonville: having actually, in his excitement, left the glass of hot gin-and-water, untasted.
1	The spectators settle themselves in their places with renewed attention, for there are several female witnesses to be examined in the next case, and it has been rumoured that Mr Brass’s gentleman will make great fun in cross-examining them for the prisoner.
1	The kitchen will not improve you, in the many respects in which you need improvement.
1	And then let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but Marley's face.
1	Oliver obeyed, and followed his master on his professional mission.
1	Do me the favour to step into my bedroom.
1	‘Not even, if his hands warn’t tied, he wouldn’t.
1	It’s a long way to come for that, though.’ The woman looks up quickly.
1	We’ve done so before now.
1	‘I don’t like this.’ ‘Nor I’ said Lightwood.
1	‘I am sure I am willing she should go.
1	All this he said as if he were answering Edith, and not Florence, and with his eyes and his smile fastened on Edith.
1	'He can't be coming here.
1	"I do not deserve your high praise.
1	The meal over, and the young ladies having enjoyed the additional relaxation of washing their hands, the work began again, and was again performed in silence, until the noise of carriages rattling through the streets, and of loud double knocks at doors, gave token that the day’s work of the more fortunate members of society was proceeding in its turn.
1	He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot; he had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be only a plated one.
1	Sir Leicester glancing, with magnificent displeasure, at the rouge and the pearl necklace.
1	‘Why ay, my lady lass, I’ve seen my share of bad weather,’ said the Captain, tremulously wiping his head, ‘and I’ve had my share of knocking about; but--but it ain’t of myself as I was a meaning to speak.
1	Poor fellow!’ said Mr. Peggotty, shaking his head, ‘theer’s not so much left him, that he could spare the little as he has!’ ‘And Mrs. Gummidge?’ said I.
1	Henry, my dear,’ interposed Mrs. Wititterly.
1	Mr. Guppy saw us to the door with the air of one who was either imperfectly awake or walking in his sleep; and we left him there, staring.
1	"You can't recommend anything for the boy, I suppose?"
1	‘My sister,’ said Paul, presenting her.
1	'He's as willing as a Christian, strike me blind if he isn't!'
1	They are looking this way, and it is time I was in my place.
1	The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter, who had a book before him.
1	With the unceremonious words ‘Come along with you!’--a very unusual form of introduction from his lips--Mr Perch then ushered into the presence a strong-built lad of fifteen, with a round red face, a round sleek head, round black eyes, round limbs, and round body, who, to carry out the general rotundity of his appearance, had a round hat in his hand, without a particle of brim to it.
1	He took up his quarters at the Bush, and designing to postpone any communication by letter with Mr. Pickwick until it was probable that Mr. Dowler’s wrath might have in some degree evaporated, walked forth to view the city, which struck him as being a shade more dirty than any place he had ever seen.
1	‘Beneath a plain gravestone, in one of the most peaceful and secluded churchyards in Kent, where wild flowers mingle with the grass, and the soft landscape around forms the fairest spot in the garden of England, lie the bones of the young mother and her gentle child.
1	‘Who has been married here, my friend?’ said the single gentleman.
1	‘No, no, my love!’ said Walter.
1	Then, the nightcap once again appeared: and the same voice called Oliver by his name.
1	I have got you one.’ ‘I thank you heartily.’ Young John turned again, and took him in at the old doorway, up the old staircase, into the old room.
1	What winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads, already at work on the hill-top beyond the village, with his day's dinner (not much to carry) lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow's while to peck at, on a heap of stones?
1	With an appetite!’ I never saw a man so hot in my life.
1	"It's one of our law terms, miss.
1	"Has she been very ill?"
1	‘Just wot the young nobleman said ev’ry quarter-day arterwards for the rest of his life,’ replied Mr. Weller.
1	there were many bolder beggars there, gipsies who promised husbands, and other adepts in their trade, and although some ladies smiled gently as they shook their heads, and others cried to the gentlemen beside them ‘See, what a pretty face!’ they let the pretty face pass on, and never thought that it looked tired or hungry.
1	I presented Caddy, and Mr. Guppy said that any friend of mine was more than welcome.
1	Having frowned upon the abashed Bob with great magnificence, the old gentleman again brought the letter to the light, and began to read it seriously.
1	Have you any apartments available, ma’am?’ ‘Mr.
1	In point of fact, Mr. Crisparkle, keeping our hearts warm and our heads cool, we clergy need do nothing emphatically.’ So Minor Canon Row knew Neville Landless no more; and he went whithersoever he would, or could, with a blight upon his name and fame.
1	At length they turned into a very filthy narrow street, nearly full of old-clothes shops; the dog running forward, as if conscious that there was no further occasion for his keeping on guard, stopped before the door of a shop that was closed and apparently untenanted; the house was in a ruinous condition, and on the door was nailed a board, intimating that it was to let:  which looked as if it had hung there for many years.
1	And when I say thot, dinnot think I be asheamed of waa’t I’ve deane, for I say again, Hurrah!
1	There was a vast deal of talking and rattling of knives and forks, and plates; a great running about of three ponderous-headed waiters, and a rapid disappearance of the substantial viands on the table; to each and every of which item of confusion, the facetious Mr. Jingle lent the aid of half-a-dozen ordinary men at least.
1	‘If anything should be amiss, if anything should be even slightly wrong, between you; if you should have any secret consciousness that you are committing yourself to this step for no higher reason than because you have long been accustomed to look forward to it; then,’ said Mr. Grewgious, ‘I charge you once more, by the living and by the dead, to bring that ring back to me!’ Here Bazzard awoke himself by his own snoring; and, as is usual in such cases, sat apoplectically staring at vacancy, as defying vacancy to accuse him of having been asleep.
1	inquired Fang, after another pause.
1	It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is often the way with his tribe too.
1	‘You must remember that my poor fellow has always been accustomed to expectations.
1	It oughtn’t to be drawn; that’s the fact.’ I was very much shocked to hear of this melancholy accident, and said I thought I had better have some water.
1	In a certain phase of his distressful state, which was the worst to those who tended him, he would roll his head upon the pillow, incessantly repeating the name in a hurried and impatient manner, with the misery of a disturbed mind, and the monotony of a machine.
1	Then, and not until then, Daniel Quilp found himself, all flushed and dishevelled, in the middle of the street, with Mr Richard Swiveller performing a kind of dance round him and requiring to know ‘whether he wanted any more?’ ‘There’s plenty more of it at the same shop,’ said Mr Swiveller, by turns advancing and retreating in a threatening attitude, ‘a large and extensive assortment always on hand--country orders executed with promptitude and despatch--will you have a little more, Sir--don’t say no, if you’d rather not.’ ‘I thought it was somebody else,’ said Quilp, rubbing his shoulders, ‘why didn’t you say who you were?’ ‘Why didn’t you say who YOU were?’ returned Dick, ‘instead of flying out of the house like a Bedlamite?’ ‘It was you that--that knocked,’ said the dwarf, getting up with a short groan, ‘was it?’ ‘Yes, I am the man,’ replied Dick.
1	I cautioned him that I must hear no more of that; that he was not at all likely to obtain a pardon; that he was expatriated for the term of his natural life; and that his presenting himself in this country would be an act of felony, rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the law.
1	I felt her trembling more.
1	I am afraid he is dead now.
1	Coming near the beach, I saw, not only the boatmen, but half the people of the town, lurking behind buildings; some, now and then braving the fury of the storm to look away to sea, and blown sheer out of their course in trying to get zigzag back.
1	‘Pray hear me,’ urged Mr. Pickwick, as Mr. Ben Allen fell into a chair that patients were bled in, and gave way to his pocket-handkerchief.
1	‘Then here’s one day off.’ She kept a calendar of the holidays in this way, and every morning checked a day off in exactly the same manner.
1	‘Why not?’ ‘He took hold of me by the chin in a precious impertinent way, the first time I ever saw him,’ said the boy.
1	I appeal to you not to take advantage of your position in this house to make my position in it distressing and disagreeable.
1	‘No,’ said Miss Squeers, looking sideways at her parent, ‘although I AM a queer bridesmaid, and SHAN’T be a bride in a hurry, and although my husband WILL be in luck, I entertain no sentiments towards you, sir, but sentiments of pity.’ Here Miss Squeers looked sideways at her father again, who looked sideways at her, as much as to say, ‘There you had him.’ ‘I know what you’ve got to go through,’ said Miss Squeers, shaking her curls violently.
1	Nothing seemed to astonish Mr. Guppy's mother so much and to make her so very indignant as our not getting out.
1	it is at the present moment in high flavour.
1	She was a very handsome young woman, and I believe had some gypsy blood in her.
1	But, as both her father and her sister received his homage with some favour, she refrained from expressing any distrust of him, lest it should prove to be a new blemish derived from her prison birth.
1	My allusion was to this matter of your having put aside your brother’s plans for you, and given the preference to those of Mr--I believe the name is Mr Eugene Wrayburn.’ He made this point of not being certain of the name, with another uneasy look at her, which dropped like the last.
1	‘The object of his search and his unrelenting animosity, now a decrepit old man, was seated at a bare deal table, on which stood a miserable candle.
1	As Mr Dombey dropped his eyes, and adjusted his neckcloth again, the smiling face of Mr Carker the Manager became in a moment, and without any stage of transition, transformed into a most intent and frowning face, scanning his closely, and with an ugly sneer.
1	Mr Chuckster likewise remarked, that he had some reason to believe this form of address was personal to himself, and that he was not a man to be trifled with--as certain snobs (whom he did not more particularly mention or describe) might find to their cost.
1	Eminently respectable, sir," adds Mr. Snagsby with a misgiving that he has not improved the matter.
1	You are right, young man.
1	Here and there, especially at first, the inundation started on them and swept by; but when they had done descending, and were winding and climbing up a tower, they were alone.
1	Under one of these latter, Eugene’s companion disappeared.
1	Accident favouring him, he has marked me for a week or two, but I’ll put a mark on him that he shall carry to his grave.
1	"It is not likely that either Richard or I can ever forget your kindness that day, cousin John."
1	With a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were going to rest, forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors surrounding them; in the towers of the churches, where no prayers were said, for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length of self-destruction from years of priestly impostors, plunderers, and profligates; in the distant burial-places, reserved, as they wrote upon the gates, for Eternal Sleep; in the abounding gaols; and in the streets along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and material, that no sorrowful story of a haunting Spirit ever arose among the people out of all the working of the Guillotine; with a solemn interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its short nightly pause in fury; Sydney Carton crossed the Seine again for the lighter streets.
1	Railroads shall soon traverse all this country, and with a rattle and a glare the engine and train shall shoot like a meteor over the wide night-landscape, turning the moon paler; but as yet such things are non-existent in these parts, though not wholly unexpected.
1	"Are you aware, sir, that this young woman whom my Lady--my Lady--has placed near her person was brought up at the village school outside the gates?"
1	She should be an upper servant by her attire, yet in her air and step, though both are hurried and assumed--as far as she can assume in the muddy streets, which she treads with an unaccustomed foot--she is a lady.
1	“I sometimes have sick fancies,” she went on, “and I have a sick fancy that I want to see some play.
1	Who was it, do you think, who snapped his fingers at me in my misery, lying, as he believed, at his feet, and left me without even this poor sign of remembrance; well satisfied that I should be sent abroad, beyond the reach of farther trouble to him, and should die, and rot there?
1	I have lately become better acquainted with him through some accidental circumstances that have made me a visitor of his in private life.
1	After this amiable remark, his spirit soars into those enchanting regions of reflection which its education and pursuits have opened to it, and again he and Mrs. Smallweed while away the rosy hours, two unrelieved sentinels forgotten as aforesaid by the Black Serjeant.
1	I wouldn't take ten thousand guineas for that bird.
1	'I tried to get it down,' rejoined the other.
1	Just as you are attracted by her beaut--by her appearance and manner, she is attracted by yours.’ ‘I certainly have NOT noticed it,’ returned Bella, again italicizing with the dimple, ‘and I should have given her credit for--’ The Secretary with a smile held up his hand, so plainly interposing ‘not for better taste’, that Bella’s colour deepened over the little piece of coquetry she was checked in.
1	When they says to me in the Lock-up, a-going to put me down in the book, “What’s your name?” I says to them, “Find out.”  Likewise when they says, “What’s your religion?” I says, “Find out.”’ Which, it may be observed in passing, it would be immensely difficult for the State, however statistical, to do.
1	She was the Murderer, bound for Gallows Bay; she was the Manslaughterer, bound for Penal Settlement; her captain ought to be tried for his life; her crew ran down men in row-boats with a relish; she mashed up Thames lightermen with her paddles; she fired property with her funnels; she always was, and she always would be, wreaking destruction upon somebody or something, after the manner of all her kind.
1	My hand she rejected at once, as she does that of any man who is a stranger to her.
1	"Lookye, Phil," says the trooper, sitting on the table.
1	[Footnote:  Or were virtually, then.]
1	“You don’t know there’s a declaration filed, which increases the costs materially, I suppose,” said Fogg.
1	Not staying to fill up the utmost margin of his time, but borrowing an hour or so, to be repaid again when he should relieve his reliever, Riderhood straightway followed on the track of Bradley Headstone.
1	All the while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced, that I was quite conscious it would have served my face right, if I had lifted it up by my hair, and knocked it against the pebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an idiot.
1	If he had been less occupied with the thought, he must have seen her singular emotion.
1	How slowly it seemed to move, now that she could hear but not see it, creeping along the floor!
1	While she was thus engaged, Mr Swiveller looked on with a grateful heart, very much astonished to see how thoroughly at home she made herself, and attributing this attention, in its origin, to Sally Brass, whom, in his own mind, he could not thank enough.
1	I was walking in the garden with Ada when I was told that some one wished to see me.
1	‘Don’t be frightened, Sammy, don’t be frightened,’ said the old gentleman, when by dint of much struggling, and various convulsive stamps upon the ground, he had recovered his voice.
1	‘We’ll try that.’ He had my head as in a vice, but I twined round him somehow, and stopped him for a moment, entreating him not to beat me.
1	"I was willing enough to be 'made,' as you call it," says Mr. George, smoking not quite so placidly as before, for since the entrance of Judy he has been in some measure disturbed by a fascination, not of the admiring kind, which obliges him to look at her as she stands by her grandfather's chair, "but on the whole, I am glad I wasn't now."
1	To that I have pledged myself.
1	Seeks earnestly to know whether Podsnap ‘will rally round him?’ Says Podsnap, something sternly, ‘Now, first of all, Veneering, do you ask my advice?’ Veneering falters that as so old and so dear a friend-- ‘Yes, yes, that’s all very well,’ says Podsnap; ‘but have you made up your mind to take this borough of Pocket-Breaches on its own terms, or do you ask my opinion whether you shall take it or leave it alone?’ Veneering repeats that his heart’s desire and his soul’s thirst are, that Podsnap shall rally round him.
1	I am to attend to your interests.
1	‘He’s in very good condition; there’s nothing the matter with him,’ said the young man carelessly.
1	Now, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment waiting for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night, the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry's attention.
1	Besides litter, they gets stole, and sharing suspicions is apt to creep in, and unpleasantness takes place.’ By this time Mr. Grewgious had his agreement-lines, and his earnest-money, ready.
1	It’s gone.’ ‘Thank you,’ said Bella, holding out her little hand.
1	No hurry; if you are not, I can wait.
1	When she had taken this gentle exercise for some time, she sat down upon the steps and called ‘George’; whereupon a man in a carter’s frock, who had been so shrouded in a hedge up to this time as to see everything that passed without being seen himself, parted the twigs that concealed him, and appeared in a sitting attitude, supporting on his legs a baking-dish and a half-gallon stone bottle, and bearing in his right hand a knife, and in his left a fork.
1	People talk across the court out of window, and bare-headed scouts come hurrying in from Chancery Lane to know what's the matter.
1	But he has been dead some years; and as I could not easily take to the notion of another when I lost him, I bought his share for myself and have gone on by myself ever since.
1	‘Far more,’ said Mr. Pluck.
1	Following the sound, Mr. Bumble raised his head and descried a man looking out of a door, breast-high, on the second story.
1	‘Do you want to spend anything now?’ he asked me.
1	He said to the world, "Go your several ways in peace!
1	Ask me what you will.’ ‘I am coming to it.
1	I only know that I found myself, with a perseverance worthy of a much better cause, making the most strenuous exertions to compress it within those limits.
1	Belling and the youngest Snawley can sit between me and the guard.
1	and know me better, man!"
1	‘Were you intrusted with this message to me by name?’ inquired Mr. Winkle, whose intellects were hopelessly confused by this extraordinary conversation.
1	‘You’re quite sure you’re not at home, are you?’ said Newman.
1	Directly he had said these words, he lay down again; gave a kind of a groan; and covered his hot head with the blankets.
1	Why SHOULD I go there?
1	The tenancy of Mr Pancks was limited to one airy bedroom; he covenanting and agreeing with Mr Rugg his landlord, that in consideration of a certain scale of payments accurately defined, and on certain verbal notice duly given, he should be at liberty to elect to share the Sunday breakfast, dinner, tea, or supper, or each or any or all of those repasts or meals of Mr and Miss Rugg (his daughter) in the back-parlour.
1	Perish the daring thought that any smaller creation should come between!
1	'Yes, I think it rather pretty,' said the beadle, glancing proudly downwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his coat.
1	It was in vain for Annie to protest that she was weary of such things.
1	Broadsides in the streets, signed with her father’s name, exonerating the late Stephen Blackpool, weaver, from misplaced suspicion, and publishing the guilt of his own son, with such extenuation as his years and temptation (he could not bring himself to add, his education) might beseech; were of the Present.
1	Nor is this the full extent of their misfortunes; for they are required to furnish an account of them besides.

1	The Fellow of Delicacy Mr. Stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good fortune on the Doctor's daughter, resolved to make her happiness known to her before he left town for the Long Vacation.
1	It is worthy of remark, as illustrating the importance we attach to our own judgments, and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and hasty conclusions, that, although Mr. Grimwig was not by any means a bad-hearted man, and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see his respected friend duped and deceived, he really did most earnestly and strongly hope at that moment, that Oliver Twist might not come back.
1	to what do you allude so cruelly, my love?’ asked Miss Tox, through her tears.
1	These, over and above Sloppy, were the mourners at the lowly grave.
1	‘Hollo, old gen’l’m’n!’ said Sam.
1	He brought the news home to my sister early in the morning, and brought Miss Abbey Potterson, a neighbour, to help break it to her.
1	There is a stern expression on her face and a part of her lower lip is compressed under her teeth.
1	I fear the turn of my thoughts is not calculated to lighten the time you must pass here; but you have brought this upon yourselves, and shall judge.
1	‘Now then, let’s have a talk.
1	I shall owe you, you don't know how much.
1	He could write of them, besides, in sound English, and render them into sound English.
1	If you think you have any evidence to lead you to the conclusion that he committed suicide, you will come to that conclusion.

1	"Richard told me--" He falters.
1	It was better and easier to keep her secret shut up there, among the tall dark walls, than to carry it abroad into the light, and try to hide it from a crowd of happy eyes.
1	There were a great many boarders in it; and as many lights sparkled and glistened from the windows down into the street below, when we drove up, as if it had been illuminated on some occasion of rejoicing.
1	Specially to introduce James Harthouse, Esquire.
1	She slightly stooped her shoulders to receive it, and the pretty girl lightly dropped it in its place.
1	‘She’s her own mistress--see who dares to take her away--unless she wishes it.’ ‘I _won’t_ be taken away,’ murmured the spinster aunt.
1	‘You didn’t mention in your letter what my brother’s complaint was, ma’am.’ ‘The doctors could attribute it to no particular disease,’ said Mrs Nickleby; shedding tears.
1	People sometimes call these dark yards ‘gardens’; it is not supposed that they were ever planted, but rather that they are pieces of unreclaimed land, with the withered vegetation of the original brick-field.
1	The ground was now covered with snow, though thinly, and there were floating lumps of ice in the more exposed parts of the river, and broken sheets of ice under the shelter of the banks.
1	That, once suspecting the existence of a conspiracy, they had no difficulty in tracing back its origin to the malice of Ralph, and the vindictiveness and avarice of Squeers.
1	Either the gas-lamps were treacherous, or he cocked his eye in a hideous manner, and likewise distorted his nose, when Mr Toots, crossing the road, looked back over his shoulder at the room where Florence slept.
1	He’s such a good fellow!” I gives her a kiss, and I says no more to her than, “My dear, you’re right to speak out, you’re to choose for yourself, you’re as free as a little bird.” Then I aways to him, and I says, “I wish it could have been so, but it can’t.
1	‘And what is more, Trot--’ said my aunt.
1	I truly love and honour you.
1	The prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how I could shelter my father from the wind and weather, better than I had done.
1	‘Aye, aye,’ said Dick, ‘advertising?’ The small servant nodded, and winked.
1	‘Is the gentleman up-stairs, sir, if you please?’ ‘Yes, Kit,’ said Brass, still fired with an honest indignation, and frowning with knotted brows upon his sister; ‘Yes Kit, he is.
1	If perfectly agreeable to Mr Aaron, the escort will now proceed.’ He knew his power over her.
1	But in some parts, this custom is inseparably mixed up with every meal and morning call, and with all the transactions of social life.
1	‘And is your Pa very ill, my darling dear Miss Floy?’ asked Susan.
1	‘Then I am forlorn.’ That he might be; but he was not so forlorn as to roam away and leave them together.
1	Neglected disease and hopeless poverty were as certain to be his portion as death itself, if he persevered in the same course; yet he did persevere, and the result may be guessed.
1	My echoing footsteps went to no other tune, but were as constant to that as if I had come home to build my castles in the air at a living mother’s side.
1	As we ascended the hill, he looked about him with a sharp eye--the day was now breaking--and reminded me that I had come down it one night, as I had reason for remembering, with my little servant and poor Jo, whom he called Toughey.
1	The single gentleman has been described as explaining their joint intentions, but it should have been written that they all spoke together; that if any one of them by chance held his peace for a moment, he stood gasping and panting for an opportunity to strike in again: in a word, that they had reached that pitch of impatience and anxiety where men can neither be persuaded nor reasoned with; and that it would have been as easy to turn the most impetuous wind that ever blew, as to prevail on them to reconsider their determination.
1	Then, of course, I recalled what she said that day at dinner when you were first with us.’ ‘Have you any idea where Miss Wade is to be found?’ ‘To tell you the truth,’ returned Mr Meagles, ‘it’s because I have an addled jumble of a notion on that subject that you found me waiting here.
1	He was interesting, wasn't he?
1	I will do nothing that you ask.’ ‘I am not accustomed to ask, Mrs Dombey,’ he observed; ‘I direct.’ ‘I will hold no place in your house to-morrow, or on any recurrence of to-morrow.
1	Scull it is, pardner--don’t fret yourself--I didn’t touch him.’ This was in answer to a quick impatient movement on the part of Gaffer: the speaker at the same time unshipping his scull on that side, and laying his hand on the gunwale of Gaffer’s boat and holding to it.
1	This passed into his mind, and passed out again; but he remembered it afterwards.
1	She was going among the coral reefs and cocoa-nuts and all that sort of thing, and she was chartered for a fortunate individual of the name of Pa (himself on board, and much respected by all hands), and she was going, for his sole profit and advantage, to fetch a cargo of sweet-smelling woods, the most beautiful that ever were seen, and the most profitable that ever were heard of; and her cargo would be a great fortune, as indeed it ought to be: the lovely woman who had purchased her and fitted her expressly for this voyage, being married to an Indian Prince, who was a Something-or-Other, and who wore Cashmere shawls all over himself and diamonds and emeralds blazing in his turban, and was beautifully coffee-coloured and excessively devoted, though a little too jealous.
1	How will he stand in the Newgate Calendar?
1	I heard that the man with the wooden leg, whose name was Tungay, was an obstinate barbarian who had formerly assisted in the hop business, but had come into the scholastic line with Mr. Creakle, in consequence, as was supposed among the boys, of his having broken his leg in Mr. Creakle’s service, and having done a deal of dishonest work for him, and knowing his secrets.
1	I know no elderly lady here, Miss, none older than yourself.’ ‘A highly desirable arrangement, Rosa my dear,’ observed Miss Twinkleton.
1	Ah, my dear Dombey!’ aside to that gentleman, ‘how her absence, as the time approaches, reminds me of the days, when that most agreeable of creatures, her Papa, was in your situation!’ ‘I have nothing to suggest.
1	It has inspired me with great commiseration, and I hope I understand it and its influences.
1	‘Never knew one of them miss fire before.

1	As the brothers paced the yard, William the bond looked about him to receive salutes, returned them by graciously lifting off his hat, and, with an engaging air, prevented Frederick the free from running against the company, or being jostled against the wall.
1	Anybody may pass, any day, in the thronged thoroughfares of the metropolis, some meagre, wrinkled, yellow old man (who might be supposed to have dropped from the stars, if there were any star in the Heavens dull enough to be suspected of casting off so feeble a spark), creeping along with a scared air, as though bewildered and a little frightened by the noise and bustle.
1	My better knowledge of his circumstances, and my direction and advice in extricating them—rather valuable, I hope, as coming from a scapegrace on a much larger scale—will give me some influence over him, and all I gain I shall certainly use towards this end.
1	He was degraded in their eyes; he had lost caste and station before the very paupers; he had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship, to the lowest depth of the most snubbed hen-peckery.
1	It was rumoured afterwards that this horrible and barbarous ceremony had been dispensed with, and that the remains had been secretly given up to Tom Scott.
1	As these people passed him standing still in the court-yard, and one of them turned back to inquire if he could assist him with his services, it came into Arthur Clennam’s mind that he would speak to Little Dorrit again before he went away.
1	‘Oh, indeed!’ said Mrs. Rogers graciously; for she was the lodger, and her servant was in waiting, so she was more gracious than intimate, in right of her position.
1	She could not pass it; she might have done so, perhaps, in the darkness without being seized, but her blood curdled at the thought.
1	And them and their descendants, to the last of their race, I, Alexandre Manette, unhappy prisoner, do this last night of the year 1767, in my unbearable agony, denounce to the times when all these things shall be answered for.
1	“But it's not my business!” he would generally say at those times, and would briskly fall to his sawing again.
1	I dried my sobbing darling's eyes and sat beside her on the sofa, and Richard sat on my other side; and while I was reminded of that so different night when they had first taken me into their confidence and had gone on in their own wild happy way, they told me between them how it was.
1	Very familiar to him, as he said himself some hours ago, George Rouncewell lifts him into easier positions through the long remainder of the blank wintry night, and equally familiar with his unexpressed wish, extinguishes the light and undraws the curtains at the first late break of day.
1	One shrill voice: ‘Weed!’ ‘Good agin!’ cried Riderhood.
1	The other is a House of Reformation for Juvenile Offenders.
1	Those are Minders.’ ‘Minders?’ the Secretary repeated.
1	Caught you spying, did I?’ It might have fallen out so, any way; but Bradley Headstone also noticed that immediately after this, Lizzie, who had not taken off her bonnet, rather hurriedly proposed that as the room was getting dark they should go out into the air.

1	She passed the church, gazing upward at its old tower, went through the wicket gate, and so into the village.
1	‘Where I little thought, Heaven forgive me,’ said Clennam to himself, ‘that I should ever enter thus!’ Mr Chivery was on the Lock, and Young John was in the Lodge: either newly released from it, or waiting to take his own spell of duty.
1	I’d beat it out of him; and I told you that, six months ago.’ ‘So you did, my love,’ rejoined Squeers.
1	"The facts bearing on that inquiry.
1	Hear, hear!’ ‘Dick!’ said the other, returning to his seat after having paced the room twice or thrice, ‘will you talk seriously for two minutes, if I show you a way to make your fortune with very little trouble?’ ‘You’ve shown me so many,’ returned Dick; ‘and nothing has come of any one of ‘em but empty pockets--’ ‘You’ll tell a different story of this one, before a very long time is over,’ said his companion, drawing his chair to the table.
1	Something had gone wrong with the house-door, for R. Wilfer stopped on the steps, staring at it, and cried: ‘Hal-loa?’ ‘Yes,’ said Mrs Wilfer, ‘the man came himself with a pair of pincers, and took it off, and took it away.
1	The dirty gateway with the wind and rain whistling through it, and the basket of muddy potatoes waiting to be spilt again or taken up, never seemed the common hole it really was, when he looked back to it by these lights.
1	In one instant, the mottled-faced gentleman depressed his hand again, and every glass was set down empty.
1	"You were talking about nothing else in the gig."
1	No one knows what I suffered at Madame Sauteuse’s, where I learnt to dance and make presentation-curtseys, and other dreadful things--or at least where they tried to teach me.
1	He begged me to express his opinion that your conduct of last evening was of a description which no gentleman could endure; and’ (he added) ‘which no one gentleman would pursue towards another.’ Mr. Winkle’s astonishment was too real, and too evident, to escape the observation of Doctor Slammer’s friend; he therefore proceeded-- ‘My friend, Doctor Slammer, requested me to add, that he was firmly persuaded you were intoxicated during a portion of the evening, and possibly unconscious of the extent of the insult you were guilty of.
1	Monsieur might have easily seen him in the valley or somewhere on the lake, when he (the dog) had gone down with one of the order to solicit aid for the convent.
1	Mr. Bounderby, having got it into his explosive composition that Mrs. Sparsit was a highly superior woman to perceive that he had that general cross upon him in his deserts (for he had not yet settled what it was), and further that Louisa would have objected to her as a frequent visitor if it had comported with his greatness that she should object to anything he chose to do, resolved not to lose sight of Mrs. Sparsit easily.
1	‘You are surprised,’ said Quilp.
1	'You want for nothing, I'm sure.'
1	If ever I bestowed a thought upon the cases, as they dragged their slow length before me, it was only to wonder, in the matrimonial cases (remembering Dora), how it was that married people could ever be otherwise than happy; and, in the Prerogative cases, to consider, if the money in question had been left to me, what were the foremost steps I should immediately have taken in regard to Dora.
1	Gentlemen, I beg to surround with a rich halo of enthusiastic cheering the united names of “Dumkins and Podder.”’ Here the little man ceased, and here the company commenced a raising of voices, and thumping of tables, which lasted with little intermission during the remainder of the evening.
1	The particular friends resumed their attack upon the breakfast, more freely than before, as if the recollection of last night’s supper had imparted a new relish to the meal.
1	So it happens that the sexton’s spade gets worn and battered.
1	Pending the conveyance of this request to some person in authority, we walked into a grim room, where several grim hats were hanging on grim pegs, and the time was grimly told by a grim clock which uttered every tick with a kind of struggle, as if it broke the grim silence reluctantly, and under protest.
1	Those two should pull a pair of oars, we settled, and I would steer; our charge would be sitter, and keep quiet; as speed was not our object, we should make way enough.
1	Bucket gives me to understand that he will probably apply for a series of remands from time to time until the case is more complete.

1	‘And yet,’ said Eugene, ‘I should like to see the fellow (Mortimer excepted) who would undertake to tell me that this was not a real sentiment on my part, won out of me by her beauty and her worth, in spite of myself, and that I would not be true to her.
1	Long after I ought to have heard it, and long after I had fancied I heard it and found it but a fancy, all was still.

1	Because his grandmother takes so MANY ounces, and drops it over him.’ ‘But he would not be living with his grandmother then, Margaretta,’ said Mr Milvey.
1	The glance was but momentary, for Ralph, being disturbed, turned to demand the cause of the interruption.

1	Dear sisters, let us live and die, if you list, in this green garden’s compass; only shun the gloom and sadness of a cloister, and we shall be happy.” ‘The tears fell fast from the maiden’s eyes as she closed her impassioned appeal, and hid her face in the bosom of her sister.
1	Mr. Omer had taken it so much to heart, his daughter told me, that he had been very low and poorly all day, and had gone to bed without his pipe.
1	In the moment’s pause I speak of, I saw Uriah’s countenance form itself into a most ill-favoured smile.
1	‘You are its mistress now.
1	Where everybody took so active a part, it is almost invidious to make a distinction; but if one individual evinced greater powers than another, it was the coachman with the hoarse voice, who took an imperial pint of vinegar with his oysters, without betraying the least emotion.
1	Who brought her father to life?” “Oh!
1	For myself, I am fighting my way on in the world against difficulties, and it would be ridiculous if I made a pretence of doing anything else.’ ‘You are reading for the bar, Mr. Waterbrook informed me?’ said I.
1	And I have no doubt she did; or that he loved her, however strange it may appear; though, to be sure, they were a congenial couple.
1	Florence, hardly glancing round her, lest she should remind him freshly of their last parting--for their feet were on the very stones where he had struck her in his madness--and keeping close to him, with her eyes upon his face, and his arm about her, led him out to a coach that was waiting at the door, and carried him away.
1	The party came to the hotel.
1	There’s no more to be said.’ ‘Ah, dear me, dear me!’ exclaimed Wegg with a sigh, but eyeing him while pretending to keep him company in eyeing the fire, ‘such is Woman!

1	I only stood at the door, one night--on the lower step there--while a shipmate of mine looked in to speak to your father.
1	“It’s a wery bad road between this and London,” says the gen’l’m’n.--“Here and there it is a heavy road,” says my father.--” ‘Specially near the canal, I think,” says the gen’l’m’n.--“Nasty bit that ‘ere,” says my father.-- “Well, Mr. Weller,” says the gen’l’m’n, “you’re a wery good whip, and can do what you like with your horses, we know.
1	Listen to the true one.
1	His wife presented herself; and, of her, Ralph inquired whether her husband was at home.
1	I have already thought of that, and taken my measures.
1	‘Out of my brother’s way?
1	It was at this moment, that the sound of approaching wheels was heard, and that the ladies, looking up, saw a hackney-coach stop at the garden gate.

1	There’s a song that says, “I’d crowns resign, to call her mine!” I hope to do it, one of these days.’ Dear Agnes!
1	'You may make up your mind to that, and think yourself well off besides.'
1	‘Now, my dearest Grangeby,’ said Mrs Skewton, ‘you must posively prom,’ she cut some of her words short, and cut out others altogether, ‘come down very soon.’ ‘I said just now, Madam,’ returned Mr Dombey, loudly and laboriously, ‘that I am coming in a day or two.’ ‘Bless you, Domber!’ Here the Major, who was come to take leave of the ladies, and who was staring through his apoplectic eyes at Mrs Skewton’s face with the disinterested composure of an immortal being, said: ‘Begad, Ma’am, you don’t ask old Joe to come!’ ‘Sterious wretch, who’s he?’ lisped Cleopatra.
1	'I have no doubt you are, my friend,' replied the old gentleman: fixing his spectacles more firmly on his nose, and looking about him for the inkstand.
1	The end of these first holidays was to witness his separation from Florence, but who ever looked forward to the end of holidays whose beginning was not yet come!
1	"I can give no such assurance, Lady Dedlock.
1	Ham, I give you joy, my boy.
1	‘Very good,’ replied Mr. Winkle, thinking in his heart it was very bad.
1	‘Uncle, dear uncle, spare yourself, spare me!’ The old man was not deaf to the last words.
1	I thanked her, but said I would prefer to answer for myself and to myself.
1	Now you know that’s infernal clever!
1	Hear me.’ ‘Sir,’ said Mr. Winkle, trembling from head to foot, ‘before I consent to sit down beside, or opposite you, without the presence of a waiter, I must be secured by some further understanding.
1	The brothers, on their return, bestowed such commendations on Nicholas for the part he had taken, and evinced so much joy at the altered state of events and the recovery of their young friend from trials so great and dangers so threatening, that, as she more than once informed her daughter, she now considered the fortunes of the family ‘as good as’ made.
1	I am very thankful, I am very cheerful, but I cannot quite help their coming to my eyes.

1	I am always saying something wrong to ma.’ ‘To me, Georgiana dearest?’ ‘No, not to you; you are not ma.
1	It’s not everybody, sir, who has an opportunity of improving himself by the conversation of Mr Quilp.’ The dwarf glanced sarcastically at his brazen friend, and, with a short dry cough, turned upon his heel to bid adieu to Miss Sally.
1	Do not," he would sometimes add in a burst of deportment, "even allow my simple requirements to be considered if they should at any time interfere with your own, my Caroline.
1	They'll soon go.” “Yes, Pip,” observed Joe, whose voice sounded hollow in his beer-mug.
1	Any one of us might have made it in your place, and felt just as you do.’ ‘The Lord bless ye!’ said the old woman, stretching out her hand.
1	She did it gloomily until she came to ten, but when she got into two figures she became more hopeful, and, as the time advanced, even jocular.
1	His fees, upon entering and leaving the jail, are reduced in amount, and he becomes entitled to a share of some small quantities of food: to provide which, a few charitable persons have, from time to time, left trifling legacies in their wills.

1	He lifted the light to his face, set it gently down, and left the apartment.
1	"My experience teaches me," says Mr. Tulkinghorn, who has by this time got his hands in his pockets and is going on in his business consideration of the matter like a machine.
1	I want to see Ada righted, Woodcourt, as well as myself; I want to do my utmost to right her, as well as myself; I venture what I can scrape together to extricate her, as well as myself.

1	It was at the corner of the house, I remember, looking two ways.
1	You don’t mean to say that you think--’ ‘Oh no, I think nothing at all,’ retorted Miss Price, pettishly.
1	‘Eh?’ said Mr. Magnus; and then he repeated the sneer with increased effect.
1	After gazing at her in silence, Mrs Clennam turned to Rigaud.
1	That’s just his character,’ said I.

1	He had been tried twice; and on the second occasion the jury felt so much hesitation in convicting him, that they found a verdict of manslaughter, or murder in the second degree; which it could not possibly be, as there had, beyond all doubt, been no quarrel or provocation, and if he were guilty at all, he was unquestionably guilty of murder in its broadest and worst signification.
1	"Do you mean to let her go in that way?"
1	From the House of Commons to the House of Correction, there is a general profession of morality, except among our people; it really is that exception which makes our people quite reviving.

1	"I am not indeed, cousin John," replied Ada with a smile, "if it is to come from you."
1	And I entreat you to say a word for me to Mr. Jaggers, and to represent to him that, all circumstances considered, he ought to be more open with me!” I have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe.
1	‘Pardon me, sir,’ says Twemlow, rather less mildly than usual, ‘I don’t agree with you.
1	If it's ever broke to him that his rip of a brother has turned up, I could wish," says the trooper, shaking his head very doubtfully, "to break it myself and be governed as to advancing or retreating by the way in which he seems to take it."
1	It gladdens my eyes to see you again; that’s all.’ ‘Don’t say that’s all, because--ha--that’s not all.
1	‘“It has been ascertained beyond the possibility of doubt, that she cannot see a ray of light, cannot hear the least sound, and never exercises her sense of smell, if she have any.
1	‘It’s a shame,’ said the bodyguard reproachfully.
1	‘I humbly beg your forgiveness, godmother.
1	There’s Mr Headstone stopping and looking over the wall at the tide, to hint that it’s time to go.
1	Brandy, Mr Dolls, or--?’ ‘Threepenn’orth Rum,’ said Mr Dolls.
1	You know where I have heard that song the last time?’ With his rapid native action, his hands made the outline of a high hook nose, pushed his eyes near together, dishevelled his hair, puffed out his upper lip to represent a thick moustache, and threw the heavy end of an ideal cloak over his shoulder.
1	The schoolmaster sat for a long time smoking his pipe by the kitchen fire, which was now deserted, thinking, with a very happy face, on the fortunate chance which had brought him so opportunely to the child’s assistance, and parrying, as well as in his simple way he could, the inquisitive cross-examination of the landlady, who had a great curiosity to be made acquainted with every particular of Nell’s life and history.
1	Put it to the proof.
1	‘For clearly do I know, mark you,’ pursued Wegg, pointing his words with his forefinger, ‘clearly do I know what question your expressive features puts to me.’ ‘What question?’ said Venus.
1	O mum!’ Sloppy’s feelings obliged him to squeeze his hat, and contract one leg at the knee.
1	The Jew walked to the door: looking over his shoulder at the boy as he went.
1	So away she went, muttering her message all the way to keep it in her mind, and, at the appointed time, came back.
1	She has her failings--as who has not?--but I never knew her do it when company was present, at which time you may freely trust her with wines, spirits, or malt liquors.
1	Waiter as he was, he had human passions and feelings, and he looked very hard at Miss Squeers as he handed the muffins.
1	"Ah, my love, my love," he said, "it is in the subtle poison of such abuses to breed such diseases.
1	‘I’ll have it explained, though,’ said Mr. Pickwick, raising his head and hammering the table.
1	‘Sir, I’m very much obliged to you for the caution, and I’ll leave particular directions with the servant to lock up the spoons,’ replied Mr. Gunter.
1	Weller, let me introduce you.’ ‘How are you, ma’am?’ said Mr. Weller.
1	"No, Lady Dedlock, not by any means."
1	‘True, sir--beg your pardon, sir.--Very nice four-wheel chaise, sir-- seat for two behind--one in front for the gentleman that drives--oh!
1	Since the Chancellor shut up his shop, which he did very early to-night, Mr. Weevle has been down and up, and down and up (with a cheap tight velvet skull-cap on his head, making his whiskers look out of all proportion), oftener than before.
1	I cannot say that I have been able to conform myself, in heart and spirit, to your rules; I cannot say that I believe my forty years have been profitable or pleasant to myself, or any one; but I have habitually submitted, and I only ask you to remember it.’ Woe to the suppliant, if such a one there were or ever had been, who had any concession to look for in the inexorable face at the cabinet.
1	“That wretch would have married me by violence in another hour.” ‘“Confound his impudence!” said my uncle, bestowing a very contemptuous look on the dying heir of Filletoville.
1	‘We will use no harsh terms,’ said brother Charles, in a gentle voice; ‘but accommodate ourselves to the circumstances in which this young lady is placed.
1	‘Receive, dear madam, the assurance of my highest and most distinguished consideration, ‘A thousand friendships to that dear Flintwinch.
1	I must speak to you.’ Why did she not, and what was the inward struggle that rendered her incapable of doing so, for minutes, while, in the strong constraint she put upon her face, it was as fixed as any statue’s--looking upon him with neither yielding nor unyielding, liking nor hatred, pride not humility: nothing but a searching gaze?
1	There had never been so serene an understanding between them since they were first affianced.
1	O, what a resounding chord!
1	The Doctor was sitting in his portentous study, with a globe at each knee, books all round him, Homer over the door, and Minerva on the mantel-shelf.
1	So I tell you what.
1	Precisely as a beast might approach the opened gate of his den and eye the freedom beyond, he passed those few moments in watching and peering, until the door was closed upon him.
1	A light was burning there, and showed her Florence in her bloom of innocence and beauty, fast asleep.
1	Why do you not take some rest?’ ‘Sleep has left me,’ returned the old man.
1	Was your father in the same way of life as yourself?"
1	‘Certainly, Sam, certainly,’ said Mr. Pickwick, his eyes glistening with delight at this manifestation of filial feeling on the part of his attendant; ‘certainly, Sam.’ Mr. Weller made a grateful bow.
1	Nancy stooped below the shutters, and Oliver heard the sound of a bell.
1	Well, this was her sister, her little sister, much younger than Nell, whom she had not seen (so the story went afterwards) for five years, and to bring whom to that place on a short visit, she had been saving her poor means all that time.
1	Does he treat you well?’ ‘You see how he treats me,’ the Secretary answered, with a patient and yet proud air.
1	‘O’ course I came to look arter you, my darlin’,’ replied Mr. Weller; for once permitting his passion to get the better of his veracity.
1	What possessed you?” “I don't know what possessed me, Joe,” I replied, letting his shirt sleeve go, and sitting down in the ashes at his feet, hanging my head; “but I wish you hadn't taught me to call Knaves at cards Jacks; and I wish my boots weren't so thick nor my hands so coarse.” And then I told Joe that I felt very miserable, and that I hadn't been able to explain myself to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook, who were so rude to me, and that there had been a beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham's who was dreadfully proud, and that she had said I was common, and that I knew I was common, and that I wished I was not common, and that the lies had come of it somehow, though I didn't know how.
1	‘Upon my soul, I don’t know what to say.
1	Then comes another certain person, in the person of yourself, and charges me, in an equally solemn way, not to mention Jo to that other certain person above all other persons.
1	The habit, too, of seeking some sort of recompense in the discontented boast of being disappointed, is a habit fraught with degeneracy.
1	Everywhere!’ The busy little dressmaker quickly snipped the shirt away, and laid bare the results of as furious and sound a thrashing as even Mr Fledgeby merited.
1	If they would only leave us a little more of the poetry of existence in these terrible days!’ Mrs Skewton was looking sharp after Mr Dombey all the time she said this, who was looking at Edith: who was listening, but who never lifted up her eyes.
1	The shadows of night had gathered so fast, that he did not look about him when he closed the door, but plodded straight along the street.
1	In six months we were to be married, and were to go to India.
1	I am disappointed and cut a poor figure.’ ‘Am I no one?’ ‘Some one--and I was coming to you, if you had waited a moment.
1	‘I’m much obleeged to her, I’m sure,’ said Mr. Peggotty.
1	Him as come down in the country with Mr.
1	‘You spoke so feelingly to me last night, sir, and I found afterwards that you had been so generous to my father, that I could not resist your message, if it was only to thank you; especially as I wished very much to say to you--’ she hesitated and trembled, and tears rose in her eyes, but did not fall.
1	Traddles now informed me, as the result of his inquiries, that the mere mechanical acquisition necessary, except in rare cases, for thorough excellence in it, that is to say, a perfect and entire command of the mystery of short-hand writing and reading, was about equal in difficulty to the mastery of six languages; and that it might perhaps be attained, by dint of perseverance, in the course of a few years.
1	“I'll redeem it at once.
1	‘The youngest--there were reasons for his being sensitive and watchful--was the first to find this out.
1	No one waiting?’ ‘No, sir, no one waiting.’ ‘Thank you, John.
1	He had an entirely new suit of glossy clothes on, a shining hat, lilac-kid gloves, a neckerchief of a variety of colours, a large hot-house flower in his button-hole, and a thick gold ring on his little finger.
1	If you asked me for another penny, and made it an open question, I'd repent of being so liberal and knock off half-a-crown."
1	‘Say yes,’ Wegg naturally urges.
1	In whatever way Mrs Jarley received the response, it did not provoke her to further questioning, or tempt her into any more remarks at the time, for she relapsed into a thoughtful silence, and remained in that state so long that Nell withdrew to the other window and rejoined her grandfather, who was now awake.
1	In the suburbs there is a spacious cemetery: unfinished yet, but every day improving.
1	‘He walked down the hill, and through the village.
1	We cannot allow those who serve us well to labour under any privation or discomfort that it is in our power to remove.
1	‘A very ill-advised and feverish proceeding this, I am sure.
1	Noo then, where be’est thou coomin’ to?
1	"It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it," was the Spirit's sorrowful reply.
1	The bell was rung; the room-door opened; a man came in, with a halting walk; and, looking round, Ralph’s eyes met those of Newman Noggs.
1	Besides, my attention was diverted by my visitor, who was cold after her ride and looked hungry and who, our dinner being brought in, required some little assistance in arraying herself with great satisfaction in a pitiable old scarf and a much-worn and often-mended pair of gloves, which she had brought down in a paper parcel.
1	Indignant as he was at this impertinence, there was something so exquisitely absurd in such a cartel of defiance, that Nicholas was obliged to bite his lip and read the note over two or three times before he could muster sufficient gravity and sternness to address the hostile messenger, who had not taken his eyes from the ceiling, nor altered the expression of his face in the slightest degree.
1	My Aunt Makes up Her Mind About Me      XV.
1	"My dear friend, he is a lawyer, and a famous one.
1	In this district, as in all others where slavery sits brooding, (I have frequently heard this admitted, even by those who are its warmest advocates:) there is an air of ruin and decay abroad, which is inseparable from the system.
1	I saw before me, lying on the step, the mother of the dead child.
1	He’s a most remarkable man--so extremely whimsical!
1	‘If you suppose that boy to be friendless, Mr Wrayburn, you deceive yourself.
1	If I makes any guess about it,’ added Sam, looking at Mr. Winkle, ‘I haven’t got any right to say what it is, ‘fear it should be a wrong ‘un.’ ‘I have no right to make any further inquiry into the private affairs of a friend, however intimate a friend,’ said Mr. Pickwick, after a short silence; ‘at present let me merely say, that I do not understand this at all.
1	This, Arthur received as an assurance that he might implicitly rely on Pancks, if he ever should come to need assistance; either in any of the matters of which they had spoken that night, or any other subject that could in any way affect himself.
1	But I see too, Charley--’ ‘Still as plain as plain can be, Liz?’ asked the boy playfully.
1	We have gone into them, and he has not.
1	Quinion suggests that it gives employment to some other boys, and that he sees no reason why it shouldn’t, on the same terms, give employment to you.’ ‘He having,’ Mr. Quinion observed in a low voice, and half turning round, ‘no other prospect, Murdstone.’ Mr. Murdstone, with an impatient, even an angry gesture, resumed, without noticing what he had said: ‘Those terms are, that you will earn enough for yourself to provide for your eating and drinking, and pocket-money.
1	In the yard, was the Patriarchal Casby, looking so tremendously benevolent that many enthusiastic Collegians grasped him fervently by the hand, and the wives and female relatives of many more Collegians kissed his hand, nothing doubting that he had done it all.
1	Strip from his fair young wife her silken dress and jewels, unbind her braided hair, stamp early wrinkles on her brow, pinch her pale cheek with care and much privation, array her faded form in coarsely patched attire, let there be nothing but his love to set her forth or deck her out, and you shall put it to the proof indeed.
1	‘I’m one of the masters at Salem House,’ he said.
1	And sure enough there’s no light, and the door’s fast.
1	She had merely asked a civil question, and to be sure she knew it would meet with a civil answer.
1	"Do you intend to remain in the house any time?
1	He cowered down upon his stone bed, and thought of the past.
1	Looking at him with the expression of the instant frozen on her face, she sits down on the seat again.
1	She gave him her hand, and said, ‘You wonder to see me here by myself?
1	Mr Dombey, recovering his composure by degrees, or cooling his emotion in his sense of having taken a high position, sat gradually stiffening again, and looking at the parrot as she swung to and fro, in her great wedding ring.
1	"I think he likes me a little, my Lady."
1	It is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that while there is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humour.
1	I cannot say, however, that it is your fault.
1	"I asked the favour of seeing you for a few moments here," said I, "in preference to calling at Mr. Kenge's because, remembering what you said on an occasion when you spoke to me in confidence, I feared I might otherwise cause you some embarrassment, Mr.
1	I have heard about it, Pip.
1	Show ‘em to somebody else, and take their advice.’ Mr. Squeers would, very likely, have carried on the farce of being offended a little longer, if Mrs. Sliderskew, in her anxiety to restore herself to her former high position in his good graces, had not become so extremely affectionate that he stood at some risk of being smothered by her caresses.
1	‘There was--pardon me--really such a person, and at all in his power?’ hinted Traddles.
1	‘Say Georgiana, darling,’ interposed his wife.
1	You're dead.” I felt that I had come to the brink of my grave.
1	He bent his eyes involuntarily upon the father as he spoke, and marked his uneasiness; for he coloured and turned his head away.
1	A man who could never sufficiently vaunt himself a self-made man.
1	Why anything the matter?’ ‘You are so very pale,’ said Kit, ‘that I should hardly have known you.’ ‘Pooh pooh!
1	It subsided as quickly as it had been roused.
1	They purposed remaining in London only three days, prior to departing for some weeks to a distant part of the coast.
1	These sequestered nooks are the public offices of the legal profession, where writs are issued, judgments signed, declarations filed, and numerous other ingenious machines put in motion for the torture and torment of His Majesty’s liege subjects, and the comfort and emolument of the practitioners of the law.
1	Look round you, my dear, and consider.
1	Then would he be there to tell that honourable gentleman that it would have been more to his honour, more to his credit, more to his good taste, more to his good sense, more to half the dictionary of commonplaces, if he had left the Circumlocution Office alone, and never approached this matter.
1	If she had one in each eye, it might keep that other drooping lid up, and look more uniform.
1	‘My dear ma’am--my dear young lady,’ cried brother Charles in violent agitation, ‘pray don’t--not another word, I beseech and entreat you!
1	The poor schoolmaster was so open-hearted, and so little versed in the most ordinary cunning or deceit, that she could not have failed to succeed in the first five minutes, but that he happened to be unacquainted with what she wished to know; and so he told her.
1	A game-cock in the stableyard, deprived of every spark of his accustomed animation, balanced himself dismally on one leg in a corner; a donkey, moping with drooping head under the narrow roof of an outhouse, appeared from his meditative and miserable countenance to be contemplating suicide.
1	Devilish cold,’ he added pettishly, ‘standing at that door, wasting one’s time with such seedy vagabonds!’ Having very vehemently stirred a particularly large fire with a particularly small poker, the clerk led the way to his principal’s private room, and announced Mr. Pickwick.
1	Her former cheerfulness was restored, her step regained its elasticity and lightness, the colour which had forsaken her cheek visited it once again, and Kate Nickleby looked more beautiful than ever.
1	When he had swallowed a little, he took the glass himself and emptied it.
1	I think my daughter Amy has mentioned to me that you know poor Plornish?’ ‘O yes!’ said Arthur Clennam.
1	‘Fred!’ said Mr Swiveller, finding that his former adjuration had been productive of no effect.
1	That’s how she know’d it.
1	Where, for the first time in many revolving years, the overwhelming pressure of pecuniary liabilities was not proclaimed, from day to day, by importune voices declining to vacate the passage; where there was no knocker on the door for any creditor to appeal to; where personal service of process was not required, and detainees were merely lodged at the gate!
1	‘Wasn’t it, too!’ returned Bella, pretending to pout.
1	Rose had been in high spirits, too, and they had walked on, in merry conversation, until they had far exceeded their ordinary bounds.
1	I have never accused him."
1	‘In the cause of the right, Mr Wegg?’ ‘Always so, Mr Venus.
1	I have often seen my mother try it, and it seemingly refreshed her.
1	Soon afterwards, Biddy, Joe, and I, had a cold dinner together; but we dined in the best parlor, not in the old kitchen, and Joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his knife and fork and the saltcellar and what not, that there was great restraint upon us.
1	Mr. Tartar’s boat was perfect.
1	Both walked sullenly on, as though their thoughts were busily occupied, until they were quite clear of the crowd, and almost alone, when Sir Mulberry wheeled round to return.
1	‘This is very extraordinary!’ ‘What is, Pa?’ ‘Why here’s Mr Rokesmith now!’ ‘No, no, Pa, no,’ cried Bella, greatly flurried.
1	In her progress to, and happy arrival at, this resolution, she was possibly influenced, not only by her maternal affections but by three politic considerations.
1	Jerry has been my bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him.
1	Let us take one of those same little children to be a little maid to Pet.
1	Don’t be like Patience on a mantelpiece frowning at Dolls, but sit down, and I’ll tell you something that you really will find amusing.
1	You don’t care who goes, I suppose?
1	So the lady screamed, and Mr. Pickwick started.
1	Will you have it now?’ I thanked him and said, ‘Yes.’ Upon which he poured it out of a jug into a large tumbler, and held it up against the light, and made it look beautiful.
1	There is also a small navy-yard, where a couple of Government steamboats were building, and getting on vigorously.
1	‘Just damp enough to be cheerful, sir,’ rejoined Brass.
1	It was very easy, Briggs said, to make a galley-slave of a boy all the half-year, and then score him up idle; and to crib two dinners a-week out of his board, and then score him up greedy; but that wasn’t going to be submitted to, he believed, was it?
1	"I wish he had let it off," says the benevolent old man, "and blown his head into as many pieces as he owed pounds!"
1	In two minutes thereafter, Mr. Pickwick was joking with the young ladies who wouldn’t come over the stile while he looked--or who, having pretty feet and unexceptionable ankles, preferred standing on the top rail for five minutes or so, declaring that they were too frightened to move--with as much ease and absence of reserve or constraint, as if he had known them for life.
1	She took very kindly to me and was extremely confidential, so much so that sometimes she almost made me uncomfortable.
1	‘In the polite circles I believe this sort of thing isn’t usually said to a gentleman in his own apartments, but never mind that.
1	Accordingly, Mr Venus slipped past Mr Wegg and towed him down.
1	‘Except well, indeed!’ said the Old Soldier.
1	‘This lady, Mr. Jinks, has come here, to give information of an intended duel in this town.’ Mr. Jinks, not knowing exactly what to do, smiled a dependent’s smile.
1	‘Lift him out,’ said Squeers, after he had literally feasted his eyes, in silence, upon the culprit.
1	‘I have no scruple in saying, in the presence of our friends here, that I am a man who has, for some years, contended against the pressure of pecuniary difficulties.’ I knew he was certain to say something of this kind; he always would be so boastful about his difficulties.
1	‘Nobody will pay you interest for the money, I suppose, between this and twelve o’clock; will they?’ ‘But nobody would pay you interest for it either, you know,’ returned Arthur, leering at Ralph with all the cunning and slyness he could throw into his face.
1	Florence had heard enough before quitting the room, to know that Edith loved her yet; that she had suffered for her sake; and that she had kept her sacrifices quiet, lest they should trouble her peace.
1	It would be harsh, and perhaps not altogether true, to say of him that he felt these rubs and gratings against his pride more keenly than he had felt his wife’s death: but certainly they impressed that event upon him with new force, and communicated to it added weight and bitterness.
1	That feline personage, with her lips tightly shut and her eyes looking out at him sideways, softly closes the door before replying.
1	As I intended to repeat it after a while, and as it was necessary to watch its influence, I then sat down by the side of the bed.
1	I know what it is to be jilted, Sir; I have endured that sort of thing three or four times.’ ‘I am much obliged to you, for your condolence on what you presume to be my melancholy case,’ said Mr. Pickwick, winding up his watch, and laying it on the table, ‘but--’ ‘No, no,’ said Mr. Peter Magnus, ‘not a word more; it’s a painful subject.
1	So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got quite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank again.
1	He inquired within--he took the lodgings; and on the very next day he entered into possession of them.
1	Spi--ies!” At length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled against him, and from this person he learned that the funeral was the funeral of one Roger Cly.
1	The moment that she touched the door on this night, Florence found that it was open.
1	To the little inn yonder?’ ‘Let us wait here,’ rejoined Nell.
1	'What's the good of talking in that way to me; why don't yer speak so as I can understand yer?'
1	"She is like the morning," he said.
1	"And you don't think it's an answer, eh?
1	I have slept in that room,’ added Tim, sinking his voice a little, ‘for four-and-forty year; and if it wasn’t inconvenient, and didn’t interfere with business, I should request leave to die there.’ ‘Damn you, Tim Linkinwater, how dare you talk about dying?’ roared the twins by one impulse, and blowing their old noses violently.
1	Son was very bald, and very red, and though (of course) an undeniably fine infant, somewhat crushed and spotty in his general effect, as yet.
1	She must be an immense age, and yet she is as active and handsome!
1	When he had gone to his own room, and had again thrown himself into the chair by the fire, Mr Doyce knocked at the door, candle in hand, to ask him how and at what hour he proposed returning on the morrow?
1	I would not endure it.
1	‘’Tis like to be long,’ said Mr. Peggotty, in a low voice, ‘afore the boat finds new tenants.
1	‘A very natural thought, at all events, after seeing me gazing at those bills.
1	Don’t you remember?’ With slowly dawning remembrance, Mr Venus rises, and holds his candle over the little counter, and holds it down towards the legs, natural and artificial, of Mr Wegg.
1	I’ll never believe you again, and never tell you anything more about Mr Carker the Junior, if I find out that you have been deceiving me!’ Solomon Gills laughingly defied him to find out anything of the kind; and Walter, revolving in his thoughts all sorts of impracticable ways of making fortunes and placing the wooden Midshipman in a position of independence, betook himself to the offices of Dombey and Son with a heavier countenance than he usually carried there.
1	‘Don’t be angry with me.’ ‘Is it good news, pleasant news, news to make a man skip and snap his fingers?’ said the dwarf.
1	Is it Havisham or--?” I had nothing to add.
1	Noggs,’ said Nicholas, after a few moments’ reflection, ‘I must go out at once.’ ‘Go out!’ cried Newman.
1	I assure you, Sophronia, that I only praise Alfred, because he is your husband and so fond of you.’ Sophronia’s glance was as if a rather new light broke in upon her.
1	There were some minutes of discussion between them before they came to this conclusion, during which the staring Rob paid close attention to both speakers, and inclined his ear to each by turns, as if he were appointed arbitrator of the argument.
1	‘I know who it is.
1	But if you will undertake to pen my lord into that furthest drawing-room where he is now so profoundly engaged, I will undertake to bring our dear Merdle into the presence, without the possibility of getting away.’ ‘Done!’ said Ferdinand.
1	I have a character to maintain.’ After a momentary struggle with myself, I turned my eyes upon him, and said, ‘You have heard my question.
1	You won't see him alive again, Fagin.
1	It don’t mind me.’ ‘Is he asleep?’ ‘No, I think not.
1	‘You are!’ said Mr Carker.
1	When dinner-time came, Flora drew the arm of her new charge through hers, and led her down-stairs, and presented her to the Patriarch and Mr Pancks, who were already in the dining-room waiting to begin.
1	As the world runs, it ought to have been a sound, hearty cuff; for Mr. Pickwick had been duped, deceived, and wronged by the destitute outcast who was now wholly in his power.
1	It leaves the lowest of the range of dust-mountains, with some sort of a dwelling-house at its foot, to an old servant who is sole executor, and all the rest of the property--which is very considerable--to the son.
1	I hate you!’ And he would have visited his hatred upon it all with the scowl he threw about him, if he could.
1	But three or four mile gained to-night is so many saved to-morrow, and if you keep on, I think our best way is to do the same.’ ‘Where’s your partner?’ inquired Grinder.
1	"That is all I have to trouble you with, Lady Dedlock."
1	Altogether, it was a scene I could not help dwelling on with pleasure, for a long time after I got back and had wished Traddles good night.
1	I could bear, and I have borne, a great deal from Mr. James; but he insulted me too far.
1	There, we meant to lie by all night.
1	‘How goes the world, my Flintwinch?
1	It was a town of machinery and tall chimneys, out of which interminable serpents of smoke trailed themselves for ever and ever, and never got uncoiled.
1	It’s a cold, cold night, and the fog clings so.’ As Miss Abbey helped her to turn her chair, her loosened bonnet dropped on the floor.
1	When she was dead, I apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done, and then the son became a part of the family, residing in the house you are acquainted with.
1	In this same Society (if that were it which came to his dinners, and to Mrs Merdle’s receptions and concerts), he hardly seemed to enjoy himself much, and was mostly to be found against walls and behind doors.
1	But, nothing happening, and the moon looking down upon him as if he were dead after a fit of wrath, he holds his steam-hammer beating head and heart, and staggers away.
1	And it has not been,’ added Walter, after a moment’s pause, ‘all heedlessness on my part, Sir; for I have felt an interest in Mr Carker ever since I have been here, and have hardly been able to help speaking of him sometimes, when I have thought of him so much!’ Walter said this from his soul, and with the very breath of honour.
1	Here too are lanes and alleys, paved with mud knee-deep, underground chambers, where they dance and game; the walls bedecked with rough designs of ships, and forts, and flags, and American eagles out of number: ruined houses, open to the street, whence, through wide gaps in the walls, other ruins loom upon the eye, as though the world of vice and misery had nothing else to show: hideous tenements which take their name from robbery and murder: all that is loathsome, drooping, and decayed is here.
1	Yet, having already made his fortune in his own mind, he was so unassuming with it that I felt quite grateful to him for not being puffed up.
1	Mr Abel remained behind, very often looking at his watch and at the room door, until Mr Swiveller was roused from a short nap, by the setting-down on the landing-place outside, as from the shoulders of a porter, of some giant load, which seemed to shake the house, and made the little physic bottles on the mantel-shelf ring again.
1	It was no female head that was thrust in at the partially-opened door, but the long black locks and red face of Mr. Stiggins.
1	Only friend and companion of my slighted childhood!
1	You don't suspect any harm?"
1	Here, against a hoarding of decaying timber, he is brought to bay and tumbles down, lying gasping at his pursuer, who stands and gasps at him until the woman comes up.
1	Mr. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight o'clock in the parlor behind the shop, while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of bread and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises.
1	If I have been a little overpowered by your news, Louisa, and have ever had any lingering thought that Mr Dombey was inclined to be particular towards me, surely you will not condemn me.’ ‘She is going to say,’ said Mrs Chick, addressing herself to the whole of the furniture, in a comprehensive glance of resignation and appeal, ‘She is going to say--I know it--that I have encouraged her!’ ‘I don’t wish to exchange reproaches, dear Louisa,’ sobbed Miss Tox.
1	These losses are much to be deplored, sir, but we must look ‘em in the face.’ ‘If the money I have sacrificed had been all my own, Mr Rugg,’ sighed Mr Clennam, ‘I should have cared far less.’ ‘Indeed, sir?’ said Mr Rugg, rubbing his hands with a cheerful air.
1	‘Your friend, sir,’ said he, ‘is--ha--is a little impatient; and, in his impatience, is not perhaps fully sensible of what he owes to--hum--to--but we will waive that, we will waive that.
1	‘It was of no use trying reason then, with that vehement panting creature (Heaven knows what her mother’s story must have been); so I quietly told her that she should not go at that late hour of night, and I gave her my hand and took her to her room, and locked the house doors.
1	Upon your solemn word and honour.’ The old man shook his head.
1	‘This man had a commission in the army--a commission, purchased with my money, and his sister’s misery!
1	And still, for all this, and though there is a sharp heartache in all this, the vanity and caprice of youth sustain that handsome figure of Miss Landless in the background of his mind.
1	Sometimes, for example, when we passed a butcher’s shop, I would say: ‘Now suppose, my pet, that we were married, and you were going to buy a shoulder of mutton for dinner, would you know how to buy it?’ My pretty little Dora’s face would fall, and she would make her mouth into a bud again, as if she would very much prefer to shut mine with a kiss.
1	Towards the afternoon, her grandfather complained bitterly of hunger.
1	A lonely brother, many thousands of miles away, writing, on paper blotted with tears, that her words had too soon come true, and that all the treasures in the world would be cheaply bartered for a sight of her dear face?
1	Responding to the sentiments, by being very gracious to Mrs Lammle, she gave that lady the means of so improving her opportunity, as that the captivation became reciprocal, though always wearing an appearance of greater sobriety on Bella’s part than on the enthusiastic Sophronia’s.
1	I was so ashamed of my folly that I did not like to confess it even to Ada, and that made me more uncomfortable still.
1	As I sat by Baby’s crib, on the night before the election, Baby was very uneasy in her sleep.’ The Analytical chemist, who is gloomily looking on, has diabolical impulses to suggest ‘Wind’ and throw up his situation; but represses them.
1	She began to think, too, that Sir Mulberry was not quite so agreeable a creature as she had at first supposed him; for, although a skilful flatterer is a most delightful companion if you can keep him all to yourself, his taste becomes very doubtful when he takes to complimenting other people.
1	Sometimes they stagger as if they were drunk, and sometimes are forced to lean against the fence, they’re so bad:—but they clear off in course of time.’ As I walked among these solitary cells, and looked at the faces of the men within them, I tried to picture to myself the thoughts and feelings natural to their condition.
1	You can buy wine here.
1	A proscribed fugitive, with a price upon his head; a fester and a wound upon the noble character of the Coketown operative!
1	In his tracking out of the claim to its complete establishment, Mr Pancks had shown a sagacity that nothing could baffle, and a patience and secrecy that nothing could tire.
1	Which way are you walking, my love?’ ‘Towards the city,’ replied Kate.
1	Between the Mussulman and the Pharisee, commend me to the first!'
1	He will be worn out soon, I expect.
1	And then to look at him, handsomely clothed in his fur and broadcloths, rich, free, numerously served and attended, his eyes roving far away among the glories of the landscape, no miserable screen before them to darken his sight and cast its shadow on him, was enough.
1	It was a sight to behold Tim Linkinwater slowly bring out a massive ledger and day-book, and, after turning them over and over, and affectionately dusting their backs and sides, open the leaves here and there, and cast his eyes, half mournfully, half proudly, upon the fair and unblotted entries.
1	In the heart of its radiance sat a beautiful woman--Edith.
1	They listened, and it struck three.
1	Yes, I chanced to be passing at the time.
1	And if I had, perhaps you would feel that I was a better companion to you in speaking about him, than I may seem now.’ ‘My dearest sister!
1	Other people have been similarly buried in worse prisons, before now.” “But never by me, Citizen Defarge.” Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer, and walked on in a steady and set silence.
1	My young family are not frivolous; they expend the entire amount of their allowance in subscriptions, under my direction; and they have attended as many public meetings and listened to as many lectures, orations, and discussions as generally fall to the lot of few grown people.
1	His wife had died in the house in which he still lived, and he had long since lost sight of any earthly cares or hopes beyond it.
1	Why should I be frightened!

1	‘Well?’ said Nicholas, advancing towards him on tiptoe.
1	The head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tellson's establishment was put through the door, and the word was given: “Porter wanted!” “Hooray, father!
1	He sank into the chair, and brooded over the embers, and shed tears.
1	Hows’ever, sir, being what I am, I merely scorn such expressions.
1	A twilight calm of happiness then succeeding to their radiant noon, they remained at peace, until a strange voice in the room startled them both.
1	Ask another.” “Is that confidence to be imparted to me soon?” “Waive that, a moment,” said Mr. Jaggers, “and ask another.” I looked about me, but there appeared to be now no possible escape from the inquiry, “Have-I--anything to receive, sir?” On that, Mr. Jaggers said, triumphantly, “I thought we should come to it!” and called to Wemmick to give him that piece of paper.
1	The Prince’s nails do more for me in private families of the genteel sort, than all my talents put together.
1	To be sure Kit looked out of his window very early that morning to see which way the clouds were flying, and to be sure Barbara would have been at hers too, if she had not sat up so late over-night, starching and ironing small pieces of muslin, and crimping them into frills, and sewing them on to other pieces to form magnificent wholes for next day’s wear.
1	His glasses were in his hand, and he had just looked round; surprised at first, no doubt, by her step upon the stairs, not expecting her until night; surprised again, by seeing Arthur Clennam in her company.
1	In this way it had come about that Charley Hexam had risen in the jumble, taught in the jumble, and been received from the jumble into a better school.
1	But he restrained himself again- -he did not pulverise him.
1	Unfortunately the morning was drizzly, and an angel could not have concealed the fact that Barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window, like some weak giant of a Sweep.
1	And I believe my brother was speaking on the subject when we--not very decently--interrupted him.’ ‘I think, Clara,’ said Mr. Murdstone, in a low grave voice, ‘that there may be better and more dispassionate judges of such a question than you.’ ‘Edward,’ replied my mother, timidly, ‘you are a far better judge of all questions than I pretend to be.
1	Mr. Pickwick, pray don’t say so,’ cried Emily and Arabella, both at once.
1	There is a principle of opposition in Mrs Dombey that must be eradicated; that must be overcome: Mrs Dombey does not appear to understand,’ said Mr Dombey, forcibly, ‘that the idea of opposition to Me is monstrous and absurd.’ ‘We, in the City, know you better,’ replied Carker, with a smile from ear to ear.
1	I was so lonely and so blank without her, and it was so desolate to be going home with no hope of seeing her there, that I could get no comfort for a little while as I walked up and down in a dim corner sobbing and crying.
1	Give me grown-ups.’ It was difficult to guess the age of this strange creature, for her poor figure furnished no clue to it, and her face was at once so young and so old.
1	My dear ladies--you may bind me hand and leg, or lock me up in a closet, if you like.
1	I repeated, pinching her cheek.
1	I really thought she was, she had been so short with me; but I was quite mistaken: for she laid aside her work (which was a stocking of her own), and opening her arms wide, took my curly head within them, and gave it a good squeeze.
1	‘I have nothing to complain of.
1	Now you look as if you’d never seen Little Bethel in all your life, as I hope you never will again; and here’s the baby; and little Jacob, you get atop of my back and catch hold of me tight round the neck, and whenever a Little Bethel parson calls you a precious lamb or says your brother’s one, you tell him it’s the truest things he’s said for a twelvemonth, and that if he’d got a little more of the lamb himself, and less of the mint-sauce--not being quite so sharp and sour over it--I should like him all the better.
1	He could have gone with us at that time of the year very well, but he was in the full novelty of his new position and was making most energetic attempts to unravel the mysteries of the fatal suit.
1	I insist upon knowing.’ The fat boy looked cautiously round, and having concluded his survey, shouted in the old lady’s ear-- ‘Miss Rachael.’ ‘What!’ said the old lady, in a shrill tone.
1	A new race of intimate friends has sprung up at Veneering’s since he went into Parliament for the public good, to whom Mrs Veneering is very attentive.
1	A repetition of such allusions would make it necessary for me to request to hear, without a mistake, before breakfast-time to-morrow morning, from Verbum personale down to simillimia cygno.’ ‘I didn’t mean, Ma’am--’ began little Paul.
1	The mother rose on being so addressed and fell upon the woman's neck.
1	‘Not at all, I don’t wish it, we needn’t stand upon that footing, Miss Floy being a permanency, Master Paul a temporary.’ Spitfire made use of none but comma pauses; shooting out whatever she had to say in one sentence, and in one breath, if possible.
1	He would repeat that childish question, ‘What is money?’ and ponder on it, and think about it, and reason with himself, more or less connectedly, for a good answer; as if it had never been proposed to him until that moment.
1	ha!’ Mr. Lowten concluded with a loud laugh, half in jocularity, and half in derision, which was prematurely cut short by the sound of Perker’s footsteps on the stairs, at the first approach of which, he vaulted on his stool with an agility most remarkable, and wrote intensely.
1	What they may become, when that fades away, is a problem that neither you nor I can solve.

1	Mr. Peggotty was so proud and overjoyed to see us, that he did not know what to say or do, but kept over and over again shaking hands with me, and then with Steerforth, and then with me, and then ruffling his shaggy hair all over his head, and laughing with such glee and triumph, that it was a treat to see him.
1	Upon these instructions Nicholas made the pen; when he gave it to Miss Squeers, Miss Squeers dropped it; and when he stooped to pick it up, Miss Squeers stooped also, and they knocked their heads together; whereat five-and-twenty little boys laughed aloud: being positively for the first and only time that half-year.
1	Train up a fig-tree in the way it should go, and when you are old sit under the shade on it.
1	Half savage as the man showed, with no covering on his matted head, with his brown arms bare to between the elbow and the shoulder, with the loose knot of a looser kerchief lying low on his bare breast in a wilderness of beard and whisker, with such dress as he wore seeming to be made out of the mud that begrimed his boat, still there was a business-like usage in his steady gaze.
1	And so you shall, you shall, my darling.--Eh, Miss Dorrit?’ He had suddenly checked himself.
1	A smile irradiated his face as she bent to kiss him.
1	‘When Prince Bladud had been shut up in the lofty turret for the greater part of a year, with no better prospect before his bodily eyes than a stone wall, or before his mental vision than prolonged imprisonment, he naturally began to ruminate on a plan of escape, which, after months of preparation, he managed to accomplish; considerately leaving his dinner- knife in the heart of his jailer, lest the poor fellow (who had a family) should be considered privy to his flight, and punished accordingly by the infuriated king.
1	I'd be more thankful than I am aready if it wos any ways possible for an unfortnet to be it."
1	‘You’ve seen something of life.’ ‘I rather think I have!’ replied the boy.
1	‘Everything, my dear sir.’ ‘Nothing, my dear sir,’ retorted the manager, with evident impatience.
1	‘This is the last good-bye upon the list, for Mother and I have just said it to Mr Clennam here, and he only waits to say it to Pet.
1	Mr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling repair to the rag and bottle shop, where they find Krook still sleeping like one o'clock, that is to say, breathing stertorously with his chin upon his breast and quite insensible to any external sounds or even to gentle shaking.
1	Has Mr. Tulkinghorn any idea of this himself?
1	‘Well, Mr. Nickleby,’ said Squeers, insinuating himself into the warmest corner, ‘you did very right to catch hold of them horses.
1	It’s a sort of a general kind of expression, sir,’ said Mrs Plornish.
1	'I shall be glad to have him away from my eyes, and to know that the worst is over.
1	When they were left alone together--which was not until noon, for Mr Boffin sat long in his easy-chair, by turns jogging up and down the breakfast-room, clenching his fist and muttering--Bella, in consternation, asked her what had happened, what was wrong?
1	‘Do nothing of the kind,’ said Jingle.
1	‘See that the money is right, Madeline,’ said the father.

1	‘Smoke away, you dog,’ said Quilp, turning to the boy; ‘fill your pipe again and smoke it fast, down to the last whiff, or I’ll put the sealing-waxed end of it in the fire and rub it red hot upon your tongue.’ Luckily the boy was case-hardened, and would have smoked a small lime-kiln if anybody had treated him with it.
1	But I don’t allow anybody to ride over that turf.
1	I am delighted to see you.
1	It’s all show with Minnie, about Martha.

1	These were the ceremonies with which he received the collegians.
1	But her mother was a fine corrective at the other end of the table; to whom her father, in the innocence of his good-fellowship, at intervals appealed with: ‘My dear, I am afraid you are not enjoying yourself?’ ‘Why so, R. W.?’ she would sonorously reply.
1	He would begin by touching her hand.
1	infernal cunning.’ ‘Infernal cunning,’ echoed two voices.
1	‘Row!’ replied the cabman, ‘what did he want my number for?’ ‘I didn’t want your number,’ said the astonished Mr. Pickwick.
1	Immediately on the old lady’s entering the shop, Mr. Benjamin Allen and Mr. Bob Sawyer, who had been putting the spirits-and-water out of sight, and upsetting nauseous drugs to take off the smell of the tobacco smoke, issued hastily forth in a transport of pleasure and affection.
1	No; I find I can’t!’ He then stood regarding the prisoner sternly, though with a swelling humour in his eyes that looked like pity.
1	That you’ll feel convinced I bear no malice to any living creature-least of all to Lieutenant Walters himself--and that you’ll casually remark that I have gone out for a walk, or probably to see what o’clock it is by the Royal Exchange.
1	‘In a last word of reference to my sister, sir (we are twin children), you ought to know, to her honour, that nothing in our misery ever subdued her, though it often cowed me.

1	‘It is often said that his manners are a true gentleman’s, and quite a study.
1	It was a will; that’s what it was.’ ‘Of what nature, whose will, when dated, how benefiting her, to what extent?’ asked Ralph hurriedly.
1	Drop it altogether.” “Yes, Jerry.” “Yes, Jerry,” repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea.
1	The parrot, swinging in the gilded hoop within her gaudy cage, attempted in vain to attract notice, for Carker was too observant of his visitor to heed her; and the visitor, abstracted in meditation, looked fixedly, not to say sullenly, over his stiff neckcloth, without raising his eyes from the table-cloth.
1	‘I do not recall all this to widen the breach between yourself and Mr Dombey, Madam--Heaven forbid!
1	Stout men with napless hats on, look out of the bedroom windows, and cut jokes with friends in the street.
1	Mr Wegg, having read on by rote and attached as few ideas as possible to the text, came out of the encounter fresh; but, Mr Boffin, who had soon laid down his unfinished pipe, and had ever since sat intently staring with his eyes and mind at the confounding enormities of the Romans, was so severely punished that he could hardly wish his literary friend Good-night, and articulate ‘Tomorrow.’ ‘Commodious,’ gasped Mr Boffin, staring at the moon, after letting Wegg out at the gate and fastening it: ‘Commodious fights in that wild-beast-show, seven hundred and thirty-five times, in one character only!
1	As to his voice, this misfortune has took it away.
1	"Rick," said my guardian, after hearing him attentively, "we can retreat with honour, and we will.
1	Little recked the Collegians who were laughing in their rooms over his late address in the Lodge, what a serious picture they had in their obscure gallery of the Marshalsea that Sunday night.
1	As Nell approached the awful door, it turned slowly upon its hinges with a creaking noise, and, forth from the solemn grove beyond, came a long file of young ladies, two and two, all with open books in their hands, and some with parasols likewise.
1	In it was a good-natured-looking old woman with a dropsy, or an asthma, or perhaps both.
1	‘I’m afeerd,’ replied Mr. Weller, in a rapture of winks--‘I’m afeerd I took vun or two on ‘em, Sammy; he wos a-flyin’ out o’ the arm-cheer all the way.’ Here the old gentleman shook his head from side to side, and was seized with a hoarse internal rumbling, accompanied with a violent swelling of the countenance, and a sudden increase in the breadth of all his features; symptoms which alarmed his son not a little.
1	'A many boys,' observed Mr. Bumble, shaking his head, despondingly.
1	Most men have seen my portrait at the cigar shop round the corner.
1	‘Assure you ‘pon my soul ‘tis the case.
1	Joe admits it.’ ‘And that allusion,’ pursued Cleopatra, ‘would involve one of the most--if not positively the most--touching, and thrilling, and sacred emotions of which our sadly-fallen nature is susceptible, I conceive.’ The Major laid his hand upon his lips, and wafted a kiss to Cleopatra, as if to identify the emotion in question.
1	My hat (which had served me for a night-cap, too) was so crushed and bent, that no old battered handleless saucepan on a dunghill need have been ashamed to vie with it.
1	'Wot did she take it into her head to go out to-night for, do you think?'
1	Oh, my eyes and limbs, bring the jacket out!’ With that he took his trembling hands, which were like the claws of a great bird, out of my hair; and put on a pair of spectacles, not at all ornamental to his inflamed eyes.
1	So, taking up his hat, and leaving poor Smike to arrange and rearrange the room with as much delight as if it had been the costliest palace, he betook himself to the streets, and mingled with the crowd which thronged them.
1	I discharge you.’ ‘So that I go,’ remarked the Secretary, waving the point aside with his hand, ‘it is all one to me.’ ‘Is it?’ said Mr Boffin.
1	Some of it now lay in a drawer near her, which was not quite closed.
1	‘So do I,’ said Mr. Snawley, thinking it as well to back his new friend occasionally.
1	You are prepared, and I hold out no expectations which circumstances might fail to justify.
1	Gentlemen, if I could express the pleasure it gives me to see three such men in a happy unity of feeling and concord of sentiment, I think you would hardly believe me.
1	Nevertheless, bad man, as you have boldly remarked upon it, and as it has occasioned me great anguish:’ Mrs Skewton touched her left side with her fan: ‘I will not shrink from my duty.’ The Major, under cover of the dimness, swelled, and swelled, and rolled his purple face about, and winked his lobster eye, until he fell into a fit of wheezing, which obliged him to rise and take a turn or two about the room, before his fair friend could proceed.
1	Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, I did endeavour to pave the way a little towards these unpleasant disclosures yesterday by saying that very strange things happened even in high families sometimes.
1	The waking Flintwinch had his full front face presented to his wife; the sleeping Flintwinch was in profile.

1	Rumour, busy overmuch, however, will not go down into Lincolnshire.
1	Consequently, instead of putting on his coat and waistcoat with anything like the impetuosity that could alone have kept pace with Walter’s mood, he declined to invest himself with those garments at all at present; and informed Walter that on such a serious matter, he must be allowed to ‘bite his nails a bit’.
1	Away goes Spyers; on goes Chickweed; round turns the people; everybody roars out, "Thieves!"
1	There they was, a-passin’ resolutions, and wotin’ supplies, and all sorts o’ games.
1	She answered for herself directly.
1	Well!--That’s all we’ve got,’ said my aunt; with whom it was an idiosyncrasy, as it is with some horses, to stop very short when she appeared to be in a fair way of going on for a long while.
1	Consequently, it is to be expected that he takes a natural interest in this poor creature.
1	While he was gone, I sat down on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister, feeling pretty sure that the man would not be there.
1	It’s true!’ ‘Try the left hand,’ said Mr Boffin, holding it out in a stolid manner; ‘it’s the least used.’ ‘You have been wonderfully good and kind to me,’ said Bella, ‘and I kiss it for that.
1	A burst of grief, and a violent struggle, such as I hope I may never have to witness again, succeeded.
1	He knew nobody round about, and nobody knew him, although he enjoyed the reputation of being immensely rich.
1	‘Nay, Amy, Amy,’ said Mr Dorrit.
1	Vast lots of waste-paper among the rest.
1	I addressed myself to a man behind the counter, who was weighing some rice for a young woman; but the latter, taking the inquiry to herself, turned round quickly.
1	‘No, she is not here at present,’ returned the Notary.
1	‘Where are we to go to?’ screamed the agitated Pickwickians.
1	‘What a rare article milk is, to be sure, in London!’ said Mr. Squeers, with a sigh.
1	Well, he always walks to his office with a wery handsome gold watch-chain hanging out, about a foot and a quarter, and a gold watch in his fob pocket as was worth--I’m afraid to say how much, but as much as a watch can be--a large, heavy, round manufacter, as stout for a watch, as he was for a man, and with a big face in proportion.
1	Sam’s two hundred pounds stood transferred to his name, and Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, having been paid his commission, dropped the money carelessly into his coat pocket, and lounged back to his office.
1	A weak reason presented itself.
1	He came up to me in the hall, took both my hands, pressed them earnestly, and opened his mouth twice.
1	‘Have blows passed?’ ‘ONE blow has,’ was the panting reply.
1	‘Then, that’s the wery best reason wy you should alvays have somebody by you as understands you, to keep you up and make you comfortable.
1	This lamp the money-lender had drawn so close to him, that there was only room between it and himself for the book over which he bent; and as he sat, with his elbows on the desk, and his sharp cheek-bones resting on his hands, it only served to bring out his ugly features in strong relief, together with the little table at which he sat, and to shroud all the rest of the chamber in a deep sullen gloom.
1	"She had a little water, miss, and Jenny fetched her some bread and tea.
1	The ship had struck once, the same boatman hoarsely said in my ear, and then lifted in and struck again.
1	‘Look here, dear old boy.
1	I assure you it’ll be a satisfaction to me to come back to-morrow, or to come back fifty times.’ Mr Toots, with these words, shook the Captain’s hand; and disguising such traces of his agitation as could be disguised on so short a notice, before the Chicken’s penetrating glance, rejoined that eminent gentleman in the shop.
1	It was wrong in me to take it?
1	If you do, you are wrong.
1	Thus they approached the chapel, a neat whitewashed edifice, recently engaged by the Reverend Melchisedech Howler, who had consented, on very urgent solicitation, to give the world another two years of existence, but had informed his followers that, then, it must positively go.

1	Bounderby,’ said Jem, turning with a smile to Louisa, ‘is a noble animal in a comparatively natural state, quite free from the harness in which a conventional hack like myself works.’ ‘You respect Mr. Bounderby very much,’ she quietly returned.
1	‘I have come through a good deal, and my intentions is now as straightfor’ard, Miss, as a cove’s--’ ‘I must get you to break yourself of that word, Robin, if you please,’ interposed Miss Tox, politely.
1	The fiction that it was not Mr Meagles who had stood in the way, but that it was the Family greatness, and that the Family greatness had made a concession, and there was now a soothing unanimity, pervaded the affair, though it was never openly expressed.
1	Her enemy he was, and she has often, often, often wished him dead.

1	Those of Mr and Mrs Quilp, however, were an exception to the general rule; the remarks which they occasioned being limited to a long soliloquy on the part of the gentleman, with perhaps a few deprecatory observations from the lady, not extending beyond a trembling monosyllable uttered at long intervals, and in a very submissive and humble tone.
1	I was sorry to hear, when I came in, that YOU were not.’ ‘A mere nothing.
1	Between the immeasurable track of space beyond the little wound that has thrown the one into the fixed sleep which jolts so heavily over the stones of the streets, and the narrow track of blood which keeps the other in the watchful state expressed in every hair of his head!

1	“You see, too,” said the Doctor, tremulously, “it is such an old companion.” “I would not keep it,” said Mr. Lorry, shaking his head; for he gained in firmness as he saw the Doctor disquieted.
1	She was in a front row, by the side of a man whom he had never seen since his arrival at the Barrier, but whom he directly remembered as Defarge.
1	Now,’ said Mr Pancks, closing upon his late Proprietor again, from whom he had withdrawn a little for the better display of him to the Yard; ‘as I am not accustomed to speak in public, and as I have made a rather lengthy speech, all circumstances considered, I shall bring my observations to a close by requesting you to get out of this.’ The Last of the Patriarchs had been so seized by assault, and required so much room to catch an idea in, an so much more room to turn it in, that he had not a word to offer in reply.
1	Stephen looked at her, saw how pale she was, noted the disorder of her hair, and the red marks of fingers on her forehead, and felt assured that his senses of sight and hearing had been awake.
1	This brings up a confabulation regarding the certain fair young person; when Noddy he gives it as his opinion that she is a deary creetur.
1	‘We want to know,’ said the little man solemnly; ‘and we ask the question of you, in order that we may not awaken apprehensions inside-- we want to know who you’ve got in this house at present?’ ‘Who there is in the house!’ said Sam, in whose mind the inmates were always represented by that particular article of their costume, which came under his immediate superintendence.

1	The school at which young Charley Hexam had first learned from a book--the streets being, for pupils of his degree, the great Preparatory Establishment in which very much that is never unlearned is learned without and before book--was a miserable loft in an unsavoury yard.
1	Did you give him no money on account of anybody, Sir?’ asked Mr Garland, with great anxiety.
1	The excellent and thoughtful old system, hallowed by long prescription, which has usually picked out from the rest of mankind the most dreary and uncomfortable people that could possibly be laid hold of, to act as instructors of youth, finger-posts to the virtues, matrons, monitors, attendants on sick beds, and the like, had established Mrs Wickam in very good business as a nurse, and had led to her serious qualities being particularly commended by an admiring and numerous connexion.
1	It is not impossible that his modest penitence may have even gone the length of sometimes severely reproving him for that he ever took the liberty of making so exalted a character his wife.
1	There was a man come into the shop this very day, and says, “I want a so-and-so,” he says--some hard name or another.
1	I knew a man who was hung in Jamaica for murdering his master.
1	That’s the first thing you have done.
1	I laid my trembling hand upon the hand he put before his face.
1	Perhaps, the having to carry his case with her, and therefore to present it in its brightest aspect, has roused his spirits.
1	But I carried away with me a most pleasant impression of the town and its inhabitants, and have preserved it to this hour.
1	The night-coach by which Susan was to go, was on the point of departure.
1	And that fellow with her, eh?
1	‘By my old one, if you like.’ ‘Why then, harkye, Mr. Brooker,’ said Ralph, in his harshest accents, ‘and don’t expect to draw another speech from me.
1	The Very Reverend the Dean refers to that?
1	Punctual to the time, at the half-hour's end the carriage came rumbling under the gateway, and they took me down, warmed, refreshed, comforted by kindness, and safe (I assured them) not to faint any more.
1	To encourage and animate him, administer to his wants, support and cheer him to the utmost of his power, was now his constant and unceasing occupation.
1	“Dressed like you, you know, only with a hat,” I explained, trembling; “and--and”--I was very anxious to put this delicately--“and with--the same reason for wanting to borrow a file.
1	"Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened.
1	‘This here, Sir,’ rejoined Sam.
1	'Knock at the next door,' cried Mr. Losberne, taking Oliver's arm in his.
1	Your governor’s the man to advance money.’ ‘Mr Dombey!’ faltered Walter.
1	When Edward and Fanny remained whispering together across it, and when Mr Dorrit remained eating figs and reading a French newspaper, Uncle suddenly fixed the attention of all three by rising out of his chair, striking his hand upon the table, and saying, ‘Brother!
1	‘Nor Brown, I s’pose?’ said Sam.
1	The list was read, in the vaulted chamber where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his arrival.
1	It lies under that fellow’s feet, and he treads upon it and exults above it.’ ‘He does not!’ said Lizzie.
1	In London itself, though in the old rustic road towards a suburb of note where in the days of William Shakespeare, author and stage-player, there were Royal hunting-seats--howbeit no sport is left there now but for hunters of men--Bleeding Heart Yard was to be found; a place much changed in feature and in fortune, yet with some relish of ancient greatness about it.
1	Then he wistfully asks, with his hand on his brother's, "Would you mind mentioning that, brother, to your wife and family?"
1	Twenty miles further on, two of the front outside passengers, wisely availing themselves of their arrival at one of the best inns in England, turned in, for the night, at the George at Grantham.
1	Mrs Clennam, her chin resting on her hand, followed him with attentive and darkly distrustful eyes; and Affery stood looking at her as if she were spell-bound.
1	‘The girl has strong affections, and brought up as she has been, may, at her age, be easily influenced and persuaded.
1	"I need not reply, Sir Leicester, that the two places are very different; but for the purposes of this case, I think a parallel may be justly drawn between them."
1	She never did marry him, but she gave birth to a child of which he was the father."
1	Indeed, it’s very kind of you, but I am afraid I DON’T talk.’ ‘Let us make a beginning,’ said the insinuating Mrs Lammle, with her best smile.
1	She thought what a good father he would be.
1	Sapsea,” he answered, looking down, “your penetration is so acute, your glance into the souls of your fellow men is so penetrating, that if I was hardly enough to deny that my name is Poker, what would it avail me?” I don’t know that I had quite exactly made out to a fraction that his name _was_ Poker, but I daresay I had been pretty near doing it.
1	If I had never known him out of Little Britain, and had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at the Castle, I might have doubted him; not so for a moment, knowing him as I did.
1	what does it all mean?’ Here the little boy on the top of the trunk gave a violent sneeze.
1	You see what an effect yours has had upon me already.’ ‘Oh, that’s very pretty,’ replied the young lady, tossing her head, ‘but--’ ‘Yes, I know it’s very pretty,’ said the young man, looking with an air of admiration in the barmaid’s face; ‘I said so, you know, just this moment.
1	"You were so good as to imply, on that occasion--" "Excuse me, miss," said Mr. Guppy, "but we had better not travel out of the record into implication.
1	It was nothing to her that Plornish had a habit of leaning against it as he smoked his pipe after work, when his hat blotted out the pigeon-house and all the pigeons, when his back swallowed up the dwelling, when his hands in his pockets uprooted the blooming garden and laid waste the adjacent country.
1	It may not be so written in the Gospel according to Podsnappery; you may not ‘find these words’ for the text of a sermon, in the Returns of the Board of Trade; but they have been the truth since the foundations of the universe were laid, and they will be the truth until the foundations of the universe are shaken by the Builder.
1	‘What I mean is, that however this comes to be the regular way of our government, it is its regular way.
1	His eyes became bright, his grey hair rose on his head, markings of purpose on his brow and face which had faded from them for five-and-twenty years, started out again, and there was an energy in his hand that made its action nervous once more.
1	He was conscious of a torrent of people rushing quickly by--looking up, could discern the cabriolet whirled along the foot-pavement with frightful rapidity--then heard a loud cry, the smashing of some heavy body, and the breaking of glass--and then the crowd closed in in the distance, and he could see or hear no more.
1	‘The house,’ thought Clennam, as he crossed to the door, ‘is as little changed as my mother’s, and looks almost as gloomy.
1	But Mr. Jasper’s door being closed, and presenting on a slip of paper the word ‘Cathedral,’ the fact of its being service-time was borne into the mind of Mr. Grewgious.
1	‘Pray hold your tongue.’ ‘I ain’t a-goin’ to say nothin’ on that ‘ere pint, sir,’ replied Sam, ‘but merely this here.
1	Now, in you we can repose the strictest confidence; in you we have seen--or at least I have seen, and that’s the same thing, for there’s no difference between me and my brother Ned, except that he is the finest creature that ever lived, and that there is not, and never will be, anybody like him in all the world--in you we have seen domestic virtues and affections, and delicacy of feeling, which exactly qualify you for such an office.
1	‘We must be going with the rest,’ observed Mrs Lammle, rising with a show of unwillingness, amidst a general dispersal.
1	‘Any room, sir?’ cries the new passenger to the coachman.
1	‘You are right, Sam.’ ‘And if I might adwise, Sir,’ added Mr. Weller, ‘I’d just have a good night’s rest arterwards, and not begin inquiring arter this here deep ‘un till the mornin’.
1	As Ada said nothing, but looked at me, I said it must be very gratifying.
1	‘Well, the place will suit me, will it?’ ‘Yes,’ said Dick.
1	I think of poor dear Baby this morning.’ ‘So do I.
1	‘Most wotes carries the day!’ said one of the vixenish ladies at length.
1	And I’ll ask,’ said Mr. Grewgious, dropping his voice, and speaking with a twinkling eye, as if inspired with a bright thought: ‘I’ll ask Bazzard.
1	Mr. Cruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron pot-lid by him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher, in case he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace.
1	This sparkling sally is to the effect that although he always knew she was the best-groomed woman in the stud, he had no idea she was a bolter.
1	'He called my mother names,' replied Oliver.
1	There is a curtain more dust-coloured than red, which divides it, and the part behind the curtain makes the private sitting-room.
1	‘Is there no other road?
1	Do the withe thing and the kind thing too, and make the betht of uth; not the wurtht!’ ‘And I never thought before,’ said Mr. Sleary, putting his head in at the door again to say it, ‘that I wath tho muth of a Cackler!’ IT is a dangerous thing to see anything in the sphere of a vain blusterer, before the vain blusterer sees it himself.
1	The mother must have changed--she looked as old as me, and full as wrinkled through her paint--but she was handsome.

1	‘What was it?’ said the schoolmaster, tenderly.
1	Now, I’ll go back to myself.’ ‘Dear Fanny, let me say first, that I would far rather we worked for a scanty living again than I would see you rich and married to Mr Sparkler.’ ‘_Let_ you say, my dear?’ retorted Fanny.
1	Now my opinion is, that it came into circulation principally on account of her sometimes saying, at the school, that if she was a lady she would like to do so-and-so for her uncle--don’t you see?--and buy him such-and-such fine things.’ ‘I assure you, Mr. Omer, she has said so to me,’ I returned eagerly, ‘when we were both children.’ Mr. Omer nodded his head and rubbed his chin.
1	Now I won't allude to conspiring to extort money or anything of that sort, because we are men and women of the world here, and our object is to make things pleasant.
1	It even expressed a kind of faint surprise, and not a disagreeable surprise, at sight of her.
1	"Pray is your lodger within?"
1	They writes fifty hands; they're not like sneaking you, as writes but one.
1	‘Don’t go away, Mary,’ said the black-eyed man.
1	'A young one,' replied Fagin.
1	He had opened, not only the glass window, but the lattice blind outside it, and he had closed both again, and he shivered through his frame.
1	what is this I hear about another disappearance?’ ‘As it is you who have heard it,’ returns Lightwood, ‘perhaps you’ll tell us.’ ‘Monster, away!’ retorts Lady Tippins.
1	It’ll pay better, I assure you,’ said Fledgeby, bestowing an inveigling twinkle or two upon the dressmaker.
1	He made his offer to her.
1	Didn’t I tell you, you dearest baby, that Edmund can’t be trusted by himself?
1	I am afraid we are keeping you up very late, ma’am.’ ‘Late!’ cried Mrs. Nickleby, with a sharp thin laugh, and one little cough at the end, like a note of admiration expressed.
1	Strangers, modest enough elsewhere, started up at dinners in Coketown, and boasted, in quite a rampant way, of Bounderby.
1	That was in the note.’ ‘Nothing more,’ said the child.
1	Mr. T. can form no adequate idea of the change in Mr. Micawber’s conduct, of his wildness, of his violence.
1	He was now alternately putting his hands into his pockets as if he were going to keep them there a long time, and taking them out again and vehemently rubbing them all over his head.
1	You would not dissuade me, Kate; now would you?’ ‘You may grow rich, you know,’ said Kate.
1	Mr Inspector achieved the smuggling of herself and John into this queer room, called Cosy in an inscription on the door, by entering in the narrow passage first in order, and suddenly turning round upon them with extended arms, as if they had been two sheep.
1	‘That’s his impudence--that’s his confounded impudence,’ said Captain Boldwig.
1	‘And now,’ said Daniel, looking at his watch, ‘as time and tide wait for no man, my trusty partner, and as I am ready for starting, bag and baggage, at the gate below, let me say a last word.
1	He dreams of lying there, asleep, and yet counting his companion’s footsteps as he walks to and fro.
1	Observing all this in the first comprehensive glance with which a stranger surveys a place that is new to him, Nicholas sat himself down in the box next to the noisy party, with his back towards them, and postponing his order for a pint of claret until such time as the waiter and one of the elderly gentlemen should have settled a disputed question relative to the price of an item in the bill of fare, took up a newspaper and began to read.
1	‘Would they make much difference?’ repeated his mistress.
1	‘They’re beginning upstairs,’ said the stranger--‘hear the company-- fiddles tuning--now the harp--there they go.’ The various sounds which found their way downstairs announced the commencement of the first quadrille.
1	I say it IS vilely, grossly, wilfully untrue.
1	There’s quite a view from it.’ ‘And you are happily married at last, my dear Traddles!’ said I.
1	As "Three high-backed chairs, a table and cover, long-necked bottle (containing wine), one flask, one Spanish female's costume, three-quarter face portrait of Miss Jogg the model, and a suit of armour containing Don Quixote."
1	At length, they touched a large iron hook, firmly driven into one of the beams.
1	Micawber being now on the eve of casting off the pecuniary shackles that have so long enthralled him,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘and of commencing a new career in a country where there is sufficient range for his abilities,--which, in my opinion, is exceedingly important; Mr. Micawber’s abilities peculiarly requiring space,--it seems to me that my family should signalize the occasion by coming forward.
1	‘It’s the only change he takes,’ said Mrs Chivery, shaking her head afresh.
1	A minute more, and this had roused me from my trance:--Steerforth had left his seat, and gone to her, and had put his arm laughingly about her, and had said, ‘Come, Rosa, for the future we will love each other very much!’ And she had struck him, and had thrown him off with the fury of a wild cat, and had burst out of the room.
1	They were a man and woman; or perhaps they would be better described as a male and female:  for the former was one of those long-limbed, knock-kneed, shambling, bony people, to whom it is difficult to assign any precise age,--looking as they do, when they are yet boys, like undergrown men, and when they are almost men, like overgrown boys.
1	But perennial youth is in her artificial flowers, and her list of lovers is full.
1	‘He is quite one of us.
1	He had no favourite ization that he knew of.
1	He was younger than me, but he'd got craft, and he'd got learning, and he overmatched me five hundred times told and no mercy.
1	‘It does not matter, Padrona.
1	Where have they taken him to!
1	‘Since then, I have consulted other branches of my family on the course which it is most expedient for Mr. Micawber to take--for I maintain that he must take some course, Master Copperfield,’ said Mrs. Micawber, argumentatively.
1	Something in the careless manner of this person, and in a certain lazily arrogant air with which he approached, holding possession of twice as much pavement as another would have claimed, instantly caught the boy’s attention.
1	The child, in a perfect agony, drew her grandfather aside, and implored him, even then, to come away.
1	‘You must not tell us what the soldier, or any other man, said, Sir,’ interposed the judge; ‘it’s not evidence.’ ‘Wery good, my Lord,’ replied Sam.
1	He held the letter out inquiringly; and Monseigneur looked at it, in the person of this plotting and indignant refugee; and Monseigneur looked at it in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee; and This, That, and The Other, all had something disparaging to say, in French or in English, concerning the Marquis who was not to be found.
1	‘You will tell your father, Sam, that if I can be of any assistance to him in his present situation, I shall be most willing and ready to lend him any aid in my power,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	They danced to the popular Revolution song, keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison.
1	"Cold and raw this morning, cold and raw!"
1	"I assure you, sir, it has given--me--pain--to learn from the housekeeper at Chesney Wold that a gentleman who was in your company in that part of the county, and who would appear to possess a cultivated taste for the fine arts, was likewise deterred by some such cause from examining the family pictures with that leisure, that attention, that care, which he might have desired to bestow upon them and which some of them might possibly have repaid."
1	Then what you have to do, is, to remain there until he wants you.” “Is that all, sir?” “That's all.
1	Mr Lammle, accustomed to be intrusted with the most delicate affairs.
1	We have been made quite uneasy by the poor accounts we have had of her state, lately, I do assure you.’ I felt ashamed to let him take my hand, but I did not know yet what else to do.
1	You wouldn’t have to worry no one, then, sir.
1	Because,’ added Mr. Pickwick, as he saw that Mr. Nupkins was about to offer a very indignant interruption, ‘because if he be, I know that person to be a--’ ‘Hush, hush,’ said Mr. Nupkins, closing the door.
1	Disregarding these sallies, which were uncommonly well received, as sallies at the expense of the best-dressed persons in a crowd usually are, Nicholas glanced carelessly round, and addressing the young gentleman, who had by this time picked up his slippers and thrust his feet into them, repeated his inquiries with a courteous air.
1	'Lord strike a blight upon it,' I says, wotever it was I went for, 'if it ain't for him!'
1	‘My dear,’ said Mr. Omer, ‘I don’t say it’s the case with you,’ winking at me, ‘but I say that half the women in Yarmouth--ah!
1	I haven’t stood by it!’ The door opened, and Agnes, gliding in, without a vestige of colour in her face, put her arm round his neck, and steadily said, ‘Papa, you are not well.
1	There was the little church, in the morning, with the green leaves fluttering at the windows:  the birds singing without:  and the sweet-smelling air stealing in at the low porch, and filling the homely building with its fragrance.
1	Fanny was so very much amused by the misgiving, that she took up her favourite fan (being then seated at her dressing-table with her armoury of cruel instruments about her, most of them reeking from the heart of Sparkler), and tapped her sister frequently on the nose with it, laughing all the time.
1	‘Shall Mr. Johnson begin, uncle?’ ‘I am ready to hear, if Mr. Johnson is ready to commence, my dear,’ said the collector, assuming the air of a profound critic.
1	Say something abusive to me!’ All the time, Mr Pancks was tearing at his tough hair in a most pitiless and cruel manner.
1	After peeping into several wine-shops, she stopped at the sign of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, not far from the National Palace, once (and twice) the Tuileries, where the aspect of things rather took her fancy.
1	Unpleasant brute!’ Relieved by this expression of opinion, albeit it was vented upon empty air, Miss La Creevy trotted on to Madame Mantalini’s; and being informed that the governing power was not yet out of bed, requested an interview with the second in command; whereupon Miss Knag appeared.
1	The Minor Canon’s Cathedral duties made these visits of his difficult to accomplish, and only to be compassed at intervals of many weeks.
1	Angels are not like me.
1	And they fired warning of him.
1	I have set myself against evil; not against good.
1	And as Walter was apprehensive that his voice might perhaps quaver a little, and that his countenance might not be quite as hopeful as he could wish it to be, if he told the old man himself, and saw the first effects of his communication on his wrinkled face, he resolved to avail himself of the services of that powerful mediator, Captain Cuttle.
1	"Besides, I wasn't proud of him."
1	‘Every day?’ ‘I think,’ said Little Dorrit, after hesitating, ‘that I have been here at least twice every day.’ He might have released the little light hand after fervently kissing it again; but that, with a very gentle lingering where it was, it seemed to court being retained.
1	I was lying on the sofa, with a book and a wine-glass, at about that time, when the door opened, and a gentleman in a stiff cravat, within a year or two on either side of thirty, entered, in his hat and gloves; walked up to the looking-glass; arranged his hair; took off his gloves; slowly produced a measure from the uttermost depths of his coat-pocket; and requested me, in a languid tone, to ‘unfix’ my straps.
1	I feel the present visit very much.
1	So, she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance than was originally provided for them.
1	His form of cheek, eye, and temple, and his colour, are repeated in her.
1	He looked round the room, and at the boot again, which was still lying on the floor; appeared thoughtful for a minute; and then said ‘Well, good arternoon.’ ‘Good afternoon, sir,’ said I: and that was the end of the interview.
1	Mrs Veneering is habitually disposed to be tearful, and has an extra disposition that way after her late excitement.
1	The atmosphere is otherwise stale and close.
1	‘Say me, if you like.
1	I had sadly broken sleep when I got to bed, through thinking of the strange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun, and of the guiltily coarse and common thing it was, to be on secret terms of conspiracy with convicts,--a feature in my low career that I had previously forgotten.
1	‘Very well, Mr. Copperfield,’ said Mr. Spenlow, ‘I must try my influence with my daughter.’ Miss Murdstone, by an expressive sound, a long drawn respiration, which was neither a sigh nor a moan, but was like both, gave it as her opinion that he should have done this at first.
1	It was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused, as the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air, and the rain commenced pouring violently down.
1	It is a longer walk to the next, but Jo, relieved of his first suspicions, sticks to the forms imposed upon him and does not look round.
1	I could trace out where every part of the old house had been, and where the brewery had been, and where the gates, and where the casks.
1	Good night.’ She held up her muffled fingers that he might touch them with his, according to their usual custom, and he stood over her wheeled chair to touch her face with his lips.
1	So, pursuing the one course of thought, he had the one relentless monster still before him.
1	He recoiled, but she laid her hand upon his arm.
1	I made Mrs Dombey acquainted, some time since, as I have already told you, with certain points of domestic deference and submission on which I felt it necessary to insist.
1	The old gentleman looked almost as rueful as Oliver when the key grated in the lock.
1	'This is a very extraordinary thing, Mrs. Maylie,' said the doctor, standing with his back to the door, as if to keep it shut.
1	Mr Feeder’s most romantic visions were fulfilled.
1	"I don't know who does," he returned.
1	My blood is up, but wholesomely up, when I think of it.
1	'They _called_ him Oliver,' replied the woman, feebly.
1	When you see Ned Cuttle bite his nails, Wal’r, then you may know that Ned Cuttle’s aground.’ Thereupon the Captain put his iron hook between his teeth, as if it were a hand; and with an air of wisdom and profundity that was the very concentration and sublimation of all philosophical reflection and grave inquiry, applied himself to the consideration of the subject in its various branches.
1	‘Even the lawyers’ preparations!’ ‘Yes, madam,’ replied Mr Dombey; ‘the deed of settlement, the professional gentlemen inform me, is now ready, and as I was mentioning to you, Edith has only to do us the favour to suggest her own time for its execution.’ Edith sat like a handsome statue; as cold, as silent, and as still.
1	‘I knew you couldn’t forget him, when you came to think for a moment,’ he said.
1	‘That’s his allegorical way of expressing it.
1	"But I am in my regular employment, you must consider.
1	She often came to Caddy's, but our function there was to amuse and cheer her, and we did not talk in our usual confidential manner.
1	It is half-past ten by the Cathedral clock when he walks out into the Precincts again; he lingers and looks about him, as though, the enchanted hour when Mr. Durdles may be stoned home having struck, he had some expectation of seeing the Imp who is appointed to the mission of stoning him.
1	The horses in the stables--the long stables in a barren, red-brick court-yard, where there is a great bell in a turret, and a clock with a large face, which the pigeons who live near it and who love to perch upon its shoulders seem to be always consulting--THEY may contemplate some mental pictures of fine weather on occasions, and may be better artists at them than the grooms.
1	I am a little rambling.
1	Lord Decimus, though one of the greatest of the earth, was not remarkable for ingratiatory manners, and Ferdinand had coached him up to the point of noticing all the fellows he might find there, and saying he was glad to see them.
1	She seems to know what the influence of her perfect quietude would be; if so, she has not miscalculated it, for he subsides again.
1	"But don't be hard upon me!
1	Such is the figure, painted and patched for the sun to mock, that is drawn slowly through the crowd from day to day; looking, as it goes, for the good old creature who was such a mother, and making mouths as it peers among the crowd in vain.
1	Five Years Later Tellson's Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty.
1	So young and handsome, and in all respects so perfectly the opposite of Miss Flite!
1	‘It was his, and his uncle’s before him, and Lord knows who before him; and that’s all I can tell you of its pedigree.’ ‘That’s a strongly marked character, Mr Flintwinch, our friend up-stairs.’ ‘Yes, sir,’ said Jeremiah, twisting himself at the visitor again, as he did during the whole of this dialogue, like some screw-machine that fell short of its grip; for the other never changed, and he always felt obliged to retreat a little.
1	Before I had been standing at the window five minutes, they somehow conveyed to me that they were all toadies and humbugs, but that each of them pretended not to know that the others were toadies and humbugs: because the admission that he or she did know it, would have made him or her out to be a toady and humbug.
1	‘I came straight to it, by instinct, I suppose.’ We said no more as we approached the light, but made softly for the door.
1	If _that’s_ a taste, I have got that.
1	“What do I touch?” “Your heart.” “Broken!” She uttered the word with an eager look, and with strong emphasis, and with a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it.
1	The hotel in which we live, is a long row of small houses fronting on the street, and opening at the back upon a common yard, in which hangs a great triangle.
1	‘We must sometimes act in opposition to our wishes,’ he tells her in a low voice.
1	And he used to drive about the country, with the clay-coloured gig with the red wheels, and the vixenish mare with the fast pace, till he gave up business many years afterwards, and went to France with his wife; and then the old house was pulled down.’ ‘Will you allow me to ask you,’ said the inquisitive old gentleman, ‘what became of the chair?’ ‘Why,’ replied the one-eyed bagman, ‘it was observed to creak very much on the day of the wedding; but Tom Smart couldn’t say for certain whether it was with pleasure or bodily infirmity.
1	And I said, “Have you hurt yourself, father?” (as he did sometimes, like they all did), and he said, “A little, my darling.” And when I came to stoop down and look up at his face, I saw that he was crying.
1	I look upon it as a pursuit which is in its nature more or less unsettled, and therefore suited to my temporary condition--I may say, precisely suited.
1	‘No, it ain’t.’ ‘Nor Vilson?’ ‘No; nor that either,’ said the groom.
1	“Your own, one day, my dear, and you will use it well.
1	It's not worth discussing.” “Yes it is,” said I, “because I cannot bear that people should say, 'she throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor, the lowest in the crowd.
1	When they reached the notary’s, which they were not long in doing, for they had encountered the dwarf in a bye street at a very little distance from the house, Mr Brass dismounted; and opening the coach door with a melancholy visage, requested his sister to accompany him into the office, with the view of preparing the good people within, for the mournful intelligence that awaited them.
1	Hold him!’ He was not aware (the meek man submitted of himself) that he was driving at any ization.
1	‘I know I have a habit of it, and I thank you very much, my adorable girl, for taking the trouble to correct it; but my mother is admitted on all sides to be a remarkably fine woman, and she really hasn’t any.’ ‘That may be, or may not be,’ returned Fanny, ‘but pray don’t mention it any more.’ ‘I will not, my love,’ said Mr Sparkler.
1	What the devil do you mean by that piece of impertinence, Mr. Kenwigs?’ said the collector.
1	'I know it all,' he said, taking a seat beside the lovely girl.
1	‘Dispatch then, madame, if you please.
1	Now, from the days when it was always summer in Eden, to these days when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has invariably gone one way--Charles Darnay's way--the way of the love of a woman.
1	That’s it, is it!’ For Mr Mortimer Lightwood had dined there two or three times, and she had met him elsewhere, and he had shown her some attention.
1	Do this at once!’ ‘Are you walking?’ asked his friend.
1	And ‘O that I were lying here with the dead!’ and ‘O Charley, Charley, that this should be the end of our pictures in the fire!’ were all the words she said, as she laid her face in her hands on the stone coping.
1	‘You mustn’t let yourself be cast down, sir,’ said the nurse.
1	But he was greatest of all, perhaps, in the articles of string and straw; with which we were all persuaded he could do anything that could be done by hands.
1	‘Well, I think I will come in!’ said Mr Toots.
1	They were only three at table, and Miss Pross made the third.
1	(“Let her alone,” said Joe.)
1	You’ll find him tough, Ma’am.
1	No; that was the wrong house; the next door.
1	There was no denying that the thing was a compliment to Mr Merdle, and was not a bad thing for Edmund if he liked it.
1	"You're so well put together that I shouldn't have thought it.
1	Her face was towards him, and she appeared to have been coming from the opposite direction.
1	Mr. George sits, with his arms folded, consuming the family and the parlour while Grandfather Smallweed is assisted by Judy to two black leathern cases out of a locked bureau, in one of which he secures the document he has just received, and from the other takes another similar document which he hands to Mr. George, who twists it up for a pipelight.
1	Feeling sure that it was necessary for papa’s peace that the sacrifice should be made, I entreated him to make it.
1	If it does not seem so to you, I am quite sure I am wholly mistaken; for your unchanged poor child confides in your knowledge and goodness more than she could ever tell you if she was to try.
1	That’s what your father and mother might both have been, Heaven knows, and been the better for it.’ I intimated that I hoped I should be what she described.
1	This shocks me very much.” For which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper, and when I went up to my own old little room, took as stately a leave of her as I could, in my murmuring soul, deem reconcilable with the churchyard and the event of the day.
1	Have they really?’ A little vexed by a suspicion that she had spoken precipitately, and withal a little defiant of her own vexation, Bella determined not to retreat.
1	It’s such a delight to know that, when they suffer, they don’t feel!
1	She stared, and said in a low voice, “Is it real?” “It is I, Pip.
1	On the present occasion he wore it very much on one side, with the back part forward in consequence of its being the least rusty; round his neck he wore a flaming red worsted comforter, whereof the straggling ends peeped out beneath his threadbare Newmarket coat, which was very tight and buttoned all the way up.
1	It is very possible that at some earlier period of his career, Mr. Weller’s profile might have presented a bold and determined outline.
1	Put down your money this instant.’ The obedient figure began to rummage in its pockets.
1	‘I want to know,’ said Arthur, and repeated his case.
1	Fascination Fledgeby feigned to be a young gentleman living on his means, but was known secretly to be a kind of outlaw in the bill-broking line, and to put money out at high interest in various ways.
1	Immediately there appeared, coming slowly up above the bulk-head of the cabin, another bulk-head--human, and very large--with one stationary eye in the mahogany face, and one revolving one, on the principle of some lighthouses.
1	‘Amy, my dear,’ said Mr Dorrit, taking her by the hand, ‘this is the close of a day, that has--ha--greatly impressed and gratified me.’ ‘A little tired you, dear, too?’ ‘No,’ said Mr Dorrit, ‘no: I am not sensible of fatigue when it arises from an occasion so--hum--replete with gratification of the purest kind.’ Little Dorrit was glad to find him in such heart, and smiled from her own heart.
1	It is a great resort of foreigners.
1	Do you know I have fancied that he sometimes feels some particular disappointment or misfortune encountered in it.
1	Which that same identical,”  said Joe, going down a new track, “do comb my 'air the wrong way sometimes, awful, by giving out up and down town as it were him which ever had your infant companionation and were looked upon as a playfellow by yourself.” “Nonsense.
1	‘But, dear father,’ cried Little Dorrit, ‘I don’t justify myself for having wounded your dear heart--no!
1	Agnes is worth the whole firm, in my opinion.’ ‘If I may umbly make the remark,’ said Uriah Heep, with a writhe, ‘I fully agree with Miss Betsey Trotwood, and should be only too appy if Miss Agnes was a partner.’ ‘You’re a partner yourself, you know,’ returned my aunt, ‘and that’s about enough for you, I expect.
1	His being heavily in my guardian's debt had nothing to do with their separation.
1	‘My daughter, sir, requires no kindness from you or anybody else.
1	He had a combative look and a chafing, irritable manner which, associated with his figure--still large and powerful, though evidently in its decline--rather alarmed me.
1	"Then I assure your ladyship that such visitors have been here and have been received here.
1	‘Too much for my poor fellow’s mother to bear at this time of day.
1	The good gentleman felt the delicacy and dexterity of the touch, and at once proposed the health of the gentleman, name unknown, who had signalised himself, that night, by his coolness and alacrity.
1	‘“Pounds, shillings, and pence.”  You find your allowance always sufficient for your wants, my dear?’ Rosa wanted for nothing, and therefore it was ample.
1	"He told me once I was the nearest relation he had."
1	‘Oh!’ rejoined Ralph, ‘I thought you did.
1	The gentlemen came slowly up from the waterside, speaking good-humouredly to each other and to the people around and glancing about them as if they were glad to be in England again.
1	The worst will be over in a moment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over.
1	I broke out crying and sobbing, and I said, "Oh, dear godmother, tell me, pray do tell me, did Mama die on my birthday?"
1	One of the peachy-cheeked charmers with the skeleton throats is already apprised of all the principal circumstances that will come out before the Lords on Sir Leicester's application for a bill of divorce.
1	"George," returns Mr. Bucket, keeping his forefinger going, "it is certainly possible, because it's the case.
1	Did Henry tell me you had travelled with them?’ ‘I travelled with my friend Mr Meagles, and his wife and daughter, during some months.’ (Nobody’s heart might have been wrung by the remembrance.)
1	Bedwin,' said Mr. Brownlow, when the housekeeper appeared; 'that boy, Oliver, is an imposter.'
1	Mr Meagles’s friend!’ exclaimed that public criminal, coming out of some mental combinations he had been making, and offering his hand.
1	‘You mean proposing?’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	Missus, thou wi’ her!’ ‘Well, and now you are surprised to be sure, and with reason I must say,’ the old woman returned.
1	"See there, my boy," says George, very gently smoothing the mother's hair with his hand, "there's a good loving forehead for you!
1	That any person or persons audaciously presuming to trespass on this property will be punished with the utmost severity of private chastisement and prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law.
1	Thus, on the daily-arising question of dinner, Miss Twinkleton would say, the three being present together: ‘Perhaps, my love, you will consult with the person of the house, whether she can procure us a lamb’s fry; or, failing that, a roast fowl.’ On which the Billickin would retort (Rosa not having spoken a word), ‘If you was better accustomed to butcher’s meat, Miss, you would not entertain the idea of a lamb’s fry.
1	I am stunned by these discoveries.
1	I half expected to see him drop down before my face and die of deadly cold.
1	I reply to the butcher, 'My good friend, if you knew it, you are paid.
1	until she was sixty, or any age that could be mentioned.
1	'Nothing, aunt; nothing,' replied the young lady.
1	‘Now, we are a partnership of three, dear Pa.’ The appearance of dinner here cut Bella short in one of her disappearances: the more effectually, because it was put on under the auspices of a solemn gentleman in black clothes and a white cravat, who looked much more like a clergyman than THE clergyman, and seemed to have mounted a great deal higher in the church: not to say, scaled the steeple.
1	I have been thinking of running away.’ ‘Bah!’ said the dwarf.
1	Nothing to fear if they parted us!
1	The parents were easily induced to consent to her coming to Boston, and on the 4th of October, 1837, they brought her to the Institution.
1	The dolls’ dressmaker found it delicious to trace the screaming and smarting of Little Eyes in the distorted writing of this epistle.
1	‘Oh, because I am such a little goose,’ said Dora, ‘and she knows I am!’ I thought this sentiment so incompatible with the establishment of any system of check on Mary Anne, that I frowned a little.
1	As to what I dare, I'm a old bird now, as has dared all manner of traps since first he was fledged, and I'm not afeerd to perch upon a scarecrow.
1	Mrs. Rouncewell is not quite sure as to that.
1	I try it with these details, and I see them all, in this my cell in the Bastille, near the close of the tenth year of my captivity, as I saw them all that night.
1	But here again she was undeceived by anomalous and incongruous conduct on the part of Mr Pancks himself.
1	The thunder of the cannon was so loud and incessant, that I could not hear something I much desired to hear, until I made a great exertion and awoke.
1	But my lovely and accomplished relative being a devilish resolute woman, I knew that she was not, in point of fact, to be trifled with, and therefore did not involve myself in any discussions.
1	You can ASK me anything, Mr.
1	Have these men deceived us, and taken us back by another road?
1	It was nothing but a startled look in Paul’s wan face--a flush--a smile--and then a close embrace--but God knows how her heart leapt up at this rich payment for her trouble.
1	‘“I’ll smoke a last pipe,” said the baron, “and then I’ll be off.” So, putting the knife upon the table till he wanted it, and tossing off a goodly measure of wine, the Lord of Grogzwig threw himself back in his chair, stretched his legs out before the fire, and puffed away.
1	The legs of the fowls, too, are longer than could be desired, and extremely scaly.
1	He thought of it and thought of it, until he resolved to steal up the stairs, if the gatekeeper would let him through, and listen.
1	She needed both advantages, for the marks of gripping fingers were deep in her face, and her hair was torn, and her dress (hastily composed with unsteady hands) was clutched and dragged a hundred ways.
1	‘Don’t think of such things, dear,’ answered the chorus.
1	It’s paper.” Miss Spenlow immediately put her hand to her frock, gave a sudden cry, and ran to the dog.
1	‘To be sure she does!’ Notwithstanding which, however, poor Polly embraced them all round in great distress, and coming to her spouse at last, could not make up her mind to part from him, until he gently disengaged himself, at the close of the following allegorical piece of consolation: ‘Polly, old ‘ooman, whatever you do, my darling, hold up your head and fight low.
1	I had come out of Italy, over one of the great passes of the Alps, and had since wandered with a guide among the by-ways of the mountains.
1	However that was, Mrs General’s skirts were very speedily heard outside, coming along--one might almost have said bouncing along--with unusual expedition.
1	Don't you take any pride out of yourself?
1	If she could be translated to heaven to-morrow, she might be expected to ascend without any rapture.
1	To me, parting is a painful thing.
1	He is sharp enough,’ said Mr. Murdstone, impatiently.
1	They changed clothes at the cottage.
1	"I have had experience since.
1	He felt it so earnestly, that he turned quite rational, and positively interdicted any further allusion to Walter’s adventures for some days to come.
1	Let all young men present mark this: ‘The maidens all flocked to his boat so readily.’ (Loud cheers, in which the ladies joined.)
1	The words were scarcely uttered when Newman darted across the road, slunk among the crowd, and disappeared in an instant.
1	Little Dorrit then put her arm round her father’s neck, to bid him good night.
1	‘One remark,’ said Flora, giving their conversation, without the slightest notice and to the great terror of Clennam, the tone of a love-quarrel, ‘I wish to make, one explanation I wish to offer, when your Mama came and made a scene of it with my Papa and when I was called down into the little breakfast-room where they were looking at one another with your Mama’s parasol between them seated on two chairs like mad bulls what was I to do?’ ‘My dear Mrs Finching,’ urged Clennam--‘all so long ago and so long concluded, is it worth while seriously to--’ ‘I can’t Arthur,’ returned Flora, ‘be denounced as heartless by the whole society of China without setting myself right when I have the opportunity of doing so, and you must be very well aware that there was Paul and Virginia which had to be returned and which was returned without note or comment, not that I mean to say you could have written to me watched as I was but if it had only come back with a red wafer on the cover I should have known that it meant Come to Pekin Nankeen and What’s the third place, barefoot.’ ‘My dear Mrs Finching, you were not to blame, and I never blamed you.
1	She made him her stately curtsey in the garden, one morning before breakfast.
1	"It seems unkind to leave him, Esther.
1	‘Has he?’ replied the widow lady.
1	The boy was lying, fast asleep, on a rude bed upon the floor; so pale with anxiety, and sadness, and the closeness of his prison, that he looked like death; not death as it shows in shroud and coffin, but in the guise it wears when life has just departed; when a young and gentle spirit has, but an instant, fled to Heaven, and the gross air of the world has not had time to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed.
1	Then Mrs Gowan, who had been accustomed in her days of a vacant arm-chair beside her to which to summon state to retain her devoted slaves, one by one, for short audiences as marks of her especial favour, invited Clennam with a turn of her fan to approach the presence.
1	‘Face like a peach!’ standing on tiptoe to pinch my cheek as I sat.
1	Very fine young lady!”  Then he pushed Miss Havisham in her chair before him, with one of his large hands, and put the other in his trousers-pocket as if the pocket were full of secrets.
1	Shake the dust from thy feet and let him go.
1	I am not clear whether it was six or seven.
1	"They are great weaknesses--Damme, sir, they are great.
1	‘Good gracious, Misses Brown, no!’ returned the Grinder, with tears in his eyes.
1	What reason have you to be morose?
1	‘My idea,’ exclaimed Miss Wren, ‘is now about the size of an orange.
1	Colonel Wugsby, and all the great people, and all the morning water-drinkers, met in grand assemblage.
1	"May I ask you a question?"
1	Says he, 'Sir, why did you eat spring lamb at eighteen pence a pound?'
1	'Not a bit of it,' replied Mr. Giles.
1	Jo searches the floor for some time longer, then looks up for a moment, and then down again.
1	‘Don’t ye believe a bit on it.’ ‘Yes, yes, it is,’ cried Mrs. Gummidge.
1	"It shall not be repeated.
1	I am not sure that I can do you the good turn I want to do you—that’s my sister, you know, in your room—but I may be able to, and if I should not be able to, there’s no harm done.
1	Lastly, it was no one, and I was no one.
1	Mrs Merdle also, as a leading lady rich in distinction, elegance, grace, and beauty, he mentioned in very laudatory terms.
1	They were calculating and reflecting persons, who had not yet been convinced by the arguments of either party, although they had frequent conferences with each.
1	Jasper brought down his hands, looked over his shoulder, and begged to thank Miss Landless for her vindication of his character.
1	But, at last I began, in a purblind groping way, to read, write, and cipher, on the very smallest scale.
1	‘Do you know who the handsome lady is?’ Munching like that sailor’s wife of yore, who had chestnuts in her lap, and scowling like the witch who asked for some in vain, the old woman picked the shilling up, and going backwards, like a crab, or like a heap of crabs: for her alternately expanding and contracting hands might have represented two of that species, and her creeping face, some half-a-dozen more: crouched on the veinous root of an old tree, pulled out a short black pipe from within the crown of her bonnet, lighted it with a match, and smoked in silence, looking fixedly at her questioner.
1	If people are so silly as to indulge the sentiment, is it my fault?
1	He would take the air there presently and get an appetite for his hotel dinner.
1	We have come into a great fortune, and we must do what’s right by our fortune; we must act up to it.’ Mr Boffin, who had a deep respect for his wife’s intuitive wisdom, replied, though rather pensively: ‘I suppose we must.’ ‘It’s never been acted up to yet, and, consequently, no good has come of it,’ said Mrs Boffin.
1	Little by little you will know me better, and the time will come when you will know me, as I know myself.
1	Good morning, Sir!’ As Miss Tox, with her most fascinating step and carriage, disappeared from Princess’s Place, the Major stood looking after her with a bluer face than ever: muttering and growling some not at all complimentary remarks.
1	Such a mean mission as the domestic mission was the very last thing to be endured among them; indeed, Miss Wisk informed us, with great indignation, before we sat down to breakfast, that the idea of woman's mission lying chiefly in the narrow sphere of home was an outrageous slander on the part of her tyrant, man.
1	‘Happy she is, beyond all doubt,’ said Mr Garland.
1	However, here was a model before him.
1	What more he was, or what else he had in him, if anything, let him show for himself.
1	His notion was, that he would find the body; he only found a shirt-pin sticking in some mud and ooze.
1	Therefore (or you could not say so) you must have set up some views as mine.
1	I was not surprised to observe Mr. Kenge inclined to dispute what he said before he had said much, for I knew that no two people ever did agree about anything in Jarndyce and Jarndyce.
1	He glares at her as he smokes; and then, his eyes becoming filmy, answers: ‘That’s the journey.’ Silence ensues.
1	The gauntlet, to which Mrs. Micawber referred upon a former occasion, being thrown down in the form of an advertisement, was taken up by my friend Heep, and led to a mutual recognition.
1	‘No; I am not going to have that done, Amy.
1	screamed the Jew, starting from his seat.
1	After the discovery was made here who I was, Mr Boffin, still restless on the subject, told me, upon certain conditions impossible for such a hound as you to appreciate, the secret of that Dutch bottle.
1	The marshes were just a long black horizontal line then, as I stopped to look after him; and the river was just another horizontal line, not nearly so broad nor yet so black; and the sky was just a row of long angry red lines and dense black lines intermixed.
1	You cannot help thinking how quickly the time passes with them, which drags so heavily with you; and the more you think of this, the more your hopes of their speedy arrival decline.
1	Then I told her, with my arms clasped round her, how I loved her, so dearly, and so dearly; how I felt it right to offer to release her from her engagement, because now I was poor; how I never could bear it, or recover it, if I lost her; how I had no fears of poverty, if she had none, my arm being nerved and my heart inspired by her; how I was already working with a courage such as none but lovers knew; how I had begun to be practical, and look into the future; how a crust well earned was sweeter far than a feast inherited; and much more to the same purpose, which I delivered in a burst of passionate eloquence quite surprising to myself, though I had been thinking about it, day and night, ever since my aunt had astonished me.
1	When the horses were swollen out to about twice their natural dimensions (there seems to be an idea here, that this kind of inflation improves their going), we went forward again, through mud and mire, and damp, and festering heat, and brake and bush, attended always by the music of the frogs and pigs, until nearly noon, when we halted at a place called Belleville.
1	He fears he will die of joy, before he gets among them.
1	'This is pretty treatment, sir,' said Monks, throwing down his hat and cloak, 'from my father's oldest friend.'
1	‘Soon the lady makes a singular and exciting discovery.
1	I am just so near disgrace as that those who are put in authority over me (as the catechism goes) would far rather be without me than with me.
1	“Behold your papers, Jarvis Lorry, countersigned.” “One can depart, citizen?” “One can depart.
1	‘Your breakfast is ready, sir,’ whispered Bella, after greeting him with a hug, ‘and all you have to do, is, to eat it up and drink it up, and escape.
1	I have never broken the condition once.
1	I must keep them closely in view; that’s all.’ So, nodding his head very complacently, Ralph was leaving the spot, when his quick ear caught the sound of a confused noise and hubbub of voices, mingled with a great running up and down stairs, in the very house which had been the subject of his scrutiny; and while he was hesitating whether to knock at the door or listen at the keyhole a little longer, a female servant of Madame Mantalini’s (whom he had often seen) opened it abruptly and bounced out, with her blue cap-ribbons streaming in the air.
1	‘Stop till I come back.
1	He is a public offender.
1	But it was not I.
1	Not so the eyes upon the bed.
1	He smiled, said, ‘I ask your pardon, my dear,’ and threw it out of window.
1	“I am pretty well, I thank you,” answered Mr. Lorry, with meekness; “how are you?” “Nothing to boast of,” said Miss Pross.
1	Clean and florid: with his light complexion, fading as it were, in the sun, and his dainty step enhancing the softness of the turf: Mr Carker the Manager strolled about meadows, and green lanes, and glided among avenues of trees, until it was time to return to breakfast.
1	"He may have found papers in something he bought, where papers were not supposed to be, and may have got it into his shrewd head from the manner and place of their concealment that they are worth something."
1	‘I raly cannot contain myself,’ said Mrs. Cluppins, ‘when I think of such perjury.
1	It may be that her beauty and all the state and brilliancy surrounding her only gives him the greater zest for what he is set upon and makes him the more inflexible in it.
1	Dear, dear, what a place it looked, that Astley’s; with all the paint, gilding, and looking-glass; the vague smell of horses suggestive of coming wonders; the curtain that hid such gorgeous mysteries; the clean white sawdust down in the circus; the company coming in and taking their places; the fiddlers looking carelessly up at them while they tuned their instruments, as if they didn’t want the play to begin, and knew it all beforehand!
1	With this, he whipped his sword out, and made a lunge at my uncle without further ceremony.
1	I had known, from the time when I could speak, that my sister, in her capricious and violent coercion, was unjust to me.
1	He do the Police in different voices.’ The visitors again considered it a point of politeness to look at Sloppy, who, looking at them, suddenly threw back his head, extended his mouth to its utmost width, and laughed loud and long.
1	‘Though I positively cannot tear myself away,’ he cherubically added, ‘--it would be a sin--without drinking to many, many happy returns of this most happy day.’ ‘Here!
1	A year or two younger than his eminently practical friend, Mr. Bounderby looked older; his seven or eight and forty might have had the seven or eight added to it again, without surprising anybody.
1	‘The fame of the gentleman in question, never reached my ears.’ ‘No, sir!’ exclaimed Mr. Weller.
1	His curiosity was therefore satisfied, and putting on his spectacles he prepared himself to watch the play which was just commencing.
1	She is dozing probably, for she gives no heed to his steps as he comes toward her.
1	As soon as there is no doubt about it, Mr Towlinson’s main anxiety is that the failure should be a good round one--not less than a hundred thousand pound.
1	I am to be trusted, for the first time in a long while, with my miserable life, on account of what you have given me to try for.
1	There was Mrs. Lenville, in a very limp bonnet and veil, decidedly in that way in which she would wish to be if she truly loved Mr. Lenville; there was Miss Gazingi, with an imitation ermine boa tied in a loose knot round her neck, flogging Mr. Crummles, junior, with both ends, in fun.
1	It was very cold, and, a collier coming by us, with her galley-fire smoking and flaring, looked like a comfortable home.
1	I quickened my pace, and knocked at the door with my hand.
1	As if he denied himself the pleasure of uttering it, lest he should soar too high; and his meekness therefore preferred to be unmeaning.
1	That, they never could lay their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could endure the notion of their children laying their heads upon their pillows; in short, that there never more could be, for them or theirs, any laying of heads upon pillows at all, unless the prisoner's head was taken off.
1	Nell and her grandfather consulted together, and while they were so engaged, Mrs Jarley with her hands behind her walked up and down the caravan, as she had walked after tea on the dull earth, with uncommon dignity and self-esteem.
1	Therefore I have no other object in this, than what Rosa has mentioned.
1	Is he wounded?--Is he dead?--Is he--Ha, ha, ha!’ Here the spinster aunt burst into fit number two, of hysteric laughter interspersed with screams.
1	It might be the making of our fortune to make a clean sweep of them both.
1	‘Sam, have my greatcoat and shawl ready, and order a conveyance to be at the door to-morrow evening, rather earlier than is absolutely necessary, in order that we may be in good time.’ Mr. Weller touched his hat, as an earnest of his obedience, and withdrew to make all needful preparations for the expedition.
1	To think how many times he went the journey, and never saw the road!’ The woman kneels upon the floor, with her arms crossed on the coverlet of the bed, close by him, and her chin upon them.
1	167 In the United States again; Lebanon; The Shaker Village; West Point The Passage Home                                                   182 Concluding Remarks                                              202 EMIGRANTS                   _Marcus Stone_, _R.A._      _Frontispiece_ I SHALL never forget the one-fourth serious and three-fourths comical astonishment, with which, on the morning of the third of January eighteen-hundred-and-forty-two, I opened the door of, and put my head into, a ‘state-room’ on board the Britannia steam-packet, twelve hundred tons burthen per register, bound for Halifax and Boston, and carrying Her Majesty’s mails.
1	I hear Conversation Kenge and the rest of them say to the new faces, 'Here's little Miss Flite.
1	‘I am very sorry, indeed, for all this.
1	You will have no objection, I dare say, to your great expectations being encumbered with that easy condition.
1	‘It isn’t fair.’ ‘You don’t keep many cooks, and can easily apologise to them for the trouble,’ retorted Ralph.
1	This caused great confusion on board the steamer, and I heard them calling to us, and heard the order given to stop the paddles, and heard them stop, but felt her driving down upon us irresistibly.
1	‘Well, Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	We make a feast of the event, and you will be made the hero of it."
1	Among her connections and acquaintances, however, she maintained her individual dignity and the dignity of the blood of the Barnacles, by diligently nursing the pretence that it was a most unfortunate business; that she was sadly cut up by it; that this was a perfect fascination under which Henry laboured; that she had opposed it for a long time, but what could a mother do; and the like.
1	‘That’s kind of you to ask.
1	At the same table, with both her elbows upon it, was Mrs Jiniwin; no longer sipping other people’s punch feloniously with teaspoons, but taking deep draughts from a jorum of her own; while her daughter--not exactly with ashes on her head, or sackcloth on her back, but preserving a very decent and becoming appearance of sorrow nevertheless--was reclining in an easy chair, and soothing her grief with a smaller allowance of the same glib liquid.
1	I was quite as dejected on the first working-day of my apprenticeship as in that after-time; but I am glad to know that I never breathed a murmur to Joe while my indentures lasted.
1	I thought I couldn’t know whether it was a prosperous nation or not, and whether I was in a thriving state or not, unless I knew who had got the money, and whether any of it was mine.
1	‘I knew but too well what all this meant.
1	‘On Saturdays and Sundays.’ ‘And you’ll try and learn a great deal here, and be a clever man,’ said Mr Dombey; ‘won’t you?’ ‘I’ll try,’ returned the child, wearily.
1	Yet the house is as free to him as if it was his, and he has his room, and is put upon a footing, and draws about a thousand a year.
1	The Close of Esther's Narrative A Chancery judge once had the kindness to inform me, as one of a company of some hundred and fifty men and women not labouring under any suspicions of lunacy, that the Court of Chancery, though the shining subject of much popular prejudice (at which point I thought the judge's eye had a cast in my direction), was almost immaculate.
1	When does the gentleman return to Cloisterham?’ ‘At six this evening.’ ‘Bless ye and thank ye.
1	Ha ha ha!’ In the height of his ecstasy, Mr Quilp had like to have met with a disagreeable check, for rolling very near a broken dog-kennel, there leapt forth a large fierce dog, who, but that his chain was of the shortest, would have given him a disagreeable salute.
1	‘My dear Madam, and Copperfield, ‘The fair land of promise lately looming on the horizon is again enveloped in impenetrable mists, and for ever withdrawn from the eyes of a drifting wretch whose Doom is sealed!
1	What colour, and what texture!"
1	James took quite uncommonly to the young woman; and was more settled, for a length of time, than I have known him to be since I have been in his service.
1	‘So I was!’ ‘How was the bride dressed?
1	‘No,’ replied Ralph, with equal abruptness.
1	Secondly, nearly all these young ladies subscribe to circulating libraries.
1	Has either anything to do with my wishing to live quite secret and retired here?
1	‘Nothing!’ said the lady, looking up.
1	For two days we toiled up this foul stream, striking constantly against the floating timber, or stopping to avoid those more dangerous obstacles, the snags, or sawyers, which are the hidden trunks of trees that have their roots below the tide.
1	The Knitting Done In that same juncture of time when the Fifty-Two awaited their fate Madame Defarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and Jacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury.
1	The remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving the hearse--advised by the regular driver, who was perched beside him, under close inspection, for the purpose--and with a pieman, also attended by his cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach.
1	Down, Pedro!’ This was addressed to the dog with the cap on, who being a new member of the company, and not quite certain of his duty, kept his unobscured eye anxiously on his master, and was perpetually starting upon his hind legs when there was no occasion, and falling down again.
1	‘Don’t you know,’ said Mr. Mantalini, taking Ralph by the button, ‘that it wasn’t an accident at all, but a demd, furious, manslaughtering attack made upon him by your nephew?’ ‘What!’ snarled Ralph, clenching his fists and turning a livid white.
1	The state expressly asks him to trust to Bucket.
1	The Jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the street; and, glancing suspiciously round, crossed the road, and struck off in the direction of the Spitalfields.
1	My head ached with wondering how it happened, if men were neither fools nor rascals; and my heart ached to think they could possibly be either.
1	She always walked with her husband to the railroad, and was always there again to meet him; her old coquettish ways a little sobered down (but not much), and her dress as daintily managed as if she managed nothing else.
1	I wonder whether they called in Mr. Chillip, and he was in vain; and if so, how he likes to be reminded of it once a week.
1	And, he said, Heaven forbid that Frederick should be there in any other character than in his present voluntary character!
1	‘Steady, steady!’ said the Captain to Diogenes, ‘what’s amiss with you?
1	They leave Mr. Tulkinghorn, without a ruffle on the surface of his unfathomable depths, drinking his old wine, and go down into the streets.
1	His imagery was all drawn from the sea, and from the incidents of a seaman’s life; and was often remarkably good.
1	A tremendous place is close before us, the black driver rolls his eyes, screws his mouth up very round, and looks straight between the two leaders, as if he were saying to himself, ‘We have done this often before, but _now_ I think we shall have a crash.’  He takes a rein in each hand; jerks and pulls at both; and dances on the splashboard with both feet (keeping his seat, of course) like the late lamented Ducrow on two of his fiery coursers.
1	B. infidel, Sir; and that if it were consistent with the dignity of a rough and tough old Major, of the old school, who had had the honour of being personally known to, and commended by, their late Royal Highnesses the Dukes of Kent and York, to retire to a tub and live in it, by Gad!
1	The same eyes followed her to the door; and in their light, and on the tranquil face, there was a smile when it was closed.
1	Now he’s singing!’ Mr Quilp was certainly entertaining himself with vocal exercise, but it was rather a kind of chant than a song; being a monotonous repetition of one sentence in a very rapid manner, with a long stress upon the last word, which he swelled into a dismal roar.
1	He did no work for two or three years before he died, but lived in clover; and his last act (like a choleric old gentleman) was to kick his doctor.
1	They searched every nook and corner round, together and separately; they shouted, whistled, laughed, called--and all with the same result.
1	‘Quite charming.’ ‘Has she come to sit upon Quilp’s knee,’ said the dwarf, in what he meant to be a soothing tone, ‘or is she going to bed in her own little room inside here?
1	"I have no patience with him," observed Scrooge's niece.
1	Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the gentlemen withdrew.
1	‘Oh, indeed!’ I observed faintly.
1	Not a bad notion though, if you want to look indifferent in driving a bargain.
1	The smallest boy I ever conversed with, carrying the largest baby I ever saw, offered a supernaturally intelligent explanation of the locality in its old uses, and was very nearly correct.
1	I’ll manage him.’ After a little rolling about, in a close scuffle which caused the faces of both to be besmeared with blood, the man took his knee from Neville’s chest, and rose, saying: ‘There!
1	She is yours!” And her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and she was gone.
1	Cly (who I will unreservedly admit, at this distance of time, was a partner of mine) has been dead several years.
1	We make no display,’ said Mrs Nickleby, with an air which seemed to insinuate that they could make a vast deal if they were so disposed; ‘no fuss, no preparation; I wouldn’t allow it.
1	‘Thanks to you, Master Copperfield,’ he returned, ‘of no one in particular just at present--no male person, at least.’ ‘Do you mean that you are jealous of a female person?’ He gave me a sidelong glance out of his sinister red eyes, and laughed.
1	And four wooden legs are more troublesome to you than two, when you don’t want any.’ Mr Pancks concluded by blowing off that steam of his.
1	The baby soon appeared, carried in great glory by Richards; while Florence, in custody of that active young constable, Susan Nipper, brought up the rear.
1	At length, the anxious mother permitted herself to be soothed into a more tranquil state, and the little Kenwigses, being also composed, were distributed among the company, to prevent the possibility of Mrs. Kenwigs being again overcome by the blaze of their combined beauty.
1	Get me a coach!’ However much astonished I might be, I was sensible that I had no right to refuse compliance with such a peremptory command.
1	Glass of wine, Sir.’ ‘With pleasure,’ said Mr. Pickwick; and the stranger took wine, first with him, and then with Mr. Snodgrass, and then with Mr. Tupman, and then with Mr. Winkle, and then with the whole party together, almost as rapidly as he talked.
1	‘For the man of wrath, too!’ added Mr. Stiggins; ‘it makes a vessel’s heart bleed!’ Mr. Weller was overheard by his son to murmur something relative to making a vessel’s nose bleed; but Mr. Stiggins heard him not.
1	But there are such places yonder.’ ‘And far from here?’ said Nell.
1	It was as if I had seen her admiringly and tenderly embracing Dora, and tacitly reproving me, by her considerate protection, for my hot haste in fluttering that little heart.
1	I was not disturbed by Mr. Vholes (who took off his gloves to dine), though he sat opposite to me at the small table, for I doubt if, looking up at all, he once removed his eyes from his host's face.
1	‘Here’s my dear boy--my dear boy, Master Davy, who brought us together, Barkis!
1	"You see again, Miss Summerson," observed Mrs. Jellyby serenely, "what a happiness it is to be so much occupied as I am and to have this necessity for self-concentration that I have.
1	And I have been lingering about,’ added Eugene, ‘like a bailiff; or,’ with a look at Riah, ‘an old clothesman.’ The Jew lifted up his eyes, and took in Eugene once more, at another glance.
1	You quite surprise me!’ And again he uttered never a word.
1	‘My dear love,’ said Arthur.
1	Why, only think how old she looked.
1	Accidents, miseries, and offences, were never to be mentioned before her.
1	‘Good- morning, sir.’ ‘You’re a soft customer, you are; we’ve got it all out o’ you, anyhow,’ thought Mr. Weller, as Job walked away.
1	The time will come--and soon enough--when you will understand this better, and will feel it too, as no one save a woman can."
1	I wish he was, poor man!'
1	That makes no noise, and is quite as certain, and more genteel.
1	Mrs. Bardell felt it proper to be agitated; and as none of the three exactly knew whether under existing circumstances, any communication, otherwise than through Dodson & Fogg, ought to be held with Mr. Pickwick’s servant, they were all rather taken by surprise.
1	“Now, don't echo,” I retorted.
1	By the time they alighted there, it was quite dark; and, proceeding by the dead wall in front of the Veterinary Hospital, they entered a small by-street, which is, or was at that time, called Little College Street, and which, whatever it may be now, was in those days a desolate place enough, surrounded by little else than fields and ditches.
1	I am born to be served.
1	They can never help me to escape in the body, though they may in the spirit.'
1	‘Peggotty is quite comfortable now, Mr. Barkis,’ I remarked, for his satisfaction.
1	He looked at himself in the glass again; went closer to it to dash a grain or two of dust out of the corner of his eye; and settled his cravat.
1	Madeline, my love, your hand here.’ ‘Oh dear!
1	Would Gargery come here with you, and bring your indentures, do you think?” I signified that I had no doubt he would take it as an honor to be asked.
1	‘He always came into the garden to say good night.
1	It comes out with him among his servants, and yet he leaves it whispering behind; he sees it pointing after him in the street; it is waiting for him in his counting-house; it leers over the shoulders of rich men among the merchants; it goes beckoning and babbling among the crowd; it always anticipates him, in every place; and is always busiest, he knows, when he has gone away.
1	‘When they are, you know what to do with them as well as any man alive, and how to back quietly out at the right time,’ said Mr. Bonney, slapping the capitalist familiarly on the shoulder.
1	You remember me?’ ‘You remember what I told you I had been, and where I came from, ragged and lame, with the fierce wind and weather beating on my head?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘You know how I came back that night, and threw your money in the dirt, and you and your race.
1	Quietly, quietly, the reflected marks of the prison bars and of the zig-zag iron on the wall-top, faded away.
1	Can't exactly say what'll be done to him arter he's dead if he tells a lie to the gentlemen here, but believes it'll be something wery bad to punish him, and serve him right--and so he'll tell the truth.
1	Slight tinge of damask revisiting cheek.
1	He belonged to the world again.
1	And truly, they were as sturdy and bluff a pair of boots as one would wish to see; as firmly planted on the ground as if their owner’s legs and feet had been in them; and seeming, with their broad soles and blunt toes, to hold possession of their place by main force.
1	Who do you suppose is with me?"
1	'Very much so indeed, ma'am,' said the beadle.
1	We must tell papa about it either to-night or to-morrow, according to the opportunities.
1	I am proud to make your acquaintance.
1	It’s beneath you, I know; but I thought that perhaps you might--’ ‘Might!’ cried Nicholas, with great alacrity; ‘of course I shall.
1	“Regular rules!” Here, he skipped from his right leg on to his left.
1	You have heard him say so fifty times.
1	Why, here’s your father, Amy!
1	“I’m in such a state of mind that I hardly know what I write”--blot--“if you could see me at this minute shedding tears for my past misconduct”--pepper-castor--“my hand trembles when I think”--blot again--if that don’t produce the effect, it’s all over.’ By this time, Mr Swiveller had finished his entry, and he now replaced his pencil in its little sheath and closed the book, in a perfectly grave and serious frame of mind.
1	Whatever the man’s labour, the girl was never employed; but sat, when she was with him, in a listless, moping state, and idle.
1	‘Half a dozen years ago, or so,’ Mr. Sapsea proceeds, ‘when I had enlarged my mind up to—I will not say to what it now is, for that might seem to aim at too much, but up to the pitch of wanting another mind to be absorbed in it—I cast my eye about me for a nuptial partner.
1	But he was a reticent as well as an eccentric man; and he made no mention of a certain evening when he warmed his hands at the gatehouse fire, and looked steadily down upon a certain heap of torn and miry clothes upon the floor.
1	Then Arthur’s father, who has all along been secretly pining in the ways of virtuous ruggedness for those accursed snares which are called the Arts, becomes acquainted with her.
1	'Oh yes, I can talk.
1	The bland and open-hearted proprietor of Bachelor’s Hall slept on amidst the congenial accompaniments of rain, mud, dirt, damp, fog, and rats, until late in the day; when, summoning his valet Tom Scott to assist him to rise, and to prepare breakfast, he quitted his couch, and made his toilet.
1	"Thank you, Mademoiselle Hortense," says Mr. Tulkinghorn with his usual equanimity.
1	Now, the fact was, that in the inmost recesses of his own heart, Mr. Grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that Oliver's appearance and manner were unusually prepossessing; but he had a strong appetite for contradiction, sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the orange-peel; and, inwardly determining that no man should dictate to him whether a boy was well-looking or not, he had resolved, from the first, to oppose his friend.
1	That fearful Impostor, Pumblechook, immediately nodded, and said, as he rubbed the arms of his chair, “It's more than that, Mum.” “Why, you don't mean to say--” began my sister.
1	Give me something, or I’ll call it after you!’ croaked the old woman, passionately.
1	‘Oh, indeed!’ Mrs. Raddle smiled sweetly, Mr. Raddle bowed, and Mrs. Cluppins said, ‘she was sure she was very happy to have an opportunity of being known to a lady which she had heerd so much in favour of, as Mrs. Rogers.’ A compliment which the last-named lady acknowledged with graceful condescension.
1	‘Why, you’ve been having the place cleaned up!’ he exclaimed.
1	She had become familiar to me, when a gracious God restored my faculties; but, I am quite unable even to say how she had become familiar.
1	A secretary is worth so much in the market, and I ought to give it and no more.
1	Here I am!’ Glancing round contemptuously at the bedstead, which was turned up by day, he leaned his back against it as a resting-place, without removing his hat from his head, and stood defiantly lounging with his hands in his pockets.
1	He had walked no more than twelve miles, when night closed in again.
1	Nell, busily plying her needle, repaired the tattered window-hangings, drew together the rents that time had worn in the threadbare scraps of carpet, and made them whole and decent.
1	Don’t ask me to desist; there is a--hum--a general principle involved here, which rises even above considerations of--ha--hospitality.
1	But, one way and another, so many things happen to me which I never could have expected, I am sure, in my umble station, that it seems to rain blessings on my ed.
1	Ding, but thou mak’st noise eneaf!’ With these words, John Browdie opened the door himself, and opening his eyes too to their utmost width, cried, as he clapped his hands together, and burst into a hearty roar: ‘Ecod, it be the godfeyther, it be the godfeyther!
1	The Captain therefore hemmed to clear his throat, and read the letter aloud.
1	‘I know so little of the gentleman,’ said Mr. Pickwick, hesitating, ‘I know you do,’ interrupted Smangle, clasping Mr. Pickwick by the shoulder.
1	Everybody and anybody has been in my confidence as yet, but now I think I’ll set up in business for myself.
1	said the girl, stooping over him, and pointing to the door as she looked cautiously round.
1	But Mr Toots said he would do a great deal more than that, if he could; and indeed he did more as it was: for he helped Paul to undress, and helped him to bed, in the kindest manner possible, and then sat down by the bedside and chuckled very much; while Mr Feeder, B.A., leaning over the bottom of the bedstead, set all the little bristles on his head bolt upright with his bony hands, and then made believe to spar at Paul with great science, on account of his being all right again, which was so uncommonly facetious, and kind too in Mr Feeder, that Paul, not being able to make up his mind whether it was best to laugh or cry at him, did both at once.
1	But the more he asked Mrs. Micawber to look up, the more she fixed her eyes on nothing; and the more he asked her to compose herself, the more she wouldn’t.
1	‘But his heart failed him, and he cast about for some other way of annoying you, and making himself popular at the same time--for that’s the point.
1	I wish you good night, Mr Clennam.’ ‘And mind you don’t forget us, you know, Nandy,’ said the Father.
1	A young man really well deserves constant support and patronage,’ looking at the Doctor, ‘who makes such sacrifices.’ ‘Time will go fast with you, Mr. Jack Maldon,’ pursued the Doctor, ‘and fast with all of us.
1	Why, I don’t see anything of the cap.’ Bless my soul!’ said Mr. Winkle, ‘I declare I forgot the cap!’ The slight omission was rectified.
1	Words, sir, never influence the course of the cards, or the course of the dice.
1	‘Give the boy some more.’ ‘No more, thank’e, Uncle!’ ‘Yes, yes,’ said Sol, ‘a little more.
1	The day seems different to me from every other day, and the light not of the same colour--of a sadder colour.
1	It is another of my miseries that I cannot speak to you or speak of you without stumbling at every syllable, unless I let the check go altogether and run mad.
1	I’ll not accompany you, I’ll not follow you, if you will reply.’ ‘How can I, Mr Wrayburn?
1	I started at every footstep and every sound, believing that he was discovered and taken, and this was the messenger to tell me so.
1	For births, deaths, marriages, and all the events which are of interest to most men, have (unless they are connected with gain or loss of money) no interest for me.
1	“The occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction so happily recovered from,” said Mr. Lorry, clearing his throat, “we will call--Blacksmith's work, Blacksmith's work.
1	Startop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he ought to have been at school, but he was devotedly attached to her, and admired her beyond measure.
1	‘I am as cheerful, father, as I usually am, or usually have been.’ ‘That’s well,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.
1	However, I will never rest (if only in remembrance of Mr Fledgeby’s having kissed my hand) until my husband does see it.
1	‘Well I am sure, Kate, my dear, you’re very polite!’ replied Mrs Nickleby.
1	“From the Hulks!” “Oh-h!” said I, looking at Joe.
1	And even now, with this case, I hesitate.
1	Tom Gradgrind, as your son, young Tom, refuses for some obstinate reason or other to say anything at all about those statements, good or bad, I am obliged to confront her with your daughter.’ ‘You have seen me once before, young lady,’ said Rachael, standing in front of Louisa.
1	Since the business is to be done by some hands, let it be done by mine.
1	It was the close of the summer day, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross.
1	'I never heard of that,' interrupted Monks in a tone intended to appear incredulous, but savouring more of disagreeable surprise.
1	Mr. John Browdie, with his hands in his pockets, hovered restlessly about these delicacies, stopping occasionally to whisk the flies out of the sugar-basin with his wife’s pocket-handkerchief, or to dip a teaspoon in the milk-pot and carry it to his mouth, or to cut off a little knob of crust, and a little corner of meat, and swallow them at two gulps like a couple of pills.
1	It was not because I had a strong sense of the virtue of industry, but because Joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry, that I worked with tolerable zeal against the grain.
1	We have begun of late years to imitate this good example.
1	‘This here red-nosed man, Sammy, wisits your mother-in-law vith a kindness and constancy I never see equalled.
1	Mr Baptist was the second, and jogged close after him, looking at no other object.
1	I thought how Joe and my sister were then sitting in the kitchen, and how I had come up to bed from the kitchen, and how Miss Havisham and Estella never sat in a kitchen, but were far above the level of such common doings.
1	You ain't looked slowly forward to this as I have; you wosn't prepared for this as I wos.
1	"If you get into debt, you must pay your debts or take the consequences.
1	They drew him to my very feet--insensible--dead.
1	where did mine learn better?
1	It was him as pointed out to me where Toughey was.
1	Entering the park, almost immediately by the disputed ground, we pursued a pleasant footpath winding among the verdant turf and the beautiful trees until it brought us to the church-porch.
1	"Miss Summerson, you'll understand me, if you think a moment.
1	If you are not too headstrong to accept of a bit of dinner, here it is."
1	said Mr. Bucket, beckoning over the banisters.
1	You must make haste.’ ‘Oh, I’m in no hurry,’ said Miss Squeers, very sharply.
1	The occupation he set himself was to visit these with all discretion and speed, and, in the event of finding anywhere that he had left a bill unpaid, and a box or parcel behind, to pay such bill, and bring away such box or parcel.
1	‘Nonsense, Uncle,’ cried the boy, still reddening and laughing, boy-like.
1	(He changed the leg he had crossed over the other, and tried the calculation again, but could not bring out the total at less.)
1	All its people were poor, and many of them were sitting at their doors, shredding spare onions and the like for supper, while many were at the fountain, washing leaves, and grasses, and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten.
1	He was so near, that with one more of his vigorous strokes he would be clinging to it,--when a high, green, vast hill-side of water, moving on shoreward, from beyond the ship, he seemed to leap up into it with a mighty bound, and the ship was gone!
1	Mr. Gridley gave his consent gruff--but gave it.
1	There was a remarkable darkness of colour on it, and the brow was more contracted.
1	‘You’ve done a little business for the youngsters today, my lad!’ In his exultation, and in his familiarity, present and prospective, with the House, the Captain, when he reached the outer office, could not refrain from rallying Mr Perch a little, and asking him whether he thought everybody was still engaged.
1	If you were to ask me who somebody is, upon my word I couldn't tell you.
1	When I conducted Mrs. Micawber to my dressing-table, and she saw the scale on which it was prepared for her, she was in such raptures, that she called Mr. Micawber to come in and look.
1	What do you go in for?
1	At sight of their perjured relative, Mrs Kenwigs turned faint and pale, and Mr. Kenwigs rose majestically.
1	He turned white, as she held her hand up like an enchantress, at whose invocation the sound had come.
1	‘Put the boys and the boxes into the cart,’ said Squeers, rubbing his hands; ‘and this young man and me will go on in the chaise.
1	His confidential agent eyed it keenly.
1	The whole body of travellers seemed to be a collection of voluntary human sacrifices, bound hand and foot, and delivered over to Mr Eustace and his attendants, to have the entrails of their intellects arranged according to the taste of that sacred priesthood.
1	We never could associate, never could communicate, never probably from that time forth could interchange another word on earth.
1	If I showed any trace of what I felt, my own sorrows were sufficient to account for it.
1	You have nothing to reproach yourself with.
1	I saw him so often in the course of the evening, which passed very pleasantly, contemplate Richard and Ada with an interest and a satisfaction that made his fine face remarkably agreeable as he sat at a little distance from the piano listening to the music--and he had small occasion to tell us that he was passionately fond of music, for his face showed it--that I asked my guardian as we sat at the backgammon board whether Mr. Boythorn had ever been married.
1	‘Rough people--paths never made for little feet like yours--a dismal blighted way--is there no turning back, my child?’ ‘There is none,’ cried Nell, pressing forward.
1	‘Now, sir,’ said Venus, ‘all is safe and quiet.
1	He didn't make a very desperate resistance, miss!
1	With those words, the Jew, stooping down, placed the candle on an upper flight of stairs, exactly opposite to the room door.
1	He was mooning about, I suppose, taking liberties with people’s chins; but there he was, somehow.
1	Not a great fortune, forty and odd pounds for the inheritor of a hundred and odd thousand!
1	‘Well, Miss Snevellicci,’ said Mrs. Curdle, entering the parlour, ‘and how do YOU do?’ Miss Snevellicci made a graceful obeisance, and hoped Mrs. Curdle was well, as also Mr. Curdle, who at the same time appeared.
1	‘This is a wery impartial country for justice, ‘said Sam.’ There ain’t a magistrate goin’ as don’t commit himself twice as he commits other people.’ At this sally another special laughed, and then tried to look so supernaturally solemn, that the magistrate detected him immediately.
1	‘Wery good, wery good,’ said Mr. Weller.
1	I hated that man with all a madman’s hate.
1	‘Not inside--I’ll be damned if you’re going inside,’ said the strange man.
1	On deck, I took leave of poor Mrs. Micawber.
1	If he had hesitated for one instant to punish Oliver most severely, it must be quite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been, according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established, a brute, an unnatural husband, an insulting creature, a base imitation of a man, and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital within the limits of this chapter.
1	‘Not the lad I speak on,’ said the Captain.
1	It’s natur; ain’t it, cook?’ ‘Don’t ask me, imperence,’ replied the cook, in a high state of delight; and hereupon the cook and Mary laughed again, till what between the beer, and the cold meat, and the laughter combined, the latter young lady was brought to the verge of choking--an alarming crisis from which she was only recovered by sundry pats on the back, and other necessary attentions, most delicately administered by Mr. Samuel Weller.
1	‘Not even going; gone.’ ‘Has he turned girl or baby?’ muttered Ralph, with a fretful gesture.
1	As soon as he had apologized for the remissness of his memory, he asked me if he should send Boots for Mr. Pumblechook?
1	The best way that I can think of would be to send a card, and my compliments, (I’ve no doubt he’d take ‘em for a pot of porter,) by this young man, to the Saracen with Two Necks.
1	Add to this, that he was good-looking and intelligent, had a plentiful share of vivacity, was extremely cheerful, and accommodated himself in five minutes’ time to all John Browdie’s oddities with as much ease as if he had known him from a boy; and it will be a source of no great wonder that, when they parted for the night, he had produced a most favourable impression, not only upon the worthy Yorkshireman and his wife, but upon Nicholas also, who, revolving all these things in his mind as he made the best of his way home, arrived at the conclusion that he had laid the foundation of a most agreeable and desirable acquaintance.
1	‘I expect a letter from the solicitor respecting that mortgage of Ruddle’s.
1	Mortimer replies, that by special testamentary clause it would then go to the old servant above mentioned, passing over and excluding the son; also, that if the son had not been living, the same old servant would have been sole residuary legatee.
1	‘There are many vessels leaving the port, I suppose,’ replied Nicholas.
1	HE was NOT an engraver.’ (Here Mr Sampson said, with no reason whatever, Of course not.)
1	Without this arrest of everything, this standing still of all the pale decayed objects, not even the withered bridal dress on the collapsed form could have looked so like grave-clothes, or the long veil so like a shroud.
1	"I hear you, sir, in the dark, but I'm a-gropin--a-gropin--let me catch hold of your hand."
1	‘You are monstrous polite, ma’am,’ said Miss Price.
1	Does he think to reduce me by long absence?
1	And in this nation, there are fifty millions of money.
1	Here was the broken pavement, worn, so long ago, by pious feet, that Time, stealing on the pilgrims’ steps, had trodden out their track, and left but crumbling stones.
1	It was a very muddy boot, and may introduce the odd circumstance connected with Mr. Cruncher's domestic economy, that, whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots, he often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay.
1	Why indeed, Mrs. Bagnet expresses with the umbrella.
1	‘And I never was so glad to see it.’ ‘Tell your master to make his box-seat wider, then,’ returned the passenger.
1	‘Oh me, oh me!’ exclaimed the wretched Emily, in a tone that might have touched the hardest heart, I should have thought; but there was no relenting in Rosa Dartle’s smile.
1	The young lady has become your sister’s friend; and I wonder that your sister, even on her behalf, has not checked you in this irrational and culpable fancy.’ ‘She has tried, sir, but uselessly.
1	It is a little better than on board the canal boat, but not much.
1	‘Pupil-teacher.’ ‘You come to be a pupil-teacher, and you still go on better and better, and you rise to be a master full of learning and respect.
1	‘As you’re perfect in that,’ resumed Squeers, turning to the boy, ‘go and look after MY horse, and rub him down well, or I’ll rub you down.
1	I will, I will, I will, I will!’ ‘How do you know, you heap of confusion,’ asked Mrs Clennam sternly, ‘that in doing what you are doing now, you are even serving Arthur?’ ‘I don’t know nothing rightly about anything,’ said Affery; ‘and if ever you said a true word in your life, it’s when you call me a heap of confusion, for you two clever ones have done your most to make me such.
1	From this soft mood she was soon aroused, with a very wholesome and refreshing effect, by the voice of Mrs Pipchin outside the door.
1	‘Sir,’ said she in continuation, ‘you are acquainted with the family, and have interested yourself with the family, and are influential with the family.
1	But, I was again taken and condemned.” “If I may ride with you, Citizen Evremonde, will you let me hold your hand?
1	‘Run for Sir Tumley,’ cried Mr. Wititterly, menacing the page with both fists.
1	He still had his wig and gown on, and he said, squaring himself at his late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent Mr. Lorry clean out of the group: “I am glad to have brought you off with honour, Mr. Darnay.
1	In short, there’s a dwelling-house rent-free, attached to my new position, and we must occupy it.’ ‘That’s a gain, John.’ ‘Yes, my dear, it is undoubtedly a gain.’ He gave her a very blithe look, and a very sly look.
1	Nancy's history was no sooner unfolded to him, than he poured forth a shower of mingled threats and execrations; threatened to make her the first victim of the combined ingenuity of Messrs. Blathers and Duff; and actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the assistance of those worthies.
1	A movement of timid curiosity impelled her, when she approached the spot, to glance towards the fire.
1	Alone again, in his own room, Mr Carker applied himself to work, and worked all day.
1	He must have some object.
1	Consequently, though she was very light, she was out of breath and could not speak at first, as she stood panting, and wiping her arms, and looking quietly at us.
1	The name of her great benefactor and friend, who writes it, is Dr. Howe.
1	I’ve prepared the way for you.’ Mr Boffin, entering the usual chamber, laid his stick upon the settle usually reserved for him, thrust his hands into his pockets, and, with his shoulders raised and his hat drooping back upon them, looking disconsolately at Wegg.
1	Estimate for furniture of offices, so much.
1	Eh, brother Ned?’ ‘For nothing at all,’ said brother Ned.
1	‘And somebody’s beating a carpet, I think?’ ‘Mr Fledgeby’s carpet, I dare say,’ replied the smiling lady.
1	We two are good friends; eh, Deputy?’ ‘Jolly good.’ ‘I forgave you the debt you owed me when we first became acquainted, and many of my sixpences have come your way since; eh, Deputy?’ ‘Ah!
1	That was his nephew,’ I replied; ‘whom he adopted, though, as a son.
1	‘That’s not an answer, sir,’ said Mr. Creakle, ‘to my remark.
1	Early to-morrow have your horses ready, so that they may be in starting trim at two o'clock in the afternoon.” “It shall be done!” His manner was so fervent and inspiring, that Mr. Lorry caught the flame, and was as quick as youth.
1	“They'd say,” returned my sister, curtly, “pretty well.
1	I saw him to-night, about eight--helped him to shut up his shop--and he had got the letters then in his hairy cap.
1	In the supper-room of last night, a new fire, piled upon the feathery ashes of the old one, shone upon a homely breakfast of loaves, butter, and milk.
1	Ay, and taking pains, too, for I know what such pains are.
1	I am afraid to see a newspaper, or to hear a word spoken of what is done in London, lest he should have done some violence.’ ‘Then you are not afraid of him for yourself, dear?’ said Bella, after pondering on the words.
1	Mr. Brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend, and resumed: 'Do you know where this poor boy is now?'
1	They all confusedly went out: Louisa crying to him that she forgave him, and loved him still, and that he would one day be sorry to have left her so, and glad to think of these her last words, far away: when some one ran against them.
1	‘Distant and quiet as the North Pole.
1	I can’t find it!’ All this time sobbing, and searching in the little reticule.
1	As a tradesman in the City, too, he began to have an interest in the Lord Mayor, and the Sheriffs, and in Public Companies; and felt bound to read the quotations of the Funds every day, though he was unable to make out, on any principle of navigation, what the figures meant, and could have very well dispensed with the fractions.
1	How easy my path, how much easier than his!
1	I came here to take leave of it before its change.
1	You saw my family with me, perhaps?
1	Its feet, observable beneath the ample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no other covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining icicles.
1	Will you not let me come near you?’ ‘How can you ask me?
1	Julia is steeped in money to the throat, and talks and thinks of nothing else.
1	Somebody said to me, ‘Let us go to the theatre, Copperfield!’ There was no bedroom before me, but again the jingling table covered with glasses; the lamp; Grainger on my right hand, Markham on my left, and Steerforth opposite--all sitting in a mist, and a long way off.
1	Perhaps your friend in the city does.
1	Don't hurry.” He drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and drank it off.
1	He is much to me.’ ‘What can he be to you?’ ‘He can be a rival to me among other things,’ said Bradley.
1	Mrs. Micawber shrieked, and folded Mr. Micawber in her embrace.
1	We must fight our way onward.
1	Two or three Collegians whom they passed, looked after them too, and presently joining Mr Chivery, formed a little group on the Lodge steps, in the midst of which there spontaneously originated a whisper that the Father was going to get his discharge.
1	He opened his eyes after a few seconds, and looked anxiously round.
1	It very nearly drove him to it.’ Whether the deceased might not have been better off if he had emigrated in his bachelor days, was a question which his relict did not stop to consider; for Kate entered the room, with her workbox, in this stage of her reflections; and a much slighter interruption, or no interruption at all, would have diverted Mrs. Nickleby’s thoughts into a new channel at any time.
1	I trust I disturb no one; but there _was_ a paper-knife—O, thank you, I am sure!’ and disappears with her prize.
1	‘Night after night comes and goes, and I have no rest.
1	I showed him, Rigaud, at his window, to Signor Panco, who was often the spy in the day.
1	O poor thing, poor thing!’ These words through her fast-dropping tears.
1	Or do you kiss my hand in the same spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek?” “What spirit was that?” said I.
1	‘Doctor,’ said the turnkey, ‘here’s a gentleman’s wife in want of you without a minute’s loss of time!’ The doctor’s friend was in the positive degree of hoarseness, puffiness, red-facedness, all-fours, tobacco, dirt, and brandy; the doctor in the comparative--hoarser, puffier, more red-faced, more all-fourey, tobaccoer, dirtier, and brandier.
1	‘For this reason,’ resumed Ralph, ‘I address myself to you, ma’am.
1	So I run away that night, and come here, and told ‘em you was my brother, and they believed me, and I’ve been here ever since.’ ‘This poor little Marchioness has been wearing herself to death!’ cried Dick.
1	"But excellent Boythorn might say," returned our host, swelling and growing very red, "I'll be--" "I understand," said Mr. Skimpole.
1	The little man gave a double-knock on the lid of his snuff-box, opened it, took a great pinch, shut it up again, and repeated the words, ‘With you.’ ‘I say, my dear Sir,’ resumed the little man, who seemed to gather confidence from the snuff--‘I say, that her speedy liberation or perpetual imprisonment rests with you, and with you alone.
1	Looking back at him, I thought of the first night of his return, when our positions were reversed, and when I little supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at parting from him as it was now.
1	The rooms are in darkness now; and to see Mr. Bucket with a wax-light in his hand, holding it above his head and taking a sharp mental inventory of the many delicate objects so curiously at variance with himself, would be to see a sight--which nobody DOES see, as he is particular to lock himself in.
1	He held her clasped in his left arm, and between whiles her low voice was heard tenderly imploring him to go away with her.
1	In this dilemma, Mr Pancks, whose resources appeared equal to any emergency in the Patriarchal waters, slipped on his hat, slipped out at the counting-house door, and slipped in again a moment afterwards with an artificial freshness upon him, as if he had been in the country for some weeks.
1	“I was wrong; I ought not to have said so, my dear, either,” said I, patting her cheek as kindly as a rough old fellow like me could pat it, “for your mother’s was one, and so was yours.” “It’s not that I meant, pa,” said Bella.
1	‘Old lady,’ returned Mr Boffin, ‘you keep still.
1	‘Bitter poor, my deary,’ replied the old woman.
1	I couldn’t do it!’ ‘Why not?’ returned the Captain, gazing at him in astonishment.
1	Leaving them together, I went home to Peggotty’s; more melancholy myself, if possible, than I had been yet.
1	I know that a great many empty bottles were one of the consequences of this traffic, and that certain men and boys were employed to examine them against the light, and reject those that were flawed, and to rinse and wash them.
1	Lignum, old boy," kissing him, "one for yourself, three for the children.
1	She was a devoted creature.
1	‘You look very well, Mr. Barkis,’ I said, thinking he would like to know it.
1	Therefore, not to be remiss in his duty as a father, he threw a pair of sea-boots at Pleasant, which she ducked to avoid, and then cried, poor thing, using her hair for a pocket-handkerchief.
1	In fact, Doctor Blimber’s establishment was a great hot-house, in which there was a forcing apparatus incessantly at work.
1	But, supposing it to exist, I doubt its probable efficacy in summoning the wandering sheep to one great fold, simply because of the immense amount of dissent which prevails at home; and because I do not find in America any one form of religion with which we in Europe, or even in England, are unacquainted.
1	What harmony, besides her age and her simplicity, surrounded her, he did not know, but even in this fantastic action there was a something neither out of time nor place: a something which it seemed as if nobody else could have made as serious, or done with such a natural and touching air.
1	'If your answer be what I almost dare to hope it is,' retorted Harry, 'it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way, and light the path before me.
1	‘You won’t do it agin,’ said the boy, nodding his head and drawing back, with the elbows ready in case of the worst; ‘now--’ ‘Stand still, you dog,’ said Quilp.
1	Captain Gills, if you could enter into this arrangement, and could answer for Lieutenant Walters, it would be a relief to my feelings that I should think cheap at the sacrifice of a considerable portion of my property.’ ‘My lad,’ returned the Captain, ‘say no more.
1	“Extermination.” The hungry man repeated, in a rapturous croak, “Magnificent!” and began gnawing another finger.
1	He got down, and looked eagerly inside for the beautiful young lady.
1	she said in a whisper.
1	He says he takes Digby to be more knave than fool; and old Fluggers, who does the heavy business you know, HE says that when he delivered messages at Covent Garden the season before last, there used to be a pickpocket hovering about the coach-stand who had exactly the face of Digby; though, as he very properly says, Digby may not be the same, but only his brother, or some near relation.’ ‘Oh!’ cried Nicholas again.
1	Conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy; but when, in the case of a boy, that secret burden co-operates with another secret burden down the leg of his trousers, it is (as I can testify) a great punishment.
1	I somehow made it out that when ladies had bad homes and mothers, they went wrong in their way, too; but that their way was not so foul a one as mine, and they had need to bless God for it.
1	‘Yes; I’m going, Captain, if you please,’ said Rob.
1	They joked freely with one another, but seldom with him.
1	But I shall call you the master.” So I went up to the top of the house and he showed me the handsome girl (very well worth looking at she was), and I was called the master.
1	There is an ordinary for ladies, and an ordinary for gentlemen.
1	"Besides," he said, pursuing his argument in his tone of light-hearted conviction, "if I don't go anywhere for pain--which would be a perversion of the intention of my being, and a monstrous thing to do--why should I go anywhere to be the cause of pain?
1	You know the accused to be the husband of my daughter.
1	Here I am, sir!” Mr. Lorry handed him a paper through the throng.
1	In some few months less than another year, you know, I shall carry Pussy off from school as Mrs. Edwin Drood.
1	Then the cake was cut, and passed through the ring; the young ladies saved pieces to put under their pillows to dream of their future husbands on; and a great deal of blushing and merriment was thereby occasioned.
1	‘What course for me then?
1	He is a stoutly built, steady-looking, sharp-eyed man in black, of about the middle-age.
1	"That's the thing, sir," repeated Richard with the greatest enthusiasm.
1	Noah Claypole, or Morris Bolter as the reader pleases, punctually followed the directions he had received, which--Master Bates being pretty well acquainted with the locality--were so exact that he was enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question, or meeting with any interruption by the way.
1	Amy,’ said the father, passing his pocket-handkerchief several times across his face, and then grasping it convulsively in the hand that dropped across his knee, ‘I have done what I could to keep you select here; I have done what I could to retain you a position here.
1	There was a hurry, too, in all his thoughts, a turbulent and heated working of his heart, that contended against resignation.
1	How’s that?’ ‘I don’t want to deceive you.
1	Under existing circumstances, there is no place like a great city when you are once in it.
1	Then, that is why it makes me wretched.” Now, if I could have believed that she favored Drummle with any idea of making me--me--wretched, I should have been in better heart about it; but in that habitual way of hers, she put me so entirely out of the question, that I could believe nothing of the kind.
1	‘There is nothing else in all the world,’ she said, ‘that would have wrung denial from me.
1	Doyce smiled, as he said to Clennam, ‘You see, my experience of these things does not begin with myself.
1	When I said to him that I hoped Mrs. Steerforth and Miss Dartle were well, he answered respectfully (and of course respectably), that they were tolerably well, he thanked me, and had sent their compliments.
1	No, to be sure,’ he added quickly, in anticipation of what the old man was going to say, ‘there’s not much business doing there, I know; but you can make him clean the place out, polish up the instruments; drudge, Mr Gills.
1	Round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on, the Marquis looked, with the air of one who was coming near home.
1	What of it?’ ‘When do you think he ever told her that before?
1	About the time of twilight, Mr Dombey, grievously afflicted with aches and pains, was helped into his carriage, and propped with cloaks and pillows on one side of it, while his confidential agent bore him company upon the other.
1	If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were poisons in themselves, I would not have administered any of those.
1	Thus John Rokesmith in the morning, and it buried John Harmon still many fathoms deeper than he had been buried in the night.
1	And now, old chap,” said Joe, conveying to me a sensation, first of burning and then of freezing, for I felt as if that familiar expression were applied to Miss Havisham,--“and now, old chap, may we do our duty!
1	‘Now, are you a-comin’?’ ‘Vait a minit, Sammy,’ replied Mr. Weller, who, having tied his shawl with the aid of a small glass that hung in the window, was now, by dint of the most wonderful exertions, struggling into his upper garments.
1	‘I would far rather not see Mr Clennam.’ ‘Oh, fie, fie, my dear, that’s folly.
1	My Lady, as on that day, sits before the fire with her screen in her hand.
1	‘You needn’t, if you don’t like, ma’am,’ was his answer.
1	And yet as I sit at work, I smell miles of flowers.
1	‘I could not have done it, but for the fortune in the waterproof belt round my body.
1	I'll point her out at the proper time,' said Fagin.
1	What does he send me?” Defarge gave into his anxious hand, an open scrap of paper.
1	Riderhood, leaning back in his wooden arm-chair with his arms folded on his breast, looked at him lying with his right hand clenched in his sleep and his teeth set, until a film came over his own sight, and he slept too.
1	"I knew this person by sight very well," says he.
1	And there really was a churchyard outside under some cloisters, for I saw the gravestones from the staircase window.
1	Every benevolent inhabitant of this retreat had his name inscribed upon his stomach.
1	Whenever Mr Carker turned his eyes to that side of the road, he still saw Toodle Junior holding his course, apparently without distress, and working himself along by the elbows after the most approved manner of professional gentlemen who get over the ground for wagers.
1	‘Hurrah!’ echoed Mr. Pickwick, taking off his hat and dashing it on the floor, and insanely casting his spectacles into the middle of the kitchen.
1	Of there being a breakfast, with abundance of things, pretty and substantial, to eat and drink, whereof I partake, as I should do in any other dream, without the least perception of their flavour; eating and drinking, as I may say, nothing but love and marriage, and no more believing in the viands than in anything else.
1	‘Come, boy, come--’ and so submitted to be led away.
1	I am confident he wants strength of purpose.
1	These are all yawning, for no crumb of amusement ever falls from Jarndyce and Jarndyce (the cause in hand), which was squeezed dry years upon years ago.
1	I begin to think he’ll never wake,’ observed Miss Sally.
1	On which occasion,’ added Mrs Merdle, quitting her nest, and putting something in Fanny’s hand, ‘Miss Dorrit will permit me to say Farewell with best wishes in my own dull manner.’ The sisters rose at the same time, and they all stood near the cage of the parrot, as he tore at a claw-full of biscuit and spat it out, seemed to mock them with a pompous dance of his body without moving his feet, and suddenly turned himself upside down and trailed himself all over the outside of his golden cage, with the aid of his cruel beak and black tongue.
1	‘In this house, in the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Crummles, who have brought up a talented and virtuous family, to be blessings and phenomenons, and what not, are we to hear talk of nooses?’ ‘Folair,’ said Mr. Crummles, deeming it a matter of decency to be affected by this allusion to himself and partner, ‘I’m astonished at you.’ ‘What are you going on in this way at me for?’ urged the unfortunate actor.
1	Lenville requests Mr. Johnson not to neglect making an appointment, as he has invited two or three professional friends to witness the ceremony, and cannot disappoint them upon any account whatever.
1	‘I suppose he will be back soon,’ he replied; ‘he has cut out and left me expecting him back, in an odd way.
1	Hearing that his examination (as he called it) was now over, Mr. Skimpole left the room with a radiant face to fetch his daughters (his sons had run away at various times), leaving my guardian quite delighted by the manner in which he had vindicated his childish character.
1	Go ahead you, and keep out in pretty open water, that I mayn’t get fouled again.’ His directions were obeyed, and they pulled ashore directly; two in one boat, two in the other.
1	The projects with which she beguiled her illness, for little Esther's education, and little Esther's marriage, and even for her own old age as the grandmother of little Esther's little Esthers, was so prettily expressive of devotion to this pride of her life that I should be tempted to recall some of them but for the timely remembrance that I am getting on irregularly as it is.
1	asked Mr. Smallweed with his hand to his ear.
1	Whether there was anything in the peculiar slyness of her action which fascinated Mr Quilp, or anything in the expression of her features at the moment which attracted his attention for some other reason; or whether it merely occurred to him as a pleasant whim to stare the small servant out of countenance; certain it is, that he planted his elbows square and firmly on the desk, and squeezing up his cheeks with his hands, looked at her fixedly.
1	They walked all day, and slept that night at a small cottage where beds were let to travellers.
1	If he could see the least sparkle of relief in her face now?
1	On one side of the house was a little stable, just the size for the pony, with a little room over it, just the size for Kit.
1	A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in at every place, high and low, from the king's palace to the criminal's gaol.
1	The demoniacal passion of this Neville Landless,     his strength in his fury, and his savage rage for the destruction of     its object, appal me.
1	The heavy pillars which support the roof engender masses of black shade, but between them there are lanes of light.
1	All that she saw was new and wonderful, but it was not real; it seemed to her as if those visions of mountains and picturesque countries might melt away at any moment, and the carriage, turning some abrupt corner, bring up with a jolt at the old Marshalsea gate.
1	He started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his shoulder.
1	To Mr. Chestle, a hop-grower.’ I am terribly dejected for about a week or two.
1	But I know that when I saw her turn round, in the grave light of the old staircase, and wait for us, above, I thought of that window; and I associated something of its tranquil brightness with Agnes Wickfield ever afterwards.
1	Traddles pretended for a little while to be busily looking among the papers.
1	Now I am going to tell you all I can about them, because I know that is what you most want to hear.
1	But he had so high a sense of his hospitable and responsible position as our entertainer, and my guardian laughed so sincerely at and with Mr. Skimpole, as a child who blew bubbles and broke them all day long, that matters never went beyond this point.
1	To them I wish to add the money as she come away with.
1	‘We have a good many of them; that boy’s one.’ ‘Him in the next box?’ said Snawley.
1	‘Hush!’ he said, in a low voice.
1	A minute might have been consumed in the ascertaining of these points, when Miss Fanny, who, from her seat in the carriage, commanded the long narrow passage leading to the Lodge, flushed indignantly.
1	I hope everybody here will lead them to believe that I died defying them, consistently and perseveringly, as I did through so many years."
1	All these are roads to ruin.
1	‘You are very kind,’ said Mrs. Nickleby, hesitating; ‘but--’ ‘There’s not a but in the case, my dear Mrs. Nickleby,’ remonstrated Mr Pluck; ‘not such a word in the vocabulary.
1	Not so Miss Tox, who, having listened to Mr Dombey with even a more emphatic attention than usual, and with a more expressive tendency of her head to one side, now leant across the table, and said to Mrs Chick softly: ‘Louisa!’ ‘My dear,’ said Mrs Chick.
1	"That is quite right," said the lady, "Miss Donny."
1	They are the city scavengers, these pigs.
1	Every one of 'em's doing of it, from the time when I don't get up, to the time when I don't go to bed.
1	Edith’s drawings were strewn about the room, a little more abundantly than usual perhaps; and Withers, the wan page, handed round a little stronger tea.
1	‘Well, what is it?’ ‘Dodson and Fogg have taken Mrs. Bardell in execution for her costs, Sir,’ said Job.
1	‘I have often said I would,’ she remarked, in a threatening manner, to herself, that morning, with many twitches of her head, ‘and now I will!’ Spurring herself on to the accomplishment of this desperate design, with a sharpness that was peculiar to herself, Susan Nipper haunted the hall and staircase during the whole forenoon, without finding a favourable opportunity for the assault.
1	I should be dead in a week.
1	‘The agent at Liverpool said he had been obliged to you many times when you were in business, and he would be glad to take him on your recommendation.’ ‘That’s well,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	'All I know is,' said Mr. Losberne, at last:  sitting down with a kind of desperate calmness, 'that we must try and carry it off with a bold face.
1	‘Don’t take it to heart,’ said Nicholas; ‘it’s of no consequence; you see I don’t care about it; you followed the wrong person, that’s all.’ That WAS all.
1	The Spirit gazed upon him mildly.
1	He married his second wife privately, because he was proud, and in course of time she died.
1	I am aware, sir, that it would not become me to carry on my little traffic under the windows of your mansion.
1	I cannot resist your prayer.
1	Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass got into the bin; Mr. Pickwick ascended to his perch, and deposited his feet on a floor-clothed shelf, erected beneath it for that purpose.
1	‘The quick eye of affection is not easily blinded, when of the female sex.
1	But I think it must have been by something more than chance, for that child--You remember the bills upon the walls at home?’ ‘Confound the bills upon the walls at home!
1	I shook my fists at Jip, who was as frantic as myself.
1	But I pretend to-night that I am at a party.’ As she made the confession, timidly hesitating, she raised her eyes to the face, and read its expression so plainly that she answered it.
1	Do you guess that I have come to remind you of a promise?'
1	What will he like him to be called?
1	That’s what _I_ call education.’ ‘I think your good sense will perceive,’ Mr. Gradgrind remonstrated in all humility, ‘that whatever the merits of such a system may be, it would be difficult of general application to girls.’ ‘I don’t see it at all, sir,’ returned the obstinate Bounderby.
1	How many sich birds are perpetually moulting, and putting their beaks through the wires to peck at all mankind!’ This poetic figure, which Kit took to be in a special allusion to his own checked waistcoat, quite overcame him; Mr Brass’s voice and manner added not a little to its effect, for he discoursed with all the mild austerity of a hermit, and wanted but a cord round the waist of his rusty surtout, and a skull on the chimney-piece, to be completely set up in that line of business.
1	If I could be at all useful in a pecuniary point of view, I should glide into the silent tomb with ease and smoothness.’ Mr Toots said no more, but slipped out quietly and shut the door upon himself, to cut the Captain off from any reply.
1	If it hadn't been for the girl, I might have died.'
1	‘There is no reason why you should thank me.’ ‘Why that, Master Copperfield,’ said Uriah, ‘is, in fact, the confidence that I am going to take the liberty of reposing.
1	The rough, irregular stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them, had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own jostling group or crowd, according to its size.
1	‘But two could play at your game,’ said Riderhood, snapping his fingers at him half a dozen times, ‘and I played it long ago; long afore you tried your clumsy hand at it; in days when you hadn’t begun croaking your lecters or what not in your school.
1	The world, however, was not in fault in Kit’s case.
1	The trooper yielding to this invitation, he and Mr. Bagnet, not to embarrass the domestic preparations, go forth to take a turn up and down the little street, which they promenade with measured tread and folded arms, as if it were a rampart.
1	We must marry--ha--we must marry _you_, now.’ With that he went, more slowly and more tired, up the staircase to his rooms, and, almost as soon as he got there, dismissed his valet.
1	The sagacious Smallweed supplies him with the newspaper and occasionally drops his eye upon him from the landing as a precaution against his becoming disgusted with waiting and making an untimely departure.
1	Miss Havisham had sent for me, to see if she could take a fancy to me.
1	But the Major cut him short by giving him to understand that he followed his own inclinations, and that they had risen up in a body and said with one accord, ‘J.
1	It told me that the writer had bred her in secrecy from her birth, had blotted out all trace of her existence, and that if the writer were to die before the child became a woman, she would be left entirely friendless, nameless, and unknown.
1	Now, boys,’ said Mrs. Squeers, mimicking, as nearly as she could, the voice and manner of the usher.
1	But, in the composure of his manner he was unaltered, except that to the shrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him, like a cold wind.
1	No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had gone out of the wine-shop singly.
1	‘If I hadn’t a family, and that family hadn’t the cowpock,’ said the waiter, ‘I wouldn’t take a sixpence.
1	They're early with the kitchen fire, and that denotes good servants.
1	Scarcely that, for it was a look of astonished and keen inquiry.
1	The room was very dark, too dark to be observed with any accuracy, though Scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse, anxious to know what kind of room it was.
1	Seeing that the happiness her mind could realise was all shining upon him, Arthur kept that single figure before her; and so they rode brightly through the poor streets in the prison neighbourhood to carry him the great news.
1	‘Not they, sir,’ replied Mr. Weller, touching his hat.
1	Her ladyship, my Mistress, coming in one day when I was alone, and at the height of feeling that I could support it no longer, I told her I must go.
1	“Why don't you answer--” “Pip,” returned Joe, cutting me short as if he were hurt, “which I meantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself and me, and which you know the answer to be full well No.
1	‘Now there,’ said Mr Meagles softly, as he gave a turn to the dumb-waiter on his right hand to twirl the sugar towards himself.
1	There was no carelessness, no languor, no idle curiosity; none of the many shades of indifference to be seen in all other assemblies, visible for one moment there.
1	"I am not at all surprised to hear it."
1	Nay, the very possibility of contradiction or disproof, however remote, communicates to this feminine judgment from the first, in nine cases out of ten, the weakness attendant on the testimony of an interested witness; so personally and strongly does the fair diviner connect herself with her divination.
1	Quite wondering at this discovery, Walter gave a single knock.
1	If they HAD called themselves rich, most likely they wouldn’t have been so.’ ‘They lived and died very miserably.
1	It’s my leg, it’s my leg.
1	It is certain that the more reduced and necessitous they were, the more pompously the skeleton emerged from its tomb; and that when there was anything particularly shabby in the wind, the skeleton always came out with the ghastliest flourish.
1	That, here he had a plan of action to recommend, with a conditional clause.
1	The place was intolerably dirty, and the smell of tobacco smoke perfectly suffocating.
1	Mr Headstone comes and confides in me, in a very delicate way, and says, “I hope my marrying your sister would be agreeable to you, Hexam, and useful to you?” I say, “There’s nothing in the world, Mr Headstone, that I could be better pleased with.” Mr Headstone says, “Then I may rely upon your intimate knowledge of me for your good word with your sister, Hexam?”  And I say, “Certainly, Mr Headstone, and naturally I have a good deal of influence with her.” So I have; haven’t I, Liz?’ ‘Yes, Charley.’ ‘Well said!
1	I must settle this before I sleep.
1	As it was of no use going on in that way, I put the paper down, took a peep at my bonnet in the glass to see if it was neat, and looked at the room, which was not half lighted, and at the shabby, dusty tables, and at the piles of writings, and at a bookcase full of the most inexpressive-looking books that ever had anything to say for themselves.
1	He raised his voice and called ‘Eugene!
1	But when they came to the town of Beauvais--which they did at eventide, when the streets were filled with people--he could not conceal from himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming.
1	It was a song that imitated the measure of beating upon iron, and was a mere lyrical excuse for the introduction of Old Clem's respected name.
1	Let me go to the door.” He took the lamp in his hand, crossed the two intervening outer rooms, and opened it.
1	We won’t be hard about terms, but you shall pay if you will.’ ‘On that understanding,’ said my aunt, ‘though it doesn’t lessen the real obligation, I shall be very glad to leave him.’ ‘Then come and see my little housekeeper,’ said Mr. Wickfield.
1	And high was her reward, when one Saturday evening, as little Paul was sitting down as usual to ‘resume his studies,’ she sat down by his side, and showed him all that was so rough, made smooth, and all that was so dark, made clear and plain, before him.
1	I felt that, at the time.’ He drew his friend closer to him.
1	We traversed but one side of the square, however, and at the end of it she stopped, and put her candle down and opened a door.
1	My guardian himself saw him before he was left for the night and reported to me when he returned to the growlery to write a letter on the boy's behalf, which a messenger was charged to deliver at day-light in the morning, that he seemed easier and inclined to sleep.
1	‘It was all right.’ Again I answered, ‘Oh!’ ‘You know who was willin’,’ said my friend.
1	Where do you think of going, Dan?’ ‘I shall go back to the factory,’ said Dan.
1	Not unless he gets out, I won't!"
1	'Nor heard anything about him?'
1	Was there ever such a mother as Kit’s mother, on her son’s showing; or was there ever such comfort in poverty as in the poverty of Kit’s family, if any correct judgment might be arrived at, from his own glowing account!
1	"Half after nine, sir," repeats Mr. Snagsby.
1	The dinner was as remarkable for the splendour and completeness of its appointments as the mansion itself, and the company were remarkable for doing it ample justice, in which respect Messrs Pyke and Pluck particularly signalised themselves; these two gentlemen eating of every dish, and drinking of every bottle, with a capacity and perseverance truly astonishing.
1	‘There is a furnished little set of chambers to be let in the Adelphi, Trot, which ought to suit you to a marvel.’ With this brief introduction, she produced from her pocket an advertisement, carefully cut out of a newspaper, setting forth that in Buckingham Street in the Adelphi there was to be let furnished, with a view of the river, a singularly desirable, and compact set of chambers, forming a genteel residence for a young gentleman, a member of one of the Inns of Court, or otherwise, with immediate possession.
1	First, of my present, before I touch upon my future.
1	He is my uncle, but he is a villain, and has done me wrong.’ ‘Has he though?’ asked Smike, bending eagerly forward.
1	But, imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class, opportunity had developed her into a tigress.
1	Sometimes, when she was in the outer circle of assemblies--at their own residence, at Mrs Merdle’s, or elsewhere--she would find herself stealthily supported round the waist by Mr Sparkler’s arm.
1	Who told him not to come?
1	Now, gentlemen.’ As the three went out together, and Riderhood slouched off from under the trembling lamp his separate way, Lightwood asked the officer what he thought of this?
1	James Harthouse begged her to take his arm; and as they moved on very slowly, asked her how the robbery had been committed.
1	As the elder Mr. Weller insisted on selling out his portion forthwith, they proceeded from the bank to the gate of the Stock Exchange, to which Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, after a short absence, returned with a cheque on Smith, Payne, & Smith, for five hundred and thirty pounds; that being the money to which Mr. Weller, at the market price of the day, was entitled, in consideration of the balance of the second Mrs. Weller’s funded savings.
1	What could I do t’ hinder her?
1	‘You see,’ said Mr. Crummles, ‘it’s sure to go, on such an occasion, and even if it should not work up quite as well as we expect, why it will be her risk, you know, and not ours.’ ‘Yours, you mean,’ said Nicholas.
1	Have you seen that?’ ‘Ah!
1	But she is proud, is she not?"
1	"But would you allow me the favour of a minute's private conversation?"
1	He'd set upon a post at a street corner eight or ten hours at a stretch if he undertook to do it."
1	I have no time to waste."
1	Some of them were most ferocious-looking ruffians, who stared at me as I went by; and stopped, perhaps, and called after me to come back and speak to them, and when I took to my heels, stoned me.
1	Don’t forget to apply it, another time, Mary Anne.’ This said, Miss Peecher finished the watering of her flowers, and went into her little official residence, and took a refresher of the principal rivers and mountains of the world, their breadths, depths, and heights, before settling the measurements of the body of a dress for her own personal occupation.
1	‘Drive slowly anywhere,’ Mrs Lammle called to her coachman, ‘and don’t let the carriage rattle.’ ‘It MUST be more dropping down, I think,’ said Mr Boffin to himself.
1	I think it came on "for further directions"--about some bill of costs, to the best of my understanding, which was confused enough.
1	Separating these, the board and trestles became a counter, the basket supplied the few small lots of fruit and sweets that he offered for sale upon it and became a foot-warmer, the unfolded clothes-horse displayed a choice collection of halfpenny ballads and became a screen, and the stool planted within it became his post for the rest of the day.
1	She was toiling up the great, wide, vacant staircase, with him in her arms; his head was lying on her shoulder, one of his arms thrown negligently round her neck.
1	With some incoherent half-formed thought to that effect, he turned under the blows that were blinding him and mashing his life, and closed with a murderer, whom he caught by a red neckerchief--unless the raining down of his own blood gave it that hue.
1	She was very fond of me--made me this waistcoat, Tom.” ‘“Did she?” said Tom Smart.
1	No trees were to be seen, nor any vegetable growth save a poor brown scrubby moss, freezing in the chinks of rock.
1	"And then I said Bleak House was thinning fast; and so it was, my dear."
1	As the old woman, with a gigantic and distorted image of herself thrown half upon the wall behind her, half upon the roof above, sat bending over the few loose bricks within which it was pent, on the damp hearth of the chimney--for there was no stove--she looked as if she were watching at some witch’s altar for a favourable token; and but that the movement of her chattering jaws and trembling chin was too frequent and too fast for the slow flickering of the fire, it would have seemed an illusion wrought by the light, as it came and went, upon a face as motionless as the form to which it belonged.
1	‘Pay five shillings for you indeed!’ Miss Wren proceeded; ‘how many hours do you suppose it costs me to earn five shillings, you infamous boy?--Don’t cry like that, or I’ll throw a doll at you.
1	I labour under the same kind of astonishment to this day, having invariably observed that of all human weaknesses, the one to which our common nature is the least disposed to confess (I cannot imagine why) is the weakness of having gone to sleep in a coach.
1	‘Yes,’ said the child, hesitating whether to enter or retreat, for the dwarf just roused, with his dishevelled hair hanging all about him and a yellow handkerchief over his head, was something fearful to behold; it’s only me, sir.’ ‘Come in,’ said Quilp, without getting off the desk.
1	We made no more provision for growing older, than we did for growing younger.
1	Let’s get the scaffolding up, then, for a pair of whiskers.
1	It is much better as it is!’ Agnes is downstairs, when I go into the parlour; and I give her the message.
1	On each of these bridges sits a man: dozing or reading, or talking to an idle companion.
1	What does he do that for?
1	After looking from Job to Jingle, and from Jingle to Job in profound silence, he softly ejaculated the words, ‘Well, I _am_ damn’d!’ which he repeated at least a score of times; after which exertion, he appeared wholly bereft of speech, and again cast his eyes, first upon the one and then upon the other, in mute perplexity and bewilderment.
1	HEEP has, on several occasions, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, systematically forged, to various entries, books, and documents, the signature of Mr. W.; and has distinctly done so in one instance, capable of proof by me.
1	Walking here again, citizeness?” “Yes, citizen.” “Ah!
1	When I do not enjoy the pleasures of the chase, for anything I know he watches at the Temple Gate all night.’ ‘This is an extraordinary story,’ observed Lightwood, who had heard it out with serious attention.
1	'And us come to bring him all these beau-ti-ful things.'
1	'In this very room--in this very bed--I once nursed a pretty young creetur', that was brought into the house with her feet cut and bruised with walking, and all soiled with dust and blood.
1	It is the game of these men, and of their profligate organs, to make the strife of politics so fierce and brutal, and so destructive of all self-respect in worthy men, that sensitive and delicate-minded persons shall be kept aloof, and they, and such as they, be left to battle out their selfish views unchecked.
1	Here the friends, for a short time, separated.
1	If he has a friend here, he will save him the disgrace of the paltry attempt to conceal his name--and utterly useless one--for I will find it out, nor leave him until I have.’ Sir Mulberry looked at him contemptuously, and, addressing his companions, said-- ‘Let the fellow talk, I have nothing serious to say to boys of his station; and his pretty sister shall save him a broken head, if he talks till midnight.’ ‘You are a base and spiritless scoundrel!’ said Nicholas, ‘and shall be proclaimed so to the world.
1	‘Halloa!’ he stammered; ‘I didn’t know you were here.’ ‘Whose name, Tom,’ said Mr. Harthouse, putting his hand upon his shoulder and turning him, so that they all three walked towards the house together, ‘have you been carving on the trees?’ ‘Whose name?’ returned Tom.
1	Leaving him in the hall for a moment, shrunk into the corner of the window-seat and staring with an indifference that scarcely could be called wonder at the comfort and brightness about him, I went into the drawing-room to speak to my guardian.
1	It was not that he was embarrassed, as on that first night with the Wilfer family; he was habitually unembarrassed now, and yet the something remained.
1	Or they would come running out into the balcony; and then Florence would hide herself quickly, lest it should check them in their joy, to see her in her black dress, sitting there alone.
1	Sit down on this chair, close beside me!
1	Oh, no, I don't think so!
1	Mrs Plornish’s father,--a poor little reedy piping old gentleman, like a worn-out bird; who had been in what he called the music-binding business, and met with great misfortunes, and who had seldom been able to make his way, or to see it or to pay it, or to do anything at all with it but find it no thoroughfare,--had retired of his own accord to the Workhouse which was appointed by law to be the Good Samaritan of his district (without the twopence, which was bad political economy), on the settlement of that execution which had carried Mr Plornish to the Marshalsea College.
1	Daniel is an honest man.’ ‘I am so sure of it that I have promptly made up my mind to speak to you.’ ‘You must guide him, you know; you must steer him; you must direct him; he is one of a crotchety sort,’ said Mr Meagles, evidently meaning nothing more than that he did new things and went new ways; ‘but he is as honest as the sun, and so good night!’ Clennam went back to his room, sat down again before his fire, and made up his mind that he was glad he had resolved not to fall in love with Pet.
1	'That's just what it was!'
1	‘It’s light enough for me,’ said Mr Merdle.
1	Mrs. Steerforth was very glad to see me, and said that he had gone away with one of his Oxford friends to see another who lived near St. Albans, but that she expected him to return tomorrow.
1	Why is it?’ said Florence, ‘Won’t you tell me?’ For Susan was shaking her head.
1	The week had gone round to the Saturday following that beating of my heart in the church; and every day had been so bright and blue that to ramble in the woods, and to see the light striking down among the transparent leaves and sparkling in the beautiful interlacings of the shadows of the trees, while the birds poured out their songs and the air was drowsy with the hum of insects, had been most delightful.
1	Oh!’ cried the little creature, holding out her hand and looking upward, ‘how they sing!’ There was something in the face and action for the moment, quite inspired and beautiful.
1	So we were left to take leave of one another without any restraint.
1	“I look to the pleasure of seeing you again in the morning.
1	He had been in that place six nights a week for many years, but had never been observed to raise his eyes above his music-book, and was confidently believed to have never seen a play.
1	‘I wanted to have a little bit o’ conwersation with you, sir,’ said Mr. Weller, ‘if you could spare me five minits or so, sir.’ ‘Certainly,’ replied Mr. Pickwick.
1	It was a great exertion for Newman Noggs, and nobody knows to this day how he ever came to make it, the other party being wholly unknown to him, but he drew a long breath and actually said, out loud, without once stopping, that if the young gentleman did not object to tell, he should like to know what his uncle was going to do for him.
1	‘My mother lives in a most primitive manner down in that dreary red-brick dungeon at Hampton Court,’ said Gowan.
1	‘That is the principal, I may say the only difficulty, my dear Mr. Copperfield,’ assented his wife.
1	I have had some slight correspondence with your former friend, sir,’ addressing me, ‘but it has not restored his sense of duty or natural obligation.
1	If you have a suspicion in your own breast, keep that suspicion in your own breast.
1	He had undergone the ordinary transitions from the height of conviviality to the depth of misery, and from the depth of misery to the height of conviviality.
1	Your good opinion is a consolation to me.
1	The thunder was rolling into distance, and the rain was pouring down like a deluge, when the door of his room opened.
1	He has a great liking for Mrs. Rouncewell; he says she is a most respectable, creditable woman.
1	She remonstrates, laughing, and is a childish schoolgirl again.
1	While Mr Quilp, in his uproarious hospitality, seated himself upon an empty beer-barrel, vaunted the place as the most beautiful and comfortable in the three kingdoms, and elevating his glass, drank to their next merry-meeting in that jovial spot; and Mr Brass, with the rain plashing down into his tea-cup, made a dismal attempt to pluck up his spirits and appear at his ease; and Tom Scott, who was in waiting at the door under an old umbrella, exulted in his agonies, and bade fair to split his sides with laughing; while all this was passing, Miss Sally Brass, unmindful of the wet which dripped down upon her own feminine person and fair apparel, sat placidly behind the tea-board, erect and grizzly, contemplating the unhappiness of her brother with a mind at ease, and content, in her amiable disregard of self, to sit there all night, witnessing the torments which his avaricious and grovelling nature compelled him to endure and forbade him to resent.
1	I am ashamed to have brought Mr Headstone with me.
1	This was not a cheering preparation for my visit, and I could have dispensed with the company of Mr. Vholes, when Richard (who arrived within a minute or two after me) brought him to share our dinner.
1	The howl and roar, the rattling of the doors and windows, the rumbling in the chimneys, the apparent rocking of the very house that sheltered me, and the prodigious tumult of the sea, were more fearful than in the morning.
1	Please see to it yourself.
1	You can say I am coming.'
1	‘If you only knew how I have loved that man--’ Don’t distress yourself by recollecting it, ma’am,’ said the bodyguard.
1	Captain Cuttle picked up his hat, and having turned it over with a look of interest and welcome, began to polish it on his sleeve.
1	‘Madam,’ he said, ‘I know, and knew before to-day, that I have found no favour with you; and I knew why.
1	'I have been lingering here these two hours.
1	Mr. Pickwick was fast asleep in bed, when his early visitor, followed by Sam, entered the room.
1	Such a thought never came into my head!
1	His visitor observed the look, and proceeded.
1	There are powdered heads from time to time in the little windows of the hall, looking out at the untaxed powder falling all day from the sky; and in the same conservatory there is peach blossom turning itself exotically to the great hall fire from the nipping weather out of doors.
1	I mount to the cell, with a fellow-citizen who is one of the Jury, directed by a gaoler.
1	Can be and shall be, on your own terms,’ returned my aunt, ‘if you say the word.
1	It very soon became unnecessary to tell Bella what to look for, and an understanding was established between her and Mr Boffin that she was always to look for Lives of Misers.
1	‘And you shall keep guard on your mistress aloft.’ Diogenes, however, although he had been eyeing his intended breakfast with a watering mouth and glistening eyes, instead of falling to, ravenously, when it was put before him, pricked up his ears, darted to the shop-door, and barked there furiously: burrowing with his head at the bottom, as if he were bent on mining his way out.
1	After hesitating a little, the figure turned back, and, advancing with an air of gentleness and compassion, said: ‘Pardon me, young woman, for speaking to you, but you are under some distress of mind.
1	The world did put it about, that she admired my style.
1	My lot has been so blest that I can relate little of myself which is not a story of goodness and generosity in others.
1	‘My dear Harriet,’ said Mr Morfin, after a silence, ‘I was not prepared for this.
1	attention to YOU, mama,’ rejoined Kate quickly--‘oh yes.’ ‘Dear me, Kate,’ retorted Mrs. Nickleby, ‘what an extraordinary girl you are!
1	We proceeded by appointment straight to Mr. Micawber’s house; where, and at Mr. Wickfield’s, my friend had been labouring ever since our explosive meeting.
1	Oh, the strong eyes, and the weak frame!
1	‘Him, Him, Him!’ ‘Him, him, him?’ repeated Sloppy; staring about, as if for Him.
1	They looked at Stephen’s worn face, rendered more pathetic by the homely emotions it evinced; and, in the kindness of their nature, they were more sorry than indignant.
1	Ada's sleeping-room was all flowers--in chintz and paper, in velvet, in needlework, in the brocade of two stiff courtly chairs which stood, each attended by a little page of a stool for greater state, on either side of the fire-place.
1	If her uncle was turned out of house and home, and forced to lay down in a dyke, Mas’r Davy,’ said Mr. Peggotty, with no less pride than before, ‘it’s my belief she’d go along with him, now!
1	We would beg to call particular attention to the monosyllable at the end of the second and fourth lines, which not only enables the singer to take breath at those points, but greatly assists the metre.
1	Nobody taught him even that much; he found it out.
1	That’s the worst of you.
1	and not my London gentleman?
1	‘He has feigned it often enough to me, of late,’ said Trent.
1	‘I think, my dear,’ said the Golden Dustman, ‘I’ll at once get rid of Wegg for the night, because he’s coming to inhabit the Bower, and it might be put into his head or somebody else’s, if he heard this and it got about that the house is haunted.
1	I dare say it would not be anything like as disagreeable as one supposes.’ Dick had made the suggestion, thinking that the duty might possibly fall within Miss Sally’s department.
1	‘You saucy baggage!’ retorted Mrs Pipchin, rattling at the handle of the door.
1	Young man of the name of Guppy!
1	Take it away!’ As with a set purpose of implying a misgiving that if nourished upon similar meats, she might come to be like that charmer, which would be a fatal consummation.
1	‘What do you say to THAT?’ Pa answered quietly with the counter-question, ‘What did YOU say to that, my love?’ ‘I said No,’ returned Bella sharply.
1	He had a tree on his right, a tree on his left, a third before him, and a fourth behind.
1	I sat looking at her as she cast her eyes down on her work; I sat seeming still to listen to her; and Steerforth, in spite of all my attachment to him, darkened in that tone.
1	From the Palace of the Tuileries, through Monseigneur and the whole Court, through the Chambers, the Tribunals of Justice, and all society (except the scarecrows), the Fancy Ball descended to the Common Executioner: who, in pursuance of the charm, was required to officiate “frizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat, pumps, and white silk stockings.” At the gallows and the wheel--the axe was a rarity--Monsieur Paris, as it was the episcopal mode among his brother Professors of the provinces, Monsieur Orleans, and the rest, to call him, presided in this dainty dress.
1	The possibility of my being brought into contact with my mother, of my being taken to her house, even of Mr. Skimpole's, however distantly associated with me, receiving kindnesses and obligations from her husband, was so painful that I felt I could no longer guide myself without his assistance.
1	I came down again to my dinner; and even the slow comfort of the meal, and the orderly silence of the place--which was bare of guests, the Long Vacation not yet being over--were eloquent on the audacity of Traddles, and his small hopes of a livelihood for twenty years to come.
1	That, rather late in the evening Mr. Wopsle gave us Collins's ode, and threw his bloodstained sword in thunder down, with such effect, that a waiter came in and said, “The Commercials underneath sent up their compliments, and it wasn't the Tumblers' Arms.”  That, they were all in excellent spirits on the road home, and sang, O Lady Fair!
1	and she prayed to Him, this lady did,’ said Polly, affecting herself beyond measure; being heartily in earnest, ‘to teach her little daughter to be sure of that in her heart: and to know that she was happy there and loved her still: and to hope and try--Oh, all her life--to meet her there one day, never, never, never to part any more.’ ‘It was my Mama!’ exclaimed the child, springing up, and clasping her round the neck.
1	On the same occasion I tell you that I am the idlest and least of lawyers, but that I am better than none, in a case I have noted down with my own hand, and that you may be always sure of my best help, and incidentally of Lightwood’s too, in your efforts to clear your father.
1	Through the ragged window-curtain, the light of early day steals in from a miserable court.
1	You'd better bring the boy here to-morrow night.
1	I always knew the real worth of such characters as yours!
1	We all said he had the Devil’s luck and his own, and as it was the kind of night for the Devil to be out and busy, I suppose he was looking over his shoulder, if anybody could have seen him.’ ‘Ah!’ returned the gruff voice; ‘for all old Luke’s winning through thick and thin of late years, I remember the time when he was the unluckiest and unfortunatest of men.
1	Call it at the outside a week.
1	This caused me to feel that I ought to tell her, and Caddy too, that I was going to be the mistress of Bleak House and that if I avoided that disclosure any longer I might become less worthy in my own eyes of its master's love.
1	‘Very well, my dear Sir, very well,’ said Perker.
1	I could sing to him, and talk to him, and show the ardour that I felt in all he did, and attain with labour to such knowledge as most interested him; and I attracted him.
1	'I says, at first, "This is illusion"; and was composing myself off to sleep, when I heerd the noise again, distinct.'
1	I’d ha’ licked a doozen such as him when I was yoong as thee.
1	A bitter sleet came rattling against us here on the east wind, and Joe took me on his back.
1	But,' she said, looking hastily round, 'this fear comes over me again.
1	In case you choose to leave it here, I can do this for you--I can replace this matter on its old footing, and I can go so far besides as to give you a written undertaking that this man Bagnet shall never be troubled in any way until you have been proceeded against to the utmost, that your means shall be exhausted before the creditor looks to his.
1	Books were distributed accordingly, and some half-dozen girls relieved each other in reading paragraphs from English History.
1	Whatever were Mr. Bumble's intentions, however (and no doubt they were of the best): it unfortunately happened, as has been twice before remarked, that the table was a round one; consequently Mr. Bumble, moving his chair by little and little, soon began to diminish the distance between himself and the matron; and, continuing to travel round the outer edge of the circle, brought his chair, in time, close to that in which the matron was seated.
1	"I wish to hear it at the window, then.
1	A gentleman lounging, full dressed, on a sofa, with an opera-glass in his hand, passed before my view, and also my own figure at full length in a glass.
1	But you never have condescended to me, as much as I could have wished.
1	Then will you set about it at once, blacksmith?” said the off-hand sergeant, “as it's on his Majesty's service.
1	I wore a fur great-coat at that time, and before we were well clear of the wharf, he questioned me concerning it, and its price, and where I bought it, and when, and what fur it was, and what it weighed, and what it cost.
1	I know that to anyone but myself--to you, who consider the immeasurable distance between me and this young lady, who is now your ward, and the object of your peculiar care--my loving her, even in thought, must appear the height of rashness and presumption.
1	Don’t you remember it?’ ‘Why, I THOUGHT I remembered it, my dear!’ ‘You should, for you bought it, Pa.’ ‘Yes, I THOUGHT I bought it my dear!’ said the cherub, giving himself a little shake, as if to rouse his faculties.
1	She has found it necessary to make a journey--I trust will shortly return.
1	It is not in tameness of spirit that I submit.
1	‘Enormously Rich, We say,’ returned Mr Podsnap, in a condescending manner.
1	‘A good, contented, well-breakfasted juryman is a capital thing to get hold of.
1	And never believe, dear dear Mr. Woodcourt, never believe that I forget this night or that while my heart beats it can be insensible to the pride and joy of having been beloved by you."
1	‘And, dear Mr Clennam,’ said Minnie, ‘because papa and one whom I need not name, do not fully appreciate and understand one another yet, as they will by-and-by; and because it will be the duty, and the pride, and pleasure of my new life, to draw them to a better knowledge of one another, and to be a happiness to one another, and to be proud of one another, and to love one another, both loving me so dearly; oh, as you are a kind, true man!
1	Where does that responsibility rest?
1	I must put something under the cushion for your head.
1	The smoke-serpents were indifferent who was lost or found, who turned out bad or good; the melancholy mad elephants, like the Hard Fact men, abated nothing of their set routine, whatever happened.
1	He had another reason for this.
1	If you do, well and good.
1	But, there was nothing there.
1	Mr. Weller, habited in his morning jacket, with the black calico sleeves, was returning in a rather desponding state from an unsuccessful survey of the mysterious house with the green gate, when, raising his eyes, he beheld a crowd pouring down the street, surrounding an object which had very much the appearance of a sedan-chair.
1	There were friends who seemed to be always coming and going across the Channel, on errands about the Bourse, and Greek and Spanish and India and Mexican and par and premium and discount and three quarters and seven eighths.
1	The business, the stock, this house, and everything in it, all belong to Miss Knag.’ ‘That’s quite true, Madame Mantalini,’ said Miss Knag, with whom her late employer had secretly come to an amicable understanding on this point.
1	Therefore it is, Mr. Honeythunder, that I consider the platform a sufficiently bad example and a sufficiently bad school, even in public life; but hold that, carried into private life, it becomes an unendurable nuisance.’ ‘These are strong words, sir!’ exclaimed the Philanthropist.
1	Girded round its middle was an antique scabbard; but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust.
1	They listen, and hear his footsteps go back to the gate, and hear the gate close after him.
1	They were a goodly company, and the Innkeepers all but worshipped them.
1	His coat, his waistcoat, his shoes and stockings, his trousers, his hat, his wit and humour, his pathos and his umbrella, all come before me like visions of my youth.
1	Firstly (in a spirit of love), what is the common sort of Terewth--the working clothes--the every-day wear, my young friends?
1	Some dark specks in the snow, like knots upon a little thread, beginning at the convent door and winding away down the descent in broken lengths which were not yet pieced together, showed where the Brethren were at work in several places clearing the track.
1	The night should have turned more wet since I came in, for he had a large sou’wester hat on, slouched over his face.
1	Why, good gracious me, suppose the house was to be let!
1	He is on his last march, miss, and has a whim to see her.
1	“Have you written 'forget them'?” Carton asked.
1	I know you have never liked me, as I have liked you!’ All this time he was squeezing my hand with his damp fishy fingers, while I made every effort I decently could to get it away.
1	As a relief to its contemplation, I will close this chapter with a curious story arising out of the same theme, which was related to me, on the occasion of this visit, by some of the gentlemen concerned.
1	It was quite sad and oppressive, to come upon great tracts where settlers had been burning down the trees, and where their wounded bodies lay about, like those of murdered creatures, while here and there some charred and blackened giant reared aloft two withered arms, and seemed to call down curses on his foes.
1	"And you're doing well, Mr.
1	The officer turned suddenly from the path, and after climbing a paling, and scaling a hedge, entered a secluded field.
1	There--see how this iron bar bends beneath my furious wrench.
1	‘I must move rapidly, or I could not draw my breath.
1	It would also appear from the Contents hereof, that a Joke, even between Husband and Wife, may be sometimes carried too far There are some men who, living with the one object of enriching themselves, no matter by what means, and being perfectly conscious of the baseness and rascality of the means which they will use every day towards this end, affect nevertheless--even to themselves--a high tone of moral rectitude, and shake their heads and sigh over the depravity of the world.
1	Sure he saw the prisoner with these lists?
1	But Florence was not there to look on; and Good Mrs Brown remained unrecognised, and sat staring at her fire, unobserved.
1	But you came to the right shop for mercy when you came to me, and thank your stars that it IS me as has got to serve you with the article.’ Anybody not in Mr. Squeers’s confidence would have supposed that he was quite out of the article in question, instead of having a large stock on hand ready for all comers; nor would the opinion of sceptical persons have undergone much alteration when he followed up the remark by poking Smike in the chest with the ferrule of his umbrella, and dealing a smart shower of blows, with the ribs of the same instrument, upon his head and shoulders.
1	‘I assure you, Mrs. Powler,’ he then said, much exhausted, ‘that the father’s manner prepared me for a grim and stony maturity.
1	But an elderly member of the Jewish persuasion, preserved in rum, followed them close, and looked in at the glass before Mr Rugg had opened one of the day’s letters.
1	‘But hear this first--hear this first, brother Ned,’ said the old man, hastily, placing two chairs, one on each side of Nicholas: ‘I’ll tell it you myself, brother Ned, because the young gentleman is modest, and is a scholar, Ned, and I shouldn’t feel it right that he should tell us his story over and over again as if he was a beggar, or as if we doubted him.
1	Mr Swiveller, without being quite so hot upon the matter, was rather shamed by his friend’s excitement, and not a little puzzled how to act (Kit being quite cool and good-humoured), when the single gentleman was heard to call violently down the stairs.
1	But it would be a hard one to learn, and you have got beyond her, and it's of no use now.” So, with a quiet sigh for me, Biddy rose from the bank, and said, with a fresh and pleasant change of voice, “Shall we walk a little farther, or go home?” “Biddy,” I cried, getting up, putting my arm round her neck, and giving her a kiss, “I shall always tell you everything.” “Till you're a gentleman,” said Biddy.
1	For the better preservation of his cheerfulness therefore, and to prevent his faculties from rusting, he provided himself with a cribbage-board and pack of cards, and accustomed himself to play at cribbage with a dummy, for twenty, thirty, or sometimes even fifty thousand pounds aside, besides many hazardous bets to a considerable amount.
1	Not a single word did Peggotty speak.
1	What could I become with these surroundings?
1	‘The next step was to procure a set of metal types, with the different letters of the alphabet cast upon their ends; also a board, in which were square holes, into which holes she could set the types; so that the letters on their ends could alone be felt above the surface.
1	Upon this head, however, he had no cause for any anxiety, for the whole performance was applauded to the echo, and voluntary contributions were showered in with a liberality which testified yet more strongly to the general delight.
1	There were a large number of attorneys’ clerks to be sworn, and it being a moral impossibility to swear them all at once, the struggles of these gentlemen to reach the clerk in spectacles, were like those of a crowd to get in at the pit door of a theatre when Gracious Majesty honours it with its presence.
1	Men find the bad among us easily enough--among what peoples are the bad not easily found?--but they take the worst of us as samples of the best; they take the lowest of us as presentations of the highest; and they say “All Jews are alike.” If, doing what I was content to do here, because I was grateful for the past and have small need of money now, I had been a Christian, I could have done it, compromising no one but my individual self.
1	‘Kit, they call him.’ ‘Kit, eh!’ said Brass.
1	Don’t take on, ma’am, and be sorry!’ It became intolerable.
1	It comes when we remember nothing but clear skies, green fields, and sweet-smelling flowers--when the recollection of snow, and ice, and bleak winds, has faded from our minds as completely as they have disappeared from the earth--and yet what a pleasant time it is!
1	‘I will not go in just yet,’ said Lizzie.
1	‘My Wal’r, as I used to call you!
1	Grasping the rail, he found that the coach had sunk greatly on one side, though it was still dragged forward by the horses; and while--confused by their plunging and the loud screams of the lady inside--he hesitated, for an instant, whether to jump off or not, the vehicle turned easily over, and relieved him from all further uncertainty by flinging him into the road.
1	You've been in low spirits this afternoon.
1	‘My dear,’ retorted Mrs Chick, in a low voice: ‘Her Mama, all over!’ ‘In-deed!’ said Miss Tox.
1	Pray forgive me.’ But for all he said, his eager eye scanned Mr Dombey’s downcast face none the less closely; and then it shot a strange triumphant look at the picture, as appealing to it to bear witness how he led him on again, and what was coming.
1	“Those rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there are odds and ends upon the ground.
1	This sounded so like a falsehood, that the old gentleman looked somewhat sternly in Oliver's face.
1	At length, quite unexpectedly, he said something in a whisper.
1	‘He’s no more a monster than you are,’ returned Paul.
1	If I have any merit it is consistency.’ The daughter had sat quite silent and still during this speech, with her eyes fixed on the ground; her cousin standing near her, and looking on the ground too.
1	He wished to do anything as laid in his power to serve Miss Dorrit, altogether putting himself out of sight; and he hoped he did.
1	But I come up with ‘em, and I crossed ‘em.
1	Besides the melancholy boy, who, I hoped, had not been made so by waltzing alone in the empty kitchen, there were two other boys and one dirty little limp girl in a gauzy dress.
1	What alone was wanting to the realization of a vast fortune, he considered to be More Capital.
1	Devil a word, gentlemen, the chair would say.
1	The sun was low--near setting--and its light came redly in above, without descending to the ground.
1	‘Ah!’ said the dwarf, smacking his lips, ‘what a nice kiss that was--just upon the rosy part.
1	She was in a state of lawful innocence, so to speak.
1	And at last he flung out in his violent way, and said, with a D, 'Then do as you like.'
1	Now, take a rest, and then we’ll talk again.
1	Often at posting-houses and other halting places, these miserable creatures would appear to her the only realities of the day; and many a time, when the money she had brought to give them was all given away, she would sit with her folded hands, thoughtfully looking after some diminutive girl leading her grey father, as if the sight reminded her of something in the days that were gone.
1	Of my darling being almost smothered among the flowers, and coming out, laughing and crying both together, to my jealous arms.
1	The house in the city preserved its heavy dulness through all these transactions, and the invalid within it turned the same unvarying round of life.
1	‘And whatever you do with your ink, I can’t think, for you’re as clean as a whistle after it.
1	By no means!’ ‘You may remember that the day I arrived in London, and found the house to which I drove, empty and deserted, I was directed by some of the neighbours to you, and waited upon you without stopping for rest or refreshment?’ ‘How precipitate that was, and yet what an earnest and vigorous measure!’ said Quilp, conferring with himself, in imitation of his friend Mr Sampson Brass.
1	He'd find himself growing thin, if he didn't look sharp!"
1	‘More than that, you say, do you?’ cried the other, pushing back his battered hat, and drawing his hand across his forehead.
1	Is this one like me, Mr Noggs?’ This was a puzzling inquiry; but Newman evaded it, by replying to Mr Lillyvick, that he thought the baby might possibly come like him in time.
1	They were not interchanging a word or a look.
1	Are you--are you very poor?’ ‘I am but a wanderer,’ said Walter, ‘making voyages to live, across the sea.
1	It was torturing to me to hear them talk of occurrences in which I had had no share.
1	‘It’s a load off my mind, Trotwood, to have such a partner.’ The red fox made him say all this, I knew, to exhibit him to me in the light he had indicated on the night when he poisoned my rest.
1	Every member of the respectable coterie appeared plunged in his own reflections; not excepting the dog, who by a certain malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an attack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he might encounter in the streets when he went out.
1	It was a strange figure--like a child: yet not so like a child as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view, and being diminished to a child's proportions.
1	Do you hear?” “If those eyes of yours were bed-winches,” returned Miss Pross, “and I was an English four-poster, they shouldn't loose a splinter of me.
1	‘Do you give lessons, ma’am?’ inquired Nicholas.
1	She presented herself to me as the wife of the Marquis St. Evremonde.
1	There was watching enough, now, but it was the watching of strangers who made a greedy trade of it, and who, in the intervals in their attendance upon the sick man huddled together with a ghastly good-fellowship, and ate and drank and made merry; for disease and death were their ordinary household gods.
1	She felt as though she would have been glad that it rang on until daylight; but it ceased, and the circles of its last sound spread out fainter and wider in the air, and all was dead again.
1	We shall never understand each other.” “Such a mean brute, such a stupid brute!” I urged, in despair.
1	Mr Clennam did not increase in favour with the Father of the Marshalsea in the ratio of his increasing visits.
1	Thrown out of his honourable employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard swearing there--not because he was not wanted there; our English reasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern date--he knew that he had crossed the Channel, and accepted service in France: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives.
1	With all her deference for Mr. Bounderby as contradistinguished from his portrait, Mrs. Sparsit had not the smallest intention of interrupting the descent.
1	‘Now, you know.’ ‘Yes, Wegg,’ said Mr Boffin, meekly.
1	Something or somebody had superseded him as a source of interest.
1	As they stood side by side near the carriage door, I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather younger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice, and (as far as I could see) face too.
1	One ought to be civil, you know.’ ‘Dear mama,’ rejoined Kate, ‘don’t say a word to him, but let us run away as fast as we can, and shut ourselves up till Nicholas comes home.’ Mrs. Nickleby looked very grand, not to say contemptuous, at this humiliating proposal; and, turning to the old gentleman, who had watched them during these whispers with absorbing eagerness, said: ‘If you will conduct yourself, sir, like the gentleman I should imagine you to be, from your language and--and--appearance, (quite the counterpart of your grandpapa, Kate, my dear, in his best days,) and will put your question to me in plain words, I will answer it.’ If Mrs. Nickleby’s excellent papa had borne, in his best days, a resemblance to the neighbour now looking over the wall, he must have been, to say the least, a very queer-looking old gentleman in his prime.
1	‘Well, Gowan,’ said Mr Meagles, even suppressing a sigh; ‘how goes the world with you this morning?’ ‘Much as usual, sir.
1	‘Don’t wait, Micawber,’ said Uriah.
1	He was very fond of pickled walnuts, gentlemen.
1	Though in general he highly appreciates the society of Mrs. Bucket--a lady of a natural detective genius, which if it had been improved by professional exercise, might have done great things, but which has paused at the level of a clever amateur--he holds himself aloof from that dear solace.
1	Question: But you think that their abolition would damage a class of practitioners?
1	and when the ugly lame old gardener, who I thought had hardly noticed me in all those years, came panting after the coach to give me a little nosegay of geraniums and told me I had been the light of his eyes--indeed the old man said so!--what a heart I had then!
1	You must exercise the strength of mind for which you are renowned, and make the best of it.’ ‘The girl’s family have made,’ said Mrs Gowan, ‘of course, the most strenuous endeavours to--as the lawyers say--to have and to hold Henry.’ ‘Of course they have, my dear,’ said Mrs Merdle.
1	His wristbands and collar were oppressive; his voice and manner were oppressive.
1	‘I give you my word and honour, sir,’ said Mr. Omer, ‘that when I lay that book upon the table, and look at it outside; compact in three separate and indiwidual wollumes--one, two, three; I am as proud as Punch to think that I once had the honour of being connected with your family.
1	There’ll be beer to feth.
1	There was a spectre always attendant on him, saying to these high priests, ‘Are such the signs you trust, and love to honour; this head, these eyes, this mode of speech, the tone and manner of this man?
1	ha!’ If the proprietor of Dotheboys Hall could have known what was passing in his assistant’s breast at that moment, he would have discovered, with some surprise, that he was as near being soundly pummelled as he had ever been in his life.
1	‘Well, now,’ said Sam, ‘afore these here ladies, I should jest like to ask you, as a sort of curiosity, whether you don’t consider yourself as nice and well-behaved a young gen’l’m’n, as ever used a pink check pocket-handkerchief, and the number four collection?’ ‘And as was ever a-going to be married to a cook,’ said that lady indignantly.
1	‘It’s not as if the theatre was in its high and palmy days--you needn’t stand, Miss Snevellicci--the drama is gone, perfectly gone.’ ‘As an exquisite embodiment of the poet’s visions, and a realisation of human intellectuality, gilding with refulgent light our dreamy moments, and laying open a new and magic world before the mental eye, the drama is gone, perfectly gone,’ said Mr. Curdle.
1	‘How do you know I am old?
1	When you are left alone here with Mrs General--’ ‘I am to be left alone here with Mrs General?’ said Little Dorrit, quietly.
1	I believe I state your views correctly; do I not, my dear Sir?’ said the little man, turning to Mr. Pickwick.
1	I answered, most assuredly he did not.
1	Opening the door with all speed, he beheld the expressive countenance of Mr Chuckster, between whom and himself a fraternal greeting ensued.
1	His friends might advise him, you know; now he is free.
1	Mr Fledgeby was thus amiably engaged when a step was heard at the outer door, and the door was heard to open hastily.
1	I think of seeing her happy, and with friends about her, and brought up as she deserves, and as she ought to be.
1	Do you think that a hundred well-arranged plans, or a hundred suborned witnesses, or a hundred false curs at my heels, or a hundred canting speeches full of oily words, will move me?
1	As she stood behind him, leaning over his chair so lovingly, he looked with downcast eyes at the fire.
1	"Devil doubt him," says Mr. George.
1	I hate your virtuous people!’ said the dwarf, throwing off a bumper of brandy, and smacking his lips, ‘ah!
1	They all agree that she was too high, and Mr Towlinson’s old flame, the housemaid (who is very virtuous), entreats that you will never talk to her any more about people who hold their heads up, as if the ground wasn’t good enough for ‘em.
1	But she, who had heard what passed, and who, besides the relief of so suddenly considering herself safe at her journey’s end, felt reassured beyond all measure by his lively youthful face and manner, ran eagerly up to him, leaving one of the slipshod shoes upon the ground and caught his hand in both of hers.
1	‘Come,’ retorted Quilp, ‘let’s have no more of this!
1	He consumed it in putting his hand to his forehead and taking it away again, and in backing his chair into the corner behind him.
1	‘And you know; at least I hope you know;’ said Mr Podsnap, with severity, ‘that Providence has declared that you shall have the poor always with you?’ The meek man also hoped he knew that.
1	Disposing these articles about him in skilful manner, he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher, extinguished the light, and went out.
1	Those things would be the watch and shirt-pin.
1	Give her the letter, make her take the letter, put it in her pocket by violence.
1	‘The prospect of an addition to your family?’ ‘The seventh addition, Johnson,’ returned Mr. Crummles, solemnly.
1	Heaven save the ladies, how they dress!
1	She held it up as if she were a beautiful Medusa, looking on him, face to face, to strike him dead.
1	But we took a moonlight walk last Monday night, to talk it over at leisure, and I represented the case to him as it really is.
1	What is there you cannot do, if you will!’ ‘Thank you,’ said Fledgeby, ‘you’re very complimentary to say so.
1	“Your head is cool?” he said, touching it.
1	As I had not seen Peepy on the occasion of our last call (when he was not to be found anywhere, and when the cook rather thought he must have strolled away with the dustman's cart), I now inquired for him again.
1	Perhaps this is the reason why it is an article of faith with the servants, handed down from race to race, that the departed Tisher was a hairdresser.
1	I could repeat this in my mind too, but I had not the least idea what it meant.
1	'As weak as water,' replied Mr. Sikes, with an imprecation on his eyes and limbs.
1	Give him the papers, conversation, music, mutton, coffee, landscape, fruit in the season, a few sheets of Bristol-board, and a little claret, and he asked no more.
1	So far, I am rejoiced, I am sure.’ Richard Swiveller, holding Kit’s hat in his hand, was watching the proceedings with great interest, and bore upon his face the slightest possible indication of a smile, as Brass, shutting one of his eyes, looked with the other up the inside of one of the poor fellow’s sleeves as if it were a telescope--when Sampson turning hastily to him, bade him search the hat.
1	‘Confound his impudence!’ muttered Squeers, rapping the stair-rail impatiently with his cane.
1	Then she ran to the old man, who folded her in his arms and bade God bless her.
1	And Hexam--’ ‘Says,’ Mary Anne went on, ‘that he is not pleased with his sister, and that his sister won’t be guided by his advice, and persists in being guided by somebody else’s; and that--’ ‘Mr Headstone coming across the garden!’ exclaimed Miss Peecher, with a flushed glance at the looking-glass.
1	It had been one of the first novelties and pleasures of his freedom, and was equally the delight of his wife.
1	"Are you a married man, sir?"
1	The young woman seemed surprised at his appearance, and asked him where his mother was.
1	My dear boy was not in his usual spirits; he was depressed—I noticed that—and I am bound henceforth to dwell upon the circumstance the more, now that I know there was a special reason for his being depressed: a reason, moreover, which may possibly have induced him to absent himself.’ ‘I pray to Heaven it may turn out so!’ exclaimed Mr. Crisparkle.
1	The Doctor looked desolately round the room, shook his head, and answered, in a low voice, “Not at all.” “Now, as to the future,” hinted Mr. Lorry.
1	Soaking into this filthy ground as you lie here, is your own shape.
1	‘Coach is ready, Sir,’ said Sam, appearing at the door.
1	With which he hurried out of the room, down the stairs, up the coachsteps, and into the coach, without another word.
1	He held out his hand, which Nancy clasped tight in hers.
1	He emptied his glass, looked mysteriously at his companion, winked both of his small eyes, one after the other, and finally made a motion with his arm, as if he were working an imaginary pump-handle; thereby intimating that he (Mr. Trotter) considered himself as undergoing the process of being pumped by Mr. Samuel Weller.
1	You'd be in a Blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion, Jerry!” III.
1	To this decision the middle-aged lady was impelled by a variety of considerations, the chief of which was the incontestable proof it would afford of her devotion to Mr. Peter Magnus, and her anxiety for his safety.
1	The man slept on, indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of brightness, to sunshine on his face and shadow, to the paltering lumps of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed them, until the sun was low in the west, and the sky was glowing.
1	Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened?
1	The man was not unnaturally cruel or hard-hearted.
1	‘Will you try to teach me, Doady?’ ‘I must teach myself first, Dora,’ said I.
1	'Stupid enough, this,' muttered the doctor to himself; 'the boy must have made a mistake.
1	That's the kind of man Mr. Tulkinghorn is!"
1	She put out her hand—a pretty little soft hand; and her fingers closed upon her brother’s, as if she would have carried them to her lips.
1	Our mother died there, when we were little children.
1	‘Shovel and all!’ said Wegg.
1	That’s the way it works.
1	And I have so many old parchmentses and papers in my stock.
1	Mr Merdle turned his tongue in his closed mouth--it seemed rather a stiff and unmanageable tongue--moistened his lips, passed his hand over his forehead again, and looked all round the room again, principally under the chairs.
1	Tumult and frenzy reigned supreme; when a noise arose that drowned all others, and two men, seizing each other by the throat, struggled into the middle of the room.
1	‘Look at his hang-dog air,’ said Lightwood, following.
1	My guardian lay at the Boar in the next room to mine.
1	Some scars on her back.’     ‘Ran away, the Mulatto wench Mary.
1	“Faithful dear boy, well done.
1	Astonished for the moment, Ralph fell back a couple of paces and surveyed him from head to foot.
1	"I don't know who may not, if you may not."
1	But of course I can’t answer for the consequences.
1	"By heaven, he is the proudest fellow breathing.
1	But when I came to think again, I felt sure that I was doing her wrong in this; and so I went on, as I did at first, hoping to see her once more, just as she used to be.
1	There were half-dressed figures tearing to and fro, some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables, others driving the cattle from the yard and out-houses, and others coming laden from the burning pile, amidst a shower of falling sparks, and the tumbling down of red-hot beams.
1	That there was no hope of escape from it, unless the escape was my own act, I knew quite well.
1	"Guv'ner," says Phil with exceeding gravity, "he's a leech in his dispositions, he's a screw and a wice in his actions, a snake in his twistings, and a lobster in his claws."
1	‘Bless the precious boy!’ cried Peggotty, taking hold of me.
1	I have wronged her enough in fact; I have wronged her still more in intention.
1	From Estella she looked at me, with a searching glance that seemed to pry into my heart and probe its wounds.
1	“They exchanged looks, but bent their heads to me as I bent mine to them, and we parted without another word on either side.
1	You know what I mean.
1	"Not so easily as you think.
1	Neither the Saone nor the Rhone sped with the swiftness of that peerless building; nor was the Mediterranean deeper than its foundations; nor were the distant landscapes on the Cornice road, nor the hills and bay of Genoa the Superb, more beautiful.
1	Let us love each other, Di!’ said Florence, fondling his shaggy head.
1	‘And how do you think we are looking, Master Copperfield,--I should say, Mister?’ fawned Uriah.
1	There was an old Roman bath in those days at the bottom of one of the streets out of the Strand--it may be there still--in which I have had many a cold plunge.
1	We can't take THAT in a court of justice, gentlemen.
1	Clennam was quite at home here, in right of Flora, not to mention the Patriarch and Pancks, and kept them in view with ease.
1	‘That’s what you tell this gentleman too, is it?’ ‘If the gentleman comes to ask the same question, I can’t tell him anything else, sir; and I only wish I could, for our own sakes,’ was the reply.
1	‘They know what they’re about, if ever people did,’ murmured Miss Nipper, drawing in her breath ‘oh!
1	This, too, delighted Mr. Skimpole.
1	She began sobbing and weeping (to secure the aunt’s sympathy to herself), and said, ‘Dear aunt, she has an unhappy temper; other girls at school, besides I, try hard to make it better; we all try hard.’ Upon that the aunt fondled her, as if she had said something noble instead of despicable and false, and kept up the infamous pretence by replying, ‘But there are reasonable limits, my dear love, to everything, and I see that this poor miserable girl causes you more constant and useless distress than even so good an effort justifies.’ The poor miserable girl came out of her concealment, as you may be prepared to hear, and said, ‘Send me home.’ I never said another word to either of them, or to any of them, but ‘Send me home, or I will walk home alone, night and day!’ When I got home, I told my supposed grandmother that, unless I was sent away to finish my education somewhere else before that girl came back, or before any one of them came back, I would burn my sight away by throwing myself into the fire, rather than I would endure to look at their plotting faces.
1	The amazement, suspicion, resentment, and shame, with which Arthur looked on at all this, struck him dumb.
1	I was taking my coffee and roll in the morning, before going to the Commons--and I may observe in this place that it is surprising how much coffee Mrs. Crupp used, and how weak it was, considering--when Steerforth himself walked in, to my unbounded joy.
1	Therefore my Lady Dedlock has come away from the place in Lincolnshire and has left it to the rain, and the crows, and the rabbits, and the deer, and the partridges and pheasants.
1	Perhaps I might say better, and yet make no boast of it.’ Poor Little Dorrit, not seeing her way to the offering of any soothing words that would escape repudiation, deemed it best to remain quiet.
1	Whether it was the absence of the fetters or not, it made no very deep impression on Mr. Lenville’s adversary, however, but rather seemed to increase the good-humour expressed in his countenance; in which stage of the contest, one or two gentlemen, who had come out expressly to witness the pulling of Nicholas’s nose, grew impatient, murmuring that if it were to be done at all it had better be done at once, and that if Mr Lenville didn’t mean to do it he had better say so, and not keep them waiting there.
1	You keep him in check, Clennam, with your common sense, and you stick to the Works, Dan, with your--’ ‘Uncommon sense?’ suggested Daniel, with his quiet smile.
1	Three cheers more: and as the first one rings upon our ears, the vessel throbs like a strong giant that has just received the breath of life; the two great wheels turn fiercely round for the first time; and the noble ship, with wind and tide astern, breaks proudly through the lashed and roaming water.
1	My aunt, who had this other general opinion in reference to London, that every man she saw was a pickpocket, gave me her purse to carry for her, which had ten guineas in it and some silver.
1	"Not enough," says the trooper, shaking his head.
1	No wonder.’ ‘No wonder,’ repeated Helena.
1	As Mrs Clennam never removed her eyes from Blandois (on whom they had some effect, as a steady look has on a lower sort of dog), so Jeremiah never removed his from Arthur.
1	I was sent for, and the case was entrusted to me.
1	Turning towards Sam, and raising his hands and eyes in token of the unspeakable sorrow with which he regarded the calamity that had befallen the family, he carried the high-backed chair to his old corner by the fire, and, seating himself on the very edge, drew forth a brown pocket-handkerchief, and applied the same to his optics.
1	‘But what a situation was hers!
1	I was well enough, however, to be up early in the morning, and to return my darling's cheerful blessing from the garden, and to talk with her as long as usual.
1	“If you don’t mind what I say, my boy,” said the father, “you’ll find yourself in bed, in something less than a pig’s whisper.” He gave the child a shake to make him obedient, and such a rattling ensued as nobody ever heard before.
1	‘What’s come to you, Liz?
1	The only pupil who evinced the slightest tendency towards locomotion or playfulness was Master Squeers, and as his chief amusement was to tread upon the other boys’ toes in his new boots, his flow of spirits was rather disagreeable than otherwise.
1	I shouldn’t have had the heart to put on gentleman’s clothes.
1	Mr. Grewgious being of opinion that she could not do better, she withdrew for the purpose.
1	Or so--like a fried fish.
1	Finally, the worthy couple went away arm in arm.
1	‘At what time will it be ready?’ asked Mr Codlin faintly.
1	‘I’ll take down the heads if you please, sir.
1	'All that I could hope to do, and even more.
1	‘A natural ambition enough,’ said Eugene, coolly.
1	‘It is truly painful to contemplate mankind in such an aspect, Master Copperfield, but our reception was, decidedly, cool.
1	Ye who have eyes and see not, and have ears and hear not; ye who are as the hypocrites of sad countenances, and disfigure your faces that ye may seem unto men to fast; learn healthy cheerfulness, and mild contentment, from the deaf, and dumb, and blind!
1	This reply is cut short by Mr. Tulkinghorn's arrival.
1	They told me in low whispers, that the floor of the old house in which my father died, was stained with his own blood, shed by his own hand in raging madness.
1	Mr. Pickwick restrained his wrath by gigantic efforts; but when Perker wrote a cheque for the whole amount, and Fogg deposited it in a small pocket-book, with a triumphant smile playing over his pimply features, which communicated itself likewise to the stern countenance of Dodson, he felt the blood in his cheeks tingling with indignation.
1	Where are they all!’ ‘Whom do you speak of?’ inquired Nicholas, wishing to rouse the poor half-witted creature to reason.
1	Then, walking again up to the window, and once more returning disappointed, he sighed deeply, and left the room; upon which the other two burst into a loud laugh.
1	The breakfast was interrupted by very little conversation; even Mr. Bob Sawyer felt the influence of the weather, and the previous day’s excitement.
1	That again was very reasonable; since in a country suffering under the affliction of a great amount of earnestness, there might, in an exceeding short space of time, be not a single Barnacle left sticking to a post.
1	But when the light of the fire was shining on the walls and ceiling of the little room, and on the tea-board and the cups and saucers that were ranged upon the table, and on her calm face turned towards the flame, and reflecting it in the tears that filled her eyes, the Captain broke a long silence thus: ‘You never was at sea, my own?’ ‘No,’ replied Florence.
1	It was not easy to answer her inquiries; still less to whisper Mr. Peggotty, when Mr. Micawber brought him in, that I had given the letter, and all was well.
1	When this same Matthew was mentioned, Miss Havisham stopped me and herself, and stood looking at the speaker.
1	The wind, too, which was directly against them, swept in furious gusts down the narrow road, and howled dismally through the trees which skirted the pathway.
1	‘The attorney bowed obsequiously, and glanced at a large packet which the gentleman carried in his hand.
1	‘Good-morning, Sir,’ said Mr. Peter Magnus.
1	‘See what, my dear Jane?’ said my mother; ‘where?’ ‘He’s got it!’ cried Miss Murdstone.
1	Ralph remained in the same attitude till he heard the noise of the closing door, when he shrugged his shoulders, and after a few turns about the room--hasty at first, but gradually becoming slower, as he relapsed into himself--sat down before his desk.
1	Late as the Dutch clock showed it to be, the poor woman was still hard at work at an ironing-table; a young child lay sleeping in a cradle near the fire; and another, a sturdy boy of two or three years old, very wide awake, with a very tight night-cap on his head, and a night-gown very much too small for him on his body, was sitting bolt upright in a clothes-basket, staring over the rim with his great round eyes, and looking as if he had thoroughly made up his mind never to go to sleep any more; which, as he had already declined to take his natural rest and had been brought out of bed in consequence, opened a cheerful prospect for his relations and friends.
1	Shocking thing that, Tom.” ‘“Dreadful!” said Tom Smart.
1	I inclined my head, without knowing what she meant; and she said, ‘Come here!’ again; and returned, followed by the respectable Mr. Littimer, who, with undiminished respectability, made me a bow, and took up his position behind her.
1	I ought rather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had energy and concentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth beyond the fact that I was falling very ill.
1	‘Think of Mr. Pyke and Mr Pluck, two of the most perfect gentlemen that ever lived, what am I too say to them--what can I say to them?
1	There are funds in hand at present.
1	My works don’t all moulder away, and rot in the earth.
1	‘I hadn’t a shoe to my foot.
1	Another morning arrived, and she came alone.
1	‘Let us be beggars, and be happy.’ ‘Beggars--and happy!’ said the old man.
1	The sun rose and sank, and rose and sank again, and many times after that; and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy bed, dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever.
1	She looked at Mrs Gowan with keen and unabated interest; the sound of her voice was thrilling to her; nothing that was near her, or about her, or at all concerned her, escaped Little Dorrit.
1	One of the many to whom, from straitened circumstances, a consequent inability to form the associations they would wish, and a disinclination to mix with the society they could obtain, London is as complete a solitude as the plains of Syria, the humble artist had pursued her lonely, but contented way for many years; and, until the peculiar misfortunes of the Nickleby family attracted her attention, had made no friends, though brimful of the friendliest feelings to all mankind.
1	My guardian looked at us again, plainly saying, "You hear him?"
1	They seem to come natural to me.’ ‘Mr.
1	‘Am I right, again?’ inquired the Captain in a whisper, with the scarlet circle on his forehead swelling in his triumphant joy.
1	It was at the concealed throat of the sleeper that Riderhood so often looked so curiously, until the sleep seemed to deepen into the stupor of the dead-tired in mind and body.
1	‘I take quite a lively interest in you, my dear soul, upon my word,’ said Miss Knag; ‘a sister’s interest, actually.
1	Now, madam, I am troubled by noticing that Amy is not, so to speak, one of ourselves.
1	‘What are you a-laughin’ at, corpilence?’ ‘Hush!
1	‘I have been a good deal flurried,’ replied Mrs. Raddle, in a reproachful manner.
1	On this head, young Blight had no doubt whatever, so Mr Boffin made him a present of that sum of money, and thanked him for his attention to his (Mr Boffin’s) affairs; which, he added, were now, he believed, as good as settled.
1	Let me suppose the case that I myself may at a certain time--ha--or times, have made a--hum--an appeal, and a properly-worded appeal, and a delicate appeal, and an urgent appeal to some individual for a small temporary accommodation.
1	‘I suppose there’s nothing to prevent your going in for it?’ said Mr Boffin.
1	Search made in every direction.
1	Mr. Rouncewell is not in the library, but she repairs to the library.
1	'He came to me, and left with me, among some other things, a picture--a portrait painted by himself--a likeness of this poor girl--which he did not wish to leave behind, and could not carry forward on his hasty journey.
1	Notwithstanding the lapse of time that had occurred since Mr. Heep’s decease, she still wore weeds.
1	Among those few there may be one who loves you even as dearly, though he has not loved you as long, as I.
1	Shall I ever forget the manner in which those handsome proud eyes seemed to spring out of their languor and to hold mine!
1	why, she was always coming backwards and forwards.
1	"It is worthy of remark," says Mr. Tulkinghorn, "however, that these people are, in their way, very proud."
1	There is another well-known suit in Chancery, not yet decided, which was commenced before the close of the last century and in which more than double the amount of seventy thousand pounds has been swallowed up in costs.
1	You are always a beggar, you know; but when you do that, you are an impudent beggar.’ I am not clear whether he was going to strike Mr. Mell, or Mr. Mell was going to strike him, or there was any such intention on either side.
1	I know nothing about seven and sixpence.
1	I see, I see.’ There was silence between them.
1	"Grandmother," says the young man, changing the subject, "what a very pretty girl that was I found with you just now.
1	And yet I--I, little Esther Summerson, the child who lived a life apart and on whose birthday there was no rejoicing--seemed to arise before my own eyes, evoked out of the past by some power in this fashionable lady, whom I not only entertained no fancy that I had ever seen, but whom I perfectly well knew I had never seen until that hour.
1	It came out that the whole of the back of the coach had been taken by a family removing from London, and that there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in front behind the coachman.
1	Nobody is true to me.
1	The old chap gave Durdles a look with his open eyes, as much as to say, “Is your name Durdles?
1	A bravo waiting for his prey, a distinguished noble waiting to save his country, the common enemy waiting to do somebody a bad turn, an angelic messenger waiting to do somebody a good turn--whatever you think he looks most like!’ ‘Say, Professore Mio, a poor gentleman waiting to do homage to elegance and beauty,’ remarked Blandois.
1	Possibly you have heard of me.” “My wife came to your house to reclaim her father?
1	Yesterday?’ ‘This here blessed day, my lady lass,’ replied the Captain.
1	At length, feeling sure that Ada suppressed this something from me lest it should make me unhappy too, it came into my head that she was a little grieved--for me--by what I had told her about Bleak House.
1	He knew these men, also, perfectly.
1	Does he ever think of his daughter, or wonder where she is gone?
1	‘I can’t at all times keep out of my mind, mistrustings of some one.
1	"That is a more alarming person than the clerk.
1	Cluppins,’ said Serjeant Buzfuz, ‘pray compose yourself, ma’am.’ Of course, directly Mrs. Cluppins was desired to compose herself, she sobbed with increased vehemence, and gave divers alarming manifestations of an approaching fainting fit, or, as she afterwards said, of her feelings being too many for her.
1	The housebreaker was lying on the bed, wrapped in his white great-coat, by way of dressing-gown, and displaying a set of features in no degree improved by the cadaverous hue of illness, and the addition of a soiled nightcap, and a stiff, black beard of a week's growth.
1	By the moonlight, Lady Dedlock can be seen in profile, perfectly still.
1	Enough, that I saw my own feelings reflected in Herbert's face, and not least among them, my repugnance towards the man who had done so much for me.
1	'The place should be somewhere here,' said Bumble, consulting a scrap of paper he held in his hand.
1	Agnes could care for no other.’ My aunt sat musing for a little while, with her chin upon her hand.
1	Let us see this discovery.’ With still reluctant hands, and not without several glances towards the skeleton hands, as if he mistrusted that a couple of them might spring forth and clutch the document, Wegg opened the hat-box and revealed the cash-box, opened the cash-box and revealed the will.
1	Mrs Boffin has herself told me, as a secret, with her own kind lips--and truer lips never opened or closed in this life, I am sure--that they wish to see me well married; and that when I marry with their consent they will portion me most handsomely.’ Here the grateful girl burst out crying very heartily.
1	The protracted and wearing anxiety and expense of the law in its most oppressive form, its torture from hour to hour, its weary days and sleepless nights, with these I’ll prove you, and break your haughty spirit, strong as you deem it now.
1	Upon his sacred word of honour, there was no cause of alarm.
1	‘Gummidge, Mr. Peggotty?’ But at this point Peggotty--I mean my own peculiar Peggotty--made such impressive motions to me not to ask any more questions, that I could only sit and look at all the silent company, until it was time to go to bed.
1	I’ll tell thee (if agreeable to Mr Boffin) how the steed drew      nigh,      And left his lord afar;      And if my tale (which I hope Mr Boffin might excuse) should      make you sigh,      I’ll strike the light guitar.”’ ‘Correct to the letter!’ said Mr Boffin.
1	Mr and Mrs Milvey had found their search a difficult one.
1	"It's all squared, you see, as I squared it myself, sir.
1	There is positively a mania among some of them for sending it to England.” “That has a bad look,” said Darnay-- “A bad look, you say, my dear Darnay?
1	Now, this appears to me a case of misdirected energy, which has a certain amount of reason in it and a certain amount of romance; and I don't know but what I should be more interested in our young friend, as an illustration of such a case, than merely as a poor vagabond--which any one can be."
1	‘Short and snappish we are!
1	‘I prefer being alone,’ replied the single gentleman.
1	So, she once more died away, and nobody minded her.
1	The person, whoever it was, had come in so suddenly and with so little noise, that Mr. Pickwick had had no time to call out, or oppose their entrance.
1	I could wish, however, to have seen it in a better light than it can ever be viewed in, where it stands.
1	These recitals, Jem, in a languid manner, received with ‘charming!’ every now and then; and they probably would have decided him to ‘go in’ for Jerusalem again to-morrow morning, had he been less curious respecting Louisa.
1	Look at me, marked until I die with his high displeasure; and moan and groan for what you made him!’ ‘Miss Dartle,’ I entreated her.
1	Miss Wisk's mission, my guardian said, was to show the world that woman's mission was man's mission and that the only genuine mission of both man and woman was to be always moving declaratory resolutions about things in general at public meetings.
1	Here Mr. Guppy's mother fell into an extraordinary passion of rolling her head and smiling waggishly at anybody who would look at her.
1	That would obviously be inconvenient and unpleasant to the customers, besides entailing on the Blue Whatever-it-was, the risk of funeral expenses.
1	But I should not have been surprised, brother, if you had considered it anything but welcome news to hear of me."
1	"Why, my angel," returns Mr. Bucket, "we shall see."
1	‘Ye’ve smoked as many as five since ye come in at midnight,’ the woman goes on, as she chronically complains.
1	For the first time in many years, he had no strong drink.
1	I thought perhaps you might have come in a cab.’ ‘No, Mr Wegg,’ replies Venus.
1	While we were talking, he more than once called me Daisy; which brought Miss Dartle out again.
1	There you have the man!
1	And here I fell asleep.
1	Neighbours were as kind as they were wont to be of old, but she shunned their greetings with averted head.
1	She had a written character, as large as a proclamation; and, according to this document, could do everything of a domestic nature that ever I heard of, and a great many things that I never did hear of.
1	'What do you mean by can't be?
1	‘For lone people as have got nobody to care for them, or take care of them, or as have been hurt in their mind, or that kind of thing,’ observed Mr. Raddle, plucking up a little cheerfulness, and looking round, ‘the country is all very well.
1	Went down to give a mother’s care, in the fulness of time, to Fanny’s neglected children no less than to their own, and to leave that lady going into Society for ever and a day.
1	If Nature, in such a case, put into that lad’s breast but one secret prompting which urged him towards his father and away from you, she would be a liar and an idiot.’ Nicholas was delighted to find that the old gentleman spoke so warmly, and in the hope that he might say something more to the same purpose, made no reply.
1	"Because," said I, "Ada and Richard have fallen in love.
1	‘They frequently ask me about you, and I give them such slight intelligence as I can.’ ‘I hope it’s truly given,’ exclaimed Bella.
1	My spirit is ready for ’em.’ ‘Do you mean animal spirits, or ardent?’ ‘The one’s the t’other,’ answers Durdles, ‘and I mean ’em both.’ He takes a lantern from a hook, puts a match or two in his pocket wherewith to light it, should there be need; and they go out together, dinner-bundle and all.
1	After a little more consideration and some backing and changing of the foot on which he rests, he mutters that he is "wery thankful."
1	I don't know why it is,' said the girl, shuddering, 'but I have such a fear and dread upon me to-night that I can hardly stand.'
1	‘Not,’ assented Mr Merdle, after having examined the cornice of all that part of the room which was within his range: ‘not that it is of any consequence.’ ‘My only anxiety is,’ said Fanny, ‘that Mrs General should not get anything.’ ‘_She_ won’t get anything,’ said Mr Merdle.
1	And Mr. Bounderby went about his daily pursuits.
1	‘Look here, you sir,’ said Fledgeby.
1	Florence had come down to the hall too, but did not advance: reserving her timid welcome until these nearer and dearer transports should subside.
1	It being necessary for the credit of the family to make a handsome appearance at such a time, Mrs Skewton, with the assistance of an accommodating tradesman resident in the parish of Mary-le-bone, who lent out all sorts of articles to the nobility and gentry, from a service of plate to an army of footmen, clapped into this house a silver-headed butler (who was charged extra on that account, as having the appearance of an ancient family retainer), two very tall young men in livery, and a select staff of kitchen-servants; so that a legend arose, downstairs, that Withers the page, released at once from his numerous household duties, and from the propulsion of the wheeled-chair (inconsistent with the metropolis), had been several times observed to rub his eyes and pinch his limbs, as if he misdoubted his having overslept himself at the Leamington milkman’s, and being still in a celestial dream.
1	The girl lingered a little while to talk, and tell her grievances.
1	‘He’s a very good fellow if you know how to manage him.
1	He then felt himself forced up some wooden steps by the persons from behind; and on removing his hat, found himself surrounded by his friends, in the very front of the left hand side of the hustings.
1	Before it could be given him, he would be gone again.
1	I’m out o’ breath, my boy.’ When Arabella, after some gentle preparation and many assurances that there was not the least occasion for being low-spirited, was at length made acquainted by Mr. Pickwick with the unsatisfactory result of his visit to Birmingham, she burst into tears, and sobbing aloud, lamented in moving terms that she should have been the unhappy cause of any estrangement between a father and his son.
1	There was nothing particularly choice there, to be sure; but I took the will for the deed, and felt that they were very attentive.
1	‘Well, I’m sure!’ exclaimed Miss Price.
1	And you?’ Mr Chivery said in a low growl, ‘Oh!
1	A handsome gentleman, with a young face, but with an older figure in its robustness and its breadth of shoulder; say a man of eight-and-twenty, or at the utmost thirty; so extremely sunburnt that the contrast between his brown visage and the white forehead shaded out of doors by his hat, and the glimpses of white throat below the neckerchief, would have been almost ludicrous but for his broad temples, bright blue eyes, clustering brown hair, and laughing teeth.
1	Mr. Turveydrop said this in quite a pious manner, and it seemed to do his son good, who, in parting from him, was so pleased with him, so dutiful to him, and so proud of him that I almost felt as if it were an unkindness to the younger man not to be able to believe implicitly in the elder.
1	When the other three, who follow closely, take their seats, his face is hidden for the first time--shaded by his cloak.
1	I looked at both of them.
1	He never liked me much, Peggotty; but he would rather not even see me now, if he can help it.’ ‘Perhaps it’s his sorrow,’ said Peggotty, stroking my hair.
1	‘Have YOU been making that horrible noise?’ said the single gentleman.
1	Introduce him to me, and I'll cultivate his acquaintance.
1	Unconscious of that, and of most things, he had left the coat so, both when he had laved his face in the river, and when he had cast himself upon the bed; though it would have been much easier to him if he had unloosened it.
1	He was on the point of emerging from his hiding-place, and regaining the road above, when he heard the sound of footsteps, and directly afterwards of voices almost close at his ear.
1	‘Hows’ever,’ said he, ‘this isn’t entertaining to Miss Bella.
1	When the outsides saw this, they put their halfpence back into their pockets again, declaring that he was an idle young dog, and didn't deserve anything; and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust behind.
1	Then lights are brought in, discovering Mr. Tulkinghorn still standing in his window with his hands behind him and my Lady still sitting with his figure before her, closing up her view of the night as well as of the day.
1	Mr Tite Barnacle never would have passed for half his current value, unless his coat had been always buttoned-up to his white cravat.
1	‘Take your Dictionary, for example.
1	You’ve come to nicely now, sir,’ said the tearful Mrs. Tope; ‘you were thoroughly worn out, and no wonder!’ ‘A man,’ said Mr. Grewgious, with his usual air of repeating a lesson, ‘cannot have his rest broken, and his mind cruelly tormented, and his body overtaxed by fatigue, without being thoroughly worn out.’ ‘I fear I have alarmed you?’ Jasper apologised faintly, when he was helped into his easy-chair.
1	‘And how long do you keep him out at a time?’ inquired Mr. Pickwick, searching for further information.
1	I suspect that I am watched more closely than I was, and I know not at what times I may be watched.
1	‘Is it the last occupant’s furniture?’ inquired my aunt.
1	Inasmuch as he has never made friends, and has ever had a rebellious family, he, John Harmon, gives to Nicodemus Boffin the Little Mound, which is quite enough for him, and gives the whole rest and residue of his property to the Crown.’ ‘The date of the will that has been proved, must be looked to,’ remarked Venus.
1	‘Bray--there was young Bray of--no, he never had a daughter.’ ‘You remember Bray?’ rejoined Arthur Gride.
1	Arriving at the house, he found that Mr and Mrs Boffin were out, but that Miss Wilfer was in the drawing-room.
1	‘Nothin’ like it,’ replied his father.
1	‘Here we are,’ said Mr. Crummles.
1	And I looked so, I have no doubt.
1	"Don't you think you can receive his evidence, sir?"
1	If you lived in an unfinished house, you couldn't settle down in it; if you were condemned to leave everything you undertook unfinished, you would find it hard to apply yourself to anything; and yet that's my unhappy case.
1	This brought fresh tears into Madame Mantalini’s eyes, which having just begun to open to some few of the demerits of Mr. Mantalini, were only open a very little way, and could be easily closed again.
1	He was a good sailor, and I was but an indifferent one; and when he went out boating with Mr. Peggotty, which was a favourite amusement of his, I generally remained ashore.
1	Sir Barnet was fain, under these circumstances, to content himself for the time with the company assembled.
1	Knows a broom's a broom, and knows it's wicked to tell a lie.
1	Don’t speak to him for the world.’ ‘Yes I will, mother.
1	All the public inscriptions in the town were painted alike, in severe characters of black and white.
1	But still Mr. Lillyvick, regardless of the siren, cried obdurately, ‘Morleena, my hat!’ upon the fourth repetition of which demand, Mrs Kenwigs sunk back in her chair, with a cry that might have softened a water-butt, not to say a water-collector; while the four little girls (privately instructed to that effect) clasped their uncle’s drab shorts in their arms, and prayed him, in imperfect English, to remain.
1	‘Nothing takes place, of that kind, that I an’t up to entirely.
1	I doen’t know as he’d do violence under any circumstances, but I hope as them two may be kep asunders.’ We had come, through Temple Bar, into the city.
1	Bradley rose early, and set out on foot for Plashwater Weir Mill Lock.
1	You would if you was a man.’ I should if I was a dozen men, my dear,’ replied Mr. Raddle pacifically, ‘but they have the advantage of me in numbers, my dear.’ ‘Ugh, you coward!’ replied Mrs. Raddle, with supreme contempt.
1	If he had been an author, who knew his place, he couldn’t have been more humble.
1	While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night watchman in his box at the door of Tellson's Bank, by Temple Bar, who was to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took such shapes to the mare as arose out of _her_ private topics of uneasiness.
1	I think I committed every possible absurdity in the way of preparation for this blessed event.
1	He _was _a horse chaunter: he’s a leg now.’ ‘Ah, so I thought,’ rejoined Mr. Roker, closing the book, and placing the small piece of paper in Mr. Pickwick’s hands.
1	He invited Mr. Jarndyce to take a glass of claret.
1	There’s not one among them, but if he had at once the power, and the wit and daring to use it, would scatter Dombey’s pride and lay it low, as ruthlessly as I rake out these ashes.’ As he broke them up and strewed them in the grate, he looked on with a thoughtful smile at what he was doing.
1	So you are now going to London, David, with Mr. Quinion, to begin the world on your own account.’ ‘In short, you are provided for,’ observed his sister; ‘and will please to do your duty.’ Though I quite understood that the purpose of this announcement was to get rid of me, I have no distinct remembrance whether it pleased or frightened me.
1	‘You have withdrawn yourself in your sullenness to your own room.
1	Be as happy as you can, and don’t be unmindful that you are blessed with health.
1	The blossom is blighted, the leaf is withered, the god of day goes down upon the dreary scene, and--and in short you are for ever floored.
1	"Airing yourself, as I am doing, before you go to bed?"
1	Then Mrs Veneering had to relate, to a larger circle, how she had been to see the girl, and how she was really pretty, and (considering her station) presentable.
1	I knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life.
1	‘“I am sure I am very much obliged to you, Sir, for your good opinion,”  said the buxom landlady, half laughing; “and if ever I marry again--” ’”_If_,” said Tom Smart, looking very shrewdly out of the right-hand corner of his left eye.
1	Oliver's ailings were neither slight nor few.
1	His memory grew DAZED.’  Mr. Tope, with his eyes on the Reverend Mr. Crisparkle, shoots this word out, as defying him to improve upon it: ‘and a dimness and giddiness crept over him as strange as ever I saw: though he didn’t seem to mind it particularly, himself.
1	But if any man desire confirmation of my statement on this head, let him repair to any place in this city of London, where scattered numbers of these publications are to be found; and there, let him form his own opinion.
1	Old remembrances of what, sir?’ Mr Venus begins drearily replying, ‘Of her words, in her own handwriting, that she does not wish to regard herself, nor yet--’ when Silas cuts him short with dignity.
1	Mrs Gowan replied he was not coming.
1	“He may be too proud to let any one take him out of a place that he is competent to fill, and fills well and with respect.
1	One idiosyncrasy for which she often apologized, she found it excessively difficult to conquer.
1	‘I an’t what I could wish myself to be,’ said Mrs. Gummidge.
1	“I always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger brother's (as I call him) having crossed swords with a peasant, and that peasant a boy.
1	Now, turn to that paper, and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that his legal advisers instructed him altogether to reserve his defence?” “I read that just now,” Mr. Wopsle pleaded.
1	For some days afterwards, I am lost in rapturous reflections; but I neither see her in the street, nor when I call.
1	"May be not, still I don't like it.
1	I have known many adventurers; interesting spirits--amiable society!
1	"You may have heard my name--Jarndyce."
1	Under the direction of a very neat maid, they were put outside a very small green carriage; and then Miss Donny, the maid, and I got inside and were driven away.
1	I may use the word, for the alley and the gutter were mine, as they will be my deathbed.'
1	She lived in such continual dread and apprehension of meeting one or other of them on the stairs or in the passages if she stirred from her grandfather’s chamber, that she seldom left it, for a moment, until late at night, when the silence encouraged her to venture forth and breathe the purer air of some empty room.
1	His step was attended by another step; and when Cavalletto opened the door, he admitted Mr Pancks and Mr Flintwinch.
1	Then, he took a live coal from the fire with the tongs, and lighted his pipe at it, and then turned round on the hearth-rug with his back to the fire, and went through his favorite action of holding out both his hands for mine.
1	The first idea that flashed upon her mind was flight, instant flight; dragging him from that place, and rather dying of want upon the roadside, than ever exposing him again to such terrible temptations.
1	Rigaud was a criminal, she said, who had killed his wife.
1	Between Mr Dombey and a young man like me, there’s a wide space of separation.
1	This dream is too real.
1	‘And a sweet set they is for sich!’ said Mrs. Crupp.
1	‘“What have you got in that bottle?” said the goblin.
1	I live at her father’s, and was with her.
1	I open the business with you, relying upon your honour not to do anything in it, and not to mention me in it, without my knowledge.’ ‘That sounds fair,’ said Mr Boffin.
1	‘Oh never quite, my darling!
1	At length Mr. Stiggins, with several most indubitable symptoms of having quite as much pine-apple rum-and-water about him as he could comfortably accommodate, took his hat, and his leave; and Sam was, immediately afterwards, shown to bed by his father.
1	‘Ah, James,’ returned his brother, speaking for the first time in an accent of reproach, and seeming, by the sound of his voice, to have covered his face with his hands, ‘I have been, since then, a useful foil to you.
1	I had ample leisure to refine upon my uneasiness: for Steerforth was at Oxford, as he wrote to me, and when I was not at the Commons, I was very much alone.
1	You are not used to being officered; I am.
1	No, no!’ He smiled and shook his head, and resting his chin upon his hand, fell a musing, and smiled again.
1	One, to Mr. Bounderby, announcing his retirement from that part of the country, and showing where he would be found for the next fortnight.
1	There were few preparatory arrangements to be made for the marriage of Mr. Snodgrass.
1	As Richard still continued to say that he was fixed in his choice after repeated periods for consideration had been recommended by Mr. Jarndyce and had expired, and he still continued to assure Ada and me in the same final manner that it was "all right," it became advisable to take Mr. Kenge into council.
1	And if I do not clearly express what I mean by that, it is either for the reason that having no conversational powers, I cannot express what I mean, or that having no meaning, I do not mean what I fail to express.
1	From what the room derived it--every one of its small variety of objects being in the fixed spot it had occupied for years--no one could have said without looking attentively at its mistress, and that, too, with a previous knowledge of her face.
1	‘In fine, then, I name it the history of this house.
1	I should think it was a very pleasant life, the married one, eh?’ ‘I have not the least doubt of it,’ rejoined Nicholas.
1	“It was a rash one,” said she.
1	I looked at Joe, making the motion with my lips and eyebrows, “She?” Joe looked at me, making the motion with his lips and eyebrows, “She?” My sister catching him in the act, he drew the back of his hand across his nose with his usual conciliatory air on such occasions, and looked at her.
1	Not a man knows it better.
1	He fixed his eyes on Mary, and replied-- ‘I knows a nicerer.’ ‘Indeed!’ said Mary.
1	Yes; but you would never have thought of it, for all that, if I hadn’t said so,’ replied his wife.
1	Dear me, Copperfield, that’s sharp practice!
1	There was something so uncommon in her manner, that the flesh of the concealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words, and the blood chilled within him.
1	What I wish is, that parties was brought up stronger-minded.’ Mr. Omer, with a very complacent and amiable face, took several puffs in silence; and then said, resuming his first point: ‘Accordingly we’re obleeged, in ascertaining how Barkis goes on, to limit ourselves to Em’ly.
1	When I woke up in the night,--like Camilla,--I used to think, with a weariness on my spirits, that I should have been happier and better if I had never seen Miss Havisham's face, and had risen to manhood content to be partners with Joe in the honest old forge.
1	These are melancholy sounds to a quiet listener at any time; but how melancholy to the watcher by the bed of death!
1	‘I don’t pretend to know more than that his words to me was, “I done it.” Those was his words.’ ‘I must see this out, Mortimer,’ whispered Eugene, rising.
1	The ashes sometimes gets in here;’ touching his chest: ‘and makes a man speak gruff, as at the present time.
1	So, Georgiana repairing to her friend, Mr Podsnap went out to dinner, and to dinner, and yet to dinner, arm in arm with Mrs Podsnap: settling his obstinate head in his cravat and shirt-collar, much as if he were performing on the Pandean pipes, in his own honour, the triumphal march, See the conquering Podsnap comes, Sound the trumpets, beat the drums!
1	And this, although I had never seen this lady's face before in all my life--I was quite sure of it--absolutely certain.
1	The old lady can do nothing but go in search of him.
1	And now I come to a part of my story touching myself very nearly indeed, and for which I was quite unprepared when the circumstance occurred.
1	It merely went to the effect that as they had all been thrown together by chance, and had all preserved a good understanding together, and were now about to disperse, and were not likely ever to find themselves all together again, what could they do better than bid farewell to one another, and give one another good-speed in a simultaneous glass of cool champagne all round the table?
1	‘“Hollands, sir,” replied the sexton, trembling more than ever; for he had bought it of the smugglers, and he thought that perhaps his questioner might be in the excise department of the goblins.
1	How few of those who stiffened in her father’s freezing atmosphere, suspected what a heap of fiery coals was piled upon his head!
1	It bent its head low again, and said not a word.
1	It were yesterday afternoon” (with an appearance of mingled wisdom, relief, and strict impartiality).
1	Perfectly.’ ‘But look at it, too.
1	The money must be paid.’ ‘In full and slap down, do you mean, Mr Riah?’ asked Fledgeby, to make things quite explicit.
1	Ned, my dearest fellow, my love!’ Jasper sets the example of nearly emptying his glass, and Neville follows it.
1	So, throwing her arms round his neck, and kissing him affectionately, she sobbed louder than before.
1	But it may have been--it may have been--that the great man thought himself defied in this new exposition of an honest spirit, and purposed to bring it down.
1	“It wasn't ending it, I suppose?
1	They dance in the academy, and at this time of year we do figures at five every morning."
1	To hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and to see his heightened and excited face; would have been a surprise to his business friends in the city, indeed.
1	It is peculiar.’ No doubt.
1	The water came over the Weir, with its usual sound on a cold starlight night, and little could be seen of it; yet Mr. Crisparkle had a strange idea that something unusual hung about the place.
1	‘If trial and calamity had fallen as lightly on his head, as in the deepest truth of my own heart I ever hoped (for her sake) it would, his life would have been one of peace and happiness,’ said the old gentleman calmly.
1	"It is not an illness of any serious consequence, Sir Leicester.
1	But he had spoken to her alone, and had said that people--ha--people in an exalted position, my dear, must scrupulously exact respect from their dependents; and that for her, his daughter, Miss Amy Dorrit, of the sole remaining branch of the Dorrits of Dorsetshire, to be known to--hum--to occupy herself in fulfilling the functions of--ha hum--a valet, would be incompatible with that respect.
1	Snow Hill--Snow Hill too, coupled with a Saracen’s Head: picturing to us by a double association of ideas, something stern and rugged!
1	‘Poor fellows, poor fellows!’ He moved away as he said this; but seeing that Nicholas was about to speak, good-naturedly slackened his pace, as if he were unwilling to cut him short.
1	Amiable and dear little Twoshoes!
1	She took her feet off the fender, pushed back her chair, and bade Fagin draw up his, without saying more about it:  for it was a cold night, and no mistake.
1	The Lammles, originally presented by the dear Veneerings, visited the Boffins on all grand occasions, and Mrs Lammle had not previously found this out; but now the knowledge came upon her all at once.
1	I recollect well how indignantly my heart beat, as I saw his crafty face, with the appropriately red light of the fire upon it, preparing for something else.
1	I may claim the merit of having originated the suggestion that the will should be looked for in the box.
1	‘We must do the best we can.’ ‘And you won’t tell me, any more, that we make other people bad,’ coaxed Dora; ‘will you?
1	‘What’s become of him?’ asked my aunt.
1	And so we gave him our hands, one after another--at least, they did--and I did; and so he put his lips to Ada's hand--and to mine; and so he went away upon his long, long voyage!
1	Mistress, you’ll die in the street!’ Her mistress only disengaged her dress from the beseeching hands, said to Rigaud, ‘Wait here till I come back!’ and ran out of the room.
1	The black in Sinbad’s Travels with one eye in the middle of his forehead which shone like a burning coal, was nature’s aristocrat compared with this white gentleman.
1	“_I_ ask no questions and make no stipulations.
1	“Where was this coach, in the name of gracious?” asked my sister.
1	But being now come into the City, where there was a coach-stand, he stood irresolute whether to go to his lodgings, or to go first to Mr Boffin’s house.
1	‘Like the startled fawn,’ said Mrs Chick.
1	‘What’s the matter?’ he asked in plain English.
1	I gained the door, dropped over the banisters, and in an instant was in the street.
1	There is no such thing as such fulfilment on this earth.
1	She softened more and more while saying this and cried so much over the unwonted little home-picture she had raised in her mind that Peepy, in his cave under the piano, was touched, and turned himself over on his back with loud lamentations.
1	'Those were his words,' said Nancy, glancing uneasily round, as she had scarcely ceased to do, since she began to speak, for a vision of Sikes haunted her perpetually.
1	Your daughter Bella,’ said Mrs Wilfer, with a lofty air of never having had the least copartnership in that young lady: of whom she now made reproachful mention as an article of luxury which her husband had set up entirely on his own account, and in direct opposition to her advice: ‘--your daughter Bella has bestowed herself upon a Mendicant.’ ‘Good gracious, my dear!’ ‘Show your father his daughter Bella’s letter, Lavinia,’ said Mrs Wilfer, in her monotonous Act of Parliament tone, and waving her hand.
1	But we don’t live under leaves, and keep cows and sheep and creatures.
1	If not, by your own thoughts and suspicions.’ ‘I have no suspicions,’ said the Manager.
1	‘Riderhood, when you have found out concerning his coming home, come round to the window of Cosy, tap twice at it, and wait for me.
1	I couldn’t myself.’ ‘Do you suppose,’ said I, constraining myself to be very temperate and quiet with him, on account of Agnes, ‘that I regard Miss Wickfield otherwise than as a very dear sister?’ ‘Well, Master Copperfield,’ he replied, ‘you perceive I am not bound to answer that question.
1	It is the hottest long vacation known for many years.
1	Now, I had known the bride when I was last there, not only as the prettiest girl in the place, but as having quite distinguished herself in the school, and I could not help looking at her with some surprise.
1	‘A tragedy.’ Rosa seemed much relieved.
1	Throughout the remainder of the day, Mr Pancks’s What were they up to?
1	Is that your fidelity to me?
1	I am inclined to believe, from my uncertainty on this head, that it was six at first and seven afterwards.
1	The lamps, gleaming on the medley of horses’ heads, jumbled with the shadowy driver, and the fluttering of his cloak, made a thousand indistinct shapes, answering to his thoughts.
1	I wasn’t here myself above seven year before you.
1	Who made me “a fellow like this”?
1	It would have been next to impossible to suspect him of anything wrong, he was so thoroughly respectable.
1	He was a true Briton, and hoped there were many like him.
1	The alacrity with which Charley brought my bonnet and veil, and having dressed me, quaintly pinned herself into her warm shawl and made herself look like a little old woman, sufficiently expressed her readiness.
1	I thank you even more for the tone of the question.
1	On the last Sunday, they invited me to dinner; and we had a loin of pork and apple sauce, and a pudding.
1	A fair girl with rich brown hair hanging free in natural ringlets.
1	You will allow me to order you lunch after your journey, sir."
1	If he should be so compassionate as to say that you might write something for me to read--I think he would, oh, I think he would, if you would only ask him, for he always was so brave and so forgiving--tell him then (but not else), that when I hear the wind blowing at night, I feel as if it was passing angrily from seeing him and uncle, and was going up to God against me.
1	They were furnished with slippers and such dry garments as the house or their own bundles afforded, and ensconcing themselves, as Mr Codlin had already done, in the warm chimney-corner, soon forgot their late troubles or only remembered them as enhancing the delights of the present time.
1	Give me your hand, my poor boy, and may God forgive you as I do!’ The culprit was moved to a few abject tears by these words and their pathetic tone.
1	‘I felt it so much that I wouldn’t on any account have even mentioned that you bought a Salmon--which was too much for two.
1	said Nancy, coming hastily forward.
1	As the elms bent to one another, like giants who were whispering secrets, and after a few seconds of such repose, fell into a violent flurry, tossing their wild arms about, as if their late confidences were really too wicked for their peace of mind, some weatherbeaten ragged old rooks’-nests, burdening their higher branches, swung like wrecks upon a stormy sea.
1	‘We were peeping at the circus,’ muttered Louisa, haughtily, without lifting up her eyes, ‘and father caught us.’ ‘And, Mrs. Gradgrind,’ said her husband in a lofty manner, ‘I should as soon have expected to find my children reading poetry.’ ‘Dear me,’ whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind.
1	‘Once make a giant common and giants will never draw again.
1	‘You spy and speculate on people’s business with me, do you?’ ‘Dear, no, sir!
1	If not yesterday, why then today.
1	There is, perhaps, no reason why I should express myself at all, except the intimacy that has subsisted between us, and which I very much hope, Lucretia--confidently hope--nothing will occur to disturb.
1	Stephen came out of the hot mill into the damp wind and cold wet streets, haggard and worn.
1	Shut up the place, turn out directly, and send me the key by bearer.
1	It comes alongside, is made fast, the men jump on board, the engine is put in motion, and we go hoarsely on again.
1	‘Tut!’ said the Minor Canon softly, ‘I am much overpaid!’ and turned away.
1	‘What amount of small change, Missis,’ he said, with an abstracted air, after a little meditation, ‘might you call a morsel of money?’ Hurriedly emptying her pocket, old Betty laid down on the table, a shilling, and two sixpenny pieces, and a few pence.
1	‘Mr Swiveller,’ said Quilp, ‘being pretty well accustomed to the agricultural pursuits of sowing wild oats, Miss Sally, prudently considers that half a loaf is better than no bread.
1	Madame Defarge knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.
1	‘What I know of Mr Riah,’ said Fledgeby, with a very disparaging utterance of his name, ‘leads me to believe that this is about the shop for disagreeable business.
1	It was November, and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back against the chimney-piece, with his hands under his coattails.
1	For your good opinion now, for your way of receiving and encouraging me when I first put myself in communication with you, and for the influence since so kindly brought to bear upon a certain lady, both by yourself and by Mr John Harmon.’ To whom, when thus making mention of him, he also bowed.
1	Mr. Littimer, clearing his throat behind his hand with a respectable short cough, changed legs, and went on: ‘At last, when there had been, upon the whole, a good many words and reproaches, Mr. James he set off one morning, from the neighbourhood of Naples, where we had a villa (the young woman being very partial to the sea), and, under pretence of coming back in a day or so, left it in charge with me to break it out, that, for the general happiness of all concerned, he was’--here an interruption of the short cough--‘gone.
1	‘Placed in a mental position of peculiar painfulness, beyond the assuaging reach even of Mrs. Micawber’s influence, though exercised in the tripartite character of woman, wife, and mother, it is my intention to fly from myself for a short period, and devote a respite of eight-and-forty hours to revisiting some metropolitan scenes of past enjoyment.
1	Grandfather Smallweed smiles in a very ugly way in recognition of the letter.
1	Dear, dear!’ I changed the subject by referring to Emily.
1	"I say, my friends," pursues Mr. Chadband, utterly rejecting and obliterating Mr. Snagsby's suggestion, "why can we not fly?
1	I was to leave our village at five in the morning, carrying my little hand-portmanteau, and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away all alone.
1	Abraham in red going to sacrifice Isaac in blue, and Daniel in yellow cast into a den of green lions, were the most prominent of these.
1	You’ll make nothing of this.
1	Her eyes were closing, but they opened again.
1	I say, my dear Loo!
1	Let’s keep out of THAT, whatever we come to.’ ‘There’s more than enough of that about, without us; ain’t there, Noddy?’ said Mrs Boffin.
1	The first man I saw, was seated at his loom, at work.
1	It was but a week, since an aged, grey-haired man, a lasting honour to the land that gave him birth, who has done good service to his country, as his forefathers did, and who will be remembered scores upon scores of years after the worms bred in its corruption, are but so many grains of dust—it was but a week, since this old man had stood for days upon his trial before this very body, charged with having dared to assert the infamy of that traffic, which has for its accursed merchandise men and women, and their unborn children.
1	I acknowledge that I like it, dear boy, but I am not worth it.
1	‘Hush!’ said Mr. Jingle, in a stage-whisper--‘Large boy--dumpling face-- round eyes--rascal!’ Here he shook his head expressively, and the spinster aunt trembled with agitation.
1	and wi' verses in his speech, too,--and warn't it me as could only say, 'Gentlemen, this man at my side is a most precious rascal'?
1	If it ever was, let us forget it.’ ‘You are a good girl, you are a patient girl.’ ‘As for patience,’ she would reply with a shrug, ‘not much of that, godmother.
1	After some search, it was found in the box, at the bottom of a horse’s nose-bag; wherein (besides hay) there was discovered an old gold watch, with chain and seals, which Mr. Barkis had worn on his wedding-day, and which had never been seen before or since; a silver tobacco-stopper, in the form of a leg; an imitation lemon, full of minute cups and saucers, which I have some idea Mr. Barkis must have purchased to present to me when I was a child, and afterwards found himself unable to part with; eighty-seven guineas and a half, in guineas and half-guineas; two hundred and ten pounds, in perfectly clean Bank notes; certain receipts for Bank of England stock; an old horseshoe, a bad shilling, a piece of camphor, and an oyster-shell.
1	I know that the longer I keep you here, the greater hope there is for my Ladybird.
1	He nodded when I said the subject was painful to me, clapped me on the back, put round the wine again, and went on with his dinner.
1	He had proudly resumed his privilege, in many of his spare hours, of walking up and down the garden with the Doctor; as he had been accustomed to pace up and down The Doctor’s Walk at Canterbury.
1	Their walk was the walk of a race apart.
1	I could snap it like a twig, only there are long galleries here with many doors--I don’t think I could find my way along them; and even if I could, I know there are iron gates below which they keep locked and barred.
1	‘I am not so unreasonable as to expect,’ said Agnes, resuming her usual tone, after a little while, ‘that you will, or that you can, at once, change any sentiment that has become a conviction to you; least of all a sentiment that is rooted in your trusting disposition.
1	'What has become of him!
1	The girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this threat; and with her lips compressed, and her hands clenched, looked alternately at the Jew and the other robber: her face quite colourless from the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself.
1	We have preserved them, nevertheless, as affording at once a touching and a convincing proof of the estimation in which he was held by every class of society, and the case with which he made his way to their hearts and feelings.
1	‘Ay!’ exclaimed the Manager, ‘what’s that?
1	it wasn’t for him to betray his trust, was it?
1	I think of the number of yards of net in Miss Murdstone’s cap, or of the price of Mr. Murdstone’s dressing-gown, or any such ridiculous problem that I have no business with, and don’t want to have anything at all to do with.
1	On our return, we held a great review of the house and garden and saw that everything was in its prettiest condition, and had the bird out ready as an important part of the establishment.
1	I may say that I do too, and always did.
1	After some quarter of an hour’s absence, he returned.
1	'I never, never will, sir,' interposed Oliver.
1	The galley was kept steady, and the silent, eager look-out at the water was resumed.
1	Of Dora’s making a long series of surprised discoveries that she has forgotten all sorts of little things; and of everybody’s running everywhere to fetch them.
1	said Mr. Blathers:  not holding his wine-glass by the stem, but grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand: and placing it in front of his chest; 'I have seen a good many pieces of business like this, in my time, ladies.'
1	He had a patron who in a certain sumptuous way--an apologetic way, as if he constantly took an admiring audience to witness that he really could not help being more free with this old fellow than they might have expected, on account of his simplicity and poverty--was mightily good to him.
1	Here he was searched; and nothing being found upon him, locked up.
1	I suppose so.’ ‘To tell you my mind, Lucretia,’ says Mrs Pipchin; she still calls Miss Tox Lucretia, on account of having made her first experiments in the child-quelling line of business on that lady, when an unfortunate and weazen little girl of tender years; ‘to tell you my mind, Lucretia, I think it’s a good riddance.
1	You are to understand, first, that it is the request of the person from whom I take my instructions that you always bear the name of Pip.
1	The grim sly faces in the squares and diamonds of the floor-cloth, relaxed and peeped out at him with less wicked eyes.
1	So obdurate, so unapproachable, so unrelenting, one would have thought that nothing could soften such a woman’s nature, and that everything in life had hardened it.
1	"Nod it; that's what I want to see you do.
1	The night was dark, and a cold wind blew, driving the clouds, furiously and fast, before it.
1	‘The room was kept like this, Rokesmith,’ said Mr Boffin, ‘against the son’s return.
1	But there was other trouble.
1	It was all gone now.
1	‘“I have wronged you,” shrieked the old man, falling on his knees, and clasping his hands together.
1	‘Jane Murdstone,’ said Mr. Murdstone to his sister, ‘any harsh words between us are, I hope, uncommon.
1	The boy shouted; four birds flew out.
1	He came to take leave of us; he had settled to do so beforehand.
1	Clear of the house, I made the best of my way back to Pumblechook's, took off my new clothes, made them into a bundle, and went back home in my older dress, carrying it--to speak the truth--much more at my ease too, though I had the bundle to carry.
1	The gentleman then beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out.
1	'That man must be delivered up by you,' said the gentleman.
1	Here IS the young man!"
1	Next comes what you mean to say.
1	Has that fellow’--to the man with the wooden leg--‘been here again?’ ‘No,’ was the answer.
1	'Make a bow to the gentleman, Oliver,' said Mrs. Mann.
1	Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those upper members, bare.
1	I go back at eight o’clock tomorrow morning, and have got only three--three oughts is an ought--three twos is six--sixty pound.
1	It's the fashionable way; and fashion and whiskers have been my weaknesses, and I don't care who knows it," says Mr. Jobling.
1	Then she would take up another pen, and begin to write, and find that it spluttered.
1	Now, Nell had still the piece of gold sewn in her dress; and when she came to consider the lateness of the hour, and the somnolent habits of Mrs Jarley, and to imagine the state of consternation in which they would certainly throw that good lady by knocking her up in the middle of the night--and when she reflected, on the other hand, that if they remained where they were, and rose early in the morning, they might get back before she awoke, and could plead the violence of the storm by which they had been overtaken, as a good apology for their absence--she decided, after a great deal of hesitation, to remain.
1	"I am very grateful for all your kindness and consideration regarding our marriage, and so, I can assure you, is Caddy."
1	He began to show now that he thought of Florence’s fatigue: and often taxed his weakness to whisper to her, ‘Go and walk, my dearest, in the sweet air.
1	The appearance of everything on the lines denoted that the approaching ceremony was one of the utmost grandeur and importance.
1	_Through the intercession     of the Board of Honour_, the challenge was withdrawn, and the     difference amicably adjusted.’ If the reader will picture to himself the kind of Board of Honour which amicably adjusted the difference between these two little boys, who in any other part of the world would have been amicably adjusted on two porters’ backs and soundly flogged with birchen rods, he will be possessed, no doubt, with as strong a sense of its ludicrous character, as that which sets me laughing whenever its image rises up before me.
1	‘Is this all?’ demanded the person of the house, when a confused heap of pence and shillings lay on the table.
1	He had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life.
1	Now I ask you fair.
1	I want you to stand between Rosa Dartle and me, and keep us asunder.’ ‘Would you love each other too much, without me?’ ‘Yes; or hate,’ laughed Steerforth; ‘no matter which.
1	My passion for her is beyond all bounds.
1	But it may not be so.
1	On the clock’s striking ten, and Miss Abbey’s appearing at the door, and addressing a certain person in a faded scarlet jacket, with ‘George Jones, your time’s up!
1	"Never have--" "Not Prince, Pa?"
1	Are coals to be relied upon?
1	It was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from Sikes.
1	The offer relieved him from considerable embarrassment, for his previous notions of loading a pistol were rather vague and undefined.
1	Say you know me, and I am sure they will not charge you for it.
1	My sister!’ ‘Lord, Nicholas!’ returned Mrs. Nickleby, ‘whose Kate should it be, if not ours; or what should I care about it, or take any interest in it for, if it was anybody but your sister?’ ‘Dear mother,’ said Nicholas, ‘surely it can’t be!’ ‘Very good, my dear,’ replied Mrs. Nickleby, with great confidence.
1	‘Not a bit of it,’ replied Bob; ‘only cheerful.’ ‘Cheerful, sir!’ ejaculated Mr. Pickwick.
1	All manner of learning my boys take down, sir; the expense is never thought of; and they get paternal treatment and washing in.’ ‘Upon my word,’ said the gentleman, glancing at Nicholas with a half-smile, and a more than half expression of surprise, ‘these are advantages indeed.’ ‘You may say that, sir,’ rejoined Squeers, thrusting his hands into his great-coat pockets.
1	The dinner done, Mrs. Bagnet, assisted by the younger branches (who polish their own cups and platters, knives and forks), makes all the dinner garniture shine as brightly as before and puts it all away, first sweeping the hearth, to the end that Mr. Bagnet and the visitor may not be retarded in the smoking of their pipes.
1	'I should like,' he said, 'to call in the aid of my friend Grimwig.
1	Mr. Peggotty thrust forth his face; and never could I forget the change that came upon it when he saw us, if I were to live five hundred years.
1	I appeal to you to discontinue your habit of making your misplaced attentions as plain to Mrs Boffin as to me.’ ‘Have I done so?’ ‘I should think you have,’ replied Bella.
1	I mean a man whose hopes and aims may sometimes lie (as most men's sometimes do, I dare say) above the ordinary level, but to whom the ordinary level will be high enough after all if it should prove to be a way of usefulness and good service leading to no other.
1	Follows the Fortunes of Miss Nickleby It was with a heavy heart, and many sad forebodings which no effort could banish, that Kate Nickleby, on the morning appointed for the commencement of her engagement with Madame Mantalini, left the city when its clocks yet wanted a quarter of an hour of eight, and threaded her way alone, amid the noise and bustle of the streets, towards the west end of London.
1	Accordingly, I started at once, and she leaned upon my shoulder, and we went away at a pace that might have been an imitation (founded on my first impulse under that roof) of Mr. Pumblechook's chaise-cart.
1	It is one Mr. George, it appears.
1	It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night.
1	But I may be wrong.’ ‘No, you are not wrong,’ said Little Dorrit, shaking her head.
1	‘Sir Tumley Snuffim would not give that for Mrs Wititterly’s existence.’ Mr. Wititterly told this with a kind of sober exultation, as if it were no trifling distinction for a man to have a wife in such a desperate state, and Mrs. Wititterly sighed and looked on, as if she felt the honour, but had determined to bear it as meekly as might be.
1	It was a mere lumber-room now, but it yet contained an old dismantled bedstead; the one on which his son had slept; for no other had ever been there.
1	‘I come to know, ma’am, whether he will keep his wured?’ ‘No,’ she returned.
1	At that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the dock-yards by stage-coach.
1	Will you come with us?’ A little winding through some muddy alleys that might have been deposited by the last ill-savoured tide, brought them to the wicket-gate and bright lamp of a Police Station; where they found the Night-Inspector, with a pen and ink, and ruler, posting up his books in a whitewashed office, as studiously as if he were in a monastery on top of a mountain, and no howling fury of a drunken woman were banging herself against a cell-door in the back-yard at his elbow.
1	This chafing over, the ornamental part of Mr. George's toilet is soon performed.
1	You needn’t think it an unmanly or quizzical thing to be particular about your nightcap, for I have often heard your poor dear papa, and the Reverend Mr. What’s-his-name, who used to read prayers in that old church with the curious little steeple that the weathercock was blown off the night week before you were born,--I have often heard them say, that the young men at college are uncommonly particular about their nightcaps, and that the Oxford nightcaps are quite celebrated for their strength and goodness; so much so, indeed, that the young men never dream of going to bed without ‘em, and I believe it’s admitted on all hands that THEY know what’s good, and don’t coddle themselves.’ Nicholas laughed, and entering no further into the subject of this lengthened harangue, reverted to the pleasant tone of the little birthday party.
1	It appears to me, my dear Mr. Copperfield,’ said Mrs. Micawber, forcibly, ‘that what Mr. Micawber has to do, is to throw down the gauntlet to society, and say, in effect, “Show me who will take that up.
1	‘Do you know that your forties have stretched into thousands?’ ‘No.’ ‘They have though.’ ‘What’s the time?’ ‘Hark!
1	That night, for the first time in all those many nights, the candle was taken out of the window, Mr. Peggotty swung in his old hammock in the old boat, and the wind murmured with the old sound round his head.
1	‘This was a merry life for the Baron of Grogzwig, and a merrier still for the baron’s retainers, who drank Rhine wine every night till they fell under the table, and then had the bottles on the floor, and called for pipes.
1	Can you lay your hand upon your heart and say that you are worthy of so hysterical a daughter?
1	‘Is Madame Mantalini in?’ faltered Kate.
1	No,” returned the stranger, “but once and away, and on a Saturday night too.
1	"William Guppy," replies the other, "I am in the downs.
1	‘You have got the address?’ ‘Manor Farm, Dingley Dell,’ said Mr. Pickwick, consulting his pocket- book.
1	‘It was very thoughtful to mention it.’ ‘Can I--or Copperfield--do anything?’ asked Traddles, gently.
1	She is truly a comfort to me the first time I see her.’ ‘Perhaps you don’t,’ said the visitor, hesitating--‘perhaps you don’t know my story?
1	Stopped speaking only; her hand was still in motion.
1	I found him out, all in a flash as I may say, one night.
1	Mr. Bumble shortly afterwards took himself off, to prepare for his journey.
1	Of course, I understand THAT, my love, without your telling me; and I said the same to Nicholas, and I AM very much pleased.
1	A lane of small boys beyond me, with the same interest in his eye, watch it too.
1	Though not Professed but Plain, still her wages should be a sufficient object to her to stimilate to soar above mere roast and biled.’ ‘We dined very well indeed,’ said Rosa, ‘thank you.’ ‘Accustomed,’ said Miss Twinkleton with a gracious air, which to the jealous ears of the Billickin seemed to add ‘my good woman’—‘accustomed to a liberal and nutritious, yet plain and salutary diet, we have found no reason to bemoan our absence from the ancient city, and the methodical household, in which the quiet routine of our lot has been hitherto cast.’ ‘I did think it well to mention to my cook,’ observed the Billickin with a gush of candour, ‘which I ’ope you will agree with, Miss Twinkleton, was a right precaution, that the young lady being used to what we should consider here but poor diet, had better be brought forward by degrees.
1	I believe it, in its effects, to be cruel and wrong.
1	Do you know what my great grandfather’s name was?’ ‘No,’ said Steerforth.
1	It was very possible that Mr Abel had not yet left the office.
1	‘You got the place, then?’ ‘I got the place, and no thanks to you for it, nor yet none to Lawyer Lightwood,’ gruffly answered Riderhood.
1	"You have been a soldier," observes Sir Leicester, "and a faithful one."
1	After all, you know, it must be said of you that you couldn’t help yourself: while it would be said of him, with equal reason, that he could.’ ‘That’s true, sir.
1	It happening that nobody did, he remarked with a mysterious air that he had heard a medical gentleman as went down to Grantham last week, say how that snuff-taking was bad for the eyes; but for his part he had never found it so, and what he said was, that everybody should speak as they found.
1	I am sure you will respect it.
1	‘For,’ said he, ‘as my business with this set of gentlemen was to do a public duty and a public service, and as their business with me was to prevent it by wearing my soul out, I think we had better not eat and drink together with a show of being of one mind.’ Mr Meagles was much amused by his friend’s oddity; and patronised him with a more protecting air of allowance than usual, when he rejoined: ‘Well, well, Dan, you shall have your own crotchety way.’ To Mr Henry Gowan, as the time approached, Clennam tried to convey by all quiet and unpretending means, that he was frankly and disinterestedly desirous of tendering him any friendship he would accept.
1	'Even if it had been the right place, and the right fellows had been there, what could I have done, single-handed?
1	"You would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day, often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all," said Scrooge.
1	Too rul loo rul      Too rul loo rul --still, in my desire to be wiser, I got this composition by heart with the utmost gravity; nor do I recollect that I questioned its merit, except that I thought (as I still do) the amount of Too rul somewhat in excess of the poetry.
1	Did he sip every flower, and change every hour, until Polly his passion requited?--Is her name Polly?’ The Elfin suddenness with which she pounced upon me with this question, and a searching look, quite disconcerted me for a moment.
1	Throughout the remainder of the day, Bleeding Heart Yard was in consternation, as the grim Pancks cruised in it; haranguing the inhabitants on their backslidings in respect of payment, demanding his bond, breathing notices to quit and executions, running down defaulters, sending a swell of terror on before him, and leaving it in his wake.
1	Oliver glanced at it, and saw that it was directed to Harry Maylie, Esquire, at some great lord's house in the country; where, he could not make out.
1	And as to being regarded in lights, there’s bumpey lights as well as bony.
1	pursues Mr. Bucket, pinching Malta's cheeks.
1	Do you know him, Mr.
1	They were all poor country people in the church, for the castle in which the old family had lived, was an empty ruin, and there were none but humble folks for seven miles around.
1	‘I got it out of him,’ said Fledgeby, with a stammer.
1	I suppose I looked uncertain, for he went on hastily: ‘You have heard the “counting-house” mentioned, or the business, or the cellars, or the wharf, or something about it.’ ‘I think I have heard the business mentioned, sir,’ I said, remembering what I vaguely knew of his and his sister’s resources.
1	‘You can tell father if you will.’  Then, staying her for a moment, she said, ‘It was you who made my room so cheerful, and gave it this look of welcome?’ ‘Oh no, Louisa, it was done before I came.
1	When toned down again, the unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box.
1	The fact is that Mrs Crummles--most extraordinary woman, Johnson.’ Here he broke off and whispered something in his ear.
1	Tom-all-Alone's My Lady Dedlock is restless, very restless.
1	‘So should I,’ said Mr. Tupman, speaking for the first time.
1	There’s his full-length portrait, painted by himself and presented to you, warranted a likeness!
1	Ring merrily for births that make expectants writhe, and marriages that are made in hell, and toll ruefully for the dead whose shoes are worn already!
1	It could not be doubted that this was the truth.
1	‘Only a man fallen out of a four pair of stairs’ window; but it’s a very fair case indeed.’ ‘Do you mean that the patient is in a fair way to recover?’ inquired Mr. Pickwick.
1	‘It is not for an old soldier of the Bagstock breed,’ observed the Major, relapsing into a mild state, ‘to deliver himself up, a prey to his own emotions; but--damme, Sir,’ cried the Major, in another spasm of ferocity, ‘I condole with you!’ The Major’s purple visage deepened in its hue, and the Major’s lobster eyes stood out in bolder relief, as he shook Mr Dombey by the hand, imparting to that peaceful action as defiant a character as if it had been the prelude to his immediately boxing Mr Dombey for a thousand pounds a side and the championship of England.
1	I had only gone out with Peepy after he was found and given him a little, tiny horse!--"and, cousin John, she softened poor Caroline, the eldest one, so much and was so thoughtful for me and so amiable!
1	And she would wait, Copperfield, till she was sixty--any age you can mention--for me!’ Traddles rose from his chair, and, with a triumphant smile, put his hand upon the white cloth I had observed.
1	Listen, all the world, to this creature of Virtue!
1	‘I AM miserable,’ returned Madame Mantalini, evidently pouting.
1	If you had ever seen her sister, you would know her to have been as resolute and haughty as she."
1	Standing by the table, with his finger in the page to keep the place, and his right arm flourishing above his head, Traddles, as Mr. Pitt, Mr. Fox, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Burke, Lord Castlereagh, Viscount Sidmouth, or Mr. Canning, would work himself into the most violent heats, and deliver the most withering denunciations of the profligacy and corruption of my aunt and Mr. Dick; while I used to sit, at a little distance, with my notebook on my knee, fagging after him with all my might and main.
1	I did not understand it.
1	Having with a grave face touched the wounds upon the head, and the broken arms, he took the hand.
1	It and I have worn away together.
1	Eligible single gentlemen pass and repass--but there is no invitation for to inquire within or without.
1	‘This is a device to keep him out of the way,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, starting from the dull office window whence she had watched him last.
1	'Doctor, your clients are people of condition.
1	It ain’t my father’s writin’, ‘cept this here signater in print letters; that’s his.’ ‘Perhaps he got somebody to write it for him, and signed it himself afterwards,’ said the pretty housemaid.
1	I held his hand for a little while in mine.
1	They shone in every part of the dance like moons.
1	Meanwhile, Mr Swiveller, on the top of the stool, drew himself into as flat a shape as possible against the wall, and looked, not unconcernedly, down upon the single gentleman, who appeared at the door growling and cursing in a very awful manner, and, with the boots in his hand, seemed to have an intention of hurling them down stairs on speculation.
1	It is the Radical of Nature to him.
1	I WISH to abstain from instituting any comparison, or drawing any parallel whatever, between the social features of the United States and those of the British Possessions in Canada.
1	"And we had better be that than a pair of noodles, which we should be if we were doing anything else, for it's the only way of doing what we want to do.
1	You understand.’ ‘Right as a trivet, sir,’ replied Mr. Weller, with a wink of intelligence; and having dragged Mr. Pickwick’s portmanteau from the hind boot, into which it had been hastily thrown when they joined the coach at Eatanswill, Mr. Weller disappeared on his errand.
1	Sloppy stared, with both his eyes and all his buttons, and his mouth wide open; but was without loss of time escorted forth by Silas Wegg, pushed out at the yard gate by the shoulders, and locked out.
1	‘First of all, I’m a-going to call you Boffin, for short,’ said Wegg.
1	In that one moment, every shadow of doubt or agitation passed away from Walter’s soul.
1	Seated round the table were four or five boys, none older than the Dodger, smoking long clay pipes, and drinking spirits with the air of middle-aged men.
1	The sensation is heightened as the tidings spread from mouth to mouth that the beadle is on the ground and has gone in.
1	It was tempting to think of that expensive Mercenary publicly airing his boots in the archway of the Blue Boar's posting-yard; it was almost solemn to imagine him casually produced in the tailor's shop, and confounding the disrespectful senses of Trabb's boy.
1	Feels very low and melancholy, is very feverish, and has a constant thirst upon him; thinks it must be the wine he used to drink (cheers).
1	I see one thing,” said Carton.
1	‘Now, old ‘un!’ cried Fascination, in his light raillery, ‘what dodgery are you up to next, sitting there with your eyes shut?
1	There is not—there may be—I really don’t see my way to what I want to say, but I must say it before we part—there is not any other young—’ ‘O no, Eddy!
1	It makes me giddy to see you!’ But Mr. Tartar, with a wave of his hand and the deftness of a cat, had already dipped through his scuttle of scarlet runners without breaking a leaf, and ‘gone below.’ Mr. Grewgious, his bedroom window-blind held aside with his hand, happened at the moment to have Neville’s chambers under his eye for the last time that night.
1	There seemed to be no hope for him.
1	These all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to the Jew; and then turned round and grinned at Oliver.
1	I say I did not resent it, nor did I; but I showed her, by not gratifying her, that I understood her.
1	It was nothing, now, that I had accustomed myself to think of her, when we were both mere children, as one who was far removed from my wild fancies.
1	But that was not to be thought of now, when they sat in the state-equipage with Mrs General on the coach-box.
1	Mr. Tupman had witnessed this process in silent astonishment, when Jackson, turning sharply upon him, said-- ‘I think I ain’t mistaken when I say your name’s Tupman, am I?’ Mr. Tupman looked at Mr. Pickwick; but, perceiving no encouragement in that gentleman’s widely-opened eyes to deny his name, said-- ‘Yes, my name is Tupman, Sir.’ ‘And that other gentleman’s Mr. Winkle, I think?’ said Jackson.
1	‘It was a bright and sunny morning in the pleasant time of summer, when one of those black monks emerged from the abbey portal, and bent his steps towards the house of the fair sisters.
1	At some turns of the road, a pale flare on the horizon, like an exhalation from the ruin-sown land, showed that the city was yet far off; but this poor relief was rare and short-lived.
1	I can’t work you into a miscellaneous one, no how.
1	This is the garden of Lincoln's Inn.
1	They both know what they want and mean to do.
1	And then, ‘Fetch his daughter.’ On both of which errands, quick messengers depart.
1	It blows over the--ha--Surrey hills.
1	Because, without having known them, you never can fully know what it is to be stimilated to frenzy by the sight of the Usurper.’ Offering these excusatory words as if they reflected great credit on himself, Mr Wegg impelled himself with his hands towards a chair in a corner of the room, and there, after a variety of awkward gambols, attained a perpendicular position.
1	The matter being settled thus, little Paul began to cry most piteously, as if he had a foreboding that no good would come of it.
1	Then she would open it at the place where Jip had made it illegible last night, and call Jip up, to look at his misdeeds.
1	Soon, Madame Defarge's hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encircled waist.
1	He had half a mind to draw a line or two upon the board, and show himself what he meant.
1	Can dance, and play music, and sing?
1	I know what it is,’ replied the friend.
1	We shook hands in a very cordial way; and I laughed and laughed, until I pulled out my pocket-handkerchief and wiped my eyes.
1	Here was the strong arm of the law, coming down with twenty gold-beater force, upon two offenders from the metropolis itself; the mighty engine was directed by their own magistrate, and worked by their own officers; and both the criminals, by their united efforts, were securely shut up, in the narrow compass of one sedan-chair.
1	it was but wishing that all he held against her in his hand might be flung to the winds and chance-sown in many places.
1	He has no respect for Mr. Chadband.
1	It was Saturday, and he had gone to Brighton.
1	But wot’s the good of saying that to you!
1	‘Let me tell you, first, that my friends who have been here to-day, know nothing of it, and that their kindness to you has been quite spontaneous and with no hope of return.
1	But hold me the while, and stay with me afterwards.’ ‘My child!
1	He wears his usual expressionless mask--if it be a mask--and carries family secrets in every limb of his body and every crease of his dress.
1	I haven’t got much sense, I know, but if he could be brought to believe that I’d been a faithful servant to him, doing the best I could, and never meaning harm, perhaps he mightn’t--’ Here Kit faltered so long that the child entreated him to speak out, and quickly, for it was very late, and time to shut the window.
1	Who was it who, unaided by his love, regard or notice, thrived and grew beautiful when those so aided died?
1	In the same style he presently passed us on the other side of the street, on his way to the aristocratic part of the town, where he was going to show himself among the few other gentlemen left.
1	“Don’t weep, mama, or you’ll make me weep too!”--“And me!” says the favourite servant, rubbing his eyes with his arm.
1	Hackney coaches, my lord, are such nasty things, that it’s almost better to walk at any time, for although I believe a hackney coachman can be transported for life, if he has a broken window, still they are so reckless, that they nearly all have broken windows.
1	Something must be done with Maggy too, who at present is--ha--barely respectable, barely respectable.
1	On one chair-back hang the old man's hairy cap and coat.
1	Next day the court is all alive--is like a fair, as Mrs. Perkins, more than reconciled to Mrs. Piper, says in amicable conversation with that excellent woman.
1	I shall hear the church-clocks strike, as I sit here.’ Very quietly, she placed a chair before the scanty fire, and sat down in it, drawing her shawl about her.
1	"Naturally there was no end to his tongue then.
1	Not that I complain,’ he added, in his lively, animated, energetic way.
1	It is you I come to see.’ ‘Me?’ replied a soft voice.
1	“Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband's business?
1	‘He always prints, I know, ‘cos he learnt writin’ from the large bills in the booking-offices.
1	I was fully old enough now to be apprenticed to Joe; and when Joe sat with the poker on his knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars, my sister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into opposition on his part, that she would dive at him, take the poker out of his hands, shake him, and put it away.
1	Presently we sat down, side by side; and her angel-face was turned upon me with the welcome I had dreamed of, waking and sleeping, for whole years.
1	All offered up sacrifices to the minion of fortune and the worm of the hour!’ The minion of fortune and the worm of the hour, or in less cutting language, Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire, the Golden Dustman, had become as much at home in his eminently aristocratic family mansion as he was likely ever to be.
1	Old prints of ships with alphabetical references to their various mysteries, hung in frames upon the walls; the Tartar Frigate under weigh, was on the plates; outlandish shells, seaweeds, and mosses, decorated the chimney-piece; the little wainscotted back parlour was lighted by a sky-light, like a cabin.
1	‘I thought so!’ said he.
1	There were holidays at school on other birthdays--none on mine.
1	‘I won’t have visitors--really don’t want visitors,’ she said; ‘little repose--and all that sort of thing--is what I quire.
1	‘Do not mention it.’ ‘Then, with your leave, madam,’ resumed Mr Dorrit, ringing his little bell to summon his valet, ‘I will send for her at once.’ ‘Does Mr Dorrit wish me to remain?’ ‘Perhaps, if you have no other engagement, you would not object for a minute or two--’ ‘Not at all.’ So, Tinkler the valet was instructed to find Miss Amy’s maid, and to request that subordinate to inform Miss Amy that Mr Dorrit wished to see her in his own room.
1	Across the hall, and up the stairs, and along the passages, and through the rooms, which are very brilliant in the season and very dismal out of it--fairy-land to visit, but a desert to live in--the old gentleman is conducted by a Mercury in powder to my Lady's presence.
1	‘Here you are, sir,’ shouted a strange specimen of the human race, in a sackcloth coat, and apron of the same, who, with a brass label and number round his neck, looked as if he were catalogued in some collection of rarities.
1	While doing so, the Captain eyed his visitors intently, and said in a low voice, ‘You see I should have bore down on Sol Gills yesterday, and this morning, but she--she took it away and kept it.
1	There were some boats and barges astrand in the mud, and these enabled us to come within a few yards of her without being seen.
1	If Volumnia have a fault, it is the fault of being a trifle too innocent, seeing that the innocence which would go extremely well with a sash and tucker is a little out of keeping with the rouge and pearl necklace.
1	‘From whom you are to exact the intelligence that is to be useful to me?’ ‘Yes,’ said the old woman, nodding again.
1	There was an execution put into our house, for rent.
1	cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed.
1	"It's eleven o'clock striking by the bell of Saint Paul's.
1	It was of little moment, indeed, whether they were intelligible or no; for there was nobody to care for them, had they been ever so plain.
1	He was a very hard man, and her mother had long been dead.
1	Their education is much as with us; neither better nor worse.
1	But, dear guardian, you are late too, and look weary.
1	To avoid attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as possible for talk and envy, was the general desire.
1	‘Don’t you think that,’ I asked the coachman, in the first stage out of London, ‘a very remarkable sky?
1	And there, my sister was laid quietly in the earth, while the larks sang high above it, and the light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees.
1	Not of the family in the present times only, but in the past times too.
1	‘It’s getting on towards our dinner time you know,’ said Polly.
1	‘It’s so stupid at home,’ she replied, ‘and Miss Murdstone is so absurd!
1	‘Uncle Sol,’ said Walter, ‘I don’t think you’re well.
1	The officer crossed to Doctor Slammer, and Mr. Snodgrass went up to Mr. Winkle.
1	Old Foulon taken, my mother!
1	‘Well,’ said the other, ‘as much in your confidence as you ever chose to let anybody be.’ ‘Ah!’ rejoined Ralph, folding his arms; ‘that’s another thing, quite another thing.’ ‘Don’t let us play upon words, Mr. Nickleby, in the name of humanity.’ ‘Of what?’ said Ralph.
1	The power of his deportment was such that they really were as much overcome with thankfulness as if, instead of quartering himself upon them for the rest of his life, he were making some munificent sacrifice in their favour.
1	For example, if Sir Barnet had the good fortune to get hold of a law recruit, or a country gentleman, and ensnared him to his hospitable villa, Sir Barnet would say to him, on the morning after his arrival, ‘Now, my dear Sir, is there anybody you would like to know?
1	Mr Wegg hinted, to jog his attention: ‘You could hardly have been out parrot-shooting, in the British climate, sir?’ ‘No, no, no,’ said Venus fretfully.
1	From the gutter he was rescued by John Rokesmith, and thus the first meeting with Mrs Higden was inaugurated by the awkward circumstance of their being in possession--one would say at first sight unlawful possession--of the orphan, upside down and purple in the countenance.
1	He wants that Blandois man.’ ‘With whom I saw you in the Strand in London,’ hinted Arthur.
1	Think of the needy man who has spent his all, beggared himself, and pinched his friends, to enter the profession, which is destined never to yield him a morsel of bread.
1	‘Please to sit down again, Sir, and consider yourself welcome.--Why, yes,’ said Plornish, taking a chair, and lifting the elder child upon his knee, that he might have the moral support of speaking to a stranger over his head, ‘I have been on the wrong side of the Lock myself, and in that way we come to know Miss Dorrit.
1	His appearance and manner; are they so honest?’ ‘Very honest.’ ‘And her confidence not to be shaken!
1	"Well, sir, I suppose it is.
1	Then the going on again--so fresh at first, and shortly afterwards so sleepy.
1	There is a press in the room, but its hinges have not creaked, nor has a step been audible upon the floor.
1	I was mentioning your perception of my weaknesses.
1	When nose and moustache had settled into their places again, Monsieur Rigaud loudly snapped his fingers half-a-dozen times; bending forward to jerk the snaps at Arthur, as if they were palpable missiles which he jerked into his face.
1	Now, you’re aware--are you--that you’re in possession of property to which you’ve no right at all?
1	Kate very well understood that this was held out as an additional inducement to her to preserve the strictest silence regarding the events of the preceding night.
1	There was something in that third-person style of being spoken to, that Mr. Sapsea found particularly recognisant of his merits and position.
1	She hurried off, and presently we passed her hushing and singing to her child at her own door and looking anxiously along the road for her drunken husband.
1	Has the picture been engraved, miss?"
1	‘You have heard it all, and you’ll not forget it.
1	His expressions, Lucretia, only yesterday upon the subject of Funerals!’ ‘I am afraid,’ said Mr Dombey, interrupting her testily, ‘that some of those persons upstairs suggest improper subjects to the child.
1	Observing that the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge advanced to listen to their talk.
1	With Mr Eugene Wrayburn in my mind, I have been set aside and I have been cast out.’ ‘If you give those names to my thanking you for your proposal and declining it, is it my fault, Mr Headstone?’ said Lizzie, compassionating the bitter struggle he could not conceal, almost as much as she was repelled and alarmed by it.
1	At last his father disinherited him; but he softened when he was dying, and left him well off, though not nearly so well off as Miss Havisham.--Take another glass of wine, and excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one to be so strictly conscientious in emptying one's glass, as to turn it bottom upwards with the rim on one's nose.” I had been doing this, in an excess of attention to his recital.
1	Fungus trees grew in corners of the cellars.
1	Of course it’s very pleasant that she should be invited, very pleasant, and I have no doubt that she’ll conduct herself extremely well; she always does.
1	She was crossing a gallery of communication that opened at some little distance on the staircase, and was only lighted on great occasions, when she saw, through the opening, which was an arch, the figure of a man coming down some few stairs opposite.
1	Thank gracious goodness heavins, I've found him!'
1	He had known the last witness seven or eight years; that was merely a coincidence.
1	‘After all these years she threatens to desert me in the moment of her coming back again!’ ‘I tell you, mother, for the second time, there have been years for me as well as you,’ said Alice.
1	‘The withered chaplet my dear,’ said Flora, with great enjoyment, ‘is then perished the column is crumbled and the pyramid is standing upside down upon its what’s-his-name call it not giddiness call it not weakness call it not folly I must now retire into privacy and look upon the ashes of departed joys no more but taking a further liberty of paying for the pastry which has formed the humble pretext of our interview will for ever say Adieu!’ Mr F.’s Aunt, who had eaten her pie with great solemnity, and who had been elaborating some grievous scheme of injury in her mind since her first assumption of that public position on the Marshal’s steps, took the present opportunity of addressing the following Sibyllic apostrophe to the relict of her late nephew.
1	Bless his heart; it's Fezziwig alive again!"
1	The carriages in the streets are few, and other late sounds in that neighbourhood there are none, unless a man so very nomadically drunk as to stray into the frigid zone goes brawling and bellowing along the pavement.
1	After all the trouble that has been taken with you!
1	Noon coming, and the Doctor not returning, and every minute's delay tending to compromise Tellson's, Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie.
1	Sydney Carton drank nothing but a little coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to refresh himself, went out to the place of trial.
1	Allan raised him so that she could hold him on her bosom, which was what he wanted.
1	She does not immediately enter, when they have parted, but remains looking after him along the street.
1	There were, certainly, no particular attractions, either in the room over which the glance of Mr. Squeers so discontentedly wandered, or in the narrow street into which it might have penetrated, if he had thought fit to approach the window.
1	The family name depends wery much upon you, Samivel, and I hope you’ll do wot’s right by it.
1	Sol Gills, Sol Gills, what have you been up to, for this many a long day, my ould boy?’ ‘I’m half blind, Ned,’ said the old man, ‘and almost deaf and dumb with joy.’ ‘His wery woice,’ said the Captain, looking round with an exultation to which even his face could hardly render justice--‘his wery woice as chock full o’ science as ever it was!
1	‘It is short, no doubt, my dear.
1	We will sit in the church porch till you come back.’ ‘A good place too,’ said the schoolmaster, leading the way towards it, disencumbering himself of his portmanteau, and placing it on the stone seat.
1	You can’t say more to me than I say to myself.
1	‘It was her father that I got acquainted with first.
1	Full of that vague kind of penitence which holidays awaken next morning, Kit turned out at sunrise, and, with his faith in last night’s enjoyments a little shaken by cool daylight and the return to every-day duties and occupations, went to meet Barbara and her mother at the appointed place.
1	I love little Em’ly, and I don’t love Agnes--no, not at all in that way--but I feel that there are goodness, peace, and truth, wherever Agnes is; and that the soft light of the coloured window in the church, seen long ago, falls on her always, and on me when I am near her, and on everything around.
1	I ask you who done it and how you know it.
1	There was a damp fireplace without any stove, full of wood ashes; a chair, and a very small table; and on the last-named piece of furniture was displayed, in grand array, the doctor’s library, consisting of some half-dozen greasy old books.
1	asked the sleepy Noah, shaking himself pettishly.
1	‘I must, indeed,’ said Mr. Smauker; ‘I promised Bantam.’ ‘Oh, wery well,’ said Sam; ‘that’s another thing.
1	Upon a hasty consideration of the circumstances, it may be matter of surprise to some persons, that Mr. and Mrs. Squeers should have taken so much trouble to repossess themselves of an incumbrance of which it was their wont to complain so loudly; but their surprise will cease when they are informed that the manifold services of the drudge, if performed by anybody else, would have cost the establishment some ten or twelve shillings per week in the shape of wages; and furthermore, that all runaways were, as a matter of policy, made severe examples of, at Dotheboys Hall, inasmuch as, in consequence of the limited extent of its attractions, there was but little inducement, beyond the powerful impulse of fear, for any pupil, provided with the usual number of legs and the power of using them, to remain.
1	‘And all friends round St Paul’s.’ He emptied and put down the wine-glass half-way through this ancient civic toast, and took up the box.
1	Your conscience will tell you, sir, whether I construe it well or not.’ ‘For Heaven’s sake!’ cried Madeline, interposing in alarm between them.
1	And Nicholas went home to brood upon it, and to meditate upon the charms of the unknown young lady, now as far beyond his reach as ever.
1	She meant the burying ground where the man was buried that took the sleeping-stuff--that you came home and told us of, Mr. Snagsby--that frightened me so, Mrs. Snagsby.
1	There is nothing in her manner to express weakness or excite compassion.
1	They made me laugh again by laughing at each other, and then we all three laughed until I was in danger of crying again.
1	However, the only thing to be done being to knock at the door, I knocked, and was told from within to enter.
1	‘Come in, come in!’ said Clennam.
1	I have been in this trouble, and that trouble, and shall be again.
1	Not a person, not a piece of property, not a winder, not a horse, nor a dog, nor a cat, nor a bird, nor a fowl, nor a pig, but what he stoned, for want of an enlightened object.
1	We shall know full soon.
1	That he was a suspicious, crabbed, cranky, used-up, J.
1	‘Bunsby,’ said the Captain, striking home at once, ‘here you are; a man of mind, and a man as can give an opinion.
1	Why not?” He made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more.
1	The breakfast languishes when that is done, the violated hatchments are avenged, and Edith rises to assume her travelling dress.
1	what strange things you fancy!’ ‘It wasn’t fancy, Kate, my dear, I’m certain of that,’ returned her mother.
1	If you ain’t imperious with ‘em, they won’t believe in your being any better than themselves, if as good, after the stories (lies mostly) that they have heard of your beginnings.
1	It received such light as it got through a grating of iron bars fashioned like a pretty large window, by means of which it could be always inspected from the gloomy staircase on which the grating gave.
1	Then I made an excuse to go in with my housekeeping keys, shutting the door after me.
1	I am going to Rome, having friends there.
1	Regardless of all this: for she had weightier matters at heart: Nancy followed the man, with trembling limbs, to a small ante-chamber, lighted by a lamp from the ceiling.
1	Roused at length by the silence, she folded the arms, and with admirable presence of mind looked her friend full in the face, and said interrogatively, ‘Ye-es?
1	‘As soon as that’s ended, send him about his business.’ ‘It shall be done, sir,’ returned Brass; ‘by all means.
1	When all this had been done several times, the Captain shook his head and seemed to think the matter had a bad look.
1	Stopping to look at nothing, but seeing all I did see as I went, I was passing quickly on, and in a few moments should have passed the lighted window, when my echoing footsteps brought it suddenly into my mind that there was a dreadful truth in the legend of the Ghost's Walk, that it was I who was to bring calamity upon the stately house and that my warning feet were haunting it even then.
1	Approaching, he observes that she has journeyed a long distance and is footsore and travel-stained.
1	As more passengers were waiting for us at the inn-door, the coachman observed under his breath, in the usual self-communicative voice, looking the while at his mouldy harness as if it were to that he was addressing himself, ‘I expect we shall want _the big_ coach.’ I could not help wondering within myself what the size of this big coach might be, and how many persons it might be designed to hold; for the vehicle which was too small for our purpose was something larger than two English heavy night coaches, and might have been the twin-brother of a French Diligence.
1	These are the Great Seal's impressions, my dear, all over England--the children know them!"
1	More; he irritated it, with a kind of perverse pleasure akin to that which a sick man sometimes has in irritating a wound upon his body.
1	Sit down, there’s a dear young man, and let me tell you all about it.’ Nicholas needed no second invitation, and eagerly inquired what was the news.
1	You von’t think o’ arrestin’ your own son for the money, and sendin’ him off to the Fleet, will you, you unnat’ral wagabone?’ At this reply of Sam’s, the father and son exchanged a complete code of telegraph nods and gestures, after which, the elder Mr. Weller sat himself down on a stone step and laughed till he was purple.
1	‘That was the treatment, you see.
1	Is it really, though?’ I replied that I liked it well enough, but that I certainly could not claim so much for it.
1	The attention and distinction you have so impressively mentioned, Mrs General, as attaching to this confidence, are, I have no doubt, of the most complimentary and gratifying description; but they don’t at all proceed from me.
1	The back is Guster's bedroom, and in it she's a-carrying on, poor thing, to a frightful extent!"
1	‘Now, Master,’ said the Chicken, doggedly, when he, at length, caught Mr Toots’s eye, ‘I want to know whether this here gammon is to finish it, or whether you’re a going in to win?’ ‘Chicken,’ returned Mr Toots, ‘explain yourself.’ ‘Why then, here’s all about it, Master,’ said the Chicken.
1	If it were my brother who had committed it, I would not spare him."
1	And if you ain’t the gentleman I took you for, may be my mind has call to be uneasy.
1	inquired the lawyer in a low voice.
1	It ain’t much to boast of, genteel as his own is.
1	"My dear Miss Summerson," said he, shaking his head pleasantly, "I don't know.
1	‘When I was very young,’ said Annie, ‘quite a little child, my first associations with knowledge of any kind were inseparable from a patient friend and teacher--the friend of my dead father--who was always dear to me.
1	There’s not such a spring in England as the pump under the archway.
1	'Look how he stares, Jack!
1	This was not lost on the speaker.
1	Below the table, again, was a long row of solicitors, with bundles of papers on the matting at their feet; and then there were the gentlemen of the bar in wigs and gowns--some awake and some asleep, and one talking, and nobody paying much attention to what he said.
1	There were afternoon times when she was unemployed, when visitors dropped in to play a hand at cards with her father, when she could be spared and was better away.
1	I think Tom may be gradually falling into trouble, and I wish to stretch out a helping hand to him from the depths of my wicked experience.—Shall I say again, for his sake?
1	This narration ended, Mr Garland put some questions to Kit respecting his qualifications and general acquirements, while Mrs Garland noticed the children, and hearing from Kit’s mother certain remarkable circumstances which had attended the birth of each, related certain other remarkable circumstances which had attended the birth of her own son, Mr Abel, from which it appeared that both Kit’s mother and herself had been, above and beyond all other women of what condition or age soever, peculiarly hemmed in with perils and dangers.
1	Besides, they know where to find you, and I represent you.
1	A man was certainly not old at forty; and many men were not in circumstances to marry, or did not marry, until they had attained that time of life.
1	Respecting the quiet tea, my dear, why you see the occupations of the day are sometimes a little wearing; and if there’s nothing interposed between the day and your mother, why SHE is sometimes a little wearing, too.’ ‘I know, Pa.’ ‘Yes, my dear.
1	‘I’ll dispose of him so, then, Mr Gills,’ he answered, rising, and shaking the old man by the hand, ‘until I make up my mind what to do with him, and what he deserves.
1	‘What I dwell upon most,’ says Jasper, pursuing his subject of romantic interest, ‘is the remarkable accuracy with which you would seem to find out where people are buried.—What is the matter?
1	Richard Swiveller kept his eyes fixed on his visitor during its narration, and directly it was concluded, took the word again.
1	So he remains for a minute or two, heaped up against it, and then staggers down the shop to the front door.
1	There was Krook, deceased; there was Nimrod, deceased; and there was Jo, deceased; and they were "all in it."
1	I endeavoured to hit a happy medium between these two extremes; my aunt approved the result; and Mr. Dick threw one of his shoes after Traddles and me, for luck, as we went downstairs.
1	It wants constant attention in the littlest things.
1	Mr. Winkle kissed the young lady with the black eyes, and Mr. Snodgrass kissed Emily; and Mr. Weller, not being particular about the form of being under the mistletoe, kissed Emma and the other female servants, just as he caught them.
1	He had a weakness in the region of the knees, and a trustfulness in his long face, which appealed even to five-feet nine for encouragement and support.
1	that’s not enough!’ she cried.
1	One Christmas time, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone, he did come, for the first time, just like that.
1	There was no reason, however, why I should refrain from seeing the person who had inconsiderately sent her to so great a distance by night and alone, and as it was not improbable that if she found herself near home she might take farewell of me and deprive me of the opportunity, I avoided the most frequented ways and took the most intricate, and thus it was not until we arrived in the street itself that she knew where we were.
1	I was just giving you up, sir, and going home."
1	I often walked past it afterwards, and never for a long time without thinking of him and half expecting to meet him.
1	Within a few minutes of our stopping, not before, I saw two great white clouds rising up slowly and majestically from the depths of the earth.
1	‘Once I was in earnest, I tell you that, for I had more than half a mind to swear he uttered threats, and demanded my life or my money.’ ‘Oho!’ said Ralph, eyeing him askew.
1	And having now got the Channel between himself and John Chivery, he began to feel safe, and to find that the foreign air was lighter to breathe than the air of England.
1	she asked, after they had walked a few hundred yards.
1	I have fear of this man.
1	‘Come!’ cried the subject of this admiration, returning.
1	‘This is indeed an unexpected pleasure!
1	He’d be sharper than a serpent’s tooth, if he wasn’t as dull as ditch water.
1	‘Well, sir,’ said Mr. Pickwick, with the profound solemnity with which that great man could, when he pleased, render his remarks so deeply impressive.
1	What have I been and done?
1	Allan proceeds to tell him all he knows about Jo, unto which the trooper listens with a grave face.
1	Did I not, Charley?’ ‘Well, never mind that now,’ said the boy.
1	I was so curious to know, that I made up my mind to have it out with Mr. Peggotty.
1	“That's no question as it stands, you know.” “Will soon come to London,” said I, after casting about for a precise form of words, “or summon me anywhere else?” “Now, here,” replied Mr. Jaggers, fixing me for the first time with his dark deep-set eyes, “we must revert to the evening when we first encountered one another in your village.
1	"He is changed," he returned, shaking his head.
1	Now, I come to the cruel part of the story,--merely breaking off, my dear Handel, to remark that a dinner-napkin will not go into a tumbler.” Why I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler, I am wholly unable to say.
1	The gushing fountains which sparkle in the sun, must not be stopped in mere caprice; the oasis in the desert of Sahara must not be plucked up idly.’ I hardly knew what I did, I was burning all over to that extraordinary extent; but I took Dora’s little hand and kissed it--and she let me!
1	‘Much better too, I hope?’ Eugene turned his eyes towards Lizzie, as if to spare her, and answered nothing.
1	‘Then I am delighted to say,’ cried Traddles, beaming with joy, ‘that we have recovered the whole money!’ ‘Don’t congratulate me, anybody!’ exclaimed my aunt.
1	He had turned the cuffs back, half-way up his arm, to get his hands out of the sleeves: apparently with the ultimate view of thrusting them into the pockets of his corduroy trousers; for there he kept them.
1	"You ought to do it of yourself," George answers; "I know that very well, Mrs. Bagnet.
1	Sophy educates ‘em.’ ‘The second daughter, perhaps?’ I hazarded.
1	It ain’t--ain’t catching.’ Lizzie murmured that she had something to do in her own room, and went away upstairs.
1	Your brother favours me to the utmost, and it is likely that we might live and work together; anyhow, it is certain that he would have my best influence and support.
1	Not a cousin of the batch but is really indignant, and connects it with the feebleness of William Buffy when in office, and really does feel deprived of a stake in the country--or the pension list--or something--by fraud and wrong.
1	"Yet would you believe that it's HIS name on the door-plate?"
1	The exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells; and what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and his devouring hunger far away.
1	I have a light hand; and if I have been seen apparently to correct Madame Rigaud in that manner, I have done it almost playfully.’ If the playfulness of Monsieur Rigaud were at all expressed by his smile at this point, the relations of Madame Rigaud might have said that they would have much preferred his correcting that unfortunate woman seriously.
1	I was jealous of everybody.
1	I am old in years, and older still in misery and care.
1	Thus, the flush of the day, in its heat and light, would gradually decline; and again the golden water would be dancing on the wall.
1	It is quite a bower in the summer-time.
1	They were clean and new, and I spread them out and handed them over to him.
1	And at night, you urge me, with great mystery, to start before the ladies are stirring; the consequence of which is, that young Oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when he ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all kinds.
1	‘It looks as if the old man’s spirit had found rest at last; don’t it?’ said Mrs Boffin.
1	‘Only you!’ cried the dwarf, stretching his neck to obtain a better view of his visitor.
1	When they were all wearied out, and could tear and beat no longer, they dragged Oliver, struggling and shouting, but nothing daunted, into the dust-cellar, and there locked him up.
1	His daughter, turning the bracelet on her arm, and now looking at him, and now looking from him, said, ‘Very well, papa.
1	Moreover, I have done no wrong, and have injured no man.
1	‘Yes, Mrs Richards, it’s me,’ said Susan, ‘and I wish it wasn’t, though I may not seem to flatter when I say so, but little Master Paul is very ill, and told his Pa today that he would like to see the face of his old nurse, and him and Miss Floy hope you’ll come along with me--and Mr Walter, Mrs Richards--forgetting what is past, and do a kindness to the sweet dear that is withering away.
1	He was requested to place himself in communication with Mr Mortimer Lightwood, as a possible means of furthering the ends of justice, and a reward was offered to any one acquainted with his whereabout who would communicate the same to the said Mr Mortimer Lightwood at his office in the Temple.
1	Decrepit age, and vigorous life, and blooming youth, and helpless infancy, poured forth--on crutches, in the pride of strength and health, in the full blush of promise, in the mere dawn of life--to gather round her tomb.
1	I know it does.’ Of Paul and Walter.
1	Now what are you going to do?
1	Now, if your pretty granddaughter--excuse me, miss--will condescend to take care of this pipe for two months, we shall save the cost of one next time.
1	I doubt if she could have been induced to desert her post, by anyone else.
1	I kept my resentment to myself; but I knew very well that it was her way of petting the knowledge that she was my Mistress, and might have behaved differently to her servant if it had been her fancy.
1	'My name is Oliver, sir,' replied the little invalid:  with a look of great astonishment.
1	Damme,’ screamed the dwarf, ‘I’ll be a bachelor in earnest.’ ‘You can’t be serious, Quilp,’ sobbed his wife.
1	What should I ever do without you!’ ‘Me leave you, my precious!’ cried Peggotty.
1	I should forget how to wear a whole coat now.
1	‘First, he wants some water,’ said he, looking round.
1	I recollect trying to think about something (about anything in the whole wide world, I was not particular) without the smallest effect.
1	'I'll eat my head, sir,' repeated Mr. Grimwig, striking his stick upon the ground.
1	‘Ven the lady and gen’l’m’n as keeps the hot-el first begun business, they used to make the beds on the floor; but this wouldn’t do at no price, ‘cos instead o’ taking a moderate twopenn’orth o’ sleep, the lodgers used to lie there half the day.
1	I fear you spoke to me?’ ‘I said,’ remarked Fledgeby, a little louder than before, ‘it was a fine day.’ ‘I beg your pardon.
1	This gentleman,’ said Miss Tox, pointing out the apple-faced man, ‘is the father.
1	‘Who says so?’ cried Nicholas, rising from his knee and confronting them, but still retaining Madeline’s lifeless hand in his.
1	Well; might you be acquainted with my middle finger, the T’other?’ ‘I know quite as much of him,’ said Bradley, with a frown and a distant look before him, ‘as I want to know.’ ‘Hooroar!’ cried the man.
1	This was frequently their theme of conversation.
1	In consideration of this eminent public service, the Barnacle then in power had recommended the Crown to bestow a pension of two or three hundred a-year on his widow; to which the next Barnacle in power had added certain shady and sedate apartments in the Palaces at Hampton Court, where the old lady still lived, deploring the degeneracy of the times in company with several other old ladies of both sexes.
1	“Nothing yet.” “What's coming on?” “The Treason case.” “The quartering one, eh?” “Ah!” returned the man, with a relish; “he'll be drawn on a hurdle to be half hanged, and then he'll be taken down and sliced before his own face, and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on, and then his head will be chopped off, and he'll be cut into quarters.
1	I was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs. Pocket's falling into a discussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies, while she ate a sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine, and, forgetting all about the baby on her lap, who did most appalling things with the nut-crackers.
1	I’ve had my dinner.’ ‘You dine early, sir,’ said the powdered-headed footman.
1	Nobody said what anything was, but everybody said what the Mrs Generals, Mr Eustace, or somebody else said it was.
1	He knew me better than I knew myself.
1	"I am very glad to go there, sir," I answered.
1	Sometimes, we strike into the skirting mud, to avoid the stones that clatter us and shake us; sometimes, we stick in ruts and sloughs there.
1	When one of 'em says to another, 'He was a convict, a few year ago, and is a ignorant common fellow now, for all he's lucky,' what do I say?
1	"My time is nearly gone."
1	“Darn me if I couldn't eat em,” said the man, with a threatening shake of his head, “and if I han't half a mind to't!” I earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldn't, and held tighter to the tombstone on which he had put me; partly, to keep myself upon it; partly, to keep myself from crying.
1	He told me that what she had said of being here, and there, and everywhere, was true enough; for she made little darts into the provinces, and seemed to pick up customers everywhere, and to know everybody.
1	I was a nuisance, an incumbrance, and a pest.
1	As if this were not bad enough for me, the boys, connecting me with the establishment, on account of the patience and perseverance with which I sat outside, half-dressed, pelted me, and used me very ill all day.
1	Disguised, but the same man.
1	It was a perfectly decent room, half parlour and half kitchen, but not at all a snug room.
1	‘I was quite at your disposition.
1	"Even if I have grown so much wiser, what then?
1	‘Is anybody else a-goin’, Tommy?’ said Mrs. Cluppins, arranging her pelerine.
1	You don’t know how wet and cold I am, or how many times I have lost my way in coming here through this thick fog.
1	Quite alarmed at being the only recipient of this untimely visit, and the only spectator of this portentous behaviour, I exclaimed again, ‘Pray tell me, Miss Mowcher, what is the matter!
1	‘Damn that boy, he’s always at something of that sort.’ ‘Never was such a boy, I do believe,’ said Mrs. Squeers; ‘whatever he has is always catching too.
1	And soon the young couple go out of the Nuns’ House, taking all precautions against the discovery of the so vitally defective boots of Mr. Edwin Drood: precautions, let us hope, effective for the peace of Mrs. Edwin Drood that is to be.
1	‘You are very good,’ said Mr. Micawber.
1	Over the chair they had thrown a red flag, and to the back of it they had bound a pike with a red cap on its top.
1	These two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating voice; whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool.
1	there are times when ignorance is bliss indeed.
1	‘You have done a stealthy and unbecoming action, Mr. Copperfield.
1	‘Why do you bring your prolifigate companions here?
1	There was something in Kate’s manner that was not to be resisted, and so Nathaniel Pipkin complied with the invitation; and after a great deal of blushing on his part, and immoderate laughter on that of the wicked little cousin, Nathaniel Pipkin went down on his knees on the dewy grass, and declared his resolution to remain there for ever, unless he were permitted to rise the accepted lover of Maria Lobbs.
1	‘It shall be brought round in any way it likes best, and not brought round at all if it likes that better,’ retorted Mr. Mantalini, with his egg-spoon in his mouth.
1	‘What on earth has anybody to do with the--with the--Bones of my son?
1	I seem, then, to be worthier of the eldest Miss Larkins.
1	‘I am disappointed myself,’ said Quilp, ‘out of mere friendly feeling for them; but you have real reasons, private reasons I have no doubt, for your disappointment, and therefore it comes heavier than mine.’ ‘Why, of course it does,’ Dick observed, testily.
1	by Gad, it’s quite Minervian.’ ‘It’ll look well enough when it comes to be finished,’ observed Mrs Jarley.
1	He lighted a candle, set out his little tea-board, got hot water from below, and brought in small portions of tea and sugar, a loaf, and some butter from the nearest shop.
1	“Take Mr. Pip's written order, and pay him twenty pounds.” This strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked impression on me, and that not of an agreeable kind.
1	Engines at pits’ mouths, and lean old horses that had worn the circle of their daily labour into the ground, were alike quiet; wheels had ceased for a short space to turn; and the great wheel of earth seemed to revolve without the shocks and noises of another time.
1	The mud and water fly about us.
1	‘He never loved me; he never loved Wackford, who is next door but one to a cherubim.
1	Fifteen guineas, tea and sugar, and servants allowed to see male cousins, if godly.
1	“Well?” cried my sister, addressing us both at once.
1	‘With which object in view, Marchioness,’ said Mr Swiveller gravely, ‘I shall ask your ladyship’s permission to put the board in my pocket, and to retire from the presence when I have finished this tankard; merely observing, Marchioness, that since life like a river is flowing, I care not how fast it rolls on, ma’am, on, while such purl on the bank still is growing, and such eyes light the waves as they run.
1	‘I will remain here to light you up the stairs.
1	I--a--I’ll know nobody--and--a--say nothing--and--a--live nowhere--until I have crushed--to--a--undiscoverable atoms--the--transcendent and immortal hypocrite and perjurer--HEEP!’ I really had some fear of Mr. Micawber’s dying on the spot.
1	The man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have sustained him in that place that day, against such denunciation.
1	Then the curtain moved more perceptibly, and the woman in the bed put it back, and sat up.
1	Over this bib her dimples looked delightful, and under it her pretty figure not less so.
1	And of course I should.’ The subject of their dispute, who had seated himself, laughed aloud, and rapped his legs with his hand.
1	You went down to the river together?’ ‘Undoubtedly.
1	Not caring what she thought of you (and Goodness knows THAT was of no consequence!)
1	‘How much have we in hand?’ ‘Very little indeed,’ replied Madame.
1	‘Then it was their own fault,’ said Mr Podsnap.
1	I cannot bear ’t nommore.
1	‘I can’t speak to you just now, Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	Turn all your pockets inside out, and leave ‘em so!’ cried the person of the house.
1	The old man lifted up his eyes once more to the little eyes in Mr Fledgeby’s head, with some reviving hope that the sign might be coming yet.
1	Curse me!’ Unwilling to hazard another quarrel, Mr. Pickwick gladly assented to the proposition, and consigned the money to Mr. Mivins, who, as it was nearly eleven o’clock, lost no time in repairing to the coffee-room on his errand.
1	It added in a postscript that I would not be many hours from Ada.
1	To see how she operated upon him with a pen-knife!
1	‘You don’t say more than the truth when you say that,’ replied Squeers.
1	‘For God’s sake consider my deplorable condition; and, while I promise to take no step without taking counsel with you, give me, at least, a vote in my own behalf.’ Moved by this entreaty, Newman stammered forth a variety of most unaccountable and entangled sentences, the upshot of which was, that Mrs. Kenwigs had examined him, at great length that morning, touching the origin of his acquaintance with, and the whole life, adventures, and pedigree of, Nicholas; that Newman had parried these questions as long as he could, but being, at length, hard pressed and driven into a corner, had gone so far as to admit, that Nicholas was a tutor of great accomplishments, involved in some misfortunes which he was not at liberty to explain, and bearing the name of Johnson.
1	I know perfectly well why you have been taking such an interest in this Mrs Gowan.
1	Nothing lay there, any longer, but the ruin of the mortal house on which the rain had beaten, and the black hair that had fluttered in the wintry wind.
1	Why the—Devil, I was going to say, if it had been respectful to their memory—couldn’t they leave us alone?’ ‘Tut, tut, dear boy,’ Mr. Jasper remonstrates, in a tone of gentle deprecation.
1	The bed had not been lain on, but was smooth and empty.
1	At last they came into a maze of dust, where a quantity of people were tumbling over one another, and where there was such a confusion of unaccountable shapes of beams, bulkheads, brick walls, ropes, and rollers, and such a mixing of gaslight and daylight, that they seemed to have got on the wrong side of the pattern of the universe.
1	I will engage that you shall be, and even that young Drood shall make the first advance.
1	‘Similarly, it was through Mr Lightwood that you ever saw her again, for you were with him on the night when my father was found, and so I found you with her on the next day.
1	‘Answer to your names, gentlemen, that you may be sworn,’ said the gentleman in black.
1	'It was the Family Pet, I tell you.
1	‘_Can _you!’ repeated Mr. Martin, with a smile of pity.
1	"But I may ask you a question, Richard?"
1	Here I sit at the desk again, on a drowsy summer afternoon.
1	By degrees his attention grew more and more attracted by the objects around him; and at last he derived as much enjoyment from the ride, as if it had been undertaken for the pleasantest reason in the world.
1	He was well dressed, of a sprightly and gay appearance, a well-knit figure, and a rich dark complexion.
1	When not doing so himself, he may have some informant skulking about, in the person of a watchman, porter, or such-like hanger-on of Staple.
1	‘Of course he proposed it, but how did it all come about?
1	I don't know nothink about nothink at all."
1	I think an inn is a good sort of a place to propose to a single woman in, Mr. Pickwick.
1	The boy, who in the midst of his astonishment could not help staring wildly at the gentleman with so many white teeth who was choking him, and at the office walls, as though determined, if he were choked, that his last look should be at the mysteries for his intrusion into which he was paying such a severe penalty, at last contrived to utter-- ‘Come, Sir!
1	Her constant nature turned to him in his distress, as fervently and faithfully, as if, in his prosperity, he had been the embodiment of that idea which had gradually become so faint and dim.
1	‘And very good ones too, I believe, haven’t they?’ asked the married lady.
1	Speaking of daughters, I have seen Miss Dombey.’ There was a sudden rush of blood to Mr Dombey’s face.
1	Is it Riderhood, Miss?’ ‘Well; yes it is.’ ‘Yes!
1	What do you mean by it?’ ‘It ain’t my fault.’ ‘Could you eat any bread and meat?’ said Dick, taking down his hat.
1	Various little presents to Mrs. Nickleby, always of the very things they most required, tended in no slight degree to the improvement and embellishment of the cottage.
1	The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come conveyed him, as before--though at a different time, he thought: indeed, there seemed no order in these latter visions, save that they were in the Future--into the resorts of business men, but showed him not himself.
1	Like the notes of a fiddle, you sweetly, sir, sweetly,      Raises our spirits and charms our ears.” Good-night, sir.’ ‘I shall have a word or two to say to you, Mr Wegg, before long,’ remarked Venus, ‘respecting my share in the project we’ve been speaking of.’ ‘My time, sir,’ returned Wegg, ‘is yours.
1	But he had married in England?
1	“Did you think of walking down to Walworth?” said he.
1	Can you make a honourable lady of her?"
1	Say there is anything again earning it.” This I put to myself strong, as in duty bound; “how can it be said without blaming Lawyer Lightwood for offering it to be earned?” And was it for ME to blame Lawyer Lightwood?
1	But what put marriage in your head?’ ‘I don’t know!--You mustn’t marry more than one person at a time, may you, Peggotty?’ ‘Certainly not,’ says Peggotty, with the promptest decision.
1	‘In the act, my dear Annie,’ repeated Mrs. Markleham, spreading the newspaper on her lap like a table-cloth, and patting her hands upon it, ‘of making his last Will and Testament.
1	‘Yes.’ ‘O, I could never go there any more.
1	It was quite exhilarating to hear the clash and bustle with which he banged the door and jumped up behind after Mrs. Nickleby was in; and as that good lady was perfectly unconscious that he applied the gold-headed end of his long stick to his nose, and so telegraphed most disrespectfully to the coachman over her very head, she sat in a state of much stiffness and dignity, not a little proud of her position.
1	He put it aside by merely repeating that he had a high regard for Mr Doyce.
1	On the whole, I would recommend you to take to Doctors’ Commons kindly, David.
1	We have lived plainly enough here, Phil and I.
1	Every eye was turned to the jury.
1	It was a little idea of mine.
1	But Joey B. has lived in the world, Sir: lived in the world with his eyes open, Sir, and his ears cocked: and Joe tells you, Dombey, that there’s a devilish artful and ambitious woman over the way.’ Mr Dombey involuntarily glanced over the way; and an angry glance he sent in that direction, too.
1	I’ll not meddle; don’t mind me.’ To get her brother out of the prison; out of the succession to Mrs Bangham in executing commissions, and out of the slang interchange with very doubtful companions consequent upon both; was her hardest task.
1	"You are impanelled here to inquire into the death of a certain man.
1	‘Thank you,’ replied Alfred, showing all his teeth.
1	‘I was not present myself,’ replied the visitor, ‘and in consequence of your firm refusal to give your card to Doctor Slammer, I was desired by that gentleman to identify the wearer of a very uncommon coat--a bright blue dress-coat, with a gilt button displaying a bust, and the letters Mr. Winkle actually staggered with astonishment as he heard his own costume thus minutely described.
1	Soon afterwards, came a slamming and banging of doors; and then came running down stairs, a gentleman with whiskers, and out of breath, who seemed to be red-hot.
1	But, astounded as he was by the apparition of the dwarf among the Little Bethelites, and not free from a misgiving that it was the forerunner of some trouble or annoyance, he was compelled to subdue his wonder and to take active measures for the withdrawal of his parent, as the evening was now creeping on, and the matter grew serious.
1	The old lady nearly blowed us into shivers and smithers, many times.’ ‘Why?’ asked Bella.
1	'I lost the boy, and no efforts of mine could recover him.
1	So, when the words were all spoken, he too kneeled on one knee on the grass, and the two men looked at one another.
1	In his dear Sophronia’s name and in his own, thank you!
1	You know what they are?’ ‘Oh yes, I know what they are,’ said Paul.
1	‘I’ve a little something to trouble you with, Sir.’ ‘Me!’ exclaimed Mr. Snodgrass.
1	He wore the blue bag in the manner of my great-coat, and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the opposite side of the street, attended by a company of delighted young friends to whom he from time to time exclaimed, with a wave of his hand, “Don't know yah!”  Words cannot state the amount of aggravation and injury wreaked upon me by Trabb's boy, when passing abreast of me, he pulled up his shirt-collar, twined his side-hair, stuck an arm akimbo, and smirked extravagantly by, wriggling his elbows and body, and drawling to his attendants, “Don't know yah, don't know yah, 'pon my soul don't know yah!” The disgrace attendant on his immediately afterwards taking to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with crows, as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was a blacksmith, culminated the disgrace with which I left the town, and was, so to speak, ejected by it into the open country.
1	Then as I sit a-looking at the fire, I seem to see in the burning coal--like where that glow is now--’ ‘That’s gas, that is,’ said the boy, ‘coming out of a bit of a forest that’s been under the mud that was under the water in the days of Noah’s Ark.
1	Yet in that same moment he was the Secretary also, Mr Boffin’s Secretary.
1	How could they help it!
1	Then Caddy hung upon her father and nursed his cheek against hers as if he were some poor dull child in pain.
1	But Louisa saw her, I have no doubt, in Mrs. Gradgrind’s presence.’ ‘Pray, Mrs. Gradgrind,’ said Bounderby, ‘what passed?’ ‘Oh, my poor health!’ returned Mrs. Gradgrind.
1	Mr Carker in his own office was the first step; Mr Morfin, in his own office, was the second.
1	Are you in the Funns, or where are you?
1	“Tell me directly what you've been doing to wear me away with fret and fright and worrit, or I'd have you out of that corner if you was fifty Pips, and he was five hundred Gargerys.” “I have only been to the churchyard,” said I, from my stool, crying and rubbing myself.
1	As it was, she had no such vent: she could only ponder on her own difficulties, and wonder more and more why this avoidance of Edwin’s name should last, now that she knew—for so much Helena had told her—that a good understanding was to be reëstablished between the two young men, when Edwin came down.
1	you, of course,’ said Mr. Tupman.
1	But I leave the ole to you, Mr Boffin.’ ‘Come!’ said Mr Boffin.
1	And get on, my lads!"
1	‘It is not funny at all.’ ‘Oh!’ said Nell, with all possible humility.
1	I felt myself quite a proctor when I read this document aloud with all possible ceremony, and set forth its provisions, any number of times, to those whom they concerned.
1	Then who so blest and happy as Mrs John Rokesmith, saving and excepting Mr John Rokesmith!
1	‘Hip, hip, hip, and nine times nine, and one to finish with, and all that, understood.
1	The horse no sooner beheld Mr. Pickwick advancing towards him with the chaise whip in his hand, than he exchanged the rotary motion in which he had previously indulged, for a retrograde movement of so very determined a character, that it at once drew Mr. Winkle, who was still at the end of the bridle, at a rather quicker rate than fast walking, in the direction from which they had just come.
1	For a moment only; but with a transient gleam of scornful wonder on her face, not lost on one observer, who was smiling round the board.
1	He begins quite to amuse our little party.
1	‘Such a fresh, blooming, modest little bud, neighbour,’ said Quilp, nursing his short leg, and making his eyes twinkle very much; ‘such a chubby, rosy, cosy, little Nell!’ The old man answered by a forced smile, and was plainly struggling with a feeling of the keenest and most exquisite impatience.
1	"I will prove you," repeats mademoiselle in her former whisper.
1	When you wouldn’t give me nothing.
1	And it was such vapouring all about his ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had already made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him so.
1	'Your master's not at home; there's not a man in the house, and he'll kick that door down in ten minutes.'
1	Perhaps you’re mistaken, and never wrote any.’ ‘He hadn’t been gone from here, young lady,’ said Rachael, turning appealingly to Louisa, ‘as much as a week, when he sent me the only letter I have had from him, saying that he was forced to seek work in another name.’ ‘Oh, by George!’ cried Bounderby, shaking his head, with a whistle, ‘he changes his name, does he!
1	In my dread of the end of the vacation and their coming back, I could not read a boy’s name, without inquiring in what tone and with what emphasis HE would read, ‘Take care of him.
1	Both as to his dress and to himself, he was of an overlapping rhinoceros build, with folds in his cheeks, and his forehead, and his eyelids, and his lips, and his ears; but with bright, eager, childishly-inquiring, grey eyes, under his ragged eyebrows, and broad-brimmed hat.
1	If you had been more mindful of yourself, and less of me, when we grew up here together, I think my heedless fancy never would have wandered from you.
1	‘Perhaps you are right, uncle,’ replied Mrs. Kenwigs, submissively.
1	Not even to try to make some amends?’ ‘You are such a dreamer,’ said the boy, with his former petulance.
1	She could distribute, and did distribute pretty looks and smiles to every one among them.
1	Oliver retained his stool by the fire; Barney wrapped in a blanket, stretched himself on the floor:  close outside the fender.
1	At other times the old man would tell them stories of robberies he had committed in his younger days:  mixed up with so much that was droll and curious, that Oliver could not help laughing heartily, and showing that he was amused in spite of all his better feelings.
1	Of all men alive, this was one of the last he would have wished to meet at any time; but, now that he recognised in him only the patron and protector of Nicholas, he would rather have seen a spectre.
1	Then I am here as soon as you, you see.
1	I might have been too reserved, and should have patronized her more (though I did not use that precise word in my meditations) with my confidence.
1	“Now,” said Wemmick, “questioning being over,” which he emphasized and repeated for my guidance, “I come to what I did, after hearing what I heard.
1	Everything was bolted and barred that could by possibility furnish relief to an overworked people.
1	But you won’t mention it, will you?’ ‘Upon my word, my love,’ said Mrs Lammle, ‘you make me ten times more desirous, now I talk to you, to know you well than I was when I sat over yonder looking at you.
1	Great men are seldom over scrupulous in the arrangement of their attire; the operation of shaving, dressing, and coffee-imbibing was soon performed; and, in another hour, Mr. Pickwick, with his portmanteau in his hand, his telescope in his greatcoat pocket, and his note-book in his waistcoat, ready for the reception of any discoveries worthy of being noted down, had arrived at the coach-stand in St. Martin’s-le-Grand.
1	After some minutes, he returned, with his legs thoroughly stretched, if the hue of his nose and a short hiccup afforded any criterion; and at the same time there came out of the yard a rusty pony-chaise, and a cart, driven by two labouring men.
1	‘Berry’s very fond of you, ain’t she?’ Paul once asked Mrs Pipchin when they were sitting by the fire with the cat.
1	Monks drew the little packet from his breast, where he had hurriedly thrust it; and tying it to a leaden weight, which had formed a part of some pulley, and was lying on the floor, dropped it into the stream.
1	He was so far the creature of circumstances, that a dry day covered him with dust, and a misty day peppered him with little bits of soot, and a wet day brightened up his tarnished uniform for the moment, and a very hot day blistered him; but otherwise he was a callous, obdurate, conceited Midshipman, intent on his own discoveries, and caring as little for what went on about him, terrestrially, as Archimedes at the taking of Syracuse.
1	‘I sat there for upwards of two hours, during which time he tossed about, murmuring exclamations of pain or impatience, restlessly throwing his arms here and there, and turning constantly from side to side.
1	Even if we were as lax as we are, in all our arrangements, by choice--which we are not--even if we liked it, and found it agreeable to be so--which we don’t--I am persuaded we should have no right to go on in this way.
1	On such an afternoon, if ever, the Lord High Chancellor ought to be sitting here--as here he is--with a foggy glory round his head, softly fenced in with crimson cloth and curtains, addressed by a large advocate with great whiskers, a little voice, and an interminable brief, and outwardly directing his contemplation to the lantern in the roof, where he can see nothing but fog.
1	And driven into that nook, and wedged as he had described, was Gaffer’s boat; that boat with the stain still in it, bearing some resemblance to a muffled human form.
1	Caddy, while she was observant of her husband and was evidently founded upon him, had acquired a grace and self-possession of her own, which, united to her pretty face and figure, was uncommonly agreeable.
1	"I advise him, then, to do no more business in that quarter.
1	What would Mr. Bounderby say?’  At the mention of this name, his daughter stole a look at him, remarkable for its intense and searching character.
1	He replied, 'I am,' 'Very well,' said I, 'now let us be business-like.
1	He stopped at a door.
1	Among the mighty store of wonderful chains that are for ever forging, day and night, in the vast iron-works of time and circumstance, there was one chain forged in the moment of that small conclusion, riveted to the foundations of heaven and earth, and gifted with invincible force to hold and drag.
1	Nathaniel Pipkin had ocular demonstration of the fact, that the rumours of old Lobbs’s treasures were not exaggerated.
1	Mr Chuckster alone was left behind--greatly to his indignation; for he held the evidence he could have given, relative to Kit’s returning to work out the shilling, to be so very material as bearing upon his hypocritical and designing character, that he considered its suppression little better than a compromise of felony.
1	Very well, so am I shocked too; so we are both shocked, and there's an end of it!"
1	As a wife and mother!” Madame Defarge looked, coldly as ever, at the suppliant, and said, turning to her friend The Vengeance: “The wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were as little as this child, and much less, have not been greatly considered?
1	So I thought when Sir Leicester married, and so I always have thought since.
1	Some of the people were eating, and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs; for the crowded place was very hot.
1	Mrs Jiniwin being very fond of cards was carefully excluded by her son-in-law from any participation in the game, and had assigned to her the duty of occasionally replenishing the glasses from the case-bottle; Mr Quilp from that moment keeping one eye constantly upon her, lest she should by any means procure a taste of the same, and thereby tantalising the wretched old lady (who was as much attached to the case-bottle as the cards) in a double degree and most ingenious manner.
1	‘Of course you have come back hungry?’ ‘Why, then, I do consider myself rather so, master,’ was the answer.
1	Then they, all three, out for a charming ride, and for a charming stroll among heath in bloom, and there behold the identical Gruff and Glum with his wooden legs horizontally disposed before him, apparently sitting meditating on the vicissitudes of life!
1	A certain mysterious feeling, consequent on the darkness, the secrecy of the revel, and the whisper in which everything was said, steals over me again, and I listen to all they tell me with a vague feeling of solemnity and awe, which makes me glad that they are all so near, and frightens me (though I feign to laugh) when Traddles pretends to see a ghost in the corner.
1	So you gave notice that you were going?
1	Mr. Bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse-gate, and walked with portly carriage and commanding steps, up the High Street.
1	And now that five-and-fifty years were gone, she spoke of the dead man as if he had been her son or grandson, with a kind of pity for his youth, growing out of her own old age, and an exalting of his strength and manly beauty as compared with her own weakness and decay; and yet she spoke about him as her husband too, and thinking of herself in connexion with him, as she used to be and not as she was now, talked of their meeting in another world, as if he were dead but yesterday, and she, separated from her former self, were thinking of the happiness of that comely girl who seemed to have died with him.
1	“Yes, do, father,” says Minnie.
1	Don't look forward to variety, but you'll have excellence.
1	As I came to myself (with the aid of a heavy thump between the shoulders, and the restorative exclamation “Yah!
1	Reflects a certain ‘Mortimer’, another of Veneering’s oldest friends; who never was in the house before, and appears not to want to come again, who sits disconsolate on Mrs Veneering’s left, and who was inveigled by Lady Tippins (a friend of his boyhood) to come to these people’s and talk, and who won’t talk.
1	May God bless our endeavours!’ They were now standing at his house-door, and a cheerful sound of voices and laughter was heard within.
1	As the receding wave swept back with a hoarse roar, it seemed to scoop out deep caves in the beach, as if its purpose were to undermine the earth.
1	And yet in his pride and jealousy, he viewed with so much bitterness the thought of being dependent for the very first step towards the accomplishment of his soul’s desire, on a hired serving-woman who would be to the child, for the time, all that even his alliance could have made his own wife, that in every new rejection of a candidate he felt a secret pleasure.
1	‘You didn’t recommend her, you know,’ said Pancks; ‘how could you?
1	Nay, the very linkmen outside got hold of it, and compared the party to a funeral out of mourning, with none of the company remembered in the will.
1	Mr. Gradgrind was for ever working, in print and out of print, at this eccentric sum, and he never could make out how it yielded this unaccountable product.
1	As to your gentleman-friend, he may take himself off, wherever he likes best.
1	He would be a valuable acquisition with such an assistant as Nancy, and must (thus Fagin argued) be secured without delay.
1	"Jo," repeats Allan, looking at him with attention, "Jo!
1	'Of course they can,' replied Sikes.
1	The passive desolation of disuse was everywhere silently manifest about it.
1	The Doctor with his learned legs, and Mrs Blimber in a lilac bonnet, and Mr Feeder, B.A., with his long knuckles and his bristly head of hair, and Mr Feeder’s brother, the Reverend Alfred Feeder, M.A., who was to perform the ceremony, were all assembled in the drawing-room, and Cornelia with her orange-flowers and bridesmaids had just come down, and looked, as of old, a little squeezed in appearance, but very charming, when the door opened, and the weak-eyed young man, in a loud voice, made the following proclamation: Upon which there entered Mr Toots, grown extremely stout, and on his arm a lady very handsomely and becomingly dressed, with very bright black eyes.
1	He made a sudden exchange of the two instruments, and turning on the worm-eaten stool and table, beat them to pieces in a few blows.
1	Oh no, for that would be too much!
1	That she had all the abstracted and nervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous step, which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon, would have been obvious to the lynx-eyed Fagin, who would most probably have taken the alarm at once; but Mr. Sikes lacking the niceties of discrimination, and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour towards everybody; and being, furthermore, in an unusually amiable condition, as has been already observed; saw nothing unusual in her demeanor, and indeed, troubled himself so little about her, that, had her agitation been far more perceptible than it was, it would have been very unlikely to have awakened his suspicions.
1	‘A proud fool!’ said my aunt.
1	Mr. Folair’s head was usually decorated with a very round hat, unusually high in the crown, and curled up quite tight in the brims.
1	There you are with the Whole Duty of Man in a commercial country.’ When they had walked a little further in silence, Clennam said: ‘Have you no taste for anything, Mr Pancks?’ ‘What’s taste?’ drily retorted Pancks.
1	"Oh, no doubt," said Mr. Kenge.
1	‘No, not now, perhaps,’ said Mr Meagles; ‘not with that lady’s eyes so intent upon you, Tattycoram,’ she glanced at them for a moment, ‘and that power over you, which we see she exercises; not now, perhaps, but at another time.
1	You have a brother; you know it, and him.
1	Once more, Frank, by a rapid motion of his arm, unaccompanied by any noise, checked him in his purpose.
1	We don't pretend to do it."
1	‘He said I should object?’ asked Mr. Jorkins.
1	‘As I say, the end crowns the work.
1	So, he had been quite alone during the four days, and had spoken to no one, when, as he was leaving his work at night, a young man of a very light complexion accosted him in the street.
1	But for these animal observances, you might suppose the whole male portion of the company to be the melancholy ghosts of departed book-keepers, who had fallen dead at the desk: such is their weary air of business and calculation.
1	Oh, my aches and pains!
1	Give me back my wife, give me back my family, substitute Micawber for the petty wretch who walks about in the boots at present on my feet, and call upon me to swallow a sword tomorrow, and I’ll do it.
1	He had given an address in London, had this chap; but when it came to the point, of course nobody knowed anything about him.
1	‘The issue appears to have been provoked on the part of Vinyard, who     was determined at all hazards to defeat the appointment of Baker, and     who, himself defeated, turned his ire and revenge upon the     unfortunate Arndt.’                           ‘_The Wisconsin Tragedy_.
1	No dashing up, with all the fire and fury of the animal; no jumping down of the driver; no loud knocking at the door; no opening of the apron with a crash at the very last moment, for fear of the ladies sitting in a draught; and then the man handing the shawls out, afterwards, as if he were a private coachman!
1	And one lady observed, as a case bearing upon the present, that her husband was often quite light-headed from anxiety on similar occasions, and that once, when her little Johnny was born, it was nearly a week before he came to himself again, during the whole of which time he did nothing but cry ‘Is it a boy, is it a boy?’ in a manner which went to the hearts of all his hearers.
1	Wishing to see at my Lock up the river, the person as we’ve spoke of, and as you’ve answered for, I takes my leave of the lambs and of their learned governor both.’ With those words, he slouched out of the school, leaving the master to get through his weary work as he might, and leaving the whispering pupils to observe the master’s face until he fell into the fit which had been long impending.
1	All this while, Kate had sat as silently as she could, scarcely daring to raise her eyes, lest they should encounter the admiring gaze of Lord Frederick Verisopht, or, what was still more embarrassing, the bold looks of his friend Sir Mulberry.
1	‘There I must umbly beg leave to differ from you.
1	We made a pleasant journey down into Lincolnshire by the coach and had an entertaining companion in Mr. Skimpole.
1	Well; Richard took her home.
1	Mr Towlinson thinks not, and hints at a refuge in one of them genteel almshouses of the better kind.
1	The younger brother, or the single gentleman, for that designation is more familiar, would have drawn the poor schoolmaster from his lone retreat, and made him his companion and friend.
1	"Esther, my dearest," she said, breaking silence, "Richard is never so well and I am never so easy about him as when he is with Allan Woodcourt.
1	Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.
1	For business or pleasure, in summer-time or winter--I don’t care which--there’s nothing like it.
1	But, they had no ears for anything in their surprise.
1	For a lame man to have got upon his legs without any previous notice, and walked off, would have been most extraordinary; but when it came to his wheeling a heavy barrow before him, by way of amusement, it grew positively miraculous.
1	you don’t know, miss, of course you don’t know.
1	For some months past, Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had discharged the office of purveyors; the former carrying the money; the latter, the basket.
1	The time allotted to a lesson having fully elapsed, there was a general putting on of bonnets.
1	‘Pass the word, and there’s another ready for you,’ quoth the Captain.
1	But there is a way, my dear Paul, of showing your sense of Miss Tox’s friendliness in a still more flattering and acceptable manner, if you should be so inclined.’ ‘How is that?’ asked Mr Dombey.
1	Nothing less than a repetition of that infallible remedy will relieve his feelings.
1	Besides that all secret men are men soon terrified, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to justify the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over.
1	‘Have the goodness to reserve your anecdotes till they are called for.’ ‘Cert’nly, sir.’ Here Mr. Weller winked the eye which was not concealed by the beer-can he was raising to his lips, with such exquisite facetiousness, that the two boys went into spontaneous convulsions, and even the long man condescended to smile.
1	The room into which they entered was a vaulted chamber once nobly ornamented by cunning architects, and still retaining, in its beautiful groined roof and rich stone tracery, choice remnants of its ancient splendour.
1	'Well, well,' replied the Jew, with an attempt at pacification; 'and, if you have, it's your living!'
1	Unnatural the hand that had directed the sharp plough, which furrowed up her gentle nature for the sowing of its seeds!
1	Unworthy son, coward, liar,--you, who hold your councils with thieves and murderers in dark rooms at night,--you, whose plots and wiles have brought a violent death upon the head of one worth millions such as you,--you, who from your cradle were gall and bitterness to your own father's heart, and in whom all evil passions, vice, and profligacy, festered, till they found a vent in a hideous disease which had made your face an index even to your mind--you, Edward Leeford, do you still brave me!'
1	'Your late unfortunate husband should have taught it you; and then, perhaps, he might have been alive now.
1	At length he returned; and in reply to an anxious inquiry after his patient; looked very mysterious, and closed the door, carefully.
1	‘I am directed to request,’ he said, ‘that the new housekeeper--Mrs Pipchin, I think, is the name--’ Nothing escaped him.
1	I think of every little trifle between me and Dora, and feel the truth, that trifles make the sum of life.
1	"Well, Charley," said I, "it appears to me that you and I can do no better than go round to Jenny's and see what's the matter."
1	Once, he went aloft, and the rope broke, and they caught him shrieking; twice, he went aloft, and the rope broke, and they caught him shrieking; then, the rope was merciful, and held him, and his head was soon upon a pike, with grass enough in the mouth for all Saint Antoine to dance at the sight of.
1	Why, take yourself, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet.
1	That was not particularly well; for he remained in the greatest perplexity, and, as the hours went on, and no kind of explanation offered itself, his perplexity augmented at compound interest.
1	The quiet spot, outside, seemed to remain the same, saving that there was music in the air, and a sound of angels’ wings.
1	He’s heerd all about you from the sawbones in barnacles.’ ‘From my brother!’ said Arabella, having some faint recognition of Sam’s description.
1	Even Miss M. Melvilleson, in the revived Caledonian melody of "We're a-Nodding," points the sentiment that "the dogs love broo" (whatever the nature of that refreshment may be) with such archness and such a turn of the head towards next door that she is immediately understood to mean Mr. Smallweed loves to find money, and is nightly honoured with a double encore.
1	‘Two friends o’ mine, as works the Oxford Road, and is up to all kinds o’ games, has got the deputy- shepherd safe in tow, Sammy; and ven he does come to the Ebenezer Junction (vich he’s sure to do: for they’ll see him to the door, and shove him in, if necessary), he’ll be as far gone in rum-and-water, as ever he wos at the Markis o’ Granby, Dorkin’, and that’s not sayin’ a little neither.’ And with this, Mr. Weller once more laughed immoderately, and once more relapsed into a state of partial suffocation, in consequence.
1	And I never will leave him now, till I have seen him with her.’ ‘And when you have seen him with her?’ said Riderhood.
1	I should think it unlikely, as he has been in the habit of taking so much.
1	One man slowly moving on towards Chalons was the only visible figure in the landscape.
1	So, the Spider, doggedly watching Estella, outwatched many brighter insects, and would often uncoil himself and drop at the right nick of time.
1	The Inexhaustible being produced, staring, and evidently intending a weak and washy smile shortly, no sooner beheld her, than it was stricken spasmodic and inconsolable.
1	"If you will allow me to finish what I have to say at once so that I may have no occasion to resume," I went on, seeing him about to speak, "you will do me a kindness, sir.
1	A cat was tearing at the door, and there was a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth-stone.
1	His terrors affected the child.
1	He has been unfortunate in his affairs, and unfortunate in his pursuits, and unfortunate in his family; but he don't care--he's a child!"
1	Out of this room, you went down two steps into a charming little sitting-room looking down upon a flower-garden, which room was henceforth to belong to Ada and me.
1	From whence do these papers come, you say?
1	I may have been born to be a benefactor to you by sometimes giving you an opportunity of assisting me in my little perplexities.
1	The question then was, whether Florence could trust Mr Toots; and Florence saying, with a smile, ‘Oh, yes, with her whole heart!’ it became important to find out where Mr Toots lived.
1	If the gentlemen insist on it--’ ‘I don’t insist on it,’ said Sir Mulberry, with a loud laugh.
1	Kit was then put under examination and closely questioned by the unknown gentleman, touching his old master and the child, their lonely way of life, their retired habits, and strict seclusion.
1	I want a novelty.’ ‘I don’t know anything about it,’ rejoined Nicholas, whose breath had been almost taken away by this sudden proposal.
1	A deeper slumber followed this--and then--What!
1	Whether she held cheap attractions that could only call forth admiration that was worthless to her, or whether she designed to render them more precious to admirers by this usage of them, those to whom they were precious seldom paused to consider.
1	thinks the afflicted stationer, as recollection breaks upon him.
1	Good-night, Sir!’ The constitution of Mr. Pickwick, though able to sustain a very considerable amount of exertion and fatigue, was not proof against such a combination of attacks as he had undergone on the memorable night, recorded in the last chapter.
1	I found Uriah Heep among the company, in a suit of black, and in deep humility.
1	She had know’d of her bitter knowledge wheer to watch and what to do.
1	Why, in that very ride, if you’ll believe me, the day was named for my Minnie to marry Joram.
1	“I must be put somewheres, dear boy.” “To sleep?” said I.
1	His eyes were set very deep in his head, and were disagreeably sharp and suspicious.
1	He looked at me steadily as I entered, but made no sign of recognition whatever.
1	When he returns, go straight to him, and speak as boldly as you like.
1	‘I should like to see him,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	He had come to the swing doors leading into the street, and was waiting, not over patiently, for two people who were between him and them to pass out and let him follow, when the voice of one of them struck familiarly on his ear.
1	With no earthly friend to help her, or so much as to see her, but the one so strangely assorted; with no knowledge even of the common daily tone and habits of the common members of the free community who are not shut up in prisons; born and bred in a social condition, false even with a reference to the falsest condition outside the walls; drinking from infancy of a well whose waters had their own peculiar stain, their own unwholesome and unnatural taste; the Child of the Marshalsea began her womanly life.
1	After some poking about with this instrument, in the course of which his face assumed a variety of distracted expressions, Mr. Barkis poked it against a box, an end of which had been visible to me all the time.
1	But, Mortimer, while I lie here, and when I lie here no longer, I trust to you that the perpetrator is never brought to justice.’ ‘Eugene?’ ‘Her innocent reputation would be ruined, my friend.
1	You are good, accomplished, and beautiful as an angel.
1	The atmosphere was hot and sultry, the summer lightning quivered faintly on the verge of the horizon, and was the only sight that varied the dull gloom in which everything was wrapped--sound there was none, except the distant barking of some restless house-dog.
1	‘I have often talked to him about you, and he will be glad to tell you all he hears from me.
1	He once yearned so frightfully for that occupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved his pain so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for the perplexity of the brain, and by substituting, as he became more practised, the ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental torture; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his reach.
1	‘But I have known you people before to-day, you’ll observe, and I know you never die for want of talking.
1	You promised me this afternoon, Mr. Sawyer, and every gentleman as has ever lived here, has kept his word, Sir, as of course anybody as calls himself a gentleman does.’ Mrs. Raddle tossed her head, bit her lips, rubbed her hands harder, and looked at the wall more steadily than ever.
1	Then the stream of moonlight has swelled into a lake, and then Lady Dedlock for the first time moves, and rises, and comes forward to a table for a glass of water.
1	“See, then,” said Herbert; “think of this!
1	Sarah Pocket and Georgiana contended who should remain last; but Sarah was too knowing to be outdone, and ambled round Georgiana with that artful slipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence.
1	“All right, John; all right, my boy!” piped the old man from within.
1	New Haven, known also as the City of Elms, is a fine town.
1	There was very little daylight to be got there in the winter: no sun at the best of times: air was out of the question, and traffic was walled out.
1	Now, although the warder’s room was a very uncomfortable one (being, in every point of decoration and convenience, several hundred degrees inferior to the common infirmary of a county jail), it had at present the merit of being wholly deserted save by Mr. Pickwick himself.
1	There was one little weazen, dried-apple-faced old woman, who took occasion to doubt the constancy of husbands in such circumstances of bereavement; and there was another lady (with a lap-dog) old enough to moralize on the lightness of human affections, and yet not so old that she could help nursing the baby, now and then, or laughing with the rest, when the little woman called it by its father’s name, and asked it all manner of fantastic questions concerning him in the joy of her heart.
1	Thus encouraged, Oliver tapped at the study door.
1	These social qualities, which Miss Sally first discovered by accident, gradually made such an impression upon her, that she would entreat Mr Swiveller to relax as though she were not by, which Mr Swiveller, nothing loth, would readily consent to do.
1	Mr. Jinks, take his words down.’ The unfortunate Grummer proceeded to re-state his complaint, but, what between Mr. Jinks’s taking down his words, and the magistrate’s taking them up, his natural tendency to rambling, and his extreme confusion, he managed to get involved, in something under three minutes, in such a mass of entanglement and contradiction, that Mr. Nupkins at once declared he didn’t believe him.
1	If Mrs. Bardell were right, it was perfectly clear that Mr. Pickwick was wrong, and if they thought the evidence of Mrs. Cluppins worthy of credence they would believe it, and, if they didn’t, why, they wouldn’t.
1	The old man was by this time up and dressed.
1	Three sacks below are quite enough for Mr.
1	Do you attend the family?’ I asked.
1	Here,’ said Mr Swiveller raising his voice to a high pitch, and looking sleepily round, ‘is a miserable orphan!’ ‘Then,’ said somebody hard by, ‘let me be a father to you.’ Mr Swiveller swayed himself to and fro to preserve his balance, and, looking into a kind of haze which seemed to surround him, at last perceived two eyes dimly twinkling through the mist, which he observed after a short time were in the neighbourhood of a nose and mouth.
1	You ought to be brokenhearted.’ ‘So I should be, my dear, if I thought that I was going to lose you.’ ‘But you know you are not; don’t you, poor dear Pa?
1	“You know what I am, don't you?
1	The interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general attention, but even made my sister liberal.
1	But, as he heard his classes, he was always doing the deed and doing it better.
1	But I saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his hands, and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money was, that it had morally laid upon his back Trabb's boy.
1	never does anything but cry, and hold the baby), and a sad interview ensues.
1	Finally, after some high words and high spirit on the part of your sister, we came to the complete understanding that there was no danger; and your sister was so obliging as to allow me to present her with a mark or two of my appreciation at my dressmaker’s.’ Little Dorrit looked sorry, and glanced at Fanny with a troubled face.
1	What’s the matter?’ Mr Baptist, or Signor Cavalletto, understood English now almost as well as Mr Pancks himself, and could speak it very well too.
1	She told it all every word without a threat, without a murmur--she did--did she not?'
1	Pa will be a bankrupt before long, and then I hope Ma will be satisfied.
1	These lively remarks the fair Dedlock delivers in her youthful manner, while making a purse.
1	You understand all about it?
1	‘As we are quite confidential here, Mr. Copperfield,’ said Mrs. Micawber, sipping her punch, ‘Mr.
1	My room was at the top of the house, at the back: a close chamber; stencilled all over with an ornament which my young imagination represented as a blue muffin; and very scantily furnished.
1	We’ll go and fly it, you and I,’ said Mr. Dick.
1	As I expect he will.’ ‘I have never heard any noises here, worth speaking of.’ ‘Ah!
1	In case this should    be so, or in case you should entertain much thought of me    in what you are doing, I most earnestly entreat and beg    you to desist.
1	If I could have made myself go to sleep, I would have done it directly, but not being able to do that, I took out of my basket some ornamental work for our house (I mean Bleak House) that I was busy with at that time and sat down to it with great determination.
1	Each of us, in his own way, got more mad every moment.
1	These staircases received light from sundry windows placed at some little distance above the floor, and looking into a gravelled area bounded by a high brick wall, with iron _chevaux-de-frise_ at the top.
1	A crowd of little children were gathered round a bright fire, clinging to their mother’s gown, and gambolling around her chair.
1	He sent it below with his card, on the morning of the head-wind; and I was long troubled with the idea that he might be up, and well, and a hundred times a day expecting me to call upon him in the saloon.
1	I cannot conceive why everybody of his standing who visited at our house should always have put me through the same inflammatory process under similar circumstances.
1	Turning suddenly, he met a man, so close upon him that Eugene, surprised, stepped back, to avoid a collision.
1	He starved in the parlour, and I starved in the kitchen; that was the principal difference in our positions; there was not much more than a flight of breakneck stairs between us.
1	But I declined these offers; being already aware that there were plenty of such covert practitioners in existence, and considering the Commons quite bad enough, without my doing anything to make it worse.
1	It seemed worth putting down among the noblest sentiments enunciated by the best of men.
1	While he was thus engaged, a chariot drove to the door, and a portly gentleman in black, with a heavy watch-chain, alighted, and went in.
1	I was in a flutter of pride and anxiety; pride in my dear little betrothed, and anxiety that Agnes should like her.
1	‘Her port-wine, I believe?’ said Double, tasting it as if he were in the Docks, with hours to spare.
1	One thing was manifest to both of us, and that was, that until relief came, neither of us could relinquish the fire.
1	But you must be fatigued.
1	One or other.’ ‘One or other?
1	I submissively expressed, by my silence, my acquiescence in all I had heard from my superior in years and knowledge; and we talked about The Stranger and the Drama, and the pairs of horses, until we came to Mr. Spenlow’s gate.
1	‘Do you mean to tell me,’ he asked again, ‘that it is not so?
1	I saw him before I left London.’  His right hand was in his breast, seeking the ring; but he checked it, as he thought: ‘If I am to take it back, why should I tell her of it?’ ‘And that made you more serious about it, didn’t it, Eddy?
1	She was thinking further, that his far-seeing blue eyes looked as if they had been used to watch danger afar off, and to watch it without flinching, drawing nearer and nearer: when, happening to raise her own eyes, she found that he seemed to be thinking something about _them_.
1	When Little Dorrit had her work on the table, and Maggy hers on the bedstead, Fanny fell to tying her bonnet as a preliminary to her departure.
1	Whether you did not also pledge yourself to astonish the government, and make them shrink in their shoes?
1	That friend is Twemlow.’ ‘Certainly!’ from Podsnap.
1	It was the prime and vigour of the year; all things were glad and flourishing.
1	'Not a bit of it,' observed Charley.
1	The lawyer turns, leans his arms on the iron railing at the top of the steps, and looks at the lamplighter lighting the court-yard.
1	The young gentleman who was standing in an easy attitude on the hearth, cocking his glass at the company, with his back to the blaze and his coat tucked under his arms, something as if he were Of the Poultry species and were trussed for roasting, lost countenance at this reply; he seemed about to demand further explanation, when it was discovered--through all eyes turning on the speaker--that the lady with him, who was young and beautiful, had not heard what had passed through having fainted with her head upon his shoulder.
1	When he first emerges into the night air, nothing around him is still or steady; nothing around him shows like what it is; he only knows that he stands with a bare head in the midst of a blood-red whirl, waiting to be struggled with, and to struggle to the death.
1	Bull's-eye wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually endearing form of speech; and, giving vent to another admonitory growl for the benefit of Oliver, led the way onward.
1	If the brothers Cheeryble, as they found Nicholas worthy of trust and confidence, bestowed upon him every day some new and substantial mark of kindness, they were not less mindful of those who depended on him.
1	What do you think, Mr. Pickwick?’ ‘I think it is very probable,’ replied that gentleman.
1	‘Well, Mary Anne?’ ‘She is named Lizzie, ma’am.’ ‘She can hardly be named Lizzie, I think, Mary Anne,’ returned Miss Peecher, in a tunefully instructive voice.
1	I do not pretend to account for it to you, sir.
1	‘Your things is come,’ said Mr Chivery, ‘and my son is going to carry ‘em up.
1	‘No bodily inconvenience,’ replied the lady.
1	‘And because you have so much constancy and patience, Traddles.’ ‘Dear me!’ said Traddles, considering about it, ‘do I strike you in that way, Copperfield?
1	Separated from her staircase, all the week, by the length of iron road dividing Coketown from the country house, she yet maintained her cat-like observation of Louisa, through her husband, through her brother, through James Harthouse, through the outsides of letters and packets, through everything animate and inanimate that at any time went near the stairs.
1	Again, his neglected child, at this rough passage of his life, put forth by even this rebellious woman, as powerful where he was powerless, and everything where he was nothing!
1	You know how well you are doing here.’ ‘After all, she got me here,’ said the boy, with a struggle.
1	If you act as decidedly as you ought and they are still continued, and to your annoyance, I can speedily put a stop to them.
1	In the interval, old Joseph will be scarce.
1	Why should they?’ ‘Because they are improvident,’ said Mrs. Sparsit.
1	With this boy, properly managed, my dears, I could do what I couldn't with twenty of them.
1	She became so fantastically and pressingly earnest in her entreaties that we would walk up and see her apartment for an instant, and was so bent, in her harmless way, on leading me in, as part of the good omen she desired, that I (whatever the others might do) saw nothing for it but to comply.
1	Follow me, Sir!’ As Mr. Muzzle uttered these words, he took a step or two towards the door; and, by way of saving time, began to pull off his coat as he walked along.
1	See here!’ cried Lagnier, giving his head a twirl; ‘as tight on as your own.’ John Baptist, with a slight shiver, looked all round the room as if to recall where he was.
1	I beg to say, that when I use the word, gentleman, I use it in the sense in which the degree may be attained by any man.
1	‘It _is_ matter of wonder, though, that anyone of Mr. Nathaniel Pipkin’s retiring disposition, nervous temperament, and most particularly diminutive income, should from this day forth, have dared to aspire to the hand and heart of the only daughter of the fiery old Lobbs--of old Lobbs, the great saddler, who could have bought up the whole village at one stroke of his pen, and never felt the outlay--old Lobbs, who was well known to have heaps of money, invested in the bank at the nearest market town--who was reported to have countless and inexhaustible treasures hoarded up in the little iron safe with the big keyhole, over the chimney-piece in the back parlour--and who, it was well known, on festive occasions garnished his board with a real silver teapot, cream- ewer, and sugar-basin, which he was wont, in the pride of his heart, to boast should be his daughter’s property when she found a man to her mind.
1	Sissy, bring her here.’ She was brought, and stood with her hand in her sister’s.
1	Come!’ Receiving no answer to these taunts, he would mount in his wrath to the words ‘swindlers’ and ‘robbers’; and these being ineffectual too, would sometimes go to the extremity of crossing the street, and roaring up at the windows of the second floor, where he knew Mr. Micawber was.
1	Healthy cheerfulness and good spirits forming a part of the banquet, I could soak my crusts in the fountain with Le Sage’s strolling player, and revel in their glad enjoyment: but sitting down with so many fellow-animals to ward off thirst and hunger as a business; to empty, each creature, his Yahoo’s trough as quickly as he can, and then slink sullenly away; to have these social sacraments stripped of everything but the mere greedy satisfaction of the natural cravings; goes so against the grain with me, that I seriously believe the recollection of these funeral feasts will be a waking nightmare to me all my life.
1	A cold feeling crept over him, and he trembled violently as he turned away.
1	‘Pawnbroker’s shop--duplicates here--small sums--mere nothing--all rascals.’ ‘Oh,’ said Mr. Pickwick, much relieved by this explanation; ‘I understand you.
1	The reins were broken, but they had been dragging on the ground.
1	I have every reason to believe, Sir, that you are harbouring in your house a gross impostor!’ ‘Two,’ interrupted Sam.
1	But ony you tell the young lady wot the genlmn ses, and it's all right.
1	When the nights are very dark, the look-out stationed in the head of the boat, knows by the ripple of the water if any great impediment be near at hand, and rings a bell beside him, which is the signal for the engine to be stopped: but always in the night this bell has work to do, and after every ring, there comes a blow which renders it no easy matter to remain in bed.
1	‘Glad to see you back again, Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	‘Certain sure,’ replied Pell; ‘but if he’d gone to any irregular practitioner, mind you, I wouldn’t have answered for the consequences.’ ‘Ah!’ said the other, with open mouth.
1	At it they went, tooth and nail.
1	There seems a fitness in the arrangement.
1	Then the carriage, and the ride into the City; and the people who looked at them; and the hats that flew off grey heads; and the general bowing and crouching before this wonderful mortal the like of which prostration of spirit was not to be seen--no, by high Heaven, no!
1	However, having an infirmity--for I am hard of hearing, sir--” I expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment.
1	Mr. Guppy, refolding his arms, resettles himself against the parapet, as resuming a conversation of interest.
1	And now I'll tell you something.
1	I had many selfish thoughts at that time, many!"
1	Here was Fanny, proud, fitful, whimsical, further advanced in that disqualified state for going into society which had so much fretted her on the evening of the tortoise-shell knife, resolved always to want comfort, resolved not to be comforted, resolved to be deeply wronged, and resolved that nobody should have the audacity to think her so.
1	The punch being very nice, we sat there drinking it and talking, until it was almost nine o'clock.
1	The discounting line is his line principally, and he's what you may call a dealer in bills.
1	And then Prince took her arm in his and turned with great emotion and respect to his father, whose deportment at that moment was overwhelming.
1	The arrival of his breakfast roused him, and he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it: “I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any time to-day.
1	Can you think what it was?’ I believed I could.
1	A silent look of affection and regard when all other eyes are turned coldly away--the consciousness that we possess the sympathy and affection of one being when all others have deserted us--is a hold, a stay, a comfort, in the deepest affliction, which no wealth could purchase, or power bestow.
1	“I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die.” Now, that the streets were quiet, and the night wore on, the words were in the echoes of his feet, and were in the air.
1	As I could hardly hope for a more favourable opportunity of putting a question in which I had a near interest, I said to Mrs. Micawber: ‘May I ask, ma’am, what you and Mr. Micawber intend to do, now that Mr. Micawber is out of his difficulties, and at liberty?
1	There are not many to equal her!
1	Don’t ask me such a thing.’ Her tone was so very earnest that I raised my eyes in surprise.
1	Boast then, and revenge me on yourself.’ The foam was on his lips; the wet stood on his forehead.
1	He is to be pitied, I think!’ Having made these reflections, Mrs. Nickleby looked in her little dressing-glass, and walking backward a few steps from it, tried to remember who it was who used to say that when Nicholas was one-and-twenty he would have more the appearance of her brother than her son.
1	‘That’s the time,’ thought Mr. Pickwick, getting cautiously on his feet.
1	"You know yourself, George," says the elder brother, returning the grip of his hand, "and perhaps you know me better than I know myself.
1	When the families gathered in-doors there, for the night, it was only a foolish fancy to feel as if it were a little hard in them to close the shutter and blacken the flame.
1	He came one morning, and when he first came in, could only hold me in his embrace and say, "My dear, dear girl!"
1	Where's my bag of documents?
1	‘I am poorly qualified to judge of such matters,’ replied Agnes, with a modest hesitation, ‘but I certainly feel--in short, I feel that your being secret and clandestine, is not being like yourself.’ ‘Like myself, in the too high opinion you have of me, Agnes, I am afraid,’ said I.
1	Arthur succeeded in finishing his reply to Ralph’s note, nevertheless, and at length handed it over to the eccentric messenger for delivery.
1	As if with one accord, they all turned their eyes towards the light of the fire shining through the window.
1	The doll’s dressmaker had become a little quaint shrew; of the world, worldly; of the earth, earthy.
1	Mr. Snodgrass was the first to break the astonished silence.
1	‘Delighted,’ said Eugene--though he didn’t look so--‘to know Mr Boffin.’ ‘Thankee, sir, thankee,’ returned that gentleman.
1	'What a grateful little dear it is.
1	‘Nevy of a scientific Uncle!
1	I can give up nothing for you--I have nothing to resign, and no one to forsake; but all my love and life shall be devoted to you, and with my last breath I will breathe your name to God if I have sense and memory left.’ He caught her to his heart, and laid her cheek against his own, and now, no more repulsed, no more forlorn, she wept indeed, upon the breast of her dear lover.
1	For a gun is fired close by.
1	‘I wish I wos behind him vith a bradawl,’ muttered the long one.
1	You have no self-respect, you have no becoming pride, just as you allow yourself to be followed about by a contemptible little Chivery of a thing,’ with the scornfullest emphasis, ‘you would let your family be trodden on, and never turn.’ ‘Don’t say that, dear Fanny.
1	When the paper was at last destroyed--as I thought--in my presence, she had long been dead, and her patron, Frederick Dorrit, had long been deservedly ruined and imbecile.
1	‘Perhaps I don’t, but--’ ‘Perhaps you don’t?
1	Yes,’ said Riderhood, withdrawing his attention from the smoke.
1	You must have some physic.
1	Lauk, Mr. Bumble, only think of its being you!
1	All this was seen in a moment, as the vision of a drowning man, or of any human creature at any very great pass, could see a world if it were there.
1	Mother and I have done all we could to get the better of it, Clennam.
1	Of course you would not be asked to betray it; and of course you would not, if you were.
1	He had escaped when he was made half wild by me and my murderous intentions; and his punishment was light.
1	‘Are you a sailor, sir?’ he asked.
1	Numerous offences had been committed in the neighbourhood; the perpetrators remained undiscovered, and their boldness increased.
1	She looked full at me when I said this, and replied, “Go on.” “Whose child was Estella?” She shook her head.
1	"What are you going to do about him?"
1	‘No, no.’ ‘Do not try,’ replied Nicholas.
1	But you see I had been such a heedless, heartless creature, and had led you so to expect that I should marry for money, and so to make sure that I was incapable of marrying for love, that I thought you couldn’t believe me.
1	It was pretty much the same for the next two days, with a tolerably fair wind and dry weather.
1	‘If you please, Sir, I wish to speak to you,’ said Susan.
1	‘Now,’ said Jackson, ‘I’m afraid you’ll think me rather troublesome, but I want somebody else, if it ain’t inconvenient.
1	And he feels (though he doesn’t mention it) that I have reason to be.’ Mr. Grewgious had by this time grown so very mysterious, that Rosa did not know how to go on.
1	‘Beautiful madam,’ such were his words, ‘if I have made any mistake with regard to your family or connections, I humbly beseech you to pardon me.
1	Florence was not on that side of the carriage which was nearest to her home, and as the distance lessened between them and it, she looked out of her window for the children over the way.
1	If you are one of those who want us to consume it, I differ from you.
1	‘When my brother was such as he,’ said Ralph, ‘the first comparisons were drawn between us--always in my disfavour.
1	‘Mr Dombey, Sir,’ said Major Bagstock, ‘Joey’ B. is not in general a man of sentiment, for Joseph is tough.
1	‘I wonder whether Fogg’s disengaged now?’ said Jackson.
1	‘Now, if Mr. M’Choakumchild,’ said the gentleman, ‘will proceed to give his first lesson here, Mr. Gradgrind, I shall be happy, at your request, to observe his mode of procedure.’ Mr. Gradgrind was much obliged.
1	You speak of that annuity in pounds sterling, but it is in reality so many pounds of beefsteaks and so many pints of porter.
1	Florence loved him still, but, by degrees, had come to love him rather as some dear one who had been, or who might have been, than as the hard reality before her eyes.
1	But, when she told him that it was only a Fairy Tale she had one day made up for Maggy, and that there was nothing in it which she wouldn’t be ashamed to tell again to anybody else, even if she could remember it, he left the subject where it was.
1	‘Surely it must be the same man,’ thought Nicholas.
1	The deep remembrance of the sense I had, of being utterly without hope now; of the shame I felt in my position; of the misery it was to my young heart to believe that day by day what I had learned, and thought, and delighted in, and raised my fancy and my emulation up by, would pass away from me, little by little, never to be brought back any more; cannot be written.
1	I wish to make a fair bargain with you, that you shall enlighten me concerning the Dorrit family when you have it in your power, as I have enlightened you.
1	He had been there often, during a whole year, and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there.
1	‘Yes, but only for white children.’  Noble aristocracy in crime!
1	Oh, my heart is breaking when I think about it!
1	I see a prisoner we know coming this way, Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick, smiling.
1	Miss Abbey’s right; you be guided by Miss Abbey, Captain.’ Nor, was Miss Abbey’s vigilance in anywise abated by this submission, but rather sharpened; for, looking round on the deferential faces of her school, and descrying two other young persons in need of admonition, she thus bestowed it: ‘Tom Tootle, it’s time for a young fellow who’s going to be married next month, to be at home and asleep.
1	But, gradually his arm reverted home to him, and his glass was lowered and lowered until he rested it upside down upon the table.
1	I was not in this slight distress because I at all repined--I am quite certain I did not, that day--but, I thought, would she be wholly prepared?
1	It was scarcely breakfast-time yet, for Mrs. Crisparkle—mother, not wife of the Reverend Septimus—was only just down, and waiting for the urn.
1	So the guard of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter's Hill, as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet, and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols, deposited on a substratum of cutlass.
1	This was succeeded by Mrs. Leo Hunter’s recitation of her far-famed ‘Ode to an Expiring Frog,’ which was encored once, and would have been encored twice, if the major part of the guests, who thought it was high time to get something to eat, had not said that it was perfectly shameful to take advantage of Mrs. Hunter’s good nature.
1	‘Not at all, my dear,’ said Mr. Grewgious, infinitely gratified; ‘it is I who thank you for your charming confidence and for your charming company.
1	Oh, pray, pray, let me lie by my brother to-night, for I believe he’s fond of me!’ Richards took her without a word, and carrying her to the little bed in which the infant was sleeping, laid her down by his side.
1	It was only Mr. Woodcourt who could occasionally divert his attention for a few hours at a time and rouse him, even when he sunk into a lethargy of mind and body that alarmed us greatly, and the returns of which became more frequent as the months went on.
1	They were not immediately suggestive of her loss; for they were all girls: four little sisters.
1	So she is an angel, Captain.
1	Among them, is a stout gentleman in a brown hat, swinging himself to and fro in a rocking-chair on the pavement.
1	The word being, according to its Genoese emphasis, a confirmation, a contradiction, an assertion, a denial, a taunt, a compliment, a joke, and fifty other things, became in the present instance, with a significance beyond all power of written expression, our familiar English ‘I believe you!’ ‘Haha!
1	“It-can't-be,” muttered Sydney Carton, retrospectively, and idling his glass (which fortunately was a small one) again.
1	‘You must do so now, or do more harm to others than you can ever set right.’ ‘What harm?’ ‘Presently, presently.
1	‘My dear Eddy,’ said Rosa, when they had turned out of the High Street, and had got among the quiet walks in the neighbourhood of the Cathedral and the river: ‘I want to say something very serious to you.
1	‘Are so liable to be influenced by many considerations, which, almost without our knowing it, are unfair, that it is necessary to keep a guard upon them.
1	Again, more in gratitude than with any evidence of concern in her own behalf, she sat down in front of it, and unbinding the handkerchief about her head, and letting her thick wet hair fall down below her waist, sat drying it with the palms of her hands, and looking at the blaze.
1	In the large kitchen, where I dimly saw bacon and ropes of onions hanging from the beams, the watchers were clustered together, in various attitudes, about a table, purposely moved away from the great chimney, and brought near the door.
1	‘She ate apple-pie at a circus for upwards of fourteen years,’ said the manager; ‘fired pistols, and went to bed in a nightcap; and, in short, took the low comedy entirely.
1	and fixed her fine eyes on Africa again.
1	'And now,' says I 'as the worst thing I can do, caring nothing for myself, I'll drag you back.'
1	A beadle ordered to hold his tongue!
1	Oh wandering heart at rest!
1	The ant crept forth to her daily toil, the butterfly fluttered and basked in the warm rays of the sun; myriads of insects spread their transparent wings, and revelled in their brief but happy existence.
1	Joseph B. does not deny it, Dombey.
1	She never seems to repine, but has all the buoyancy and gaiety of childhood.
1	‘Happening to be this way early this morning--to tell you the truth, I was coming to breakfast with you.
1	He had provided himself, among other things, with a complete suit of oilskin, and a straw hat with a very low crown, pitched or caulked on the outside.
1	On our way home, I so conciliated Peepy's affections by buying him a windmill and two flour-sacks that he would suffer nobody else to take off his hat and gloves and would sit nowhere at dinner but at my side.
1	‘Hush, hush!’ cried the terrified Gride, catching him by the arm again.
1	If you hear of Lady Dedlock, brilliant, prosperous, and flattered, think of your wretched mother, conscience-stricken, underneath that mask!
1	I had fulfilled my destiny.
1	But what the agitation of a steam-vessel is, on a bad winter’s night in the wild Atlantic, it is impossible for the most vivid imagination to conceive.
1	When adopted?” Herbert shrugged his shoulders.
1	He murmurs, growing warm and red and holding the slip of paper now close to his eyes, now a long way off, "C.S.
1	There!’ said the old woman to Stephen, ‘you can make all the rest out for yourself now, a deal shorter than I can, I dare say!’ Once again, Stephen had to conquer an instinctive propensity to dislike this old woman, though her manner was as honest and simple as a manner possibly could be.
1	Mr. Peggotty went occasionally to a public-house called The Willing Mind.
1	I am best left alone now, and I do best to keep apart from you, of all else.
1	I must say now—even at the hazard of appearing to make a pretence, and of justly awakening your incredulity—yes.’ She made a slight movement, as if she were trying to speak, but could not find voice; at length she said, ‘Mr.
1	Or how do you mean to say it comes about?’ he demands impatiently.
1	It’s the fact of the Bank being robbed, that’s the important circumstance.
1	“Swine,” pursued Mr. Wopsle, in his deepest voice, and pointing his fork at my blushes, as if he were mentioning my Christian name,--“swine were the companions of the prodigal.
1	Naturally a retired and simple man, he had shown no particular sense of being ruined at the time when that calamity fell upon him, further than that he left off washing himself when the shock was announced, and never took to that luxury any more.
1	Christopher’s mother, my good soul, farewell.
1	On the evening of the very night when the object of her jealousy was strangled as I tell you, the young woman presented herself before Provis for one moment, and swore that she would destroy the child (which was in her possession), and he should never see it again; then she vanished.--There's the worst arm comfortably in the sling once more, and now there remains but the right hand, which is a far easier job.
1	My father’s former calling was umble.
1	Mr. Lorry sat at a table, among the gentlemen in wigs: not far from a wigged gentleman, the prisoner's counsel, who had a great bundle of papers before him: and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands in his pockets, whose whole attention, when Mr. Cruncher looked at him then or afterwards, seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the court.
1	"And you speak of his writing to YOU," said I, repeating his emphasis.
1	You wouldn’t wish to make unpleasantness.
1	She knows that I consider Miss Dombey the most beautiful, the most amiable, the most angelic of her sex.
1	I resolved to set this right beyond all doubt;--if such a barrier were between us, to break it down at once with a determined hand.
1	This fortune is destined to be yours, but you have a greater fortune in her, sir, than you would have in money were it forty times told.
1	The old girl's umbrella is of a flabby habit of waist and seems to be in need of stays--an appearance that is possibly referable to its having served through a series of years at home as a cupboard and on journeys as a carpet bag.
1	To some men it never comes; let them rest and be thankful!
1	“No malice to dread, sir,      And no falsehood to fear,      But truth to delight me, Mr Venus,      And I forgot what to cheer.
1	I should think it no disgrace to work, Heaven knows.
1	Then came the experienced chaplain of the jail, with more tabular statements, outdoing all the previous tabular statements, and showing that the same people _would_ resort to low haunts, hidden from the public eye, where they heard low singing and saw low dancing, and mayhap joined in it; and where A.
1	I had need to get some scrap of comfort out of all this business, for it's a bad one at the best, as I have no occasion to tell you."
1	Come home with me--it is but across the road--and take a little time to recover your peace and to make your eyes seemly, and then I will bear you company through the streets.
1	‘You pay him for his share in bringing about this sale of Madeline Bray.
1	I have taken the liberty of calling upon you, Mr Twemlow, to add a sort of postscript to what I said that day.’ Mr Twemlow’s dry and hollow cheeks become more dry and hollow at the prospect of some new complication.
1	There can be no harm in your going here to-night, and seeing for yourself that all is well with Tom, Jack, or Richard, before you go home,--which is another reason for your not going home last night.
1	Blessed, if they was a-callin’ me to the bar, they couldn’t make more noise about it!’ Accompanying these words with a gentle rap on the head of the young gentleman before noticed, who, unconscious of his close vicinity to the person in request, was screaming ‘Weller!’ with all his might, Sam hastened across the ground, and ran up the steps into the hall.
1	He had scarcely bestowed upon him his blessing, and followed it with a general remark touching the present state and prospects of the weather, when, lifting up his eyes, he beheld the single gentleman of Bevis Marks in earnest conversation with Christopher Nubbles.
1	Can I do anything to give you comfort?’ She raised her head at the sound of these kind words, and answered gladly, ‘O, Mr Riah, is it you?’ ‘My daughter,’ said the old man, ‘I stand amazed!
1	Ada would contrive to take him, somehow, he said.
1	She cried, with her clasped hands lifted above her head, that it would kill their father if he ever knew it; and fell down at Tip’s graceless feet.
1	Mrs Wickam was a waiter’s wife--which would seem equivalent to being any other man’s widow--whose application for an engagement in Mr Dombey’s service had been favourably considered, on account of the apparent impossibility of her having any followers, or anyone to follow; and who, from within a day or two of Paul’s sharp weaning, had been engaged as his nurse.
1	“You made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll.
1	As to the wictim of oppression in the suit o’ brimstone, all I can say of him, is, that I hope he’ll get jist as good a berth as he deserves; in vitch case it’s wery little cold swarry as ever he’ll be troubled with agin.’ Here Sam sat down with a pleasant smile, and his speech having been vociferously applauded, the company broke up.
1	I really don’t know what to say or think,’ replied Mr Abel.
1	‘Take care of Walter, I was fond of Walter!’ The dear remembrance of the plaintive voice that said so, rushed upon her soul, like music in the night.
1	But my mother, covetous always, sent to him in my name, told the true story of my case, and humbly prayed and petitioned for a small last gift--for not so many pounds as I have fingers on this hand.
1	I did intend to ask you to use any little opportunities you might have after I was gone, of improving dear Joe.
1	‘Don’t hurry, don’t hurry,’ said Sir Mulberry, as Kate hastened on, and attempted to release her arm.
1	he observes when he is in trim again.
1	‘She’s tired you see, Mrs Quilp,’ said the dwarf, squinting in a hideous manner to imply that his wife was to follow his lead.
1	But let him look for that slight figure when he wakes, and find it near him when the hour is come!
1	There was an agreeable little surprise in the way of certain love passages between the desponding captive and Miss Snevellicci, and the comic fighting-man and Miss Bravassa; besides which, Mr. Lenville had several very tragic scenes in the dark, while on throat-cutting expeditions, which were all baffled by the skill and bravery of the comic fighting-man (who overheard whatever was said all through the piece) and the intrepidity of Miss Snevellicci, who adopted tights, and therein repaired to the prison of her captive lover, with a small basket of refreshments and a dark lantern.
1	Most of the shops lighted two hours before their time--as the gas seems to know, for it has a haggard and unwilling look.
1	It seems to me, at this distance of time, as if my unfortunate studies generally took this course.
1	A disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them, and slowly and heavily the day lagged on with him.
1	"My dear friend," returns the old man, "I was applied--Judy, shake me up a little!--I was applied to yesterday about the captain, and my opinion still is that the captain is not dead."
1	It was at first difficult to lead him to speak about himself, and he put off Arthur’s advances in that direction by admitting slightly, oh yes, he had done this, and he had done that, and such a thing was of his making, and such another thing was his discovery, but it was his trade, you see, his trade; until, as he gradually became assured that his companion had a real interest in his account of himself, he frankly yielded to it.
1	‘Miss Amy,’ he then stammered, ‘I have had for a long time--ages they seem to me--Revolving ages--a heart-cherished wish to say something to you.
1	says the ironmaster, checking her in a low voice, though not angrily.
1	There may be black ingratitude in the thing, and the punishment may be retributive and well deserved; but that it is a miserable thing, I can testify.
1	But Precedent and Precipitate together frightened all objection out of most people.
1	I could not admit the thought, remembering what had passed between us, and the tone of voice in which he had called her by her name.
1	Lightwood, Boots, and Brewer, flutter like moths around that yellow wax candle--guttering down, and with some hint of a winding-sheet in it--Lady Tippins.
1	“It's not the question, my dear child, who paid for them,” returned Camilla.
1	‘You know what I am going to say.
1	‘You don’t say so!’ ejaculated Mr. Pickwick.
1	First, something tickles your right knee, and then the same sensation irritates your left.
1	‘If such things had been done when I was a young girl,’ said Mrs Wititterly (this, by the way, must have been some little time before), ‘I don’t suppose anybody would have believed it.’ ‘I don’t think they would,’ murmured Kate.
1	When Jasper is restored, he lays a tender hand upon his nephew’s shoulder, and, in a tone of voice less troubled than the purport of his words—indeed with something of raillery or banter in it—thus addresses him: ‘There is said to be a hidden skeleton in every house; but you thought there was none in mine, dear Ned.’ ‘Upon my life, Jack, I did think so.
1	Don’t be uneasy about me.
1	‘Am I not right, Kate?’ he said, after a short silence.
1	I have heard him on such occasions produce sounds of a nature similar to what may be sometimes heard in Dutch clocks.
1	Button my coat across at the chest, my love.
1	Now, when I saw Joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the kitchen in helpless amazement, I was overtaken by penitence; but only as regarded him,--not in the least as regarded the other two.
1	Is that, or something like it, the ring of the cant?
1	Bishop alone talked steadily and evenly.
1	Child of an unfortunate father, but--ha--always a gentleman.
1	And rising quietly, and glancing at them with a look that was a little alarmed but perfectly confiding, left the room.
1	‘Will you please to read it?’ ‘But first of all,’ said Miss Abbey, ‘--did you ever taste shrub, child?’ Miss Wren shook her head.
1	I should have committed murder--I know I should--if we'd caught one of them rascals.'
1	He had now done all he sought to do for the present, except that he wished to leave her with a reliance upon him, and to have something like a promise from her that she would cherish it.
1	He obtruded himself upon us in the first instance.
1	It’s the only truth going!’ This vicious assumption of honesty in dishonesty—a vice so dangerous, so deadly, and so common—seemed, he observed, a little to impress her in his favour.
1	And you quite a small party then, yourself.
1	Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark for ever.
1	"Rents ARE high about here.
1	If my character, and my now dropping you, help me out of that, Mr Headstone, the deliverance is to be attributed to me, and not to you.
1	From Belleville, we went on, through the same desolate kind of waste, and constantly attended, without the interval of a moment, by the same music; until, at three o’clock in the afternoon, we halted once more at a village called Lebanon to inflate the horses again, and give them some corn besides: of which they stood much in need.
1	Patriots, I speak the truth!” It was The Vengeance who, amidst the warm commendations of the audience, thus assisted the proceedings.
1	‘Does anybody down there know what has happened?’ demanded Miss Abbey, in her voice of authority.
1	‘I have gone on day after day,’ said Kate, bending over him, and timidly placing her little hand in his, ‘in the hope that this persecution would cease; I have gone on day after day, compelled to assume the appearance of cheerfulness, when I was most unhappy.
1	Your day is past, and night is comin’ on.’ ‘My curse, my bitter, deadly curse, upon you, boy!’ ‘Whence will curses come at your command?
1	He was not put into better humour either, by the reflection that he had taken it into his head, early in the evening, to think he had got an ache there, and so stopped at home.
1	‘What an extraordinary thing it is, Winkle,’ said Mr. Pickwick, rather pettishly, ‘that you couldn’t have taken your place before.’ ‘Not at all extraordinary,’ said Mr. Winkle.
1	He also follows with his eyes, the toss of Venus’s head: as if to seek a direction to over yonder.
1	There are offices about the Inns of Court in which a man might be cool, if any coolness were worth purchasing at such a price in dullness; but the little thoroughfares immediately outside those retirements seem to blaze.
1	They were garish in taste and colour, but were expensive articles of drawing-room furniture that had a very odd look beside the settles and the flaring gaslight pendent from the ceiling.
1	"I'm sure I'm surprised at that.
1	You took her for better for worse.’ ‘I mun’ be ridden o’ her.
1	It may have been a mistaken one, or you may have ceased to justify it.
1	I belong to the Bank; so, if you go straight up without me (I was sent to fetch you), you’ll save me a walk.’ Stephen, whose way had been in the contrary direction, turned about, and betook himself as in duty bound, to the red brick castle of the giant Bounderby.
1	‘Very much admired, indeed, the young woman was.
1	I can understand a man’s dying of a broken neck, or suffering from a broken arm, or a broken head, or a broken leg, or a broken nose; but a broken heart!--nonsense, it’s the cant of the day.
1	Florence left alone, soon hid her head upon her hands as she had often done in other days, and did not restrain the tears from coursing down her face.
1	That’s the vay to begin.
1	I said I owed him more obligations than I could ever repay, and held him in a higher admiration than I could ever express.
1	I thought it very curious to see her looking on serenely from her writing-table while Caddy and I discussed it, occasionally shaking her head at us with a half-reproachful smile like a superior spirit who could just bear with our trifling.
1	Aye, aye, mistress, it's you, is it?
1	‘Oh, he’s all right,’ said Tom.
1	If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quite gone out of her.
1	"I am glad to hear it, Sir Leicester; and if I may, by way of a last word, revert to what I said before of my mother's long connexion with the family and the worth it bespeaks on both sides, I would point out this little instance here on my arm who shows herself so affectionate and faithful in parting and in whom my mother, I dare say, has done something to awaken such feelings--though of course Lady Dedlock, by her heartfelt interest and her genial condescension, has done much more."
1	"I don't know what it is.
1	Walters and Miss Dombey are expected home!’ ‘My dear,’ said Mrs Toots, raising herself quickly from the sofa, very pale, ‘don’t try to deceive me, for it’s no use, they’re come home--I see it plainly in your face!’ ‘She’s a most extraordinary woman!’ exclaimed Mr Toots, in rapturous admiration.
1	‘Well, they won’t petition.’ ‘But if they did, they couldn’t get her out, I suppose?’ ‘Well, not the first time, perhaps, nor yet the second, but tiring and wearying for a few years might do it.’ ‘Does that ever do it?’ ‘Why yes, that’ll do it sometimes.
1	Stars were yet visible, but there was dull light in the east that was not the light of night.
1	‘Mr Doyce mentioned incidentally, in the course of our conversation, that he was going to take your valuable advice on the subject of finding such a partner.
1	He, Doctor Slammer, of the 97th, to be extinguished in a moment, by a man whom nobody had ever seen before, and whom nobody knew even now!
1	This important business of the evening had hardly commenced, when the door was thrown briskly open, and another gentleman in a light-blue suit, and leaden buttons, made his appearance.
1	Her quiet interest in everything that interested Dora; her manner of making acquaintance with Jip (who responded instantly); her pleasant way, when Dora was ashamed to come over to her usual seat by me; her modest grace and ease, eliciting a crowd of blushing little marks of confidence from Dora; seemed to make our circle quite complete.
1	What is your opinion of Bethnal Green?’ Mortimer assented to Bethnal Green, and they turned eastward.
1	"Oh, when I think of all these years, and of his fatherly care and kindness, and of the old relations among us, and of you, what shall I do, what shall I do!"
1	The philanthropist deranged the symmetry of the table, sat himself in the way of the waiting, blocked up the thoroughfare, and drove Mr. Tope (who assisted the parlour-maid) to the verge of distraction by passing plates and dishes on, over his own head.
1	The mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing.
1	I sat next to her.
1	three times without making an impression.
1	This conjunction of circumstances led to his immediately afterwards presenting himself before the young ladies in a posture, which in ancient times would not have been considered one of favourable augury for his suit; since the gondoliers of the young ladies, having been put to some inconvenience by the chase, so neatly brought their own boat in the gentlest collision with the bark of Mr Sparkler, as to tip that gentleman over like a larger species of ninepin, and cause him to exhibit the soles of his shoes to the object of his dearest wishes: while the nobler portions of his anatomy struggled at the bottom of his boat in the arms of one of his men.
1	Now is the time for shadow, when every corner is a cavern and every downward step a pit, when the stained glass is reflected in pale and faded hues upon the floors, when anything and everything can be made of the heavy staircase beams excepting their own proper shapes, when the armour has dull lights upon it not easily to be distinguished from stealthy movement, and when barred helmets are frightfully suggestive of heads inside.
1	Mrs. Chadband merely laughs and contemptuously tells him he can "offer" twenty pence.
1	Last evening he does this.
1	I have expected you some time.’ ‘It is my misfortune,’ he replied, ‘to be here, wholly against my will, for such a purpose.
1	‘--Hear me out!’ cried Wegg.
1	Now, as to the management of your capital while you are away, and as to the conversion of so much of it as the business may need from time to time--’ His partner stopped him.
1	You had better tell us at once, that that fellow Slackbridge is not in the town, stirring up the people to mutiny; and that he is not a regular qualified leader of the people: that is, a most confounded scoundrel.
1	I ask you, what is that light?"
1	This being a very long word for Mr Sparkler, and his mind being exhausted by his late effort, he replied, ‘No, thank you.
1	He now sat looking at the fire, and bit his lip.
1	‘Well!’ he replied, shaking the snow out of his long hair, ‘I was a-going to turn in somewheers.’ In those days there was a side-entrance to the stable-yard of the Golden Cross, the inn so memorable to me in connexion with his misfortune, nearly opposite to where we stood.
1	‘How do you do, Sir?’ ‘Why, reasonably conwalessent,’ replied Sam.
1	Mr Rokesmith, it is to me you owe this perverted account of what passed between us that night.
1	He had all his life been restless and locomotive, with an irresistible desire for change; and was still the son of his old self: for if he had nothing to keep him at home, he said (slightly jerking his hat and his thumb towards the window of the room in which the old lady sat, as we stood talking in front of the house), he would clean up his musket, and be off to Texas to-morrow morning.
1	He gave us a searching look as we entered, but his manner was both courtly and kind.
1	Hang him,’ cried Brass, as the chant began again.
1	‘Where is it?’ ‘No good can come of your knowing,’ replied Ralph.
1	We are a great country, Mr. Jarndyce, we are a very great country.
1	Lorry, look again upon the prisoner.
1	I don’t know how long I may live, or how soon I may die; but I know that if I was capsized, any night, in a gale of wind in Yarmouth Roads here, and was to see the town-lights shining for the last time over the rollers as I couldn’t make no head against, I could go down quieter for thinking “There’s a man ashore there, iron-true to my little Em’ly, God bless her, and no wrong can touch my Em’ly while so be as that man lives.”’ Mr. Peggotty, in simple earnestness, waved his right arm, as if he were waving it at the town-lights for the last time, and then, exchanging a nod with Ham, whose eye he caught, proceeded as before.
1	She may be an hour, she may be more.
1	This dignitary, conferring in secrecy with John Rokesmith on the subject of punch and wines, bent his head as though stooping to the Papistical practice of receiving auricular confession.
1	Have you taken Kit into custody before he had time and opportunity to beat me!
1	A vast deal of coolness, and a peculiar degree of judgment, are requisite in catching a hat.
1	I’ll make Jip bark at you all day.
1	He has caused himself to be provided with a key and can pass in at his pleasure.
1	As Johnny murmured something in his placid admiration, the ministering women at his bed’s head asked him what he said.
1	Oliver, shut that door at Mister Noah's back, and take them bits that I've put out on the cover of the bread-pan.
1	To these remonstrances, the single gentleman answered not a word, but when the trunk was at last got into the bed-room, sat down upon it and wiped his bald head and face with his handkerchief.
1	_No_ doubt, I am sure.
1	Will you hear me say one word, in explanation of this mischance?’ But Nicholas might as well have spoken to the wind, for the young lady, with distracted looks, hurried up the stairs.
1	"He has died," says the surgeon, "of an over-dose of opium, there is no doubt.
1	Or at least’--for I saw a faint blush in her face, ‘you would have let me find it out for myself.
1	He was a great politician of course, and explained his opinions at some length to one of our company; but I only remember that he concluded with two sentiments, one of which was, Somebody for ever; and the other, Blast everybody else!
1	Her hands were then nervously clasping together, but he took one of them.
1	‘Marchioness, take a seat on the bed, will you?
1	Hot springs and fiery eruptions, the usual attendants upon earthquakes, lent their contributions of confusion to the scene.
1	Biddy's first triumph in her new office, was to solve a difficulty that had completely vanquished me.
1	Because we are so very umble.’ ‘Have you been studying much law lately?’ I asked, to change the subject.
1	Such roads I had never seen.
1	It seemed to penetrate into the very bones of the shrinking wayfarers, and to rack them with cold and pains.
1	Two mutton-chops, three potatoes, some split peas, a little flour, two ounces of butter, a pinch of salt, and all this black pepper.
1	‘A gentleman who was so good as to bring Nell home the other night when she lost her way, coming from your house.’ The little man turned to the child as if to chide her or express his wonder, but as she was talking to the young man, held his peace, and bent his head to listen.
1	She described to us how tenderly he had taken leave of her, and how manfully and quietly he had borne himself.
1	Prince's health is not strong, and I want to be able to assist him.
1	good Heaven, Mr Brass!’ cried Kit, trembling from head to foot; ‘you don’t suppose--’ ‘No, no,’ rejoined Brass quickly, ‘I don’t suppose anything.
1	I doen’t know, being a lady’s, but what it’s worse.’ She changed now, in a moment.
1	The walks shrunk into stripes again at the sound, and raising himself a little in the bed, and holding the curtain open with one hand, he looked out.
1	To this he submitted with the best grace possible, staring at me during the whole operation as if he never had been, and never could again be, so astonished in his life--looking very miserable also, certainly, but making no complaint, and going snugly to sleep as soon as it was over.
1	‘Yes, he is,’ was the reply, ‘but he’s very busy.
1	If they discern no such thing, they will consider me altogether mistaken.
1	‘At the same time, Christopher,’ added Mr Garland, glancing at the note in his hand, ‘if the gentleman should want to borrow you now and then for an hour or so, or even a day or so, at a time, we must consent to lend you, and you must consent to be lent.--Oh!
1	asked Noah, setting down his cup, and looking his employer, eagerly, in the face.
1	Having seen him sound asleep, and heard him snore most satisfactorily, and having further presided over the distribution of the toys, to the perfect contentment of all the little Kenwigses, Nicholas took his leave.
1	He says this, not unfeelingly, while sitting on the bedstead's edge with his face towards that other face and his hand upon the region of the heart.
1	"And reminding you that she and her sister had differed, had gone their several ways?"
1	a horrible, horrible sight!’ ‘Who did you think it might have been?’ asked Mr Inspector.
1	There was no resource but to knock at the door.
1	But, finding me well employed, and bearing a good character, and hearing on all hands that I rose fast in the school, she soon discontinued these visits.
1	Because I am well aware of my deficiencies.
1	But, the Evremonde people are to be exterminated, and the wife and child must follow the husband and father.” “She has a fine head for it,” croaked Jacques Three.
1	‘Bitherstone is new to Mr Toots.’ New to Florence, too, almost; for, in the schoolroom, Bitherstone--no longer Master Bitherstone of Mrs Pipchin’s--shows in collars and a neckcloth, and wears a watch.
1	It is a foolish mercy.
1	The soldiers' swords are sharpened there,” said Mr. Lorry.
1	Mr Swiveller replied that he had very recently been assuaging the pangs of thirst, but that he was still open to ‘a modest quencher,’ if the materials were at hand.
1	It always appears to me (if this should prove to be a baseless assumption, I shall be pardoned), that Mr Dorrit has been accustomed to exercise influence over the minds of others.’ ‘Hum--madam,’ said Mr Dorrit, ‘I have been at the head of--ha of a considerable community.
1	But, the bitterness of her grief was not in beholding him in this condition, when he was at least content and tranquil, nor in her solitary meditations on his altered state, though these were trials for a young heart.
1	A clean room, a hot dish for dinner, and a bottle of not absolutely poisonous wine, are all I want tonight.
1	Nickleby, sir,’ said brother Ned, ‘the matter upon which my brother Charles called upon you this morning is one which is already perfectly well known to us three, and to others besides, and must unhappily soon become known to a great many more.
1	She had not failed to recollect, either, how much more agreeable she could render his situation if she were his friend, and how much more disagreeable if she were his enemy; and, doubtless, many less scrupulous young gentlemen than Nicholas would have encouraged her extravagance had it been only for this very obvious and intelligible reason.
1	In this house, and with this family, I passed my leisure time.
1	I can say to you of the healthful music of my pulse what Hamlet said of his.
1	I said, 'Can you, at your time of life, be so headstrong, my friend, as to persist that an arm-chair is a thing to put upon a shelf and look at?
1	These did occasionally wink a little, as the hot air barely moved their faint leaves.
1	‘Heaven forbid, Copperfield,’ he replied, ‘that I should do any man an injustice: still less, Mr. Jorkins.
1	After a trifling delay, Mrs Dombey’s maid appeared, and conducted him to a morning room upstairs, where Edith and Florence were together.
1	There was a fine, massive gravity in his face, I did not venture to disturb.
1	Mr. Peggotty was well, and Ham was well, and Mrs. Gummidge was but poorly, and little Em’ly wouldn’t send her love, but said that Peggotty might send it, if she liked.
1	The blindness of my confidence is past, Lucretia.
1	Rosa Dartle’s keen glance comprehended all of us.
1	‘No, Mr Richard, sir,’ rejoined Brass with emotion, ‘I will not take it up.
1	‘Shaving-water, Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick, from within the curtains.
1	We stood in the Inn Yard while she pointed out her luggage to me, and when it was all collected I remembered--having forgotten everything but herself in the meanwhile--that I knew nothing of her destination.
1	For, as I says to Biddy when the news of your being ill were brought by letter, which it were brought by the post, and being formerly single he is now married though underpaid for a deal of walking and shoe-leather, but wealth were not a object on his part, and marriage were the great wish of his hart--” “It is so delightful to hear you, Joe!
1	He won’t; not that he’s afraid--, oh, no!
1	‘A bird flying to the hedge,’ was all he thought about it; and came back, and resumed his walk.
1	Kit found it, at last, after some trouble, and pausing at the door to take breath that he might enter with becoming decency, passed into the chapel.
1	The text of his order (altered from the original by only a pronoun, which is not much) ran: “The earth and the fulness thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur.” Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into his affairs, both private and public; and he had, as to both classes of affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General.
1	Be quiet, will you!’ ‘Then write large, Rob,’ she returned, repeating her secret signal; ‘for my eyes are not good, even at print.’ Muttering to himself, and returning to his work with an ill will, Rob went on with the word.
1	I can acquit my conscience therefore, almost equally, by confidence, on such a theme, in you or him.
1	It set him thinking of her as he had first seen her, when she had believed herself to be alone among the trees.
1	“That’s it!”  says the doctor.
1	‘To Mr Dombey,’ says the old man.
1	‘There’s plenty of time,’ rejoined the dwarf, ‘and it shall be done.
1	‘Oh dear me, dear me!’ sighs Mr Venus, heavily, snuffing the candle, ‘the world that appeared so flowery has ceased to blow!
1	From this time you begin your history.
1	But this is the custom: for if the law were to bind down a free and independent citizen to keep his word with the public, what would become of the liberty of the subject?
1	Sikes made no reply; but, pulling open the door, of which Fagin had turned the lock, dashed into the silent streets.
1	The robbery, partly owing to the inquisitiveness of the neighbours, and partly to his own grief and rage, had, long ago, become known; but he positively refused to give his sanction or yield any assistance to the old woman’s capture, and was seized with such a panic at the idea of being called upon to give evidence against her, that he shut himself up close in his house, and refused to hold communication with anybody.
1	I recollect saying with my own lips that I was much too umble.
1	‘Dear Mr Clennam, I must say something to you before I go.
1	'It would be hard to tell.
1	“You are a man of business and bound to have a reason.
1	‘She will be at Coketown long before him,’ thought Mrs. Sparsit, ‘though his horse is never so good.
1	I find, running through the performances of this child,’ said Mr. Curdle, turning to the phenomenon, ‘a unity of feeling, a breadth, a light and shade, a warmth of colouring, a tone, a harmony, a glow, an artistical development of original conceptions, which I look for, in vain, among older performers--I don’t know whether I make myself understood?’ ‘Perfectly,’ replied Nicholas.
1	A woman’s anger is pretty much the same here, as in your fine house.
1	Anywhere beyond his reach, was no reply to the question.
1	‘Just so,’ returned Mrs. Micawber.
1	‘I hope good may be coming of it in the future time.
1	‘Then,’ said Mrs. Micawber, who prided herself on taking a clear view of things, and keeping Mr. Micawber straight by her woman’s wisdom, when he might otherwise go a little crooked, ‘then I ask myself this question.
1	Not a thread changes, in the house of the two little bird-like ladies.
1	‘What’s the row, Sam?’ inquired one gentleman in black calico sleeves.
1	Mr Carker,’ said the Captain, in the goodness of his nature, ‘when I was here last, we was very pleasant together.
1	What’s the meaning of it?’ The Major decided, after some consideration, that it meant mantraps; that it meant plotting and snaring; that Miss Tox was digging pitfalls.
1	I took leave of Mr. Peggotty, and Ham, and Mrs. Gummidge, and little Em’ly, that day; and passed the night at Peggotty’s, in a little room in the roof (with the Crocodile Book on a shelf by the bed’s head) which was to be always mine, Peggotty said, and should always be kept for me in exactly the same state.
1	They can scarcely be represented as having lumbered it, so conscientious and precise was their orderly arrangement.
1	Come?” “No, Joe, there was nothing at all of the kind.” As I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Joe, Joe contemplated me in dismay.
1	This, however, was a speciality on that particular birthday, and not a general solemnity.
1	‘What is it but a grave!’ said the sexton.
1	The meeting did not take place without great emotion on both sides.
1	This might lead to his apprehension as he passed along the streets.
1	‘You’re about right there,’ said Mr. Crummles; ‘and if you had said she would look very well upon the stage too, you wouldn’t have been far out.
1	I was not mad at that time," curtsying low and smiling between every little sentence.
1	These gradually fell into their proper places, and by degrees suggested more:  so that in a little time he had the whole, almost as it was delivered.
1	Wishing to be fully re-established in my strength and my good spirits before Ada came, I now laid down a little series of plans with Charley for being in the fresh air all day long.
1	Heaping them back into the drawers, and locking them up in a rage of haste, he saw some papers on the table.
1	My old dear bedroom was changed, and I was to lie a long way off.
1	; and the astonishment of Nicholas was in no degree lessened, when he found it to be couched in the following laconic terms:-- “Mr.
1	Greatly relieved to find that he was not too late, Kit leant against a lamp-post to take breath, and waited the advent of the pony and his charge.
1	Are any on ‘em to be doubled up?’ When the Chicken put this question he dropped his hat, made a dodge and a feint with his left hand, hit a supposed enemy a violent blow with his right, shook his head smartly, and recovered himself.
1	There was not a bird of such methodical and business-like habits in all the world, as the blind blackbird, who dreamed and dozed away his days in a large snug cage, and had lost his voice, from old age, years before Tim first bought him.
1	Under which circumstances she has answered Our John, “No, John, I cannot have you, I cannot have any husband, it is not my intentions ever to become a wife, it is my intentions to be always a sacrifice, farewell, find another worthy of you, and forget me!” This is the way in which she is doomed to be a constant slave to them that are not worthy that a constant slave she unto them should be.
1	But I can’t consent, and I won’t consent, and I never did consent, and I never will consent to be lost in you.
1	The schoolmaster took a seat beside him, and stooping over the pillow, whispered his name.
1	Tozer replied that he thought not also, judging from Paul’s looks, and that it was a pity, for it need be.
1	But as this step involved the relinquishment of his apartments at Mrs MacStinger’s, and he knew that resolute woman would never hear of his deserting them, the Captain took the desperate determination of running away.
1	But he’s a perfect Patriarch; and it would do a man good to serve him on such terms--on any terms.’ Arthur for his life could not have said with confidence whether Pancks really thought so or not.
1	And Herbert had seen him as a predatory Tartar of comic propensities, with a face like a red brick, and an outrageous hat all over bells.
1	Better try Mr Clive, second door on the left in the next passage.’ ‘Perhaps he will give me the same answer.’ ‘Very likely.
1	Is she dozing, old lady?'
1	I never hear the name, or read the name, of Yarmouth, but I am reminded of a certain Sunday morning on the beach, the bells ringing for church, little Em’ly leaning on my shoulder, Ham lazily dropping stones into the water, and the sun, away at sea, just breaking through the heavy mist, and showing us the ships, like their own shadows.
1	And we fell back on the guitar-case, and the flower-painting, and the songs about never leaving off dancing, Ta ra la!
1	Pay five shillings fine for you indeed.
1	‘Did you ever see such a thing as this?’ said Ferdinand to Bar when he had been baffled twenty times.
1	I’ll right thee one day, child, I’ll right thee, never fear!’ She took from her pocket a little purse.
1	At this crisis Alice interposed her voice, but not in the Grinder’s favour, by saying, ‘Well done, mother.
1	We shall soon know now.
1	‘So she does,’ assented Mr. Lumbey.
1	At last the ringing of horses’ bells greeted his anxious ears.
1	It is quite fitting.’ ‘Ma,’ Bella struck in, ‘Mr and Mrs Boffin are prosperous, no doubt; but you have no right to say they are proud.
1	‘This ring was given to the young lady who was drowned so early in her beautiful and happy career, by her husband, when they first plighted their faith to one another.
1	“But for your face I should think you were a little despondent,” said I.
1	More than that; I'm going to ask you to take a walk with me.” I was about to excuse myself, as being but a bad companion just then, when Wemmick anticipated me.
1	Looking at her he saw her, with a face quite strange to him, shrinking back against the wall, with her hands before her eyes.
1	With my husband standing by!
1	"Why, cousin John," said Ada, clasping her hands upon his arm and shaking her head at me across him--for I wanted her to be quiet--"Esther was their friend directly.
1	"You look pale," said Caddy when we came out, "and cold!"
1	He has been took a little poorly.’ ‘Say “taken,” Tope—to the Dean,’ the younger rook interposes in a low tone with this touch of correction, as who should say: ‘You may offer bad grammar to the laity, or the humbler clergy, not to the Dean.’ Mr. Tope, Chief Verger and Showman, and accustomed to be high with excursion parties, declines with a silent loftiness to perceive that any suggestion has been tendered to him.
1	‘Lord bless you, no!’ ‘Not just yet?’ said my mother, tenderly.
1	I’m thinking of taking to it again, next summer, though.’ The child wondered how a grey-headed man like him--one of his trade too--could talk of time so easily.
1	But, you must not think,’ and here she laid her light hand on his shoulder, and looked into his face, ‘that I regret to be this burden on you.
1	Within there, where the light was, was the man who as to both distances could give him up to ruin.
1	And as the lady’s humour was considered to lie chiefly in retort, Mr. Squeers laughed heartily, and seemed to expect that Nicholas should do the same.
1	‘Bottle of wine to the gentleman on the box.
1	He was not among the bobbing umbrellas, and he certainly was not the newspaper boy in the oilskin cap who was slowly working his way along the piece of brass outside, writing his name over Mr Gills’s name with his forefinger.
1	Oliver and Sikes got in without any further ceremony; and the man to whom he belonged, having lingered for a minute or two 'to bear him up,' and to defy the hostler and the world to produce his equal, mounted also.
1	Do you hear me when I tell you that, my darling?
1	The jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge knew and named them every one.
1	And he was so good-natured throughout, and in such high spirits, and so fond of Ada, that it was very difficult indeed to be otherwise than pleased with him.
1	‘Is it my fault?’ ‘All I know is,’ said Miss Sally, smiling drily, for she delighted in nothing so much as irritating her brother, ‘that if every one of your clients is to force us to keep a clerk, whether we want to or not, you had better leave off business, strike yourself off the roll, and get taken in execution, as soon as you can.’ ‘Have we got any other client like him?’ said Brass.
1	I do not deny that he has kept me in the dark as to his resources and his liabilities both,’ she went on, looking at the wall; ‘but I never will desert Mr. Micawber!’ Mrs. Micawber having now raised her voice into a perfect scream, I was so frightened that I ran off to the club-room, and disturbed Mr. Micawber in the act of presiding at a long table, and leading the chorus of      Gee up, Dobbin,      Gee ho, Dobbin,      Gee up, Dobbin,      Gee up, and gee ho--o--o!
1	Being quite alone, I cried a little again, though on the whole I don't think I behaved so very, very ill.
1	"Hallowed be--thy--" The light is come upon the dark benighted way.
1	He seemed to be losing time unless he was moving.
1	Why can’t they do as I have done, ma’am?
1	‘Thomas Groffin.’ ‘Here,’ said the chemist.
1	‘Wot job?’ said the long-legged young man.
1	You may kiss me, if you like.” I kissed her cheek as she turned it to me.
1	He wouldn’t let me touch him, when I tried; and then she beat him.
1	You’re right, Mary, my dear.’ Having satisfied himself on this point, Sam read the letter all over, once more, and, appearing to form a clear notion of its contents for the first time, ejaculated thoughtfully, as he folded it up-- ‘And so the poor creetur’s dead!
1	Many of them are not early risers at the brightest of times, being birds of night who roost when the sun is high and are wide awake and keen for prey when the stars shine out.
1	A pitiful and plaintive look, with which she had begun to regard him when she was still extremely young, was perhaps a part of this discovery.
1	I’m a-going to seek her at the post-mark.’ He showed it to me.
1	Upon this, the women calls a meetin’, sings a hymn, wotes your mother-in-law into the chair, wolunteers a collection next Sunday, and hands it all over to the shepherd.
1	And what did the doctor call it?
1	‘Perhaps that might escape the notice of the girls, even if they did see me,’ remarks Edwin, looking down at his boots with a sudden distaste for them.
1	Says, "Bless my soul, sir!
1	This can he charged to nobody.
1	Her forehead was painfully anxious and intent as she gave this evidence, and, in the pauses when she stopped for the Judge to write it down, watched its effect upon the counsel for and against.
1	It cost me five-and-twenty shillings.
1	The disease took the singular form, on those occasions, of causing the infected to find an unfathomable excuse and consolation in allusions to the magic name.
1	‘And so, neighbour,’ he added, ‘I’ll turn my face homewards, leaving my love for Nelly and hoping she may never lose her way again, though her doing so HAS procured me an honour I didn’t expect.’ With that he bowed and leered at me, and with a keen glance around which seemed to comprehend every object within his range of vision, however, small or trivial, went his way.
1	Madame had no maid!’ ‘I came here alone,’ said Edith ‘It was my choice to do so.
1	My guardian's old hopes of her and Richard arose sorrowfully in my mind, and I said to myself, "She has been anxious about him," and I wondered how that love would end.
1	I saw his bed rolled up in a corner; and what plates and dishes and pots he had, on a shelf; and I divined (God knows how) that though the two girls with the shock heads of hair were Captain Hopkins’s children, the dirty lady was not married to Captain Hopkins.
1	Where are you going?’ was the next compassionate chorus she heard.
1	‘Thank you, but I don’t want you.’ Some small voice, near his ear, would ask him how he was, perhaps.
1	‘I hope so,’ returned Madame Mantalini; ‘our hours are from nine to nine, with extra work when we’re very full of business, for which I allow payment as overtime.’ Kate bowed her head, to intimate that she heard, and was satisfied.
1	‘Who passes by this road so late?
1	It was again a summer day when, lately arrived in London from his college occupation, he turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity of opening his mind to Doctor Manette.
1	The day was just breaking, and the whole scene was rendered perfectly visible by the grey light of the morning.
1	I see her grown up--gent’lmen--like a flower.
1	Rob did not blush to hear the Captain earnest in his praises, but sat staring at him, and affecting to snivel with sympathy, and making a feint of being virtuous, and treasuring up every word he said (like a young spy as he was) with very promising deceit.
1	It was not until they had seen him gradually diminish into a mere speck upon the distant road, that they turned to each other, and ventured to laugh aloud.
1	Upon my honour,’ said Mr. Micawber, indefinitely kissing his hand and bowing with his genteelest air, ‘I do Homage to Miss Wickfield!
1	‘Yes, I think you had better.
1	‘You have been here many, many times, when I have not seen you, Little Dorrit?’ ‘Yes, I have been here sometimes when I have not come into the room.’ ‘Very often?’ ‘Rather often,’ said Little Dorrit, timidly.
1	‘We bring the compliments of Sir Mulberry Hawk, and a thousand entreaties that you’ll take a seat in a private box at the play tonight,’ said Mr. Pluck.
1	It turns into curds and whey when I look at him.’ ‘Well it may, sir,’ said Mrs. Snawley.
1	Let us leave our old friend in one of those moments of unmixed happiness, of which, if we seek them, there are ever some, to cheer our transitory existence here.
1	The devotion of a life--it seems a life, it is all the same--is at an end; Miss Shepherd comes out of the morning service, and the Royal Family know her no more.
1	I had then divided my text (if I may be allowed so to call it) into three heads: firstly, Sold; secondly, In pursuance of a writ of execution; thirdly, Issued by a creditor; with a few moral reflections on each, and winding up with, “Now to the first lot” in a manner that was complimented when I afterwards mingled with my hearers.
1	A diamond all set round with rubies; that's a gentleman's, I hope!
1	Kit scraped his shoes very carefully (for he had not yet lost his reverence for the bundles of papers and the tin boxes,) and tapped at the office-door, which was quickly opened by the Notary himself.
1	She was one of those people who can bear a great deal of pleasure, and she never flinched in her perseverance in the cause.
1	It was not summer yet, but spring; and it was not gentle spring ethereally mild, as in Thomson’s Seasons, but nipping spring with an easterly wind, as in Johnson’s, Jackson’s, Dickson’s, Smith’s, and Jones’s Seasons.
1	Such tokens seldom flourish long.
1	Now, give me the address.’ Rob repeated it slowly, as Mr Carker wrote it down.
1	And why glorious, my young friend?
1	Bell, dong, ding; hammer, clang, clash!
1	‘If you make believe very much, it’s quite nice,’ said the small servant, ‘but if you don’t, you know, it seems as if it would bear a little more seasoning, certainly.
1	You call yourself humble and sinful, but you are the most Bumptious of your sex.
1	said Fang, after a pause.
1	I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation, and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the nature of your calling.
1	‘I only go too ready.’ ‘Very ready,’ said Mrs. Gummidge, shaking her head, and wiping her eyes.
1	Therefore we had sat, feeling keenly for him, but laughing, nevertheless, from ear to ear.
1	It had, in its day, probably furnished employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements.
1	Adjusting the arm, she slyly took the opportunity of blowing at her own hair where it fell over her face; then the eye down there, under lighter shadows sparkled more brightly and appeared more watchful.
1	He had been eight years at a public school and had learnt, I understood, to make Latin verses of several sorts in the most admirable manner.
1	"If I wasn't as weak as a brimstone baby, sir," whispers Grandfather Smallweed, drawing the lawyer down to his level by the lapel of his coat and flashing some half-quenched green fire out of his angry eyes, "I'd tear the writing away from him.
1	Thus the lessons of my life have been perverted!
1	The period of the family’s stay at Venice came, in its course, to an end, and they moved, with their retinue, to Rome.
1	I am in my’--John hesitated a little--‘father’s business likewise.’ ‘Oh indeed!’ said Mr Dorrit.
1	Now, if I had stayed at Badger's I should have been obliged to spend twelve pounds at a blow for some heart-breaking lecture-fees.
1	‘But I mean, boy,’ resuming his gravity, ‘what do you consider me in this respect?’ touching his forehead.
1	In all weathers, fair or foul, calm or windy, we were every one on deck, walking up and down in pairs, lying in the boats, leaning over the side, or chatting in a lazy group together.
1	Or, if they flop, their floppings goes in favour of more patients, and how can you rightly have one without t'other?
1	In contrasting her system with that which we have modelled upon it, I merely seek to show that with all its drawbacks, ours has some advantages of its own.
1	‘No,’ said Wegg, ‘he’s getting cold.’ ‘It strikes me,’ whispered Venus, ‘that he wants to find out whether any one has been groping about there.’ ‘Hush!’ returned Wegg, ‘he’s getting colder and colder.--Now he’s freezing!’ This exclamation was elicited by his having turned the lantern off again, and on again, and being visible at the foot of the third mound.
1	Where are you going?’ asked the Captain, looking round at him over the glasses.
1	The words had hardly passed his lips when the bell was rung and my guardian appeared, "on the chance," he slightly observed, "of being able to do any little thing for a poor fellow involved in the same misfortune as himself."
1	The old girl promptly makes a sign of entreaty to him to say nothing; assenting with a nod, he suffers them to enter as he shuts the door.
1	George, having folded the letter, walks in that direction.
1	‘I find I’ve got a couple of coats at home that I don’t want, Sam.
1	‘Mr Carker,’ said Walter, brightening with a generous thought, ‘Come!
1	He was a tall, gaunt, cadaverous man, in an old greatcoat and slippers, with sunken cheeks, and a restless, eager eye.
1	“No, sir,” returned Wemmick; “it was going by post, when you brought Mr. Pip into the office.
1	‘That’h Jack the Giant Killer—piethe of comic infant bithnith,’ said Sleary.
1	For he is, by heaven, the most self-satisfied, and the shallowest, and the most coxcombical and utterly brainless ass!"
1	He withdrew his eyes when he saw that he was observed, and affected to be busied with some scanty preparations for dinner.
1	He has been there so long!
1	‘What is it?’ By this time Nicholas had recovered sufficient presence of mind to speak for himself, so he said (as it had been agreed he should say) that he had called about a pair of hand-screens, and some painted velvet for an ottoman, both of which were required to be of the most elegant design possible, neither time nor expense being of the smallest consideration.
1	She was even more dreadfully fond of Estella than she had been when I last saw them together; I repeat the word advisedly, for there was something positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces.
1	Before one can say ‘Thank Heaven!’ she wrongs again.
1	It may be as well for you to assist us, if you please.’ I had been in agony to obtain some knowledge of the circumstances in which my Dora would be placed--as, in whose guardianship, and so forth--and this was something towards it.
1	The story goes that Sir Leicester paid some who could have spoken out to hold their peace; but it is a lame story, feebly whispering and creeping about, and any brighter spark of life it shows soon dies away.
1	The weather was miserably raw, and the two cursed the cold.
1	The air was heavy and hot; the closeness of the place, oppressive; and from without there arose a rush of free sounds, like the jarring memory of such things in a headache and heartache.
1	‘It was the shadow of Some one who had gone by long before: of Some one who had gone on far away quite out of reach, never, never to come back.
1	What a useful work a Dictionary is!
1	‘A great deal,’ replied Kate; ‘but not now.
1	You, so far superior, so distinguished, so noble; I, a poor useless creature fit for nothing, and whom no one would have missed!’ It did her, for the time, the good of having him to think of and to succour.
1	‘Sound philosopher,’ said Mr. Pott.
1	So grey, so slow, so quiet, so impassionate, so very bumpy in the head, Patriarch was the word for him.
1	Mr. Peggotty had made a communication to me on the way to London for which I was not unprepared.
1	Mr. Woodcourt, disregarding my remonstrances, had hurriedly taken off his cloak and was putting it about me.
1	No man ever admits the unhealthiness of the place he dwells in (unless he is going away from it), and I shall therefore, I have no doubt, be at issue with the inhabitants of St. Louis, in questioning the perfect salubrity of its climate, and in hinting that I think it must rather dispose to fever, in the summer and autumnal seasons.
1	There was an earthy savour in the air, a chilly bareness in the place, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by candle-light, and not too much to eat.
1	He dressed himself for going out, with a docile submission to her entreaty; and walking with a feeble gait, and looking back, with a tremble, at the room in which he had been so long shut up, and where he had seen the picture in the glass, passed out with her into the hall.
1	You recollect him?’ ‘Never mind,’ replied the old lady, with great dignity.
1	‘--And that you have missed the letter, anyhow?’ ‘Why, Wal’r,’ said the Captain, turning his eyes upon him with a faint approach to a severe expression, ‘ain’t I been on the look-out for any tidings of that man o’ science, old Sol Gills, your Uncle, day and night, ever since I lost him?
1	She has her own supper of bread and cheese to hand to Jo, with whom she ventures to interchange a word or so for the first time.
1	Things go too contrary with me.
1	I shall find a time when we can steal away.
1	‘Uncle, you must--I am sure you will--release me from such vile and degrading companionship as I am exposed to now.
1	No one can never fill the place that’s empty.
1	He snuffed the candle, and backing away a little to see how it looked, backed out of the room--unexpectedly to me, for I was going to ask him by whom he had been sent.
1	The man shook his head.
1	I tell you I must get it before I can give it to you.’ She stopped in the roadway, as if to put an end to the conference.
1	Further, she was lady paramount over certain vaults in the basement, sharply spiked off from communication with the predatory world; and over the relics of the current day’s work, consisting of blots of ink, worn-out pens, fragments of wafers, and scraps of paper torn so small, that nothing interesting could ever be deciphered on them when Mrs. Sparsit tried.
1	“What will you take for breakfast, sir?” ‘Tom was thinking how he should open the case, so he made no answer.
1	It was as if he kissed me, and I couldn’t bear it, but cried out.
1	However, all the things indispensable to be said are said, and all the things indispensable to be done are done (including Lady Tippins’s yawning, falling asleep, and waking insensible), and there is hurried preparation for the nuptial journey to the Isle of Wight, and the outer air teems with brass bands and spectators.
1	‘Servant, sir,’ said the one-eyed man to Mr. Pickwick.
1	‘Besides,’ says the discreet lady, with an argumentative air, ‘who ever heard of such obstinacy as his staying shut up here through all these dreadful disagreeables?
1	I have not the least idea what we had for dinner, besides Dora.
1	The pipe soon getting into better condition, he fell into that state of repose becoming a good smoker; but sat with his eyes fixed on Florence, and, with a beaming placidity not to be described, and stopping every now and then to discharge a little cloud from his lips, slowly puffed it forth, as if it were a scroll coming out of his mouth, bearing the legend ‘Poor Wal’r, ay, ay.
1	Another shake of the hand, Marchioness, if you please.
1	‘Why, I’ll tell you what, sir,’ said Tim, standing in his favourite attitude and pointing to the cage with the feather of his pen, ‘it’s a very extraordinary thing about that bird, that the only people he ever takes the smallest notice of, are Mr. Charles, and Mr. Ned, and you, and me.’ Here, Tim stopped and glanced anxiously at Nicholas; then unexpectedly catching his eye repeated, ‘And you and me, sir, and you and me.’ And then he glanced at Nicholas again, and, squeezing his hand, said, ‘I am a bad one at putting off anything I am interested in.
1	They worked gaily in ordering and arranging their houses until noon, and then went to visit the clergyman.
1	‘Yes, Sir, that’s wagging, Sir,’ returned the quondam Grinder, much affected.
1	‘Hawk,’ rejoined the other, ‘tell me; I must know.’ ‘MUST know,’ interrupted the other disdainfully.
1	you’d make a pound a week!’ ‘You don’t say so!’ ‘I do indeed, and if we had a run of good houses, nearly double the money.’ Nicholas shrugged his shoulders; but sheer destitution was before him; and if he could summon fortitude to undergo the extremes of want and hardship, for what had he rescued his helpless charge if it were only to bear as hard a fate as that from which he had wrested him?
1	And immediately darted into her state-cabin again.
1	His table was covered with papers, and he was hard at work in an old coat.
1	The allusion to friends, and the offer of money, Gride held to be mere empty vapouring, for purposes of delay.
1	Not tonight!’ He comes very slowly back to me, licks my hand, and lifts his dim eyes to my face.
1	Not a sluice gate, or a painted scale upon a post or wall, showing the depth of water, but seemed to hint, like the dreadfully facetious Wolf in bed in Grandmamma’s cottage, ‘That’s to drown YOU in, my dears!’ Not a lumbering black barge, with its cracked and blistered side impending over them, but seemed to suck at the river with a thirst for sucking them under.
1	How long such conquests last, is another matter; that they are achieved, is every-day experience, not even to be flourished away by Podsnappery itself.
1	"Why, you an't such an unnatural woman, I hope," returns Bucket sternly, "as to wish your own child dead?"
1	Take care of that veal and ham--mind the lobsters--take the salad out of the cloth--give me the dressing.’ Such were the hurried orders which issued from the lips of Mr. Wardle, as he handed in the different articles described, and placed dishes in everybody’s hands, and on everybody’s knees, in endless number.
1	‘Now, don’t ask me how I dare, father, because that’s bosh.
1	I hope it’ll bring his pride down, and it shall be no fault of mine if it don’t.’ Now, a proud usher in a Yorkshire school was such a very extraordinary and unaccountable thing to hear of,--any usher at all being a novelty; but a proud one, a being of whose existence the wildest imagination could never have dreamed--that Miss Squeers, who seldom troubled herself with scholastic matters, inquired with much curiosity who this Knuckleboy was, that gave himself such airs.
1	Those Furies, the conventionalities, being thus appeased, he left her.
1	‘I say systematic villainy, gentlemen,’ said Serjeant Buzfuz, looking through Mr. Pickwick, and talking _at_ him; ‘and when I say systematic villainy, let me tell the defendant Pickwick, if he be in court, as I am informed he is, that it would have been more decent in him, more becoming, in better judgment, and in better taste, if he had stopped away.
1	Cornelia looked at Mr Dombey through her spectacles, as if she would have liked to crack a few quotations with him from the authority in question.
1	The room in which Kit sat himself down, in this condition, was an extremely poor and homely place, but with that air of comfort about it, nevertheless, which--or the spot must be a wretched one indeed--cleanliness and order can always impart in some degree.
1	‘Wasn’t that how you put it?’ ‘That was what I said.’ ‘Ay!
1	From these, in a narrow and a dirty street devoted to such callings, Mr Wegg selects one dark shop-window with a tallow candle dimly burning in it, surrounded by a muddle of objects vaguely resembling pieces of leather and dry stick, but among which nothing is resolvable into anything distinct, save the candle itself in its old tin candlestick, and two preserved frogs fighting a small-sword duel.
1	‘And so you’ve got another berth, have you, my lad?’ said the Captain, eyeing him intently.
1	You're a great deal too fond of poking your nose into things that don't concern you, making everybody in the house laugh, the moment your back is turned, and making yourself look like a fool every hour in the day.
1	Something that--' 'You had better bid,' interrupted Mrs. Bumble.
1	"But pray tell me how you got it."
1	Look at me, I say, proud mother of a proud, false son!
1	'I couldn't help it, Bill.
1	These were all the antecedents known in Minor Canon Corner of the coming pupils.
1	Mr. Guppy would say no if he could--as he is unable to hide.
1	I longed for home till I was weary, and pined away with grief, but now--’ ‘And what now?’ asked Nicholas, looking kindly in his face.
1	‘I surprise you, I see, ma’am,’ said the old gentleman.
1	They were all about her at the time, knowing that the end was drawing on.
1	He stood, for a moment, with the blood so tingling through all his veins from terror, that he felt as if he were in a burning fire; then, confused and frightened, he took to his heels; and, not knowing what he did, made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground.
1	Don't be afraid, Oliver, you shall come back to us again.
1	Now, who's next?” Thus, we walked through Wemmick's greenhouse, until he turned to me and said, “Notice the man I shall shake hands with.” I should have done so, without the preparation, as he had shaken hands with no one yet.
1	The Master Crummleses had no sooner swallowed the last procurable morsel of food, than they evinced, by various half-suppressed yawns and stretchings of their limbs, an obvious inclination to retire for the night, which Smike had betrayed still more strongly: he having, in the course of the meal, fallen asleep several times while in the very act of eating.
1	I replied, ‘I, Miss Mills!
1	I have long found that there is nothing.
1	“For the loss of his services.” Joe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman.
1	I got him back for you by means of the girl; and then _she_ begins to favour him.'
1	I have a partiality for everything genuine.
1	Away, with a shriek, and a roar, and a rattle, plunging down into the earth again, and working on in such a storm of energy and perseverance, that amidst the darkness and whirlwind the motion seems reversed, and to tend furiously backward, until a ray of light upon the wet wall shows its surface flying past like a fierce stream.
1	I begged he would excuse me from discussing it.
1	But it is ashes, Mum, not crustiness.’ Miss Tox seemed to be so little enlightened by this reply, as to find a difficulty in pursuing the subject.
1	It would have been a long time before I could have accommodated myself comfortably with her, after this; and I really don’t know, as Paul is going to be very grand, and these are people of condition, that she would have been quite presentable, and might not have compromised myself.
1	They were both so glad to see me at all hours, and used to brighten up so when they heard me opening the door and coming in (being quite at home, I never knocked), that I had no fear of becoming troublesome just yet.
1	It is appointed against such offences that the offenders shall not be able to forget.
1	‘More than enough,’ the other said, and took her hand and kissed it.
1	‘“Send young Gay.”’ ‘Call him back,’ said Mr Dombey.
1	‘Why, I think it’s Mr Carker,’ said Walter.
1	And then, and not till then, I said to Annie, “Annie, Doctor Strong will not only be your husband, but he will represent your late father: he will represent the head of our family, he will represent the wisdom and station, and I may say the means, of our family; and will be, in short, a Boon to it.” I used the word at the time, and I have used it again, today.
1	You have supposed Mr Meagles and his family to strain every nerve, I think you said--’ ‘Every nerve,’ repeated Mrs Gowan, looking at him in calm obstinacy, with her green fan between her face and the fire.
1	I have been very poor, too, and have even suffered from want.’ ‘Good Heaven, Mr. Nicholas!’ exclaimed Miss La Creevy, ‘what are you telling me?’ ‘Nothing which need distress you quite so much,’ answered Nicholas, with a more sprightly air; ‘neither did I come here to bewail my lot, but on matter more to the purpose.
1	She was not quite so self-possessed as usual, I thought; and had evidently undergone anxiety and fatigue.
1	I can’t say--all I know is, that Tom Smart said so--or at least he always told my uncle he said so, and it’s just the same thing.
1	But look at him!’ He pointed to Uriah, pale and glowering in a corner, evidently very much out in his calculations, and taken by surprise.
1	The dashing man, who used his handsome wife so ill?’ ‘If you seek to recall any particular dashing man to my recollection by such a trait as that,’ said Ralph, shrugging his shoulders, ‘I shall confound him with nine-tenths of the dashing men I have ever known.’ ‘Tut, tut.
1	He was not so much surprised to see me as I had expected.
1	There is no look of decent comfort anywhere.
1	‘We were a very happy little company, Johnson,’ said poor Crummles.
1	But only to think how kind and friendly a gentleman you must be!’ Mr Fledgeby found that he was skating round a board marked Dangerous, and had better cut out a fresh track.
1	Not so identically the same as I supposed when I really did for the moment take you to be the same in the dusk--for which I ought to apologise; permit me to do so; a readiness to confess my errors is, I hope, a part of the frankness of my character--still, however, uncommonly like.’ ‘Indeed?’ said Jeremiah, perversely.
1	Now, John, the candles.’ The candles were brought, the fire was stirred up, and a fresh log of wood thrown on.
1	I can’t keep my money very well.
1	‘If I have found it best to conceal where my home is, it is not because I am ashamed of him.
1	Her companion was not encumbered with much luggage, as there merely dangled from a stick which he carried over his shoulder, a small parcel wrapped in a common handkerchief, and apparently light enough.
1	With the round top of an inkstand and two broken bits of sealing-wax he is silently and slowly working out whatever train of indecision is in his mind.
1	I am sure, Sir,’ observed Mr Perch, ‘that although Mrs Perch was at that time nursing as thriving a little girl, Sir, as we’ve ever took the liberty of adding to our family, I wouldn’t have made so free as drop a hint of her being capable of imparting nourishment, not if it was never so!’ Mr Carker grinned at him like a shark, but in an absent, thoughtful manner.
1	The smaller birds might have tumbled out of their nests, fascinated by the glittering of Mrs. Sparsit’s eyes in the gloom, as she stopped and listened.
1	Old Mr. Wardle without a hat, and his clothes torn in several places, stood by his side, and the fragments of the chaise lay scattered at their feet.
1	In the distance before him, lay the place where he had struck the worse than useless blows that mocked him with Lizzie’s presence there as Eugene’s wife.
1	said the old lady, 'painters always make ladies out prettier than they are, or they wouldn't get any custom, child.
1	These Nicholas engaged, only too happy to have escaped any request for payment of a week’s rent beforehand.
1	O Mr Wrayburn, Mr Wrayburn, is there no cruelty in your being here to-night!’ ‘In the name of all that’s good--and that is not conjuring you in my own name, for Heaven knows I am not good’--said Eugene, ‘don’t be distressed!’ ‘What else can I be, when I know the distance and the difference between us?
1	It may be time that I should meet with some misfortune; but I hope it is not this.'
1	Anybody might see that the shadow of the wall was dark upon him.
1	‘If you’re wanting a place to stop at,’ the man remarked, ‘I should advise you to take up at the same house with us.
1	I told him that I was resolved to leave off, and that I was determined to stand by my resolution.’ ‘And you still are?’ ‘I still am, sir.
1	Nancy's appearance gave a new turn to the conversation; for the boys, receiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew, began to ply her with liquor: of which, however, she took very sparingly; while Fagin, assuming an unusual flow of spirits, gradually brought Mr. Sikes into a better temper, by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant banter; and, moreover, by laughing very heartily at one or two rough jokes, which, after repeated applications to the spirit-bottle, he condescended to make.
1	‘And as to you, my dear Bella,’ said Mrs Boffin, still with that distressed expression, ‘he is so much attached to you, whatever he says, that your own father has not a truer interest in you and can hardly like you better than he does.’ ‘Says too!’ cried Mr Boffin.
1	We’re all shipmets here,--Wal’r and sweet--heart will be jined together in the house of bondage, as soon as the askings is over,’ whispered Captain Cuttle, in his ear.
1	Perhaps you are aware--my daughter Amy may have mentioned that I am the Father of this place.’ ‘I--so I have understood,’ said Arthur, dashing at the assertion.
1	When he cast off the Patriarch at night, it was only to take an anonymous craft in tow, and labour away afresh in other waters.
1	The lady made no answer, but she smiled again.
1	Go!’ His little daughter hesitated for another instant as though she would have clung about him still, or had some lingering hope that he might raise her in his arms and kiss her.
1	There is some solemn echo of them even in the Cathedral chime, which strikes a sudden surprise to his heart as he turns in under the archway of the gatehouse.
1	‘No, sir, it was not.
1	There was a formation of surface going on around her on an amazing scale, and it had not a flaw of courage or honest free speech in it.
1	‘He has paid off every obligation he incurred here--even to Traddles’s bill, you remember my dear Agnes--and therefore we may take it for granted that he is doing well.
1	and more than that, John,’ said a neighbour, who had come down to help him with the boat.
1	Dismissing his guide at the gate, and in his impatience not even stopping to admire the thriving look of cottage or garden either, Nicholas made his way to the kitchen door, and knocked lustily with his stick.
1	At the end of the second day, he saw land; at the end of the third, his loom stood empty.
1	He shook as if he would have fallen; and his hand--I touched it with my own, for his appearance alarmed me--was deadly cold.
1	‘What?’ ‘All this,’ she rejoined; ‘all this about us.
1	‘There was that sort of thing done to me somehow.
1	‘You will understand, when I wish to see you, that Miss Dombey is not to be present; and that I seek an interview as one who has the happiness to possess your confidence, and who comes to render you every assistance in his power, and, perhaps, on many occasions, to ward off evil from her?’ Looking at him still with the same apparent dread of releasing him for a moment from the influence of her steady gaze, whatever that might be, she answered, ‘Yes!’ and once more bade him go.
1	“It would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in the street.
1	You have that in the house, I suppose?’ ‘You shall have a glass of--of anything you like,’ answered Gride, with a groan.
1	Bella was hurrying back to the chair in which she had hidden her face so long, when, catching sight of Mrs Boffin by the way, she stopped at her.
1	I was alone, and calm and quiet below me in the sun and shade lay the old house, with its terraces and turrets, on which there had seemed to me to be such complete repose when I first saw it, but which now looked like the obdurate and unpitying watcher of my mother's misery.
1	‘When you’re ready for your snooze,’ said that honest creature, ‘chuck yourself on my bed in the corner, T’otherest.
1	Sometimes Mr. Claypole faints himself, but the result is the same.
1	Maids are so hard to teach, now-a-days, that I have put her about me young.
1	You want to know why I played this little trick that you have interrupted?
1	But she got over it with the same good humour; tied a handkerchief round her head; and came out into the little gallery with the rest.
1	There are only four of us.
1	I say when I rendered it; I am speaking of the past.” “You make light of the obligation,” returned Darnay, “but I will not quarrel with _your_ light answer.” “Genuine truth, Mr. Darnay, trust me!
1	Happening, in the midst of these cogitations, to raise his hand, he was astonished to find how heavy it seemed, and yet how thin and light it really was.
1	“'Yes, master, and I've never been in it much.'
1	Yet I had never been taught to pray for any relation but my godmother.
1	I am not angry.’ ‘I say,’ resumed the Golden Dustman, ‘I am not angry, and I mean kindly to you, and I want to overlook this.
1	‘Really, George,’ remonstrated Miss Lavinia, ‘I must say that I don’t understand your allusions, and that I think you might be more delicate and less personal.’ ‘Go it!’ cried Mr Sampson, becoming, on the shortest notice, a prey to despair.
1	There were times, she said, of an evening, when he talked of their old life in the boat-house; and then he mentioned Emily as a child.
1	Before Maggy could open the door, Mr Pancks, opening it from without, stood without a hat and with his bare head in the wildest condition, looking at Clennam and Little Dorrit, over her shoulder.
1	‘Upon my word,’ said Nicholas, taking the manager aside, ‘I don’t think I can be ready by Monday.’ ‘Pooh, pooh,’ replied Mr. Crummles.
1	They might be buried in consecrated ground, but he would have had them buried deep, and never brought to light again.
1	'Really, my friend,' I said, 'I think not--if your time is of any value to you.'
1	As they were, like some other committees, extremely dull and prolix in debate, this history may pursue the footsteps of Newman Noggs; thereby combining advantage with necessity; for it would have been necessary to do so under any circumstances, and necessity has no law, as all the world knows.
1	‘Warn’t it a steamer?’ he pauses to ask her.
1	I will not budge one inch!’ He went home, and was glad to find his housekeeper complaining of illness, that he might have an excuse for being alone and sending her away to where she lived: which was hard by.
1	Only in the corner where the combat had taken place could I detect any evidence of the young gentleman's existence.
1	‘Why, surely he must love you with all his heart!’ cried Helena, with an earnestness that threatened to blaze into ferocity if he didn’t.
1	It’s not for me to boast of any family with which I have the honour to be connected; at the same time, Mrs Kenwigs’s is--I should say,’ said Mr. Kenwigs, abruptly, and raising his voice as he spoke, ‘that my children might come into a matter of a hundred pound apiece, perhaps.
1	Monsieur Rigaud arose, lighted a cigarette, put the rest of his stock into a breast-pocket, and stretched himself out at full length upon the bench.
1	How stands the fact?’ Mr. Jasper weighs the three keys in his hand, lifts his head from his idly stooping attitude over the fire, and delivers the keys to Durdles with an ingenuous and friendly face.
1	As a professional Receiver of rents, so very few people _do_ wish to see me, that the novelty would be bracing.’ For his ready acquiescence, the grateful Rosa put her hands upon his shoulders, stood on tiptoe, and instantly kissed him.
1	‘And when you had made sure of the poor little fool,’ said my aunt--‘God forgive me that I should call her so, and she gone where YOU won’t go in a hurry--because you had not done wrong enough to her and hers, you must begin to train her, must you?
1	I have an enemy--you understand what that is?’ ‘Oh, yes, I understand that,’ said Smike.
1	If the members of a religious persuasion built a chapel there—as the members of eighteen religious persuasions had done—they made it a pious warehouse of red brick, with sometimes (but this is only in highly ornamental examples) a bell in a birdcage on the top of it.
1	They have been in that house (says Cook) through a funeral, a wedding, and a running-away; and let it not be said that they couldn’t agree among themselves at such a time as the present.
1	‘Give it to me.’ ‘Oh yes, I dare say,’ cried the other boy.
1	Now, greatly to the relief of the visitors, the emotional Sloppy no sooner beheld his patroness in this condition, than, throwing back his head and throwing open his mouth, he lifted up his voice and bellowed.
1	Oliver fell into a heavy doze:  imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes, or wandering about the dark churchyard, or retracing some one or other of the scenes of the past day:  when he was roused by Toby Crackit jumping up and declaring it was half-past one.
1	I clearly perceived, too, that Ada shared my feelings.
1	Christian name?” “John.” “John Barsad,” repeated madame, after murmuring it once to herself.
1	He said ‘very much.’ And Susan, with no little trepidation, showed herself at his bedside.
1	‘I trust, madam,’ said his Grace, returning alone, ‘that you will have the kindness to overlook it, in consideration of its being the act of a very young man who is merely here on liking, and who will never answer.’ With that, he solemnly bowed and retired, and they all burst into laughter, long and merry.
1	Miss Brass is here, gentlemen.’ Mr Garland and the Notary walked in, looking very grave; and, drawing up two chairs, one on each side of the single gentleman, formed a kind of fence round the gentle Sarah, and penned her into a corner.
1	the counting up to twelve, and 'Hush!'
1	Following close at his heels, came Mr. Job Trotter, in the catalogue of whose vices, want of faith and attachment to his companion could at all events find no place.
1	Fledgeby told it again with great care, and rang every sovereign.
1	‘But you are resigned now!’ said one of the gentlemen after a short pause, during which he had resumed his former manner.
1	Instead of going straight to the gate, too, she stepped back into the passage, and beckoned me.
1	He wrote with extraordinary neatness.
1	And there were a good many inches of him, too, for although he was not very tall, he was a remarkable size round, and the inches that he wanted in height, he made up in circumference.
1	At the hour of eight, a deep lowing, as of a nautical Bull, outside the shop-door, succeeded by the knocking of a stick on the panel, announced to the listening ear of Captain Cuttle, that Bunsby was alongside; whom he instantly admitted, shaggy and loose, and with his stolid mahogany visage, as usual, appearing to have no consciousness of anything before it, but to be attentively observing something that was taking place in quite another part of the world.
1	To which end, the accidental discovery by Miss Knag of some tender correspondence, in which Madame Mantalini was described as ‘old’ and ‘ordinary,’ had most providentially contributed.
1	I stopped then, to wave my hat, and dear old Joe waved his strong right arm above his head, crying huskily “Hooroar!” and Biddy put her apron to her face.
1	‘Slow, you may be; sure, you are!’ This he twice or thrice repeated with much complacency, as he again dispersed the legs of the Turkish trousers and bent the knees.
1	Squeers had actually begun to haul him out, when Nicholas (who, until then, had been evidently undecided how to act) took him by the collar, and shaking him so that such teeth as he had, chattered in his head, politely escorted him to the room-door, and thrusting him into the passage, shut it upon him.
1	‘Traddles,’ said I, shaking hands with him again, after I had sat down, ‘I am delighted to see you.’ ‘I am delighted to see YOU, Copperfield,’ he returned.
1	For if I had that chance, in one of the humours he drives me into--he'd go down, sir!"
1	You, with your practices of infamous foreign prisons and galleys would make it the money that impelled me.
1	The sun is tremendously hot, even to me.
1	‘That’s comforting, and I hope you may be right.
1	After which offensive implication, he cut himself a crust of bread, and threw the knife down with a noise.
1	Among them is a very little boy, who chews tobacco like a very big one; and a droning gentleman, who talks arithmetically and statistically on all subjects, from poetry downwards; and who always speaks in the same key, with exactly the same emphasis, and with very grave deliberation.
1	‘Did you hear him?’ retorted Wegg.
1	It has closed around me almost as awfully as if these woods of Chesney Wold had closed around the house, but my course through it is the same.
1	She went by the Iron Bridge, though it cost her a penny, and walked more slowly in that part of her journey than in any other.
1	"I ask your pardon, sir," returns the trooper, "but I should wish to know what YOU say?"
1	'Yes, sir,' said Mr. Bumble.
1	Oh, how happy I was, down upon the floor, with my sweet beautiful girl down upon the floor too, holding my scarred face to her lovely cheek, bathing it with tears and kisses, rocking me to and fro like a child, calling me by every tender name that she could think of, and pressing me to her faithful heart.
1	And why, then, do men tread them?
1	Now, the point was this.
1	‘He never loved nobody,’ bawled Squeers, through the keyhole.
1	I know where this hound is to be met with; time and place both.
1	‘What’s your name, sir?’ inquired the judge.
1	On the road home, he was more demonstrative of aggressive intentions against the other foot-passengers, than comported with a professor of the peaceful art of self-defence.
1	Say, that you could carry back your thoughts to very distant days--to the time of your early life--when, unlike this fair flower, you did not pass your youth alone.
1	"It was he who was very gentlemanly, I think!"
1	Suddenly Miss Murdstone gave such a scream that I all but dropped it.
1	‘I wish I were not going to this dinner, Helena.’ ‘Dear Neville, is it worth while to care much about it?
1	The Storming of the Castle in the Air      20.
1	Let me go and listen.’ She shuddered to approach the pit; but she crept towards it on her hands and knees, and called to him as loud as she could call.
1	said Mr. Sikes, suddenly breaking silence.
1	I never see a young woman in any station of society--and I've seen many elevated ones too--conduct herself like you have conducted yourself since you was called out of your bed.
1	When it was asleep again, I crept close to my mother’s side according to my old custom, broken now a long time, and sat with my arms embracing her waist, and my little red cheek on her shoulder, and once more felt her beautiful hair drooping over me--like an angel’s wing as I used to think, I recollect--and was very happy indeed.
1	Now, Pet, my darling, you had better go along with Mother and get ready for the boat.
1	‘Just gobbled and gobbled, till I found out how to do it.
1	‘If you had money now,’ said Mr Dombey; ‘as much money as young Gay has talked about; what would you do?’ ‘Give it to his old Uncle,’ returned Paul.
1	"Let us open the window a bit and get a mouthful of air.
1	‘Some thinks,’ he said, ‘as her affection was ill-bestowed; some, as her marriage was broken off by death.
1	They were very quiet again.
1	When I go about here in a gondola, I surprise myself looking into other gondolas as if I hoped to see them.
1	Nicholas saw it, and ground his teeth at every repetition of the savage and cowardly attack.
1	Not that they had ever quarrelled (Miss Mills informed me); but that having been, on the occasion of Dora’s christening, invited to tea, when they considered themselves privileged to be invited to dinner, they had expressed their opinion in writing, that it was ‘better for the happiness of all parties’ that they should stay away.
1	‘Count, count,’ screamed Mrs. Leo Hunter to a well-whiskered individual in a foreign uniform, who was passing by.
1	He brought me such joyful and wonderful intelligence about you!
1	They are no part of the case.
1	Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think, sir?” “Not of late years.
1	When Flora replied in the negative, Little Dorrit said that she understood why he had been so delicate, but that she felt sure he would approve of her confiding her secret to Flora, and that she would therefore do so now with Flora’s permission.
1	One was a young girl; not twenty, as I recollect; whose snow-white room was hung with the work of some former prisoner, and upon whose downcast face the sun in all its splendour shone down through the high chink in the wall, where one narrow strip of bright blue sky was visible.
1	There was very little said at dinner.
1	The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet indeed.
1	She approached one of the wretched hovels by the way-side, and knocked with her hand upon the door.
1	He could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the ground than his own height, and had his knife ready in his hand to cut it then and drop.
1	It is not generous in you, it is not honourable in you, to conduct yourself towards me as you do.’ ‘Is it ungenerous or dishonourable to be devoted to you; fascinated by you?’ ‘Preposterous!’ said Bella.
1	She follows him, peeps from the court, sees him still faltering on without looking back, and holds him in view.
1	‘What does my sister say to that?’ ‘I hope not.’ ‘Then I have no such intention, Agnes.’ ‘I think you ought not, Trotwood, since you ask me,’ she said, mildly.
1	The fact is, our roads are not the same.
1	‘Why, that’s the Wrong hand, Davy!’ laughed the gentleman.
1	It appeared to me that he never thought of being observed by anyone; but was so intent upon her, and upon his own thoughts in connexion with her, as to be quite absorbed.
1	There was another loud ring; and the bustling old landlady of the White Hart made her appearance in the opposite gallery.
1	The touch was still in its influence so like a blow that Arthur could not get many words together to close the subject with.
1	We never have tunes here."
1	“I have come into such good fortune since I saw you last, Miss Havisham,” I murmured.
1	Then, she dilated on the fearful hardship of having a father and mother strenuously opposed to her intended husband; on which unhappy circumstance she dwelt at great length; for the friend’s father and mother were quite agreeable to her being married, and the whole courtship was in consequence as flat and common-place an affair as it was possible to imagine.
1	You remember me as give you somethink handsome for a handkercher wot she had left?'
1	Having rested here, for a minute or so, to collect a good burst of sobs and an imposing show of tears and terror, he knocked loudly at the wicket; and presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it, that even he, who saw nothing but rueful faces about him at the best of times, started back in astonishment.
1	There was an hotel in this place, which, like all hotels in America, had its large dining-room for the public table.
1	Did he catch any glimpse of himself making a show of Bitzer to strangers, as the rising young man, so devoted to his master’s great merits, who had won young Tom’s place, and had almost captured young Tom himself, in the times when by various rascals he was spirited away?
1	After many compliments on this performance, we fell into some general conversation; and as I was too full of my desperate intentions to keep my altered circumstances to myself, I made them known to Mr. and Mrs. Micawber.
1	For by that time it was known that the late Mr Merdle’s complaint had been simply Forgery and Robbery.
1	‘It’s Heart’s Delight!’ said the Captain, looking intently in her face.
1	Yes.’ ‘It shall be done, Eugene.
1	Mr. Brownlow's indignation was greatly roused; but reflecting perhaps, that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it, he suppressed his feelings and submitted to be sworn at once.
1	Mr. Grummer, perfectly speechless with indignation, dragged the truncheon with the brass crown from its particular pocket, and flourished it before Sam’s eyes.
1	I had no doubt that under all the circumstances we should be married in the most private and simple manner.
1	‘Not that I swaller it,’ said Riderhood, squinting at his Lock, when he saw Bradley coming out of the house, ‘as you’ve been a sleeping all the time, old boy!’ Bradley came to him, sitting on his wooden lever, and asked what o’clock it was?
1	A remarkable feature of the theme is that it is found to be so inspiring that several people come out upon it who never came out before--positively say things!
1	Hem!’ This last sound was a solemn and dignified cough, in which Mr. Pell, observing an indecent tendency to mirth in some of his auditors, considered it due to himself to indulge.
1	He walked a little to and fro after saying this to himself with a shudder, and then looked at me, and brightened, and came and sat down again with his hands in his pockets.
1	Well, this was comfortable too; but even this was not all--for in the bar, seated at tea at the nicest possible little table, drawn close up before the brightest possible little fire, was a buxom widow of somewhere about eight-and-forty or thereabouts, with a face as comfortable as the bar, who was evidently the landlady of the house, and the supreme ruler over all these agreeable possessions.
1	I hope you are well!” It was Stryver's grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any place, or space.
1	"Quite true that I have exhausted my present resources, and I am quite content to know it.
1	Come into this house for heaven's sake!
1	Immense deference was shown to the Henry Spikers, male and female; which Agnes told me was on account of Mr. Henry Spiker being solicitor to something or to somebody, I forget what or which, remotely connected with the Treasury.
1	Even on himself, its shadow was faint enough as he moved about among the throng, receiving homage.
1	I think it must have been a full year after our hunt upon the marshes, for it was a long time after, and it was winter and a hard frost.
1	Rachael took it up, shaking from head to foot.
1	I had known him a long time--from a little child.
1	Come home to your poor mother, you young dog!
1	You are going to a Cathedral town?’ said I. Mr. Micawber, who had been helping us all, out of the wash-hand-stand jug, replied: ‘To Canterbury.
1	"He is a very fervid, impassioned speaker--full of fire!
1	Some are almost sliding down, as you look at them.
1	Dr. Crocus has come all this way to cure you, gentlemen.
1	Still my position was a distinguished one, and I was not at all dissatisfied with it, until Fate threw me in the way of that unlimited miscreant, Trabb's boy.
1	The letter never reached its destination; but that, and other proofs, she kept, in case they ever tried to lie away the blot.
1	The boy made no sign.
1	Old Barley might be as old as the hills, and might swear like a whole field of troopers, but there were redeeming youth and trust and hope enough in Chinks's Basin to fill it to overflowing.
1	It had been uniformly gloomy and dull.
1	Spirits are supposed to haunt the places where their bodies most resorted, and Monseigneur without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be.
1	Even Stephen Blackpool’s disappearance was falling into the general way, and becoming as monotonous a wonder as any piece of machinery in Coketown.
1	Dinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was his dressing-room; the third, his bedroom.
1	‘Ha!’ said Mr Swiveller, with a portentous frown.
1	Mr Merdle wished him to take it, and he had taken it.
1	He even seemed half afraid that she might have read his thoughts; for he leered coaxingly upon her, as he said aloud: ‘Take up all loose stitches in the bottle-green with the best black silk.
1	‘But you needn’t trouble yourself to make a noise at my door,’ said Susan Nipper, ‘nor to contaminate the key-hole with your eye, I’m packing up and going you may take your affidavit.’ The Dowager expressed her lively satisfaction at this intelligence, and with some general opinions upon young hussies as a race, and especially upon their demerits after being spoiled by Miss Dombey, withdrew to prepare the Nipper’s wages.
1	inquired one of the magistrates.
1	Clennam had abundant occupation for his thoughts, as he sat in the quiet room watching the father on his bed, and the daughter fanning his face.
1	‘The servant girl had her key in the door as I came up, and directed me to this room, telling me I was expected.
1	Thirty horses stood in his stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls, six body-women waited on his wife.
1	It was the money left me, and the gains of the first few year wot I sent home to Mr. Jaggers--all for you--when he first come arter you, agreeable to my letter.” O that he had never come!
1	He acted upon this impulse without delay, and choosing the least frequented roads began his journey back, resolved to lie concealed within a short distance of the metropolis, and, entering it at dusk by a circuitous route, to proceed straight to that part of it which he had fixed on for his destination.
1	She uttered no cry of distress.
1	No man could say, ‘Mr F.’s Aunt, will you permit me?’ Every man retired from the spoon, as Clennam did, cowed and baffled.
1	Say, makes away with himself.’ ‘Kills himself, in fact,’ said Wilkins Flasher, Esquire.
1	We have had a wretched existence.
1	His anxiety, in reference to that worthy pair, was that they should not come near him; for, in the morbid state of his nerves, he sought to be left alone, and spared the being seen so subdued and weak.
1	‘It is an honour, indeed!’ said Mr. Wititterly.
1	‘Contradictory things to wish,’ said Bella, ‘but my life and fortunes are so contradictory altogether that what can I expect myself to be!’ The Secretary, working in the Dismal Swamp betimes next morning, was informed that a youth waited in the hall who gave the name of Sloppy.
1	He agreed to this compromise, and if Caddy had ever been happy in her life, she was happy when we sat down to work.
1	"I don't know, your ladyship, that it's worth while my sitting down and detaining you, for I--I have not got the letters that I mentioned when I had the honour of waiting on your ladyship."
1	You do, don't you, Phil?"
1	He had always doubled, and sometimes quadrupled, his fees.
1	He appears to be very strong and lifts heavy benches about as if he had no idea what weight was.
1	Crackit went to the window, and shaking all over, drew in his head.
1	Penned in the dock, as I again stood outside it at the corner with his hand in mine, were the two-and-thirty men and women; some defiant, some stricken with terror, some sobbing and weeping, some covering their faces, some staring gloomily about.
1	And if you should be apprehensive of the trouble of doing so, there is the further haven of consolation that any number of people will take the trouble off your hands.’ ‘Well!
1	I was walking out with Miss Trotwood after tea, just at dark, and there he was, close to our house.’ ‘Walking about?’ I inquired.
1	But the deep regular breathing, still going on while the other was taking off his worn shoes and gaiters, and still continuing when he had laid aside his coat and cravat, became at length a strong provocative to curiosity, and incentive to get a glimpse of the sleeper’s face.
1	She lives near Cavendish Square.
1	They looked at each other.
1	Arrived at the wharf off which this great commander’s ship was jammed in among some five hundred companions, whose tangled rigging looked like monstrous cobwebs half swept down, Captain Cuttle appeared at the coach-window, and invited Florence and Miss Nipper to accompany him on board; observing that Bunsby was to the last degree soft-hearted in respect of ladies, and that nothing would so much tend to bring his expansive intellect into a state of harmony as their presentation to the Cautious Clara.
1	‘You are not to suppose that he hasn’t got a longer name, if he chose to use it,’ said my aunt, with a loftier air.
1	He prepared me, on that    fatal night, for his disclosure of my guilt to you.
1	I will speak to you by and by--another time.
1	But when it came to that, they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her; as if--the thought passed through my mind--I were dying too.
1	‘I do, indeed,’ replied the junior.
1	He gets to know about me and my property, and about this young lady, and her share in poor young John’s story, and he puts this and that together, and he says to himself, “I’ll get in with Boffin, and I’ll get in with this young lady, and I’ll work ‘em both at the same time, and I’ll bring my pigs to market somewhere.”  I hear him say it, bless you!
1	Or," says Sir Leicester somewhat sternly, for Volumnia was going to cut in before he had rounded his sentence, "or who vindicate their outraged majesty."
1	'Let 'em alone for that,' replied the undertaker.
1	‘It was possessed by, and was the property of--him as I have made mention on,’ said Riderhood, stupidly evading the actual mention of the name.
1	‘Why, what have you been doing these three months?’ ‘Ah, to be sure!’ interposed Perker; ‘come, account for this idleness.
1	‘Although,’ stammered Mr Toots, ‘I had not the pleasure of your acquaintance, Sir, before you were--you were--’ ‘Lost to sight, to memory dear,’ suggested the Captain, in a low voice.
1	The pudding was out of the copper.
1	‘By advertising,’ said Mrs. Micawber--‘in all the papers.
1	But she was a very, very little creature indeed, when she had somehow gained the knowledge that her clasp of her father’s hand was to be always loosened at the door which the great key opened; and that while her own light steps were free to pass beyond it, his feet must never cross that line.
1	He was a short, bald old man, in a high-shouldered black coat and waistcoat, drab breeches, and long drab gaiters.
1	Then came more of the wrathful monsters, whose like they almost seemed to be in their wildness and their untamed air, screeching and turning round and round again; and still, before, behind, and to the right and left, was the same interminable perspective of brick towers, never ceasing in their black vomit, blasting all things living or inanimate, shutting out the face of day, and closing in on all these horrors with a dense dark cloud.
1	As to her, Barbara, I think I could almost die to do her service, but you would think so too, if you knew her as I do.
1	I don’t know as I should ha’ done it, indeed, if I had remembered it,’ added Mr. Weller, ‘for it’s a rum sort o’ thing, Sammy, to go a-hankerin’ arter anybody’s property, ven you’re assistin’ ‘em in illness.
1	'Then, mind what I told you,' said the matron: 'and be careful to say as little as you can, or you'll betray us at once.'
1	The courts are all shut up; the public offices lie in a hot sleep.
1	Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr. Jaggers is another.
1	It was not very long before, in the midst of the dismal house so wide and dreary, her low voice in the twilight, slowly and stopping sometimes, touched the old air to which he had so often listened, with his drooping head upon her arm.
1	Almost immediately afterwards, Master Percy Crummles entered with a letter, which had arrived by the General Post, and was directed to his gracious mother; at sight of the superscription whereof, Mrs. Crummles exclaimed, ‘From Henrietta Petowker, I do declare!’ and instantly became absorbed in the contents.
1	But, Mrs. Heep gave him little trouble; for she not only returned with the deed, but with the box in which it was, where we found a banker’s book and some other papers that were afterwards serviceable.
1	But I'll swear it was a name of two syllables.” “Indeed?” “Yes.
1	Miss Twinkleton’s establishment was about to undergo a serene hush.
1	‘I told you, you rare charmer, you sweet witch, that you must stay and hear me, or do more harm than can ever be undone.
1	I know how you come away from London in your own clothes, and where you changed your clothes, and hid your clothes.
1	It's not that I don't or I won't.
1	At length what remains of the last candle is blown out, and daylight looks into the room.
1	Seeing him still on the threshold, more out of the house than in it, as if he had no love for darkness and no desire to probe its mysteries, she flew into the next street, and sent a message into the tavern to Mr Flintwinch, who came out directly.
1	If a lady stains her honour, she has only need to swallow one cake and she's cured at once--for it's poison.
1	"Why, you'll tell me I'm my own mother next," says Mr. Bucket.
1	They would kill me; they would; I know they would.’ ‘You will do better, poor fellow,’ replied Nicholas, shaking his head mournfully, ‘when I am gone.’ ‘Gone!’ cried the other, looking intently in his face.
1	HE knew how to take advantage of the ground, and where to put the hedge between them, and where the wall, and when to duck, and when to drop, and had a thousand arts beyond the doomed Bradley’s slow conception.
1	When I think of myself, it’s as her old servant, and one that loved her dearly, as his kind, good, gentle mistress; and who would have gone--yes, and still would go--through any harm to serve her.
1	Even now, nothing is changed but our own room below-stairs that you have just left.
1	A porochial 'prentis, who is at present a dead-weight; a millstone, as I may say, round the porochial throat?
1	It will be heard of, one day.
1	She merely speaks of stock-in-trade.
1	Leave him to his action on it.’ She did not shrink under his evil leer, or avoid it.
1	'She has pretty well settled that, in her own mind, already.'
1	There was a third young man on the box who wished to be learned in cattle; and an old one behind, who was familiar with farming.
1	IT was falling dark when Stephen came out of Mr. Bounderby’s house.
1	She does it with all her heart and soul.
1	‘But not his daughter?’ said Clennam.
1	But one man was killed on the same occasion; and from the very window whence he received his death, the very flag which shielded his murderer (not only in the commission of his crime, but from its consequences), was displayed again on the occasion of the public ceremony performed by the Governor General, to which I have just adverted.
1	I say, Mr. Pip!” calling me back, and speaking low.
1	Society had said ‘Let us license them; let us know them.’ Mr Merdle was immensely rich; a man of prodigious enterprise; a Midas without the ears, who turned all he touched to gold.
1	the poor Gaspard!” With a sigh of great compassion.
1	‘I think your father will admit it to be documentary proof of what I tell him.
1	But it's not Phil Barker's time,' said the Jew, looking up.
1	‘Pray do not make me the subject of any bets.
1	“Who are you?” said the new tenant, turning very pale; poising the poker in his hand, however, and taking a very decent aim at the countenance of the figure.
1	The dew seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves; the air to rustle among them with a sweeter music; and the sky itself to look more blue and bright.
1	"My dear sir," said the other, shaking hands with him.
1	On the other hand, the Right Honourable William Buffy, M.P., contends across the table with some one else that the shipwreck of the country--about which there is no doubt; it is only the manner of it that is in question--is attributable to Cuffy.
1	Do you know, or do you not know, that the law of England supposes every man to be innocent, until he is proved--proved--to be guilty?” “Sir,” Mr. Wopsle began to reply, “as an Englishman myself, I--” “Come!” said the stranger, biting his forefinger at him.
1	‘It was a wilderness to me once.
1	I had never known him to pass the garden-gate before, but on this occasion he came into the house.
1	What doth your friend thay?
1	As they passed Mr. Pickwick, he could hear the female sob bitterly; and once she burst into such a passion of grief, that she was compelled to lean against the wall for support, while the man took the child in his arms, and tried to soothe her.
1	Then, I saw him wait for her and meet her.
1	My husband and I have exchanged some remarks upon the subject, when we have observed with pain that you have not been easy with us.’ ‘Easy?
1	That it would be received as a great honour and distinction, Paul, I need not say.’ ‘Louisa,’ said Mr Dombey, after a short pause, ‘it is not to be supposed--’ ‘Certainly not,’ cried Mrs Chick, hastening to anticipate a refusal, ‘I never thought it was.’ Mr Dombey looked at her impatiently.
1	Miss Nipper threw away the scabbard the first morning she arose in Mrs Pipchin’s house.
1	The sympathising tone in which he spoke, was quite sincere; she was sure of that.
1	One or two late birds sleepily chirping in their nests, and a bat heavily crossing and recrossing her, and the reek of her own tread in the thick dust that felt like velvet, were all Mrs. Sparsit heard or saw until she very softly closed a gate.
1	‘We are very much obliged to you, ma’am,’ said Nell, ‘and thankfully accept your offer.’ ‘And you’ll never be sorry for it,’ returned Mrs Jarley.
1	It looked a very fresh, free life, by daylight: still fresher, and more free, by sunlight.
1	‘I was chivied through the streets, Sir, when I went there, and pounded when I got there.
1	And you are always in my thoughts now.
1	Don’t I dote upon you, Misses Brown?’ ‘Do you, sweet Rob?
1	‘What do you think I see in this very arbour last night?’ inquired the boy.
1	Concert, assembly, opera, theatre, drive, nothing is new to my Lady under the worn-out heavens.
1	This done, Mr. Vincent Crummles returned thanks, and that done, the African Swallower proposed Mrs. Vincent Crummles, in affecting terms.
1	And even if you exchanged blankets for the child--or books and firing--it would be impossible to prevent their being turned into liquor.’ Accordingly, it was resolved that Mr and Mrs Milvey should search for an orphan likely to suit, and as free as possible from the foregoing objections, and should communicate again with Mrs Boffin.
1	She knew he didn’t mean to be unkind; but Mary Ann was very far from strong, and, if he didn’t take care, he might lose her when he least expected it, which would be a very dreadful reflection for him afterwards; and so on.
1	She was more than human to me.
1	‘I know you thought so.
1	Thus whispering, they both go in together.
1	_Will_ you advise me, my sweet child?’ Even Amy smiled at this notion, but she said, ‘I will, Fanny, as well as I can.’ ‘Thank you, dearest Amy,’ returned Fanny, kissing her.
1	His property in money amounted to nearly three thousand pounds.
1	Now the tongue--now the pigeon pie.
1	It amazed us when we began to sort his letters and to answer some of them for him in the growlery of a morning to find how the great object of the lives of nearly all his correspondents appeared to be to form themselves into committees for getting in and laying out money.
1	This is the Annual Register, Wegg, in a cab-full of wollumes.
1	‘I beg you to excuse me.
1	Five were to be tried together, next, as enemies of the Republic, forasmuch as they had not assisted it by word or deed.
1	‘Satisfaction, I mean,’ returned the Grinder.
1	He wishes to see the fine world--the King, the Queen, and Court; let him see them on Sunday.” “What?” exclaimed the hungry man, staring.
1	At length, in course of time, Maggy began to take pains to improve herself, and to be very attentive and very industrious; and by degrees was allowed to come in and out as often as she liked, and got enough to do to support herself, and does support herself.
1	‘Sam, be quiet,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	The carriages are once more at the church door.
1	Thus it is, that it often attains its most luxuriant growth in separation and under circumstances of the utmost difficulty; and thus it was, that Nicholas, thinking of nothing but the unknown young lady, from day to day and from hour to hour, began, at last, to think that he was very desperately in love with her, and that never was such an ill-used and persecuted lover as he.
1	As the young lady brushed past, she dropped one of her gloves into my uncle’s hand, and softly whispered, with her lips so close to his face that he felt her warm breath on his nose, the single word “Help!”  Gentlemen, my uncle leaped out of the coach at once, with such violence that it rocked on the springs again.
1	Mr. Serjeant Snubbins was a lantern-faced, sallow-complexioned man, of about five-and-forty, or--as the novels say--he might be fifty.
1	“I should think it was a strong point,” said Herbert, “and I should think you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger; as to the rest, you must bide your guardian's time, and he must bide his client's time.
1	Deportment Richard left us on the very next evening to begin his new career, and committed Ada to my charge with great love for her and great trust in me.
1	‘It’s a failure so far, but I’ll stay behind, and take another touch at Mr Riah.’ ‘Do not deceive yourself Mr Twemlow,’ said the Jew, then addressing him directly for the first time.
1	Not a whit less reticent and wooden was Mr Flintwinch outwardly, than in the usual course of things: the only perceptible difference in him being that the knot of cravat which was generally under his ear, had worked round to the back of his head: where it formed an ornamental appendage not unlike a bagwig, and gave him something of a courtly appearance.
1	I didn’t like his eye.
1	I struck a blow that laid your lofty master in the dust, and set you there, before me, looking at me now, and knowing what I mean.’ He sprung up from his chair with a great oath.
1	If not, where was the man, and why did he not come back?’ Where was the man, and why did he not come back?
1	'If he was coming here, he'd have come with the dog,' said Kags, stooping down to examine the animal, who lay panting on the floor.
1	She was audaciously prejudiced in my favour, and quite unable to understand why I should have any misgivings, or be low-spirited about it.
1	What will I not promise to my Love?” What, indeed, with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the cheek, and his other hand against the heart that beat for him!
1	The chariot is at the door; the Bride is descending to the hall, where Mr Dombey waits for her.
1	He will immediately take care that one of my people releases your Uncle from his present position, by paying the amount at issue; and that such arrangements are made for its repayment as may be consistent with your Uncle’s circumstances.
1	There was even the later addition of a conservatory sheltering itself against it, uncertain of hue in its deep-stained glass, and in its more transparent portions flashing to the sun’s rays, now like fire and now like harmless water drops; which might have stood for Tattycoram.
1	“I am quite glad you are at home; for these hurries and forebodings by which I have been surrounded all day long, have made me nervous without reason.
1	Its effect upon young Barnacle was to make him repeat in a defenceless way, ‘Look here!
1	'There is no other,' said the doctor.
1	At one of the theatre doors, there was a little girl with a mother, looking for a way across the street through the mud.
1	‘Well,’ said Lord Frederick, sipping his first glass of port, ‘if this is a discounting dinner, all I have to say is, deyvle take me, if it wouldn’t be a good pla-an to get discount every day.’ ‘You’ll have plenty of it, in your time,’ returned Sir Mulberry Hawk; ‘Nickleby will tell you that.’ ‘What do you say, Nickleby?’ inquired the young man; ‘am I to be a good customer?’ ‘It depends entirely on circumstances, my lord,’ replied Ralph.
1	‘Ay!’ said Mr. Kenwigs, as though he pitied him from his heart, ‘then you don’t know what she’s capable of.’ All this time there had been a great whisking in and out of the other room; the door had been opened and shut very softly about twenty times a minute (for it was necessary to keep Mrs. Kenwigs quiet); and the baby had been exhibited to a score or two of deputations from a select body of female friends, who had assembled in the passage, and about the street-door, to discuss the event in all its bearings.
1	Newman gave a nod, put it in his hat, and was shuffling away, when Gride, whose doting delight knew no bounds, beckoned him back again, and said, in a shrill whisper, and with a grin which puckered up his whole face, and almost obscured his eyes: ‘Will you--will you take a little drop of something--just a taste?’ In good fellowship (if Arthur Gride had been capable of it) Newman would not have drunk with him one bubble of the richest wine that was ever made; but to see what he would be at, and to punish him as much as he could, he accepted the offer immediately.
1	He said, ‘Tom Pythick.’ I asked him who was Tom Pythick?
1	‘Give me your hand, my worthy friend,’ said Mr. Gregsbury.
1	I’m here before him, though, so I don’t mind.’ Comforting himself with this reflection, Mr. Lowten extracted the plug from the door-key; having opened the door, replugged and repocketed his Bramah, and picked up the letters which the postman had dropped through the box, he ushered Mr. Pickwick into the office.
1	The Spider, as Mr. Jaggers had called him, was used to lying in wait, however, and had the patience of his tribe.
1	I see myself, with Agnes at my side, journeying along the road of life.
1	‘Who is Slumkey?’ whispered Mr. Tupman.
1	And if I ever do leave this place, Sam,’ added Mr. Pickwick, with assumed cheerfulness--‘if I do, I pledge you my word that you shall return to me instantly.’ ‘Now I’ll tell you wot it is, Sir,’ said Mr. Weller, in a grave and solemn voice.
1	At an early hour, but not before Uncle Sol and Walter had questioned each other at some length about their voyages and dangers, they all, except Walter, vacated Florence’s room, and went down to the parlour.
1	As Mr. Pickwick bowed, he took his spectacles from his waistcoat pocket, and put them on; a process which he had no sooner gone through, than, uttering an exclamation of surprise, Mr. Pickwick retreated several paces, and the lady, with a half-suppressed scream, hid her face in her hands, and dropped into a chair; whereupon Mr. Peter Magnus was stricken motionless on the spot, and gazed from one to the other, with a countenance expressive of the extremities of horror and surprise.
1	He broke her heart.’ Agnes leaned upon his shoulder, and stole her arm about his neck.
1	‘You had better get your wind now and change your clothes.’ Having addressed these words to the combatants, he saluted Nicholas, who then observed that the face of Mr. Crummles was quite proportionate in size to his body; that he had a very full under-lip, a hoarse voice, as though he were in the habit of shouting very much, and very short black hair, shaved off nearly to the crown of his head--to admit (as he afterwards learnt) of his more easily wearing character wigs of any shape or pattern.
1	It was a ghastly figure to look upon.
1	Scrooge sat with his door wide open, that he might see him come into the Tank.
1	I played the game to an end with Estella, and she beggared me.
1	The noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs, a few minutes after the occurrence of this conversation, roused the merry old gentleman as he sat over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his hand; a pocket-knife in his right; and a pewter pot on the trivet.
1	Florence drooped her head, and rose, and put up her work-basket Edith drew her hand through her arm, and they went out of the room like sisters.
1	Certainly not so many.” “Twice?” “Jaggers,” interposed Miss Havisham, much to my relief, “leave my Pip alone, and go with him to your dinner.” He complied, and we groped our way down the dark stairs together.
1	So what," continued Richard, confident again by this time, "do I naturally turn my thoughts to?"
1	I made an exception of you at first.
1	That thought I never had.
1	Doctor Crocus looks round upon the crowd to observe the effect he produces, rubs his hands, and says, in a very loud voice: ‘Not yet awhile, sir, not yet.
1	A part of the bone     came out.
1	‘Wery careful that he ain’t led avay, in a innocent moment, to say anythin’ as may lead to a conwiction for breach.
1	Just as the clock struck three, there was blown into the crescent a sedan-chair with Mrs. Dowler inside, borne by one short, fat chairman, and one long, thin one, who had had much ado to keep their bodies perpendicular: to say nothing of the chair.
1	A gloomy person with tangled locks, and a general air of having been reared under the shadow of that baleful tree of Java which has given shelter to more lies than the whole botanical kingdom, Mr. Grewgious, nevertheless, treated him with unaccountable consideration.
1	‘That’s the point,’ said his sister.
1	"Ada, my dear," said Mr. Jarndyce, recovering his cheerfulness, "these are strong words of advice, but I live in Bleak House and have seen a sight here.
1	Mr Brass, struck with the humour of this jest, and carrying out its spirit to the utmost, sought from his wide connection a pair of friends whose joint possessions fell some halfpence short of fifteen pence, and proffered them as bail--for that was the merry word agreed upon both sides.
1	I fear he is not to be reclaimed; there is scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable now.
1	It was a scene of gaiety, glitter, and show; of richly-dressed people, handsome mirrors, chalked floors, girandoles and wax-candles; and in all parts of the scene, gliding from spot to spot in silent softness, bowing obsequiously to this party, nodding familiarly to that, and smiling complacently on all, was the sprucely-attired person of Angelo Cyrus Bantam, Esquire, the Master of the Ceremonies.
1	I believe your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken, the ties between me and my other and far dearer self.
1	‘Wait a minute,’ said the stranger, ‘fun presently--nobs not come yet-- queer place--dockyard people of upper rank don’t know dockyard people of lower rank--dockyard people of lower rank don’t know small gentry--small gentry don’t know tradespeople--commissioner don’t know anybody.’ ‘Who’s that little boy with the light hair and pink eyes, in a fancy dress?’ inquired Mr. Tupman.
1	"Captain Swosser of the Royal Navy, who was Mrs. Badger's first husband, was a very distinguished officer indeed.
1	‘I ain’t doing any harm here, am I?’ Arthur Gride in reply repeated the word ‘bell’ as loud as he could roar; and, his meaning being rendered further intelligible to Mrs. Sliderskew’s dull sense of hearing by pantomime expressive of ringing at a street-door, Peg hobbled out, after sharply demanding why he hadn’t said there was a ring before, instead of talking about all manner of things that had nothing to do with it, and keeping her half-pint of beer waiting on the steps.
1	No Poetry and no Art ever charmed the imagination more than the union of the two in this counterfeit cottage charmed Mrs Plornish.
1	These provisions laid in, we went on through a great noise and uproar that confused my weary head beyond description, and over a bridge which, no doubt, was London Bridge (indeed I think he told me so, but I was half asleep), until we came to the poor person’s house, which was a part of some alms-houses, as I knew by their look, and by an inscription on a stone over the gate which said they were established for twenty-five poor women.
1	It was quite enough, she said, that she had told me Agnes was going to be married; and that I now knew better than anyone how true it was.
1	He had been at his books when I had found myself staring at him, and I now saw that he was inky.
1	But it was pleasant cookery too.
1	I came to tell you.
1	‘Why, what do you call yourselves?
1	The girl must know, well, that if she shook him off, she could never be safe from his fury, and that it would be surely wreaked--to the maiming of limbs, or perhaps the loss of life--on the object of her more recent fancy.
1	Now, I appeal to every human mind, imbued with the commonest of common sense, and the commonest of common humanity; to all dispassionate, reasoning creatures, of any shade of opinion; and ask, with these revolting evidences of the state of society which exists in and about the slave districts of America before them, can they have a doubt of the real condition of the slave, or can they for a moment make a compromise between the institution or any of its flagrant, fearful features, and their own just consciences?
1	He was a mighty monarch.
1	‘There was a time,’ said Mr Casby, ‘when your parents and myself were not on friendly terms.
1	You dined over the way.
1	But nothing more was found.
1	"I wonder you don't go into Parliament."
1	And now the worthy Mrs Wilfer, having used her youngest daughter as a lay-figure for the edification of these Boffins, became bland to her, and proceeded to develop her last instance of force of character, which was still in reserve.
1	Accordingly, these steps are taken; and now the trooper, in his rounds, has the house to himself.
1	‘At least they were eating one another, which looked like it.’ ‘Tormentor!’ returns the dear young creature.
1	'Have you anything to ask this witness, boy?'
1	Deeply sorry for you.’ ‘And I for you, poor boy!
1	Then the thought must have come upon him, poor, poor father!
1	On a fine, mild autumn day, when all was tranquil and at peace: when the soft sweet air crept in at the open window of the quiet room, and not a sound was heard but the gentle rustling of the leaves: Nicholas sat in his old place by the bedside, and knew that the time was nearly come.
1	Kate would take this reproof very quietly, and Mrs. Nickleby, making every board creak and every thread rustle as she moved stealthily about, would add: ‘My son Nicholas has just come home, and I have come, according to custom, my dear, to know, from your own lips, exactly how you are; for he won’t take my account, and never will.’ ‘He is later than usual to-night,’ perhaps Madeline would reply.
1	She listened to her father as he told her about me, with a pleasant face; and when he had concluded, proposed to my aunt that we should go upstairs and see my room.
1	I fancied she was dreaming of him when I kissed her cheek after she had slept an hour and saw how tranquil and happy she looked.
1	‘You have the soul of a gentleman, and I know I may trust you.
1	You were to abolish military force, but you were first to bring all commanding officers who had done their duty, to trial by court-martial for that offence, and shoot them.
1	One Sunday when Joe, greatly enjoying his pipe, had so plumed himself on being “most awful dull,” that I had given him up for the day, I lay on the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand, descrying traces of Miss Havisham and Estella all over the prospect, in the sky and in the water, until at last I resolved to mention a thought concerning them that had been much in my head.
1	The worm _will_, when—’ But here, Mr. Crisparkle interposed, remonstrating aside, in a friendly voice: ‘Joe, Joe, Joe!
1	Captain Cuttle, having joined in all the amens and responses, with a devout growl, feels much improved by his religious exercises; and in a peaceful frame of mind pervades the body of the church, glazed hat in hand, and reads the tablet to the memory of little Paul.
1	‘They’re not used to see this sort of thing, every day, I dare say.’ ‘Possibly,’ replied Mr. Pickwick.
1	Don’t hide, you know; that’s mean.
1	It was quite unmindful, and sat thinking.
1	He looked to the right and to the left, uncertain whither to fly.
1	It may be that Kit has caressed the pony enough; it may be that there are even better things to caress than ponies.
1	The favour that I have to ask is, simply--but it really does seem so exceedingly singular, that I should be in the last degree obliged to my friend Gay if he would have the goodness to break the--in point of fact, the ice,’ said Cousin Feenix.
1	‘Sit down again, Young John.’ ‘Thank you, sir--but I’d rather stand.’ Mr Dorrit sat down instead.
1	‘It’s the sweet creetur grow’d a woman!’ Captain Cuttle was so respectful of her, and had such a reverence for her, in this new character, that he would not have held her in his arms, while she was unconscious, for a thousand pounds.
1	‘I have nothing very particular to do to-day,’ adds Podsnap, ‘and I’ll mix with some influential people.
1	Thus it came to pass, that even among those rigid and absorbed young anchorites, who mortified themselves beneath the roof of Doctor Blimber, Paul was an object of general interest; a fragile little plaything that they all liked, and that no one would have thought of treating roughly.
1	Bucket observing to Mr. Snagsby as they go on again that he looks a little poorly, Mr. Snagsby answers that he feels as if he couldn't breathe the dreadful air.
1	‘Fight for it, Neville!’ ‘If I were dying, I feel as if a word from you would rally me; if my pulse had stopped, I feel as if your touch would make it beat again,’ said Neville.
1	Could he ever forget how that woman had wept over his pillow, and called him her own child!
1	Do you know him?’ ‘The book’s name, sir?’ inquired Silas.
1	And yet he was asleep.
1	It is a good and happy sleep--eh?’ ‘Indeed it is,’ returned the bachelor.
1	‘And be sure you treat this lovely woman with everything of the best.’ While they were going along to take boat, ‘Don’t you wish, my dear,’ said R. W., timidly, ‘that your mother was here?’ ‘No, I don’t, Pa, for I like to have you all to myself to-day.
1	Why, I spend half my life now, pretty well, loitering and dodging about his door.
1	I haven't any sister, or father and mother either.
1	But he still protected his brother according to his long usage; and would say with some complacency, fifty times a day, when he saw him standing by his bed, ‘My good Frederick, sit down.
1	‘Very well, my dear Sir, very well,’ replied Perker, ‘I can only say that if you expect either Dodson or Fogg to exhibit any symptom of shame or confusion at having to look you, or anybody else, in the face, you are the most sanguine man in your expectations that I ever met with.
1	Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side of the door, and shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him or her a Merry Christmas.
1	Do you see that?’ ‘Everybody must see that,’ replied Squeers, half imitating the sneer with which the old gentleman was regarding his unconscious relative.
1	he might have even gone so far as to reply, "The head of Coavinses!"
1	‘What is it, Young John?’ ‘A letter for you, sir, being left in the Lodge just this minute, and a message with it, I thought, happening to be there myself, sir, I would bring it to your room.’ The speaker’s attention was much distracted by the piteous spectacle of Little Dorrit at her father’s feet, with her head turned away.
1	Mr. Lorry was there, and Doctor Manette was there.
1	We are together to talk it over.
1	To this Gowan had no objection.
1	I wish you'd lend me half a crown.
1	“There's power here,” said Mr. Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinews with his forefinger.
1	said Mr. Jarndyce to Ada.
1	Knows that there’s nothing on earth I wouldn’t do for Miss Dombey.
1	For from the first shades of dusk till the earliest light of morning, it still stands motionless in the same place, listening to the music of my iron chain, and watching my gambols on my straw bed.’ At the end of the manuscript was written, in another hand, this note:-- [The unhappy man whose ravings are recorded above, was a melancholy instance of the baneful results of energies misdirected in early life, and excesses prolonged until their consequences could never be repaired.
1	It may, at first sight, be matter of surprise to the thoughtless few that Mr Brass, being a professional gentleman, should not have legally indicted some party or parties, active in the promotion of the nuisance, but they will be good enough to remember, that as Doctors seldom take their own prescriptions, and Divines do not always practise what they preach, so lawyers are shy of meddling with the Law on their own account: knowing it to be an edged tool of uncertain application, very expensive in the working, and rather remarkable for its properties of close shaving, than for its always shaving the right person.
1	He returns rubbing his chin, and rubs it a good deal in the course of the evening.
1	I am the family, ma’am--at least, I believe I am the only relation they have, and I think it right that you should know I can’t support them in their extravagances.
1	"Guardian," said I, "I am already certain, I can no more be changed in that conviction than you can be changed towards me.
1	‘I know it very well, and when I claim the money you shall share it.’ The honest man paused, and drew a little nearer to the visitor, and a little further from the door.
1	As their freedom from all further apprehension, however, left no pretext for his insisting on mounting guard, he was obliged to abandon the citadel, and to retire with the trusty Tim.
1	In which state of agitation, Mr Merdle, evasively rolling his eyes round the Chief Butler’s shoes without raising them to the index of that stupendous creature’s thoughts, had signified to him his intention of giving a special dinner: not a very large dinner, but a very special dinner.
1	Barnet, to say the truth, appeared to entertain an opposite sentiment on the subject, and on such occasions frequently expressed himself audibly, though indefinitely, in reference to ‘a parcel of girls.’ As it was not easy to ruffle her sweet temper, however, Florence generally reconciled the young gentleman to his fate after a few minutes, and they strolled on amicably: Lady Skettles and Sir Barnet following, in a state of perfect complacency and high gratification.
1	Besides these, there was a roving-looking person in a rough great-coat, who strode up and down in front of the lamps, flourishing a dress cane, and rattling away, in an undertone, with great vivacity for the amusement of an ideal audience.
1	That it was not for me, then resting for the first time on my mother's bosom, to take her to account for having given me life, but that my duty was to bless her and receive her, though the whole world turned from her, and that I only asked her leave to do it.
1	You were useful; not too honest, not too delicate, not too nice of hand or heart; but useful.’ ‘Useful, indeed!’ said the man.
1	It was not a bosom to repose upon, but it was a capital bosom to hang jewels upon.
1	My whole existence is bound up in my sweetest Edith; and to see her change from day to day--my beautiful pet, who has positively garnered up her heart since the death of that most delightful creature, Granger--is the most affecting thing in the world.’ Mrs Skewton’s world was not a very trying one, if one might judge of it by the influence of its most affecting circumstance upon her; but this by the way.
1	It was the elder who replied, 'Since about this hour last night.'
1	"He is a kind friend to you, for he is going to give you lodging room here."
1	He said he certainly could have wished to have continued to hold the appointment he had just resigned.
1	We left Venice before Mr and Mrs Gowan did, but they were not so long upon the road as we were, and did not travel by the same way, and so when we arrived we found them in a lodging here, in a place called the Via Gregoriana.
1	Let’s believe so!’ ‘With all my heart,’ replied the good old man.
1	‘I was born in a ditch, and my mother ran away from me.
1	And I didn’t four seven one.
1	In this state of things, Arthur Gride was appealed to.
1	I am not going to sit here, a member of this family, to be taken no notice of.
1	Send me as much of that as you can.’ ‘So I will, Uncle: I have enough and to spare, and I’ll not be chary of it!
1	In the first outcry, young Piper dashed off for the fire-engines and returned in triumph at a jolting gallop perched up aloft on the Phoenix and holding on to that fabulous creature with all his might in the midst of helmets and torches.
1	‘The servant,’ pursued Ham, ‘was seen along with--our poor girl--last night.
1	Never had master a more anxious, humble, docile pupil.
1	"These are things I never talk about or even think about, excepting in the growlery here.
1	‘Oh, they have,’ replied Mr. Tupman, not exactly making the sort of reply that was expected from him.
1	‘Well, I don’t know, mother; not much to boast on.
1	It is not possible to know how far the influence of any amiable honest-hearted duty-doing man flies out into the world; but it is very possible to know how it has touched one's self in going by, and I know right well that any good that intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented Joe, and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me.
1	Oo him?’ asked Mrs Plornish.
1	The weather being dark, and piercing cold, he had no great temptation to loiter.
1	An old acquaintance of mine, long ago!’ Mr Plornish did not see his road to any comment on this fact, and made none.
1	Mr Twemlow takes his station on a settee before her, and Mrs Lammle shows him a portrait.
1	As he wouldn't go away, and shocked the company very much, our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a pint of oatmeal.
1	My head may be clearer when I am free of it, and I may then agree with what you say to-day.
1	‘I should say he must have pocketed a good deal, in one way or other.
1	‘I see ‘em together, T’otherest Governor, on the very day when Gaffer was towed ashore.’ Bradley could have hidden a reserved piece of information from the sharp eyes of a whole inquisitive class, but he could not veil from the eyes of the ignorant Riderhood the withheld question next in his breast.
1	Miss Tox sat down upon the window-seat, and thought of her good Papa deceased--Mr Tox, of the Customs Department of the public service; and of her childhood, passed at a seaport, among a considerable quantity of cold tar, and some rusticity.
1	‘Yes, I am quite tired out.’ ‘You have been so hurried and disturbed to-day.
1	The old feeling was roused by what she said, into a stronger and fiercer existence than it had ever had.
1	I don't deny that she do throw us back-falls, and that she do drop down upon us heavy.
1	You may say Mr. Noggs there, for I was a gentleman then.
1	He admits that he was alone on the scene of the murder within a few minutes of its commission.
1	However, as he thought his court-suit necessary to the occasion, it was not for me to tell him that he looked far better in his working-dress; the rather, because I knew he made himself so dreadfully uncomfortable, entirely on my account, and that it was for me he pulled up his shirt-collar so very high behind, that it made the hair on the crown of his head stand up like a tuft of feathers.
1	Such of her late friends and companions as were yet remaining at the villa, came running from within, and from the garden, to say good-bye.
1	That’s everything!’ ‘She is ready, is she?’ said Ralph.
1	I wish you’d confess how much you really did make out of my late governor.
1	‘This is the way indeed to be Dombey and Son, and have money.
1	These are the real feelings that I had.
1	‘At all events, Tom kicked the very tall man out at the front door half an hour later, and married the widow a month after.
1	After some pause, a door of communication with another room was opened, and a lady entered.
1	‘You dislike the mention of it.’ ‘Dislike the mention of it?’ answered the old woman.
1	Something of the softened sadness with which she loved the memory of little Paul, or of her mother, seemed to enter now into her thoughts of him, and to make them, as it were, a dear remembrance.
1	'Very much, indeed, if you'll teach me, sir,' replied Oliver.
1	At length the quarters of the little Midshipman arose in view.
1	"As I know by experience that it's not disagreeable to Miss Flite, and since it's equally agreeable to yourself--" and finishes the sentence by putting it between his lips again.
1	‘With submission, my soul,’ pleaded Mr Sparkler.
1	Because when Tom Gradgrind, with his new lights, tells me that what I say is unreasonable, I am convinced at once it must be devilish sensible.
1	Let whomsoever it most concerned look well to it!
1	In that room, the housekeeper wrapped in a blanket was fast asleep in an easy chair before the fire.
1	‘Let me see--peculiar resources of this establishment--new and splendid scenery--you must manage to introduce a real pump and two washing-tubs.’ ‘Into the piece?’ said Nicholas.
1	"Do you mean your husband?"
1	After sitting silent in the carriage watching Edith for some time, she took her hand and kissed it passionately.
1	She heeded no more what they said, than if she had had no ears.
1	“I know it well,” answered Carton.
1	I am sure there ought to be no third party present at anything so very kind and so very serious; and so, if you’ll remove the third party upstairs, my dear, the third party will retire.’ Lizzie took the hand which the dolls’ dressmaker held out to her for the purpose of being supported away, but only looked at her with an inquiring smile, and made no other movement.
1	‘But I DOUBT, Frank,’ Mrs Milvey hinted, after a little hesitation, ‘if Mrs Boffin wants an orphan QUITE nineteen, who drives a cart and waters the roads.’ Mr Milvey referred the point to Mrs Boffin in a look; on that smiling lady’s shaking her black velvet bonnet and bows, he remarked, in lower spirits, ‘that’s true again.’ ‘I am sure,’ said Mrs Boffin, concerned at giving so much trouble, ‘that if I had known you would have taken so much pains, sir--and you too, ma’ am--I don’t think I would have come.’ ‘PRAY don’t say that!’ urged Mrs Milvey.
1	Suppose you were to go down into the old part of the country again, for instance, and see that--that out-of-the-way woman with the savagest of names,’ said my aunt, rubbing her nose, for she could never thoroughly forgive Peggotty for being so called.
1	‘Bella, dear, advise me.’ Upon this, Emily and Mr. Snodgrass, and Arabella and Mary, crowded into a corner, and conversed earnestly in whispers for some minutes, during which the fat boy dozed.
1	'And what have I heard!
1	Young John locked his door for him as they went out, slided the key into his pocket with great dexterity, and led the way to his own residence.
1	I went to Garden Court to find you; not finding you, I went to Clarriker's to find Mr. Herbert.” “And him you found?” said I, with great anxiety.
1	When that was done, the basket, which was filled with grapes and other fruit, was unpacked, and all its contents were quietly put away.
1	It is so cold, so dark, my senses are so benumbed, and the gloom upon me is so dreadful.
1	‘Wa’et be the matther noo?
1	"You are fettered," said Scrooge, trembling.
1	‘You know what a horse is.’ She curtseyed again, and would have blushed deeper, if she could have blushed deeper than she had blushed all this time.
1	'I am the infamous creature you have heard of, that lives among the thieves, and that never from the first moment I can recollect my eyes and senses opening on London streets have known any better life, or kinder words than they have given me, so help me God!
1	‘Confound the girl, I am half afraid of her.
1	Poor pretence as it is, these allusions to her being expected keep up hope within him.
1	After some scraping of his chin with his hand, he went on to say, with his eyes cast downward--still scraping, very slowly: ‘When I was but an umble clerk, she always looked down upon me.
1	Sunbury was passed through, and they came again into the lonely road.
1	They did not disturb him then, but kept a watch upon him all that day.
1	Though I could almost have consigned her to the mercies of the wind on the topmost pinnacle of the Cathedral, without remorse, I made a virtue of necessity, and gave her a friendly salutation.
1	Am I a nasty, cruel, selfish, bad mama?
1	Monsieur Rigaud, as I expected yesterday, the President will look for the pleasure of your society at an hour after mid-day, to-day.’ ‘To try me, eh?’ said Rigaud, pausing, knife in hand and morsel in mouth.
1	Nor even Mr Inspector, as having been trepanned into an industrious hunt on a false scent.
1	I had reached my own gate, and was standing listening for the deep bell of St. Paul’s, the sound of which I thought had been borne towards me among the multitude of striking clocks, when I was rather surprised to see that the door of my aunt’s cottage was open, and that a faint light in the entry was shining out across the road.
1	But, profound gravity sat enthroned on Wegg’s countenance.
1	I never saw, in any painting or reality, horror and compassion so impressively blended.
1	At least, don’t do it to me.
1	Although it was yet but the middle of March, the weather in this southern temperature was extremely warm; the peech-trees and magnolias were in full bloom; and the trees were green.
1	It's quite enough that we let 'em have live bodies.
1	how the long-forgotten thoughts of former days rushed upon his mind, as he almost ran up and down the narrow yard--as if intelligence would arrive the sooner for his hurrying--and how bitterly a sense of his helplessness and desolation rushed upon him, when he heard the truth!
1	A stage or two further on, the lamps were lighted, and a great to-do occasioned by the taking up, at a roadside inn, of a very fastidious lady with an infinite variety of cloaks and small parcels, who loudly lamented, for the behoof of the outsides, the non-arrival of her own carriage which was to have taken her on, and made the guard solemnly promise to stop every green chariot he saw coming; which, as it was a dark night and he was sitting with his face the other way, that officer undertook, with many fervent asseverations, to do.
1	Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it.
1	I never was so ashamed in my life to hear a man talk folly as I have been to hear you talk this day to the present company.
1	It may be objected that they are not adapted to the daylight, but everybody knows that they would glitter if there were lamps; and nothing can be clearer than that if people give fancy-balls in the day-time, and the dresses do not show quite as well as they would by night, the fault lies solely with the people who give the fancy-balls, and is in no wise chargeable on the spangles.
1	I’d carve her name as often as she liked.’ ‘I am afraid you are mercenary, Tom.’ ‘Mercenary,’ repeated Tom.
1	That's my life pretty much, down to such times as I got shipped off, arter Pip stood my friend.
1	And London looks so large, so barren, and so wild.’ In Little Dorrit’s eyes, its vastness under the black sky was awful; a tremor passed over her as she said the words.
1	Now, breaking the unnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the head of the king--and now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned widowhood and misery, to turn it grey.
1	Five days, six days, seven days, eight days, nine days.
1	So much the more did Florence feel the greatness of the alteration in him; so much the oftener did she weep at this estrangement of her brother.
1	'So you did,' observed Brittles, in a low voice.
1	It's bad enough to be a blacksmith's wife (and him a Gargery) without being your mother.” My thoughts strayed from that question as I looked disconsolately at the fire.
1	Some have been there so long, that they are mere dry, grizzly skeletons.
1	‘I thought it might be agreeable, my dear,’ said Mr. Omer.
1	"Mr. Tulkinghorn," says Sir Leicester, "is always welcome here and always discreet wheresoever he is.
1	'A gentleman we met on the road, coming up from the country, recommended us here,' said Noah, nudging Charlotte, perhaps to call her attention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect, and perhaps to warn her to betray no surprise.
1	But, the charm was broken.
1	The Washington Monument, which is a handsome pillar with a statue on its summit; the Medical College; and the Battle Monument in memory of an engagement with the British at North Point; are the most conspicuous among them.
1	Here I stand, with the contamination of a jail upon me; but it is possible that you may think me better suited to her than her former husband was.’ He had a certain air of being a handsome man--which he was not; and a certain air of being a well-bred man--which he was not.
1	These various arrangements completed, she took out her old needle-case to make him a curtain for his window; and thus, with a quiet reigning in the room, that seemed to diffuse itself through the else noisy prison, he found himself composed in his chair, with Little Dorrit working at his side.
1	Knowing very well that the mystery with which his mind was occupied, might of itself give the place this haunted air, he strained those hawk’s eyes of his for the correction of his sight.
1	For three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and human, stared blindly at the night.
1	It gave him a surprised look--not to say a hearth-broomy kind of expression--which, my apprehensions whispered, might be fatal to us.
1	‘But I am not prepared,’ he went on, ‘to deny--perhaps I may have been, without knowing it, in some degree prepared to admit--that I may have unwittingly ensnared that lady into an unhappy marriage.
1	Mr Pancks was the first to lift up his head and speak.
1	There was another, and a darker object, to be gained.
1	‘I’ll tell you what, Squeers,’ remarked his wife as the door closed, ‘I think that young chap’s turning silly.’ ‘I hope not,’ said the schoolmaster; ‘for he’s a handy fellow out of doors, and worth his meat and drink, anyway.
1	‘By the Lord Harry, I do!’ With a very different shake of the head and deep sigh, Stephen said, ‘Thank you, sir, I wish you good day.’  So he left Mr. Bounderby swelling at his own portrait on the wall, as if he were going to explode himself into it; and Mrs. Sparsit still ambling on with her foot in her stirrup, looking quite cast down by the popular vices.
1	Let us see the natives in their aboriginal condition.’ ‘Though they ARE that sort of people that you mentioned,’ I returned.
1	If not remote enough, I can go remoter.
1	And now, Edwin Drood’s right hand closed again upon the ring in its little case, and again was checked by the consideration: ‘It is certain, now, that I am to give it back to him; then why should I tell her of it?’ That pretty sympathetic nature which could be so sorry for him in the blight of their childish hopes of happiness together, and could so quietly find itself alone in a new world to weave fresh wreaths of such flowers as it might prove to bear, the old world’s flowers being withered, would be grieved by those sorrowful jewels; and to what purpose?
1	And of any new professional connexion too, for if I was to give a reference to-morrow, it would be mentioned and would sew me up.
1	You can bear a little more?” The shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of listening, at the floor on one side of him; then similarly, at the floor on the other side of him; then, upward at the speaker.
1	"You see, miss, I have been handcuffed and taken into custody and brought here.
1	After watching it a long time, they saw Mr. Sleary bring out a chair and sit down by the side-door, smoking; as if that were his signal that they might approach.
1	He, yielding under the pressure of a complicated something, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against, and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed, I should hope that the worst was over.” “Well, well!
1	Then, he had his own lesson for the next day to prepare; and at this, he would work hard, in a little room which looked into the garden, till evening came slowly on, when the ladies would walk out again, and he with them: listening with such pleasure to all they said:  and so happy if they wanted a flower that he could climb to reach, or had forgotten anything he could run to fetch: that he could never be quick enough about it.
1	‘There’s small glasses on the shelf,’ said Riderhood to his daughter.
1	Newman wondered very much what could have occasioned this altered behaviour on the part of the collector; but, philosophically reflecting that he would most likely know, sooner or later, and that he could perfectly afford to wait, he was very little disturbed by the singularity of the old gentleman’s deportment.
1	Now, pray, Caddy," said Mrs. Jellyby, for Caddy was kissing her, "don't delay me in my work, but let me clear off this heavy batch of papers before the afternoon post comes in!"
1	They had something of the sort of pleasure in us, I suppose, that they might have had in a pretty toy, or a pocket model of the Colosseum.
1	‘Stay, sir,’ said Mr. Pickwick; ‘before you apply those epithets to the gentleman in question, consider, dispassionately, the extent of his fault, and above all remember that he is a friend of mine.’ ‘What!’ said Mr. Bob Sawyer.
1	‘My dear Mr. Copperfield,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘of your friendly interest in all our affairs, I am well assured.
1	But this was not the effect of time so much as of the change in all my habits made by the helplessness and inaction of a sick-room.
1	‘Ah, child, you pass a good many hours here!
1	I have often told you, Caddy, you have no such sympathy."
1	Then he delivered to the escort, drunk and sober, a receipt for the escorted, and requested him to dismount.
1	He’s a little dusty, but he’s very like you in tone.
1	Traddles has a rising reputation among the lawyers, I believe?’ ‘Well, sir,’ returned the waiter, ‘probably he has, sir; but I am not aware of it myself.’ This waiter, who was middle-aged and spare, looked for help to a waiter of more authority--a stout, potential old man, with a double chin, in black breeches and stockings, who came out of a place like a churchwarden’s pew, at the end of the coffee-room, where he kept company with a cash-box, a Directory, a Law-list, and other books and papers.
1	The Marquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his valet.
1	Well-seasoned timber is an expensive article, sir; and all the iron handles come, by canal, from Birmingham.'
1	Yes, he came to the same end; quite the natural end here, I assure you.
1	I saw in a moment that it was always kept prepared for her reception, and that he never went out but he thought it possible he might bring her home.
1	Why, wherever you are going," said the gentleman.
1	‘The appeal to him seemed necessary.
1	‘And how is Betty, my good fellow?’ Mrs Boffin asked him.
1	This gradually led to a want of toleration for him, and even--on his being detected in holy orders, and declining to perform the funeral service--to the general indignation taking the form of nuts.
1	Having made this arrangement with great despatch, he assisted Mary in the long-deferred occupation of shaking the carpets.
1	I am the man as is guaranteed, by unimpeachable references, to be a out-and-outer in morals and uprightness of principle.
1	I knew your father before you.
1	‘There ain’t a person in your service, Sir,’ pursued the black-eyed, ‘that has always stood more in awe of you than me and you may think how true it is when I make so bold as say that I have hundreds and hundreds of times thought of speaking to you and never been able to make my mind up to it till last night, but last night decided of me.’ Mr Dombey, in a paroxysm of rage, made another grasp at the bell-rope that was not there, and, in its absence, pulled his hair rather than nothing.
1	I was surprised to see that all this time everything was done by the child, and that there appeared to be no other persons but ourselves in the house.
1	"But now I have told you, you don't think it wrong of me, do you?"
1	I began with my overshadowed childhood, and passed through those timid days to the heavy time when my aunt lay dead, with her resolute face so cold and set, and when I was more solitary with Mrs. Rachael than if I had had no one in the world to speak to or to look at.
1	Less remarkable, now that she was not alone and it was darker, Mrs Clennam hurried on at Little Dorrit’s side, unmolested.
1	I had a doll married, last week, and was obliged to work all night.
1	As their utmost exertions had not enabled them to overhear a word of the interview, however, in consequence of a quarrel for precedence, which, though limited of necessity to pushes and pinches and such quiet pantomime, had lasted the whole time, they hurried him down to the office to hear his account of the conversation.
1	Mindful, then, of what we had read together, I thought of the two men who went up into the Temple to pray, and I knew there were no better words that I could say beside his bed, than “O Lord, be merciful to him a sinner!” Now that I was left wholly to myself, I gave notice of my intention to quit the chambers in the Temple as soon as my tenancy could legally determine, and in the meanwhile to underlet them.
1	‘And what did Mrs. Gummidge say?’ I asked, when I was grave enough.
1	May it haunt their houses pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.
1	I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth of political life.
1	At last they got to the theatre, which was Astley’s: and in some two minutes after they had reached the yet unopened door, little Jacob was squeezed flat, and the baby had received divers concussions, and Barbara’s mother’s umbrella had been carried several yards off and passed back to her over the shoulders of the people, and Kit had hit a man on the head with the handkerchief of apples for ‘scrowdging’ his parent with unnecessary violence, and there was a great uproar.
1	I present it, unaltered, in the Cheap Edition; and such of my opinions as it expresses, are quite unaltered too.
1	In which Nicholas falls in Love.
1	Then, among the advancing echoes, there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of her prattling words.
1	The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect.
1	"At poor Miss Flite's," said Caddy.
1	‘I know you’ll excuse me, Nicholas, my dear, but I don’t like to do this before a third person; indeed, before a young man it would not be quite proper, though really, after all, I don’t know what harm there is in it, except that to be sure it’s not a very becoming thing, though some people say it is very much so, and really I don’t know why it should not be, if it’s well got up, and the borders are small-plaited; of course, a good deal depends upon that.’ With which preface, Mrs. Nickleby took her nightcap from between the leaves of a very large prayer-book where it had been folded up small, and proceeded to tie it on: talking away in her usual discursive manner, all the time.
1	said Richard as we went downstairs.
1	We all took some, but our appreciation of it was gone, and we merely made a show of eating it.
1	He was shown into the little back study, where sat Mr. Brownlow and his friend Mr. Grimwig, with decanters and glasses before them.
1	Do you know what you have done?
1	He never rode a match on the swiftest animal in his costly stud, with half the speed at which he had torn along the course that ended in the Fleet.
1	That’s the Question.’ Mr Rugg was so soothingly persuasive as to be quite pathetic.
1	When these people howl, they howl to be heard.’ ‘Most people do, I suppose.’ ‘Ah!
1	However, of course, you can do as you like.
1	"It shall say it, Jo.
1	‘Some beloved companionship fades out of most lives, my dear,’ said the Jew,--‘that of a wife, and a fair daughter, and a son of promise, has faded out of my own life--but the happiness was.’ ‘Ah!’ said Miss Wren thoughtfully, by no means convinced, and chopping the exclamation with that sharp little hatchet of hers; ‘then I tell you what change I think you had better begin with, godmother.
1	The ceremony was very quickly disposed of, and all parties present having signed the register (for which purpose, when it came to his turn, Mr. Crummles carefully wiped and put on an immense pair of spectacles), they went back to breakfast in high spirits.
1	The women, led by Mrs Perch and Cook, often repeat ‘a hun-dred thou-sand pound!’ with awful satisfaction--as if handling the words were like handling the money; and the housemaid, who has her eye on Mr Towlinson, wishes she had only a hundredth part of the sum to bestow on the man of her choice.
1	What does it matter?’ Mr. Gradgrind seemed rather at a loss to understand the last four words; replying, ‘How, matter?
1	Determined to assure Mr Dombey, in so far as it was possible to give him the assurance without expressing it in words, that indeed he mistook his nature, Walter had been anxious to show even more cheerfulness and activity after the West Indian interview than he had shown before: if that were possible, in one of his quick and zealous disposition.
1	‘As if,’ said Eugene, ‘as if the churchyard ghosts were rising.’ He had walked to the window with his cigar in his mouth, to exalt its flavour by comparing the fireside with the outside, when he stopped midway on his return to his arm-chair, and said: ‘Apparently one of the ghosts has lost its way, and dropped in to be directed.
1	Who so mindful of those he left at home--albeit they were but a mother and two young babies--as Kit?
1	Could I dream of the true reason when they would give me none at all?’ They admitted that they had thought it discreet to be silent, and that the struggle had taken place.
1	Again, there was the subject of his relations with his mother, which were now upon an equable and peaceful but never confidential footing, and whom he saw several times a week.
1	Nor is it your fault.
1	Put it back half an hour every morning, and about another quarter towards the arternoon, and it’s a watch that’ll do you credit.’ ‘Captain Cuttle!
1	So I says to George when he has done, who is this old lady he has seen?
1	‘Davy,’ she said at length.
1	‘His name!’ cried Ben Allen.
1	Paul and myself will be able, when the time comes, to hold our own--the House, in other words, will be able to hold its own, and maintain its own, and hand down its own of itself, and without any such common-place aids.
1	Why do I do it?” “I never saw you do it yet,” muttered Carton.
1	This showed her directly that the Princess knew why she lived all alone by herself spinning at her wheel, and she kneeled down at the Princess’s feet, and asked her never to betray her.
1	You made it all right, first.
1	I would walk back at my leisure.
1	When Arthur’s mother had been under the care of him and his wife, she had been always writing, incessantly writing,--mostly letters of confession to you, and Prayers for forgiveness.
1	‘It is clear that a family of six, not including a domestic, cannot live upon air.’ ‘Certainly, ma’am,’ said I.
1	I don’t think that there ever were such people as those Peltiroguses.
1	He ventured to hope that nothing he had said would lead to the estrangement of Kate and Madeline, who had formed an attachment for each other, any interruption of which would, he knew, be attended with great pain to them, and, most of all, with remorse and pain to him, as its unhappy cause.
1	The importance of such an establishment, in every point of view, and with reference to every consideration of humanity and social policy, requires no comment.
1	She knew of their existence by hundreds and by thousands.
1	But since his last interview with Mr Carker, Captain Cuttle had come to entertain doubts whether his former intervention in behalf of that young lady and his dear boy Wal’r, had proved altogether so favourable as he could have wished, and as he at the time believed.
1	‘Is Martha with you yet?’ I asked.
1	‘’Gad, so he has,’ replied the young man; ‘deyvle take me if I know which is master in my house, he or I.’ ‘I know,’ muttered Ralph.
1	In the evening, sometimes, I went and sat with Peggotty in the kitchen.
1	Stick up to her, Tom.
1	The very idea of exhibiting his nightcap to a lady overpowered him, but he had tied those confounded strings in a knot, and, do what he would, he couldn’t get it off.
1	‘Hollo!’ exclaimed Sam, ‘wot’s all this?’ ‘Nothing the matter, I hope?’ said Mary, peeping over his shoulder.
1	The terms in both cases are understood to be exactly as stated to me in writing by yourself, when I opened a correspondence with you on this subject, after the honour of being introduced to you at your sister’s house in town here.
1	And you see the clouds rushing on above the narrow streets, not minding them, and you see the golden arrows pointing at the mountains in the sky from which the wind comes, and you feel as if you were dead.’ The little creature looked above her, holding up her slight transparent hand.
1	Then I shall probably not see him for some little time to come.
1	The inexhaustible baby was two or three months old, when Bella began to notice a cloud upon her husband’s brow.
1	Especially One Happy Afternoon      IX.
1	‘This is your doing, Peggotty, you cruel thing!’ said my mother.
1	There is a reason against this matter, there is a personal relation concerned in this matter, not yet explained to you.
1	It was written to me (as it told me in so many words), perhaps because it was the writer's idiosyncrasy to put that trust in me, perhaps because it was mine to justify it.
1	Did you open my packet, Ned?’ ‘Why, ay, ay,’ said the Captain.
1	Samson and his men complain sometimes, of being exhausted.
1	"I know there is such a stationer," returns Mr. Jobling.
1	But what you've always got to be careful of with servants is who comes to see 'em; you never know what they're up to if you don't know that.
1	If, any sunny forenoon, she had spread a little pair of wings and flown away before my eyes, I don’t think I should have regarded it as much more than I had had reason to expect.
1	The woman looked very hard at the whole party; and the red-headed man whispered something in her ear.
1	The big-headed babies were equally obliging in lending their grotesque aid to the general effect.
1	A bread-and-butter pudding entirely disappeared, and a considerable amount of cheese and radishes vanished by the same means.
1	A dim light shone at intervals from some bed-room window; and the hoarse barking of dogs occasionally broke the silence of the night.
1	said Mrs. Mann, thrusting her head out of the window in well-affected ecstasies of joy.
1	In one of those wanderings in the evening time, when, following the two sisters at a humble distance, she felt, in her sympathy with them and her recognition in their trials of something akin to her own loneliness of spirit, a comfort and consolation which made such moments a time of deep delight, though the softened pleasure they yielded was of that kind which lives and dies in tears--in one of those wanderings at the quiet hour of twilight, when sky, and earth, and air, and rippling water, and sound of distant bells, claimed kindred with the emotions of the solitary child, and inspired her with soothing thoughts, but not of a child’s world or its easy joys--in one of those rambles which had now become her only pleasure or relief from care, light had faded into darkness and evening deepened into night, and still the young creature lingered in the gloom; feeling a companionship in Nature so serene and still, when noise of tongues and glare of garish lights would have been solitude indeed.
1	Camels,” by which I presently understood he meant Camilla, “she have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her in spirits when she wake up in the night.” The accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me, to give me great confidence in Joe's information.
1	Mr Dolls, accepting the shilling, promptly laid it out in two threepennyworths of conspiracy against his life, and two threepennyworths of raging repentance.
1	He will want it when he comes back.
1	Rosa Dartle sat looking down upon her, as inflexible as a figure of brass.
1	The leader was insisting upon Mrs. Squeers repeating her dose, Master Squeers was undergoing another dip in the treacle, and a violent assault had been commenced on Miss Squeers, when John Browdie, bursting open the door with a vigorous kick, rushed to the rescue.
1	"Esther, it's enough to make anybody but me jealous," said Caddy, laughing and shaking her head; "but it only makes me joyful, for you are the first friend I ever had, and the best friend I ever can have, and nobody can respect and love you too much to please me."
1	The old, white-headed father, too--such deference--such respect--such devoted friendship--he worshipped me!
1	When I saw you, for the first time, coming out at the door, with your quaint little basket of keys hanging at your side?’ ‘It is just the same,’ said Agnes, smiling.
1	God bless you!’ And it showed, Paul thought, how easily one might do injustice to a person; for Miss Blimber meant it--though she was a Forcer--and felt it.
1	The trooper falters and looks at him.
1	Joseph Bagstock can never permit that assertion to pass uncontradicted.
1	Mr. Spenlow inquired in what respect?
1	He had a very broad chest had Miss Snevellicci’s papa, and he wore a threadbare blue dress-coat buttoned with gilt buttons tight across it; and he no sooner saw Nicholas come into the room, than he whipped the two forefingers of his right hand in between the two centre buttons, and sticking his other arm gracefully a-kimbo seemed to say, ‘Now, here I am, my buck, and what have you got to say to me?’ Such was, and in such an attitude sat Miss Snevellicci’s papa, who had been in the profession ever since he had first played the ten-year-old imps in the Christmas pantomimes; who could sing a little, dance a little, fence a little, act a little, and do everything a little, but not much; who had been sometimes in the ballet, and sometimes in the chorus, at every theatre in London; who was always selected in virtue of his figure to play the military visitors and the speechless noblemen; who always wore a smart dress, and came on arm-in-arm with a smart lady in short petticoats,--and always did it too with such an air that people in the pit had been several times known to cry out ‘Bravo!’ under the impression that he was somebody.
1	Miss Abbey, with manifest tokens of astonishment, took the diminutive document, and found it to run concisely thus:-- 	Dolls attended at their own residences.
1	Mr. Pickwick thought so also; but, under all the circumstances, he considered it a matter of sound policy to be silent.
1	Other people had thought of such things, if I had not.
1	Not in summer, as common pigs do now, to cool themselves, and did even in those distant ages (which is a proof that the light of civilisation had already begun to dawn, though feebly), but in the cold, sharp days of winter.
1	I lie down now, to ease my head.
1	‘I’m a-comin’, sir,’ replied Mr. Weller, mechanically following his master; and still he lifted not his eyes from Mr. Job Trotter, who walked at his side in silence.
1	He furthermore conjured him to avoid, above all things, the vice of intoxication, which he likened unto the filthy habits of swine, and to those poisonous and baleful drugs which being chewed in the mouth, are said to filch away the memory.
1	My aunt received a few lines next day in reply; addressed, outside, to her; within, to me.
1	But, had it been the beginning of some great labour with the same end in view--had it been the commencement of a long journey, to be performed on foot in that inclement season of the year, to be pursued under very privation and difficulty, and to be achieved only with great distress, fatigue, and suffering--had it been the dawn of some painful enterprise, certain to task his utmost powers of resolution and endurance, and to need his utmost fortitude, but only likely to end, if happily achieved, in good fortune and delight to Nell--Kit’s cheerful zeal would have been as highly roused: Kit’s ardour and impatience would have been, at least, the same.
1	Dinnot think so, Mr. Nickleby?’ ‘Certainly,’ returned Nicholas; ‘and you acted upon that principle when I meet you on horseback on the road, after our memorable evening.’ ‘Sure-ly,’ said John.
1	N--n--no, I don’t know you.’ The man replied, ‘No, you don’t know me.’ And so they stood looking at one another surlily enough, until Pleasant came back.
1	‘Does he requite her affection?’ ‘True kindness, considerate self-denying kindness, is not in his nature,’ returned Mr. Cheeryble.
1	‘He is,’ said the middle-aged lady.
1	I propose to consecrate this little retreat, by having a ceremony in which I take a great interest, performed there.
1	Much as my dear boy was, unhappily, too self-conscious and self-satisfied (I’ll draw no parallel between him and you in that respect) to love as he should have loved, or as any one in his place would have loved—must have loved!’ She sits in the same still attitude, but shrinking a little more.
1	How from counting months, we came to weeks, and then to days; and how I then began to be afraid that I should not be sent for and when I learnt from Steerforth that I had been sent for, and was certainly to go home, had dim forebodings that I might break my leg first.
1	I am a keeping that young man from harming of you at the present moment, with great difficulty.
1	"Then, sir," returns the trooper in a decisive manner, "it appears to me--being naturally in the vagabond way myself--that the sooner he comes out of the street, the better.
1	With his hat thrown back upon his ears as if his wiry prongs of hair had darted up like springs and cast it off, with his jet-black beads of eyes inquisitively sharp, with the fingers of his right hand in his mouth that he might bite the nails, and with the fingers of his left hand in reserve in his pocket for another course, Mr Pancks cast his shadow through the glass upon the books and papers.
1	‘What’s this?’ repeated Mr Dombey, almost foaming.
1	‘I only ask from curiosity, my dear.’ ‘Well, then, if you want to know,’ rejoined Mrs. Squeers, ‘I’ll tell you.
1	It is a retired situation.
1	'Go on,' said the person addressed, turning away his face.
1	He had that good reason for sympathy with haughtiness and coldness, which is found in a fellow-feeling.
1	Scrooge could say no more.
1	Both gentlemen laughed for some time.
1	‘Not on no account,’ replied the inexorable creditor.
1	As they abased themselves before him, Mr. Micawber took a seat, and waved his hand in his most courtly manner.
1	When we passed through a village, I pictured to myself what the insides of the houses were like, and what the inhabitants were about; and when boys came running after us, and got up behind and swung there for a little way, I wondered whether their fathers were alive, and whether they were happy at home.
1	What prison is he in?” “La Force!” “La Force!
1	‘Now, gentlemen,’ said Mr. Gregsbury, tossing a great bundle of papers into a wicker basket at his feet, and throwing himself back in his chair with his arms over the elbows, ‘you are dissatisfied with my conduct, I see by the newspapers.’ ‘Yes, Mr. Gregsbury, we are,’ said a plump old gentleman in a violent heat, bursting out of the throng, and planting himself in the front.
1	I Fall into Disgrace      V.      I Am Sent Away      VI.
1	Pray don’t hurry.’ ‘Let me get my bundle right, Mister Jarsper, and I’m with you.’  As he ties it afresh, he is once more conscious that he is very narrowly observed.
1	‘What did you want to say?’ demanded Wardle, shaking him.
1	Having parted from her with what may be conjectured to have been a rather bony kiss of a cosmetic flavour, he gave his daughter his blessing, graciously.
1	‘He’s quite a Troubadour, you know; quite a Troubadour!’ These complimentary expressions were uttered in a somewhat absent and distracted manner; for the unfortunate lawyer, besides having a bad cold in his head, had got wet in coming, and would have willingly borne some pecuniary sacrifice if he could have shifted his present raw quarters to a warm room, and dried himself at a fire.
1	Look sharp, or Nance will think I'm lost.'
1	I have never been in the streets with one of them.’ ‘Heard me talked of among ‘em, though?’ ‘No.
1	don’t you understand?’  And out of that look he vanished from her view.
1	If she should ever tell me that you are essential to her perfect happiness, I will give her to you.
1	The major part of the conversation was confined to Mrs. Weller and the reverend Mr. Stiggins; and the topics principally descanted on, were the virtues of the shepherd, the worthiness of his flock, and the high crimes and misdemeanours of everybody beside--dissertations which the elder Mr. Weller occasionally interrupted by half-suppressed references to a gentleman of the name of Walker, and other running commentaries of the same kind.
1	‘Ask--HEEP--if he ever kept a pocket-book in that house,’ said Mr. Micawber; ‘will you?’ I saw Uriah’s lank hand stop, involuntarily, in the scraping of his chin.
1	That’s exactly what I am incapable of doing.
1	Observing that he made no sketch, however, and that he talked about business only, she began to have suspicions that he represented some creditor of her father’s, the balance due to whom was noted in that pocket volume.
1	There was no way through it, and the front windows of the Doctor's lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that had a congenial air of retirement on it.
1	Wherefore, he only muttered a brief defiance of his master, and did as he was ordered.
1	Merriment, Marchioness, is not a bad or a degrading quality.
1	‘He’s gone!’ cried Westwood, who, with the other second, had run up to the body, and fallen on one knee beside it.
1	If you walley my precious life don’t upset me, as the gen’l’m’n said to the driver when they was a-carryin’ him to Tyburn.’ And quickening his pace to a sharp run, Mr. Weller wheeled his master nimbly to the green hill, shot him dexterously out by the very side of the basket, and proceeded to unpack it with the utmost despatch.
1	The way he’d sit and chuckle over himself!
1	‘Ah,’ said Miss Nipper, with great sharpness, ‘Oh, them “Blimbers”’ ‘Don’t blame anyone,’ said Florence.
1	After the momentary distraction of Captain Cuttle’s address, which he regarded with lofty indifference, Mr Dombey again turned his eyes upon his son, and sat steadily regarding the child, for some moments, in silence.
1	I’m a-goin’ to vork a coach reg’lar, and ha’n’t got noveres to keep it in, unless I vos to pay the guard for takin’ care on it, or to put it in vun o’ the coach pockets, vich ‘ud be a temptation to the insides.
1	But you--where are you going, where are you coming from, what have you been doing since you left me, what had you been doing before?
1	One ancestress of Volumnia, in high-heeled shoes, very like her--casting the shadow of that virgin event before her full two centuries--shoots out into a halo and becomes a saint.
1	Mr. Snodgrass, being occasionally abstracted and melancholy, is to this day reputed a great poet among his friends and acquaintance, although we do not find that he has ever written anything to encourage the belief.
1	I won’t deduct for it; I look to you to make it up handsomely by keeping the expenses down.
1	He was a sort of town traveller for a number of miscellaneous houses, now; but made little or nothing of it, I am afraid.
1	To fail in submission to the authority of the Tribunal would be to put yourself out of Law.
1	Some pitying hand may find it there, when I and my sorrows are dust.
1	There was a broad strong ledge of stone to this grating where the bottom of it was let into the masonry, three or four feet above the ground.
1	After a little discussion, he proposed to take my aunt to the school, that she might see it and judge for herself; also, to take her, with the same object, to two or three houses where he thought I could be boarded.
1	'If it was Charley, or the Dodger, or Bet, or--' 'I don't care who,' replied Sikes impatiently.
1	‘She understands that, anyways,’ muttered Squeers, watching Mrs Sliderskew as she dispatched her portion, and choked and gasped in a most awful manner after so doing.
1	When I paused for a moment at the door, and marked how fresh and free the whole scene was—what sparkling bubbles glanced upon the waves, and welled up every moment to the surface, as though the world below, like that above, were radiant with the bright day, and gushing over in its fulness of light: when I gazed from sail to sail away upon a ship at sea, a tiny speck of shining white, the only cloud upon the still, deep, distant blue—and, turning, saw a blind boy with his sightless face addressed that way, as though he too had some sense within him of the glorious distance: I felt a kind of sorrow that the place should be so very light, and a strange wish that for his sake it were darker.
1	if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous,” said Mr. Lorry.
1	Nothing can be tided over now, Pancks.
1	'She shall,' said Mrs. Maylie.
1	Bent upon this purpose, and in that mood in which delay is insupportable, he repaired at once to the place; and being, by description, perfectly acquainted with the situation of his room, crept upstairs and knocked gently at the door.
1	In the State House is the charter itself.
1	‘Martha wants,’ she said to Ham, ‘to go to London.’ ‘Why to London?’ returned Ham.
1	As he walked up and down that part of the courtyard which was at the side of the house, with the stray rooks and jackdaws looking after him with their heads cocked slyly, as if they knew how much more knowing they were in worldly affairs than he, if any sort of vagabond could only get near enough to his creaking shoes to attract his attention to one sentence of a tale of distress, that vagabond was made for the next two days.
1	I would sooner send him away, though I know I am the only person who appreciates him, than have him, and not spend his money on himself.
1	So, keeping to byways, and shunning human approach, this troublesome old woman hid herself, and fared on all through the dreary day.
1	You're a scorpion--a brimstone scorpion!
1	I called to his recollection the French maid and the eager offer of herself she had made to me.
1	I only use the word to express a monster in a lecturing castle, with Heaven knows how many heads manipulated into one, taking childhood captive, and dragging it into gloomy statistical dens by the hair.
1	It was only a moment that I stopped him, for he cut me heavily an instant afterwards, and in the same instant I caught the hand with which he held me in my mouth, between my teeth, and bit it through.
1	Lawrence Boythorn presents his compliments to Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, and has to call HIS attention to the fact that he totally denies the whole of Sir Leicester Dedlock's positions on every possible subject and has to add, in reference to closing up the pathway, that he will be glad to see the man who may undertake to do it.'
1	Fanny combined with the attractions of her youth and beauty, a certain weight of self-sustainment as if she had been married twenty years.
1	She breathes quickly and heavily, but she stands as unflinchingly as ever he has seen her in the midst of her grandest company.
1	'Wot a precious strange gal that is!'
1	Here, the moonlight is so very bright again that the colours of the nearest stained-glass window are thrown upon their faces.
1	A letter lay on his table.
1	Under these circumstances, when Flopson and Millers had got the children into the house, like a little flock of sheep, and Mr. Pocket came out of it to make my acquaintance, I was not much surprised to find that Mr. Pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression of face, and with his very gray hair disordered on his head, as if he didn't quite see his way to putting anything straight.
1	Although at another time Mr Swiveller might have looked upon this as a doubtful compliment, he felt it, under the then-existing circumstances, a great relief to be assured that he was not wrongfully suspected.
1	Then I go on board again; and getting into the light of one of the lamps, look at my watch and think it must have stopped; and wonder what has become of the faithful secretary whom I brought along with me from Boston.
1	What do you mean?’ ‘I beg your pardon, sir,’ pleaded Mr Tinkler, ‘I was wishful to know--’ ‘You wished to know nothing, sir,’ cried Mr Dorrit, highly flushed.
1	He was going to spend the evening at some private house in the neighbourhood, had ordered the boots to sit up until his return, and had taken his servant with him.
1	When they take their inventions into foreign countries, that’s quite different.
1	In many a noble mansion lives a man, the best of husbands and of fathers, whose private worth in both capacities is justly lauded to the skies.
1	What can YOU come for, because we are all very sure before-hand that you are not going to talk!
1	‘Good man!’ replied Perker; ‘bless your heart and soul, my dear Sir, Serjeant Snubbin is at the very top of his profession.
1	Good morning, sir, much obliged.--Door!” The last word was flung at the boy, who had not the least notion what it meant.
1	The break he set between his last two sentences was quite embarrassing to his hearer.
1	But to explain why Mr Carker reined in his horse quickly, and what he looked at in no small surprise, a few digressive words are necessary.
1	‘They should be so, of course.
1	Chuckster, bring in Mr Abel’s articles.’ ‘You see, Mr Witherden,’ said the old lady, ‘that Abel has not been brought up like the run of young men.
1	‘If that’s Tom Tootle,’ Miss Abbey made proclamation, in her most commanding tones, ‘let him instantly come underneath here.’ The submissive Tom complied, attended by a crowd.
1	In the corner by the chimney stand a deal table and a broken desk, a wilderness marked with a rain of ink.
1	‘I’m glad to hear it, but I don’t remember when.
1	‘While I was foreman at the Bower--afore it WAS the Bower--I considered the business very satisfactory.
1	He had a reason for going away, though it was an insufficient one."
1	‘I wanted to speak to him.’ ‘What did you want to say?’ asked half a dozen voices at once.
1	And she handed me the key across the counter.
1	Two pairs of eyes not unused to such people look after him, as, biting his nails and brooding, he crosses the square and is swallowed up by the shadow of the southern gateway.
1	Give him the new bill to sign, George, and he'll sign it like a man."
1	The straw hat then inquires of the brown hat, whether that coach in which he (the straw hat) then sits, is not a new one?
1	It was somewhat embarrassing at first, too, to have to duck nimbly every five minutes whenever the man at the helm cried ‘Bridge!’ and sometimes, when the cry was ‘Low Bridge,’ to lie down nearly flat.
1	But it pleases me to hear the old music, though I am very bad.’ ‘You are a traveller!
1	The floors were scrubbed to that extent, that you might have supposed the London blacks emancipated for ever, and gone out of the land for good.
1	‘What wages do you get?’ ‘Half what I could wish,’ replied young Blight.
1	I think there are some odd shillings or pence, if you are very particular.’ Mr Lammle bestows a by no means loving look upon the partner of his joys and sorrows, and he mutters something; but checks himself.
1	‘Now tell me I’m a liar!’ said the honest man.
1	The rooms in which they worked, were as well ordered as themselves.
1	While out on his hospitable preparations, he looks in on Mr. Sapsea; and mentions that dear Ned, and that inflammable young spark of Mr. Crisparkle’s, are to dine at the gatehouse to-day, and make up their difference.
1	It’s the case with my own wife.
1	I squeezed it dry to-day.’ ‘Nonsense, sir.
1	He was not singing as usual, nor was he seated at his desk.
1	In the majority of the shameful cases of disease and death from destitution, that shock the Public and disgrace the country, the illegality is quite equal to the inhumanity--and known language could say no more of their lawlessness.
1	Come in!’ ‘I beg your pardon, Mr Carker.
1	What I missed, I still regarded--I always regarded--as something that had been a dream of my youthful fancy; that was incapable of realization; that I was now discovering to be so, with some natural pain, as all men did.
1	One of these expeditions led them through the churchyard where was his father’s grave.
1	The end of the second book.
1	After a very gallant parting on his side, and a very cool and gentlemanly sort of one on hers, he nodded to Dick Swiveller, and withdrew with the attorney.
1	‘Because I should change; not those about me.
1	‘That is my brave boy,’ said Sir Barnet Skettles.
1	Put it to her ladyship, if you think it right, from Inspector Bucket of the Detective.
1	But as I mentioned to my friend Dombey, I could not admit the criminality of my lovely and accomplished relative until it was perfectly established.
1	One of you is enough.’ ‘You have an accurate memory of your own,’ said Mr Dombey.
1	‘Prepare yourself for intelligence which, if you have any human feeling in your breast, will make even you shrink and tremble.
1	I never made them.” Waiting until she was quiet again,--for this, too, flashed out of her in a wild and sudden way,--I went on.
1	Oh dear, dear, what a man it is!’ ‘WHICH of the bygones do you want to revive?’ said Ralph.
1	Practical suggestions being much needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation, and the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out, while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any exercise of ingenuity stick upon it.
1	I don’t feel quite myself.
1	‘That is what alarms me so much.’ ‘Instant measures must be taken,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	If it turns out that he warn’t at the Six Jolly Fellowships that night at midnight, I’m a liar.’ ‘What did he say?’ ‘I’ll tell you (take me down, T’other Governor, I ask no better).
1	you are not put upon your trial before a Court of Justice, at present, Louisa,’ returned Mr Dombey, chafing, ‘and therefore it don’t matter.’ ‘My dear Paul,’ said Mrs Chick, in a warning voice, ‘I must be spoken to kindly, or there is an end of me,’ at the same time a premonitory redness developed itself in Mrs Chick’s eyelids which was an invariable sign of rain, unless the weather changed directly.
1	"I am glad of your good opinion."
1	‘As I am so fortunate as to have met you, let me press my petition.’ She looked down for a moment at his glistening mouth; and he looked up at her, standing above him in her stately dress, and thought, again, how beautiful she was.
1	My schooling was paid for; it was a bargain; and when I came away, the bargain ended.’ It was a fundamental principle of the Gradgrind philosophy that everything was to be paid for.
1	Pray tell me what it is.’ I replied that I had no complaint to make, either of my Mistress or to my Mistress; but I must go.
1	It was Sir Barnet Skettles, Lady Skettles, and Master Skettles.
1	The indigent blind of that state are admitted gratuitously.
1	Stretching forth his flabby paw, Mr. Chadband lays the same on Jo's arm and considers where to station him.
1	Swear it was not true?
1	To this Ladies’ Seminary, then, Richard Swiveller hied, with designs obnoxious to the peace of the fair Sophia, who, arrayed in virgin white, embellished by no ornament but one blushing rose, received him on his arrival, in the midst of very elegant not to say brilliant preparations; such as the embellishment of the room with the little flower-pots which always stood on the window-sill outside, save in windy weather when they blew into the area; the choice attire of the day-scholars who were allowed to grace the festival; the unwonted curls of Miss Jane Wackles who had kept her head during the whole of the preceding day screwed up tight in a yellow play-bill; and the solemn gentility and stately bearing of the old lady and her eldest daughter, which struck Mr Swiveller as being uncommon but made no further impression upon him.
1	He is at his place in Lincolnshire; but the waters are out again on the low-lying grounds, and the cold and damp steal into Chesney Wold, though well defended, and eke into Sir Leicester's bones.
1	‘Driven to do it, were you?’ said Squeers.
1	He says it with such a pitiable air, and his grimy tears appear so real, and he lies in the corner up against the hoarding so like a growth of fungus or any unwholesome excrescence produced there in neglect and impurity, that Allan Woodcourt is softened towards him.
1	There had been rain all day, and there was a damp feeling in the air.
1	When he left me for my good—he never would have left me for his own—I know he was almost broken-hearted with the trial.
1	My position as a mutual friend requires it, sir.’ Mr. Folair paused with a most impressive look, and diving into the hat before noticed, drew from thence a small piece of whity-brown paper curiously folded, whence he brought forth a note which it had served to keep clean, and handing it over to Nicholas, said-- ‘Have the goodness to read that, sir.’ Nicholas, in a state of much amazement, took the note and broke the seal, glancing at Mr. Folair as he did so, who, knitting his brow and pursing up his mouth with great dignity, was sitting with his eyes steadily fixed upon the ceiling.
1	I come up in a cab, and the cab’s waiting to be paid.
1	"Very magnanimous indeed, sir," observed my guardian.
1	The ravages committed by this unfortunate, rendering her dismissal necessary, she was succeeded (with intervals of Mrs. Kidgerbury) by a long line of Incapables; terminating in a young person of genteel appearance, who went to Greenwich Fair in Dora’s bonnet.
1	Landlady came round for me at dinner-time.
1	‘To think of your going and attacking me, that have always been a friend to you!
1	However, he wouldn't be, and there was an end of it."
1	She began to forget him soon after her discovery of the Toodle family.
1	But never mind them just now.
1	“I know your engagements,” said he, “and I know you are out of sorts, Mr. Pip.
1	His adversary saw the advantage he had gained, and followed it up.
1	He introduces Rick, and then he is good friends with Mr. Vholes and borrows five pounds of him.
1	Flora, now permanently heavy, did not release Arthur from the survey of the house, until it had extended even to his old garret bedchamber.
1	It is late; I need say no more to-night.
1	Containing Matter of a surprising Kind ‘As we gang awa’ fra’ Lunnun tomorrow neeght, and as I dinnot know that I was e’er so happy in a’ my days, Misther Nickleby, Ding!
1	“Says you, 'Joseph, he gave me a little message, which I will now repeat.
1	See another reason for urging it on!
1	It is too insolvent a state of things for any one with any self-respect to entertain, and is universally scouted.
1	Mr. Pickwick had been so fully occupied in falling about, and disentangling himself, miraculously, from between the legs of horses, that he had not enjoyed sufficient leisure to observe the scene before him, until it assumed the appearance we have just described.
1	Her son,’ said Mr Toots, as an additional recommendation, ‘was educated in the Bluecoat School, and blown up in a powder-mill.’ Susan accepting this kind offer, Mr Toots conducted her to his dwelling, where they were received by the Matron in question who fully justified his character of her, and by the Chicken who at first supposed, on seeing a lady in the vehicle, that Mr Dombey had been doubled up, ably to his old recommendation, and Miss Dombey abducted.
1	This was the utmost description Ada could give me.
1	I verily believe that her not remembering and not minding in the least, made me cry again, inwardly,--and that is the sharpest crying of all.
1	“I have felt this strange feeling before,” said he, “I cannot help thinking there’s something wrong about that closet.” He made a strong effort, plucked up his courage, shivered the lock with a blow or two of the poker, opened the door, and there, sure enough, standing bolt upright in the corner, was the last tenant, with a little bottle clasped firmly in his hand, and his face--well!’ As the little old man concluded, he looked round on the attentive faces of his wondering auditory with a smile of grim delight.
1	In work alway   Let my first years be past,   That I may give for ev’ry day   Some good account at last.”’ A deep hum of applause rose not only from the two teachers, but from all the pupils, who were equally astonished to hear Miss Monflathers improvising after this brilliant style; for although she had been long known as a politician, she had never appeared before as an original poet.
1	'I couldn't see 'em suffer before my very eyes, you know sir.'
1	By and by, there comes a great bustle downstairs, and a lanky chap with a red nose and a white neckcloth rushes up, and sings out, “Here’s the shepherd a-coming to wisit his faithful flock;” and in comes a fat chap in black, vith a great white face, a-smilin’ avay like clockwork.
1	The elder gentleman took the cry so ill, that he watched his opportunity, and smote the young gentleman on the ear.
1	That, my dear Mr. Copperfield, appears to me to be his true position.
1	Surely you know, my dear, that all the greatest ornaments of England in knowledge, imagination, active humanity, and improvement of every sort are added to its nobility!
1	‘You’re quite a sailor, I suppose?’ I said to Em’ly.
1	‘Oh, nothing, nothing,’ replied Wardle.
1	And as to plate, Lord bless you, we haven’t so much as a tea-spoon.’ ‘All to be earned?’ said I, cheerfully.
1	All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.
1	'He's drunk it all up, every drop,' said Chitling after watching the dog some time in silence.
1	“He's an invalid now,” replied Herbert.
1	It was solely the effect of his internal emotions.
1	‘He cannot answer for others.’ ‘My dear,’ returned Mr. Micawber with sudden seriousness, ‘I have no desire to answer for others.
1	‘There’s burning fever here, and something now and then to which I fear to give a name.’ The dwarf said never a word, but watched his companion as he paced restlessly up and down the room, and presently returned to his seat.
1	Captain Martin was a gentleman and a man of honour, and I put it to him first to give me his--his own opinion.
1	And there, too, was a sprinkling of less distinguished Parliamentary Barnacles, who had not as yet got anything snug, and were going through their probation to prove their worthiness.
1	"You may observe, Mr. Bucket, that I abstain from examining this paper myself.
1	For whom, perhaps with some old instinct of his race, the gentle Jew had spread a carpet.
1	That the punishment is nevertheless, to my thinking, fully as cruel and as wrong in their case, as in that of the men, I need scarcely add.
1	‘Been out to-day, Mrs Lammle?’ Mrs Lammle answered, for a short drive.
1	Peggotty and myself will constantly keep a double look-out together, on our goods and chattels.
1	‘“Oh, the deception and villainy of the man!” said the widow.
1	They asked me to look out for you,’ said the man.
1	Both expressed their opinion that a more independent, a more enlightened, a more public-spirited, a more noble- minded, a more disinterested set of men than those who had promised to vote for him, never existed on earth; each darkly hinted his suspicions that the electors in the opposite interest had certain swinish and besotted infirmities which rendered them unfit for the exercise of the important duties they were called upon to discharge.
1	‘Mr Rokesmith goes with us?’ he said, hesitating, with a look towards the door.
1	It’s all owing to your precious caution that they got hold of it.
1	"Such as they were, of course."
1	We never did look at this subject from the same side, and we never shall.
1	“MERCIE--that will do.” ‘At this instant, while the Lady Flabella yet inhaled that delicious fragrance by holding the MOUCHOIR to her exquisite, but thoughtfully-chiselled nose, the door of the BOUDOIR (artfully concealed by rich hangings of silken damask, the hue of Italy’s firmament) was thrown open, and with noiseless tread two VALETS-DE-CHAMBRE, clad in sumptuous liveries of peach-blossom and gold, advanced into the room followed by a page in BAS DE SOIE--silk stockings--who, while they remained at some distance making the most graceful obeisances, advanced to the feet of his lovely mistress, and dropping on one knee presented, on a golden salver gorgeously chased, a scented BILLET.
1	oh no, I have not been out of town,’ said Miss Tox.
1	It appeared to have become a perfect passion with Mrs Flintwinch, that the only son should be pitted against them.
1	By little and little Paul had grown stronger, and had become able to dispense with his carriage; though he still looked thin and delicate; and still remained the same old, quiet, dreamy child that he had been when first consigned to Mrs Pipchin’s care.
1	You didn’t exactly understand me, though?’ I gave him a look, but no other answer; and, going to my good old master, said a few words that I meant to be words of comfort and encouragement.
1	He was still by the river-side.
1	Jarndyce and Jarndyce If the secret I had to keep had been mine, I must have confided it to Ada before we had been long together.
1	‘Perhaps, my friend, philosopher, man of virtue, Imbecile, what you will; perhaps,’ said Rigaud, pausing in his drink to look out of his glass with his horrible smile, ‘you would have done better to leave me alone?’ ‘No!
1	Continuing to chuckle when his laugh is over, as though remonstrant with himself on his drinking powers, he rolls to the door and unlocks it.
1	‘To think that my master should have suspected the conversation I had with yours, and so dragged me away in a post-chaise, and after persuading the sweet young lady to say she knew nothing of him, and bribing the school-mistress to do the same, deserted her for a better speculation!
1	Let some be upon their guard.
1	take me home!’ But he could remember, when he got home, and was carried up the well-remembered stairs, that there had been the rumbling of a coach for many hours together, while he lay upon the seat, with Florence still beside him, and old Mrs Pipchin sitting opposite.
1	"I was bred in this place.
1	He might have been some profoundly deaf old gentleman, who had come in to take a rest, or he might have been patiently waiting for a friend, without the least consciousness of anybody’s presence, or fixed in a trance, or under the influence of opium.
1	‘Yes, it is rather near,’ replied Mr. Magnus, ‘rather too near to be pleasant--eh!
1	It was not, she remarked, so palatable to her, but it was the next best.
1	“Your name is Poker, and there is no harm in being named Poker.” “Oh, Mr. Sapsea!” cried the young man, in a very well-behaved manner.
1	It is singularly well conducted by Mr. Mitchell, a comic actor of great quiet humour and originality, who is well remembered and esteemed by London playgoers.
1	‘Really, I think,’ said Mrs Lammle, still gaily, ‘I must throw myself on the protection of the Court.
1	Surely they can wait, till I come back!’ Cleopatra looked all round the table as she said it, and appeared very uneasy.
1	‘Forty-two,’ replied the driver, eyeing him askant.
1	Mr. Winkle, thus instructed, climbed into his saddle, with about as much difficulty as he would have experienced in getting up the side of a first-rate man-of-war.
1	‘There is nothing Traddles likes so much!’ ‘Ye-yes, Doady,’ said Dora, ‘and so I bought a beautiful little barrel of them, and the man said they were very good.
1	Ah, poor me, the business is slack, is slack!
1	I am as free as the air.
1	There’s a chill in the air, governor.
1	Nothing?’ A certain eagerness in her voice, and something that was almost joyful in her look, seemed to surprise him more and more; to disappoint him too, and jar discordantly against his own emotions.
1	I have systematically devoted myself (as you know) to the education of the reason of my family.
1	Doctor Crocus is here, gentlemen, the celebrated Dr. Crocus!
1	Effect not soothing, but reverse.
1	And so the jumble would be in action in this department for a mortal hour; the exponent drawling on to My Dearert Childerrenerr, let us say, for example, about the beautiful coming to the Sepulchre; and repeating the word Sepulchre (commonly used among infants) five hundred times, and never once hinting what it meant; the conventional boy smoothing away right and left, as an infallible commentary; the whole hot-bed of flushed and exhausted infants exchanging measles, rashes, whooping-cough, fever, and stomach disorders, as if they were assembled in High Market for the purpose.
1	He’ll cut up so rough, Nickleby, at our talking together without him.
1	Nowt o’ th’ kind, ma’am, nowt o’ th’ kind.
1	Good morning.’ Young Barnacle seemed discomfited at this, as not having at all expected him to go.
1	His brother’s greatness, wealth, freedom, and grandeur, pleased him without any reference to himself.
1	She was by that time perseveringly dictating to Caddy, and Caddy was fast relapsing into the inky condition in which we had found her.
1	‘What!’ cried the Doctor, in a terrible voice.
1	They shall be made an example of.
1	They tended their flocks severely in buckram and powder and put their sticking-plaster patches on to terrify commoners as the chiefs of some other tribes put on their war-paint.
1	It means your precious Mr Wrayburn; that’s what it means.’ ‘Charley!
1	But the room was dark; and as she made no answer to his call, he was fain to go back for the lamp.
1	"Whether by his own hand--" "Upon my honour!"
1	Oh!’ ‘But it’s all over now--all over for good, Maggy.
1	Now I am off!’ And this time he really was: and Solomon Gills, with no appetite for dinner, sat on the opposite side of the fire, watching Florence in her slumber, building a great many airy castles of the most fantastic architecture; and looking, in the dim shade, and in the close vicinity of all the instruments, like a magician disguised in a Welsh wig and a suit of coffee colour, who held the child in an enchanted sleep.
1	‘You see, Mr. Pickwick,’ said the host in explanation of his wife’s lament, ‘that we are in some measure cut off from many enjoyments and pleasures of which we might otherwise partake.
1	In the first instant of alighting, Mrs. Sparsit turned her distracted eyes towards the waiting coaches, which were in great request.
1	She had done her work now, and her hand, faltering on the arm of his chair since its last tending of him, was hesitating there yet.
1	It was evident from the general tone of the whole party, that they had come to regard insolvency as the normal state of mankind, and the payment of debts as a disease that occasionally broke out.
1	If the individuals in the Money Market oblige Mr. Micawber to sustain a great sacrifice, that is between themselves and their consciences.
1	David, I wish to God I had had a judicious father these last twenty years!’ ‘My dear Steerforth, what is the matter?’ ‘I wish with all my soul I had been better guided!’ he exclaimed.
1	Emporiums of splendid dresses, the materials brought from every quarter of the world; tempting stores of everything to stimulate and pamper the sated appetite and give new relish to the oft-repeated feast; vessels of burnished gold and silver, wrought into every exquisite form of vase, and dish, and goblet; guns, swords, pistols, and patent engines of destruction; screws and irons for the crooked, clothes for the newly-born, drugs for the sick, coffins for the dead, and churchyards for the buried--all these jumbled each with the other and flocking side by side, seemed to flit by in motley dance like the fantastic groups of the old Dutch painter, and with the same stern moral for the unheeding restless crowd.
1	‘What has come over you, my dear, in the name of goodness?’ asked Mrs Nickleby, when they had walked on, for some time, in silence.
1	‘I am sure you do not, my dear,’ returned her mother, ‘for you have a fine brave spirit.
1	‘Of all the ruinous and desolate places my uncle had ever beheld, this was the most so.
1	To this Mr. Weller replied with an easy and unstudied closing of one eye; which might be considered to mean, either that he would have thought it, or that he would not have thought it, or that he had never thought anything at all about it, as the observer’s imagination suggested.
1	However, I have MY consolation, and that should be enough for me!’ Washing her hands, thus, of all responsibility under this head, past, present, or to come, Mrs. Nickleby kindly added that she hoped her children might never have greater cause to reproach themselves than she had, and prepared herself to receive the escort, who soon returned with the intelligence that the old gentleman was safely housed, and that they found his custodians, who had been making merry with some friends, wholly ignorant of his absence.
1	R. W. himself was for his part convinced that he was father of one of the most charming of girls, and that Rokesmith was the most favoured of men; which opinion, if propounded to him, Rokesmith would probably not have contested.
1	‘Shall I put it off till to-morrow?’ said Mr. Grewgious.
1	"Thirdly, you can judge for yourself whether it is at all like that," says Mr. Tulkinghorn, suddenly handing him some sheets of written paper tied together.
1	I will be the mistress of Bleak House when you please."
1	The guard was standing at the door, waiting for the letter-bag.
1	But recovering her voice--which was synonymous with her presence of mind, indeed they were one and the same thing--she replied with dignity: ‘Florence, my dear child, your poor Papa is peculiar at times; and to question me about him, is to question me upon a subject which I really do not pretend to understand.
1	‘These five sisters were all of surpassing beauty.
1	‘Not a bit on it,’ replied the father; ‘for the shepherd’s water-rate, Sammy.’ ‘The shepherd’s water-rate!’ said Sam.
1	There never was such a house for noises.
1	A glimpse of the river through a dull gateway, where some waggons were housed for the night, seemed to arrest my feet.
1	No one answered; but, from within the chambers, there proceeded a continuous spluttering sound of a highly singular and unintelligible nature.
1	‘Thethilia,’ said Mr. Sleary, who had brandy and water at hand, ‘it doth me good to thee you.
1	Those who had kept themselves cool, to win, and who earned their living in such scenes, threw themselves upon the combatants, and, forcing them asunder, dragged them some space apart.
1	You little fool!’ ‘I beg your pardon.
1	I find that I am heavy company enough for myself as I am.’ ‘But the fame--’ I was beginning.
1	'Smelling the grub like a old lady a going to market!
1	On the contrary, he had to think of everything familiar to him, in his contemplative moods and in his wanderings about the house, as being to be parted with; and hence the many things he had to think of, all day long.
1	yes!’ and nodded at the fire: to which, I am persuaded, she gave the credit of the whole performance.
1	As to the straw hat and blue ribbons which was on the top of the curls, if I could only have hung it up in my room in Buckingham Street, what a priceless possession it would have been!
1	Go and speak to Flopson.
1	‘You’re in luck, my child.’ ‘Oh don’t talk about luck, Misses Brown,’ returned the wretched Grinder, facing round and stopping.
1	I must not leave it to be supposed that we were ever a great House, or that we made mints of money.

1	Here again, although I went down with the owner of the estate, to ‘the quarter,’ as that part of it in which the slaves live is called, I was not invited to enter into any of their huts.
1	He was sent to a preparatory seminary in his father’s dominions until he was ten years old, and was then despatched, in charge of a trusty messenger, to a finishing school at Athens; and as there was no extra charge for remaining during the holidays, and no notice required previous to the removal of a pupil, there he remained for eight long years, at the expiration of which time, the king his father sent the lord chamberlain over, to settle the bill, and to bring him home; which, the lord chamberlain doing, was received with shouts, and pensioned immediately.
1	Truly, a proud and noble character that I describe in the supposed words of Monsieur, the uncle.
1	She did not weep; she showed no greater agitation, outwardly, than when she was riding home.
1	Gets finer as she gets on.
1	'The Artful's a deal too artful, and would forget to come, or lose his way, or get dodged by traps and so be perwented, or anything for an excuse, if you put him up to it.
1	‘For the sake of Wal’r drownded in the briny deep, turn to, and histe up something or another, if able!’ Finding her insensible to this impressive adjuration also, Captain Cuttle snatched from his breakfast-table a basin of cold water, and sprinkled some upon her face.
1	Mr Wegg was going to say, My Benefactor, and had said My Bene, when a grandiloquent change came over him.
1	‘I can trust you as myself.
1	He had been so cruel to me, that I might have effected a separation on easy terms for myself; but I did not.
1	All the guides, mule-drivers, and idlers in the yard, had made themselves parties to the angry conference, and were much impressed by the courier’s now bestirring himself to get the carriages out.
1	The father, who once worked in a factory himself, will be a little disappointed at first very possibly.
1	‘We have but a shoulder of mutton with onion sauce,’ said Mrs. Crummles, in the same charnel-house voice; ‘but such as our dinner is, we beg you to partake of it.’ ‘You are very good,’ replied Nicholas, ‘I shall do it ample justice.’ ‘Vincent,’ said Mrs. Crummles, ‘what is the hour?’ ‘Five minutes past dinner-time,’ said Mr. Crummles.
1	The sharp, involuntary glance Jingle had cast at a small piece of raw loin of mutton, which Job had brought in with him, said more of their reduced state than two hours’ explanation could have done.
1	No!’ Comforting himself with this assurance, Mr. Mantalini closed his eyes and waited patiently till such time as he should wake up.
1	In the instant, I had seen a face that was strange to me, looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched and pleased by the sight of me.
1	‘Three days, you say?’ ‘Only three days--all over then--no more difficulties.’ Mr. Tupman counted the money into his companion’s hand, and he dropped it piece by piece into his pocket, as they walked towards the house.
1	But I leave it wholly to you, sir.’ Mr Sloppy still continued his singular, and on the surface his incomprehensible, movement.
1	Mr. Grewgious ought to be possessed of the whole case.
1	‘Did she?’ ‘No, you think not?’ replied old Arthur.
1	Well spoken, Di, so near your Mistress!
1	I shall wear,’ added Richard, taking off his hat again and looking hard at it, as if he were only deterred by pecuniary considerations from spurning it with his foot, ‘I shall wear this emblem of woman’s perfidy, in remembrance of her with whom I shall never again thread the windings of the mazy; whom I shall never more pledge in the rosy; who, during the short remainder of my existence, will murder the balmy.
1	But there were other persons associated with these recollections, and many changes came about before they had being.
1	His feeling about the child had been negative from her birth.
1	She don’t act as a vife, Sammy.’ Don’t she, though?’ inquired Mr. Weller, junior.
1	It is true that the royal speech, at the close of such session, virtually said, My lords and gentlemen, you have through several laborious months been considering with great loyalty and patriotism, How not to do it, and you have found out; and with the blessing of Providence upon the harvest (natural, not political), I now dismiss you.
1	Thus I made the second discovery on that first occasion, that the nurture of the little Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down.
1	‘Angry,’ I answered, with an involuntary imitation of his dark frown.
1	It so rarely happened that anybody seemed to want him, it was such an exceptional case when his powers were in any request, that his misty mind could not make out how it happened.
1	He still hoped to resume that domestic position when Fortune should smile upon his son-in-law; in the meantime, while she preserved an immovable countenance, he was, and resolved to remain, one of these little old men in a grove of little old men with a community of flavour.
1	‘Two parties, of course!’ said Mr. Omer, nodding his head retrospectively.
1	"Sergeant," the lawyer proceeds in his dry passionless manner, far more hopeless in the dealing with than any amount of vehemence, "make up your mind while I speak to you, for this is final.
1	Mr. What’s-your-name, you were going to refer some question to Micawber.
1	Two additional chairs were brought in from the bedroom: Miss Snevellicci sat at the head of the table, and Mr. Lillyvick at the foot; and Nicholas had not only the honour of sitting next Miss Snevellicci, but of having Miss Snevellicci’s mama on his right hand, and Miss Snevellicci’s papa over the way.
1	I can’t be more miserable anywhere,’ whimpered the whelp, ‘than I have been here, ever since I can remember.
1	He must have been a boy of spirit and resource, to get here on a stopped allowance of five sous a week; but he did it somehow, and he burst in on his father, and pleaded his sister’s cause.
1	‘If you had to die,’ said Paul, looking up into his face--Mr Toots started, and seemed much disturbed.
1	Now, it certainly looked about the last apartment on the whole earth out of which any man would be likely to get anything to do him good.
1	"I am sure I don't wonder at it!"
1	It must be especially observed in justice to poor Kit that he was by no means of a sentimental turn, and perhaps had never heard that adjective in all his life.
1	In a third cell, was a tall, strong black, a burglar, working at his proper trade of making screws and the like.
1	said the Jew, taking up a jagged and knotted club which law in a corner of the fireplace; 'eh?'
1	He stooped a good deal, and plodded along in a slow pre-occupied manner, which made the bustling London thoroughfares no very safe resort for him.
1	That would have been a change indeed.
1	I'm going to take a liberty with you.
1	So, Arthur was a dying, and a dying poor and with the horrors on him, and Compeyson's wife (which Compeyson kicked mostly) was a having pity on him when she could, and Compeyson was a having pity on nothing and nobody.
1	We don’t mean money, bless you; you’re not to think of that!
1	we can talk it over now; can’t us?’ Mr Rokesmith bowed, thanked her, and said he hoped so.
1	Good-night.’ As Mr. Folair was pretty well known among his fellow-actors for a man who delighted in mischief, and was by no means scrupulous, Nicholas had not much doubt but that he had secretly prompted the tragedian in the course he had taken, and, moreover, that he would have carried his mission with a very high hand if he had not been disconcerted by the very unexpected demonstrations with which it had been received.
1	Long afterwards he had cause to remember how Jasper sprang from the couch in a delirious state between sleeping and waking, and crying out: ‘What is the matter?
1	"My poor girl," said I, laying my face against her forehead, for indeed I was crying too, and trembling, "it seems cruel to trouble you now, but more depends on our knowing something about this letter than I could tell you in an hour."
1	‘What’s the matter here?’ ‘We were only asleep, Sir,’ said Nell.
1	‘Then, I have got it, boy!’ said Mr. Dick.
1	I--ha--need not trouble you, Amy.
1	‘Bless you, yes,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘and turned to with a will.
1	Come a very small and straggling congregation indeed: chiefly from Minor Canon Corner and the Precincts.
1	He knew, now, what he had done.
1	Only there ain’t no Chicking in it.’ Here she shook herself, and fell asleep again.
1	By degrees, as they could bear no more, they dropped off one by one, and lights twinkled in little casements; which lights, as the casements darkened, and more stars came out, seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having been extinguished.
1	I find that the image which I did suppose had been eradicated from my 'eart is NOT eradicated.
1	I’m sure a cove might think,’ said Mr Toodle Junior, with a burst of penitence, ‘that singing birds was innocent company, but nobody knows what harm is in them little creeturs and what they brings you down to.’ They seemed to have brought him down to a velveteen jacket and trousers very much the worse for wear, a particularly small red waistcoat like a gorget, an interval of blue check, and the hat before mentioned.
1	Miss Lavinia looked consciously at Miss Clarissa, and heaved a little sigh.
1	"I shall be honoured, I am sure," said Mr. Guppy.
1	I assure you I have no desire to be controversial.
1	The Capital Modern Household Furniture, &c., is on sale.
1	“What's _he_ got to do with the case?” asked the man he had spoken with.
1	Who would make the vulgar very picturesque and faithful by putting back the hands upon the clock of time and cancelling a few hundred years of history.
1	‘Cheer up, Mawther!’ cried Mr. Peggotty.
1	“My dear ma’am, will you have the kindness to sit down for one moment?” ‘The widow looked much amazed, but she sat down, and Tom sat down too, close beside her.
1	You were to go to the offices of the Haven of Philanthropy, and put your name down as a Member and a Professing Philanthropist.
1	Particularly in a case like this, where the greater part of the costs comes out of the estate, I should not be considerate of my good name if I gave hopes.
1	I was going for the one, and my darling was going for the other; and my darling was right again.
1	D--me, if my neck-handkercher an't lined with beer!
1	“I should have said this sooner, but for my long mistake.
1	“The door is locked then, my friend?” said Mr. Lorry, surprised.
1	‘Thank you.’ ‘Indeed,’ said Mr Dombey, in his lofty patronage, ‘anyone might say so.
1	He would find it was weak, he would say it was weak, and I was lost!
1	Returning with their jackets buttoned and their pumps stuck in them, they then produced packets of cold bread and meat and bivouacked under a painted lyre on the wall.
1	You do not know what it is, at one blow, to be deserted by a lovely and fascinating creature, and to fall a victim to the artifices of a villain, who had the grin of cunning beneath the mask of friendship.
1	Then, when the horses were to, in he came like a Harlequin, and before they had gone a mile, out came the watch and the fire-box together, and Kit’s mother as wide awake again, with no hope of a wink of sleep for that stage.
1	‘I am very well, I thank you,’ he would answer.
1	But I hope I did it for his good.
1	I supposed the room was empty.
1	I could go to Soho in the evening, and come to your chambers afterwards.” “Then I say yes,” said Stryver: “I won't go up there now, I am not so hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look in to-night.
1	Mr. Crisparkle beamed at the books, but not so brightly as when he had entered.
1	Warm water, Sir?’ ‘No; and take away the candle.
1	‘Is that no harm?’ The lawyer stopped short in his invective, and listening for a moment, and recognising the well-known voice, rested his head upon his hand, raised his eyes to the ceiling, and muttered faintly, ‘There’s another!’ Up went the single gentleman’s window directly.
1	I am so soured.’ ‘Yes, but hang it,’ says Wegg argumentatively, ‘a well-governed mind can be soured sitting!
1	‘What are they doing now?’ inquired Mr. Pickwick, adjusting his spectacles.
1	Nonsense!’ said Wardle, dragging off his skates with the impetuosity which characterised all his proceedings.
1	That lady acts as mistress of this house, and she is a highly connected lady.
1	They walked back together to the corner of the street where Rachael lived, and as they drew nearer and nearer to it, silence crept upon them.
1	‘I’m sooary I ha spok’n on ’t,’ said Stephen, ‘I ought t’ hadn in my mind as I might touch a sore place.
1	I got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the brewery wall, and twisting them out of my hair, and then I smoothed my face with my sleeve, and came from behind the gate.
1	God knows I have no such thought.’ ‘What is your thought, then?’ said his brother, ‘and why do you thrust yourself in my way?
1	He had declaimed himself into a violent heat, and was as hoarse as he was hot.
1	Mr. Bounderby had taken possession of a house and grounds, about fifteen miles from the town, and accessible within a mile or two, by a railway striding on many arches over a wild country, undermined by deserted coal-shafts, and spotted at night by fires and black shapes of stationary engines at pits’ mouths.
1	I don't know,” returned Biddy, smiling.
1	On the third morning after their arrival, just as all the clocks in the city were striking nine individually, and somewhere about nine hundred and ninety-nine collectively, Sam was taking the air in George Yard, when a queer sort of fresh-painted vehicle drove up, out of which there jumped with great agility, throwing the reins to a stout man who sat beside him, a queer sort of gentleman, who seemed made for the vehicle, and the vehicle for him.
1	You must pardon my finding fault with you,--but why not have brought him?'
1	‘Wardle,’ said Mr. Pickwick, almost as soon as they were all seated, ‘a glass of wine in honour of this happy occasion!’ ‘I shall be delighted, my boy,’ said Wardle.
1	It was a note of a few lines, written from the couch on which she lay and enclosed to me in another from her husband, in which he seconded her entreaty with much solicitude.
1	‘If I didn’t--thinking that you were certain not to go, because you said you wouldn’t--tell Kenwigs I couldn’t come, and make up my mind to spend the evening with you!’ ‘I was obliged to go,’ said Newman.
1	Some of us can hardly expect, perhaps, in the natural course of things, to greet you on your return.
1	I have the most confused impressions of that walk.
1	‘I know that,’ said the man, ‘for I have been to the place they dwelt in, at the time of the inquest.
1	Cards of breakfast-invitation were sent out to half the English in the city of Romulus; the other half made arrangements to be under arms, as criticising volunteers, at various outer points of the solemnity.
1	Arriving at his journey’s end, he leaped out, and breathlessly announcing his errand to the servant, followed him straight into the library, we there was a great confusion of tongues, and where Mr Dombey, his sister, and Miss Tox, Richards, and Nipper, were all congregated together.
1	‘Ha!’ said he, very slowly remembering Arthur, ‘you were shut in last night?’ ‘Yes, Mr Dorrit.
1	They never asked me what religion that poor thing had followed.’ ‘My dear,’ said Mrs Milvey, aside to the Reverend Frank, ‘I wish you would talk to her.’ ‘My dear,’ said the Reverend Frank aside to his good little wife, ‘I think I will leave it to somebody else.
1	She loved me dearly, but was never happy.
1	‘And now I know what it is.
1	‘Oho, won’t you ever come and see me?’ ‘Yes, I tell you!
1	‘That’s wot he says, miss,’ replied Sam coolly.
1	‘Is my peace nothing?’ said the single gentleman.
1	The proceedings commenced by Mr Dombey, in a cravat of extraordinary height and stiffness, walking restlessly about the drawing-room until the hour appointed for dinner; punctual to which, an East India Director, of immense wealth, in a waistcoat apparently constructed in serviceable deal by some plain carpenter, but really engendered in the tailor’s art, and composed of the material called nankeen, arrived and was received by Mr Dombey alone.
1	Have I ever excused her for it?
1	But all the way home to his own hotel, the Major incessantly said to himself, and of himself, ‘Sly, Sir--sly, Sir--de-vil-ish sly!’ And when he got there, sat down in a chair, and fell into a silent fit of laughter, with which he was sometimes seized, and which was always particularly awful.
1	If Mrs Boffin (to whose countenance no disciple of Lavater could possibly for a single moment subscribe),’ with a shiver, ‘seeks to illuminate her new residence in town with the attractions of a child of mine, I am content that she should be favoured by the company of a child of mine.’ ‘You use the word, ma’am, I have myself used,’ said Rokesmith, with a glance at Bella, ‘when you speak of Miss Wilfer’s attractions there.’ ‘Pardon me,’ returned Mrs Wilfer, with dreadful solemnity, ‘but I had not finished.’ ‘Pray excuse me.’ ‘I was about to say,’ pursued Mrs Wilfer, who clearly had not had the faintest idea of saying anything more: ‘that when I use the term attractions, I do so with the qualification that I do not mean it in any way whatever.’ The excellent lady delivered this luminous elucidation of her views with an air of greatly obliging her hearers, and greatly distinguishing herself.
1	‘You see,’ said Mr. Dick, wistfully, ‘if I could exert myself, Mr. Traddles--if I could beat a drum--or blow anything!’ Poor fellow!
1	In hollow voices from Workhouse, Hospital, and jail, this truth is preached from day to day, and has been proclaimed for years.
1	I had always a sneaking kindness for these odd animals, and found a constant source of amusement, when all others failed, in watching their proceedings.
1	He’s a very good shot, ain’t he?’ ‘I’ve heard him say he’s a capital one,’ replied Mr. Pickwick, ‘but I never saw him aim at anything.’ ‘Well,’ said the host, ‘I wish he’d come.
1	‘You needn’t suppose,’ resumed Mrs. Wititterly, ‘that your looking at me in that way, Miss Nickleby, will prevent my saying what I am going to say, which I feel to be a religious duty.
1	'I am sure they would,' rejoined Oliver's benefactress; 'and Mr. Losberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well enough to bear the journey, he will carry you to see them.'
1	Thither he directed his steps,--running sometimes, and sometimes, with a strange perversity, loitering at a snail's pace, or stopping altogether and idly breaking the hedges with a stick.
1	I wonder at you, Captain, I do.’ All of which the Grinder howled forth in a lachrymose whine, and backing carefully towards the door.
1	One might have said that the shadows of avarice and distrust lengthened as his own shadow lengthened, and that the night closed around him gradually.
1	Exhausted as I am, and standing in no common need of rest, I cannot hope to close my eyes all night, unless you tell me everything.’ ‘And if I should tell you everything,’ said Newman, hesitating.
1	‘Would you, Ma’am, would you!’ said the Major, straining with vindictiveness, and swelling every already swollen vein in his head.
1	I say condoled, but her only words were "Jenny!
1	‘God bless you, old fellow!’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	‘Give me the one without a foot.
1	Gentleman's valise and hot water to Concord.
1	But, imperceptibly, though I held by them fast, Joe's hold upon them began to slacken; and whereas I wondered at this, at first, I soon began to understand that the cause of it was in me, and that the fault of it was all mine.
1	One I’m going to give the name to!’ ‘You took me by surprise,’ said Mr Rokesmith, ‘and it sounded like an omen, that you should speak of showing the Dead to one so young and blooming.’ Now, Bella suspected by this time that Mr Rokesmith admired her.
1	‘About the land, grandma.’ ‘What about the land?--Nothing the matter, is there?’ ‘No, no.
1	'I wish you had watched the play.
1	We naturally drew back and glanced at our conductress, who had been trying to open the house-door with a key she had taken from her pocket, and to whom Richard now said that as we had had the pleasure of seeing where she lived, we would leave her, being pressed for time.
1	“Where will you put me?” he asked, presently.
1	You will therefore, Bella, be entertained in the humble abode of your parents, so far in accordance with your present style of living, that there will be a drawing-room for your reception as well as a dining-room.
1	He can’t leave his bed now, so they have moved it close beside the window, and there he lies, all day: now looking at the sky, and now at his flowers, which he still makes shift to trim and water, with his own thin hands.
1	If he have the courage to stand in its place, and drive it out (he had once: being desperate), it broods upon his bed.
1	‘I wouldn’t have anybody say anything to me in that way for I don’t know how many thousand pounds.’ ‘In what way, my Georgiana?’ inquired Mrs Lammle, still smiling coolly with her eyes upon her lunch, and her eyebrows raised.
1	‘Dombey,’ said the Major, ‘you don’t eat; what’s the matter?’ ‘Thank you,’ returned the gentleman, ‘I am doing very well; I have no great appetite today.’ ‘Why, Dombey, what’s become of it?’ asked the Major.
1	It was inhabited by poor people, who set up their rest among its faded glories, as Arabs of the desert pitch their tents among the fallen stones of the Pyramids; but there was a family sentimental feeling prevalent in the Yard, that it had a character.
1	Lee-e-e-e-e!’ They run up the bank, and go down again on the other side at a fearful pace.
1	Both houses are handsomely carpeted; but the state to which these carpets are reduced by the universal disregard of the spittoon with which every honourable member is accommodated, and the extraordinary improvements on the pattern which are squirted and dabbled upon it in every direction, do not admit of being described.
1	But why one should go out to dine with one’s own daughter or sister, as if one’s under-petticoat was a blackboard, I do NOT understand.’ ‘Neither do I understand,’ retorted Mrs Wilfer, with deep scorn, ‘how a young lady can mention the garment in the name of which you have indulged.
1	He blamed himself exceedingly and told me in the most generous manner that he had been very wrong and that he begged my pardon a thousand times.
1	‘Why, what lovely hair!’ cried Miss Abbey.
1	‘I’ll try.’ ‘At least take some assistance,’ I returned, ‘until you have tried.’ ‘I could not do what I have promised, for money,’ she replied.
1	‘Another?’ says this woman, in a querulous, rattling whisper.
1	'There is something in your manner, which would almost imply that she will hear me coldly, mother,' said the young man.
1	After a short duration, the permission was most graciously conceded.
1	But the whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his nephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.
1	It must seem very strange to any one but me, and does even to me: I often feel the old sad pity for--I need not write the word--for him.
1	This is not an inspiriting close to a dull day.
1	I hope for your admission that they can do no harm.’ Passing him with a courteous reverence, specially unlike any action that Mr Fledgeby could for his life have imparted to his own head and hands, the old man began to ascend the stairs.
1	‘One child dead, and one child living: one wife dead, and one wife coming.
1	to touch that passive hand in love and friendship.
1	When that person discloses, it will not be necessary for me to know anything about it.
1	They would not be moved.
1	‘The miserable vanity of these earth-worms!’ she said, when she had so far controlled the angry heavings of her breast, that she could trust herself to speak.
1	‘It is very distressing to me, Sir, to give this information,’ said Miss Witherfield, ‘but I fear a duel is going to be fought here.’ ‘Here, ma’am?’ said the magistrate.
1	Mr Merdle took down a countess who was secluded somewhere in the core of an immense dress, to which she was in the proportion of the heart to the overgrown cabbage.
1	Joe is a dear good fellow,--in fact, I think he is the dearest fellow that ever lived,--but he is rather backward in some things.
1	‘I beg your pardon, I don’t know what I’m laughing at--yes, that’ll be very pretty--the phenomenon--who else?’ ‘Some young woman or other,’ replied the collector, rising; ‘some other friend of Henrietta Petowker’s.
1	I had had no purpose, no sustaining soul within me, anywhere.
1	‘That’s the happiness of you young people,’ she continued.
1	‘If it ain’t ready-money, were’s the use on it?’ ‘It’s a law term, that’s all,’ said the cobbler.
1	He meant his drawing the gentle head down to his pillow, and laying it beside him.
1	This must be very sore."
1	You are a blessing to us.
1	Within a month,’ said Mrs Wilfer, deepening her voice, as if she were relating a terrible ghost story, ‘within a-month, I first saw R. W. my husband.
1	very soon!’ replied the child.
1	"Well, mother dear, I say again, I hope not."
1	"Why, Sir Leicester is much the same, miss.
1	"Miss Barbary, your sole relation (in fact that is, for I am bound to observe that in law you had none) being deceased and it naturally not being to be expected that Mrs. Rachael--" "Oh, dear no!"
1	After Silas had left the shop, hat-box in hand, and had left Mr Venus to lower himself to oblivion-point with the requisite weight of tea, it greatly preyed on his ingenuous mind that he had taken this artist into partnership at all.
1	'The same reasons which influenced me then, will influence me now,' said Rose firmly.
1	Mrs. Chadband composes herself grimly by the fire and warms her knees, finding that sensation favourable to the reception of eloquence.
1	There existed proofs--proofs long suppressed--of his birth and parentage.
1	I have not the least idea.
1	‘That I see,’ observed the schoolmaster.
1	And truly if that famous period had been revived, or had ever been at all, it may be doubted whether it would have produced many more heartily admiring daughters than the poor woman.
1	Hundreds of dead and dying.
1	But another Saturday came, and on that Saturday evening she was to be at Miss Mills’s; and when Mr. Mills had gone to his whist-club (telegraphed to me in the street, by a bird-cage in the drawing-room middle window), I was to go there to tea.
1	"Circumstances," pursued Mr. Guppy, "over which I had no control, but quite the contrary, weakened the impression of that image for a time.
1	"And our lodger with you.
1	"You are out early, ma'am," said I as she curtsied to me.
1	Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea --on, on--until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a ship.
1	On the other hand, he reasoned with himself that she was just as good and just as true in love with him, as not in love with him; and that to make a kind of domesticated fairy of her, on the penalty of isolation at heart from the only people she knew, would be but a weakness of his own fancy, and not a kind one.
1	"No idea of money," observed Mr. Bucket.
1	And it's run through my fingers and gone, you see!”  holding up his dripping hand.
1	It has great merits of course, but it struck me as being rather strained and violent for its subject.
1	‘Why, I don’t exactly know about perjury, my dear sir,’ replied the little gentleman.
1	Anything but his death, I told you from the first.
1	‘Between such old and intimate friends as ourselves,’ pursues Veneering, ‘there should in such a case be no reserve.
1	One lady (a widow) was quite certain she should stab him if he hinted at it.
1	Tom waited until the crowd had dispersed, and the bustle was over; and then referred to a posted list of trains, and took counsel with porters.
1	I saw his finger uneasily going across and across his mouth during the whole of one long weary stage.
1	Mortimer looked at the boy, and the boy looked at the bran-new pilgrims on the wall, going to Canterbury in more gold frame than procession, and more carving than country.
1	Accordingly Mrs. Wititterly broke ground next morning, during a pause in the novel-reading.
1	‘Come,’ said I, ‘I’ll take you there.’ She put her hand in mine as confidingly as if she had known me from her cradle, and we trudged away together; the little creature accommodating her pace to mine, and rather seeming to lead and take care of me than I to be protecting her.
1	‘You are a chit and a little idiot,’ returned Bella, ‘or you wouldn’t make such a dolly speech.
1	We were no longer alone.
1	Though they took but a hasty breakfast, and no rest (which it would have been in vain to seek under such anxious circumstances), it was noon before they began to find the bills of Sleary’s Horse-riding on barns and walls, and one o’clock when they stopped in the market-place.
1	He went down to the river last night, with Mr. Neville, to look at the storm, and has not been back.
1	Then came the fourgon with the rest of the retainers, the heavy baggage, and as much as it could carry of the mud and dust which the other vehicles left behind.
1	There were all the young-lady workers, some with bonnets and some without, in various attitudes expressive of alarm and consternation; some gathered round Madame Mantalini, who was in tears upon one chair; and others round Miss Knag, who was in opposition tears upon another; and others round Mr. Mantalini, who was perhaps the most striking figure in the whole group, for Mr. Mantalini’s legs were extended at full length upon the floor, and his head and shoulders were supported by a very tall footman, who didn’t seem to know what to do with them, and Mr Mantalini’s eyes were closed, and his face was pale and his hair was comparatively straight, and his whiskers and moustache were limp, and his teeth were clenched, and he had a little bottle in his right hand, and a little tea-spoon in his left; and his hands, arms, legs, and shoulders, were all stiff and powerless.
1	Every description of Greek and Latin vegetable was got off the driest twigs of boys, under the frostiest circumstances.
1	Delighted admiration of Florence and Walter always overthrew the rest, and remained victorious and undisguised, unless Mr Toots made another rush into the air, and then the Captain would sit, like a remorseful culprit, until he came back again, occasionally calling upon himself, in a low reproachful voice, to ‘Stand by!’ or growling some remonstrance to ‘Ed’ard Cuttle, my lad,’ on the want of caution observable in his behaviour.
1	I remonstrated, in allusion to the epithet and the vigorous emphasis Miss Jellyby set upon it.
1	And this snort being regular in its reproduction, at length comes to be expected by the company, who make embarrassing pauses when it is falling due, and by waiting for it, render it more emphatic when it comes.
1	I see the blots I threw upon it, faded away.
1	Now you have begun to know me too, my young friend, and you may go.
1	My dear Steerforth, I am so overjoyed to see you!’ ‘And I am rejoiced to see you, too!’ he said, shaking my hands heartily.
1	'Are you going to sit snoring there, all day?'
1	'She's a shaking the shroud at me!
1	In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile.
1	Jostling against clerks going to post the day's letters, and against counsel and attorneys going home to dinner, and against plaintiffs and defendants and suitors of all sorts, and against the general crowd, in whose way the forensic wisdom of ages has interposed a million of obstacles to the transaction of the commonest business of life; diving through law and equity, and through that kindred mystery, the street mud, which is made of nobody knows what and collects about us nobody knows whence or how--we only knowing in general that when there is too much of it we find it necessary to shovel it away--the lawyer and the law-stationer come to a rag and bottle shop and general emporium of much disregarded merchandise, lying and being in the shadow of the wall of Lincoln's Inn, and kept, as is announced in paint, to all whom it may concern, by one Krook.
1	Of a Orse?’ inquired the foreign gentleman.
1	"It's what I seldom do myself," says Mr. Krook with a grin.
1	He heerd it all, and see it all.
1	said Richard with a sigh.
1	‘Again I ramble away from thinking it out to the end.
1	Free of the room, the boy was not slow in taking his departure; when he had gone, and the child was occupied in clearing the table, the old man said: ‘I haven’t seemed to thank you, sir, for what you have done to-night, but I do thank you humbly and heartily, and so does she, and her thanks are better worth than mine.
1	I have come down to look after the property; it must be sealed up, it must be protected.
1	You can get me out, if you take me so.
1	But I only the more earnestly adjure all those whose eyes may rest on these pages, to pause and reflect upon the difference between this town and those great haunts of desperate misery: to call to mind, if they can in the midst of party strife and squabble, the efforts that must be made to purge them of their suffering and danger: and last, and foremost, to remember how the precious Time is rushing by.
1	He passed one of his heavy hands over his crisp dark hair as if to sweep the broken thoughts out of his mind and sat a little forward, with one arm akimbo and the other resting on his leg, looking in a brown study at the ground.
1	You go and buy a tart--Mr. Nickleby’s man will show you where--and mind you buy a rich one.
1	But, oh, it don't matter!
1	'Now, you know what you've got to expect, master, so call away as quick as you like; the dog will soon stop that game.
1	Instead of coming up and being dead, let’s come out and look alive.
1	‘“Do!” replied the client, with sudden vehemence.
1	The Swallower said the same, and looked and spoke remarkably like an Irishman.
1	What will be, will be.
1	You remember the Peltiroguses, Kate?’ Kate saw that for the ease and comfort of the visitors it was high time to stay this flood of recollection, so answered that she entertained of the Peltiroguses a most vivid and distinct remembrance; and then said that Mr. Browdie had half promised, early in the evening, that he would sing a Yorkshire song, and that she was most impatient that he should redeem his promise, because she was sure it would afford her mama more amusement and pleasure than it was possible to express.
1	‘We have all the talking to ourselves, it seems,’ said Nicholas, looking good-humouredly round the table as he took up the cards for a fresh deal.
1	It is what YOU do.
1	She had been weeping; for the traces of the tears were still wet upon her cheek.
1	‘Yes, ma’am.’ ‘Left my home, Mr. Sawyer, three days ago, on a pretended visit to my sister, another aunt of hers, who keeps the large boarding-school, just beyond the third mile-stone, where there is a very large laburnum-tree and an oak gate,’ said the old lady, stopping in this place to dry her eyes.
1	‘That I may be very kind to her, and take great care to try to please her.
1	I can say Schoolmaster, which is a most respectable title.
1	A joker of an extremely, not to say wolfishly practical character, he looked, under those circumstances.
1	‘Now see,’ said Mr Inspector, after mature deliberation: kneeling on one knee beside the body, when they had stood looking down on the drowned man, as he had many a time looked down on many another man: ‘the way of it was this.
1	Heaven, and the Christmas Time be praised for this!
1	A portly, important-looking gentleman, dressed all in black, with a white cravat, large gold watch seals, a pair of gold eye-glasses, and a large seal-ring upon his little finger.
1	I observed that he doubled his right fist and delivered a secret blow into the crown of his cap, which was under his left arm.
1	‘Can anything be finer or more delightful?’ he inquired of Mr. Winkle.
1	‘Oh, that’s nothing,’ said Jack Hopkins.
1	The hand and the match and the voice were then seen by John Rokesmith to belong to Mr Inspector, once meditatively active in this chronicle.
1	There are various opinions on the merits, more or less conflicting with Volumnia's.
1	The people are all alike, too.
1	Drink a little drop o’ this here,’ said the Captain.
1	"Have you anything to say to me?"
1	He is surrounded by a mysterious halo of family confidences, of which he is known to be the silent depository.
1	Who forces it upon him?’ ‘Uriah,’ she replied, after a moment’s hesitation, ‘has made himself indispensable to papa.
1	Mr. Pickwick was perfectly aware that a tree is a very dangerous neighbour in a thunderstorm.
1	Did they feel any of the wonder about her, that she felt about them?
1	The Ironmaster Sir Leicester Dedlock has got the better, for the time being, of the family gout and is once more, in a literal no less than in a figurative point of view, upon his legs.
1	To him, now entered Charles Darnay, at sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand.
1	"You're a nobleman, sir," returns Krook with another taste, and his hot breath seems to come towards them like a flame.
1	Then, looking towards the glass front of the counting-house, and seeing two figures approaching, she cried with infinite relish, ‘Papa!
1	You don’t know Joseph B.
1	The transitions in real life from well-spread boards to death-beds, and from mourning-weeds to holiday garments, are not a whit less startling; only, there, we are busy actors, instead of passive lookers-on, which makes a vast difference.
1	‘I’m sorry for it,’ said Lowten.
1	The fog was much heavier than it had been in the early part of the night; and the atmosphere was so damp, that, although no rain fell, Oliver's hair and eyebrows, within a few minutes after leaving the house, had become stiff with the half-frozen moisture that was floating about.
1	A town so sacred to fact, and so triumphant in its assertion, of course got on well?
1	It was such a powerful one that it seemed quite to lift him out of his seat.
1	I am here, in a position of trust.
1	‘What’s the use of this?’ he demanded.
1	Delicacy, my dear friend, delicacy!’ And the man in blue, pulling up his neckerchief, and adjusting his coat cuffs, nodded and frowned as if there were more behind, which he could say if he liked, but was bound in honour to suppress.
1	Next, our young friends begin to think, becoming mercenary, 'This is the man who HAD pounds, who borrowed them,' which I did.
1	If there happened to be anything choice at table, she always sent it to me: but I always declined it, and ate of the rejected dishes.
1	It would do for me and Dora admirably: with a little front garden for Jip to run about in, and bark at the tradespeople through the railings, and a capital room upstairs for my aunt.
1	At once a short cut and a broad road.
1	Are you ill?’ Edith suddenly let fall her face, as if it had been stung, and while she pressed her hands upon it, a terrible tremble crept over her whole frame.
1	But he came regularly every evening and sat without his coat, with his head against the wall, as though he would have helped us if he had known how.
1	‘Why so, my lad?’ ‘Why,’ returned Rob, looking about, ‘I don’t see his shaving tackle.
1	Mr. Tupman felt that as Jingle’s popularity increased, he (Tupman) retired further into the shade.
1	“You expected,” said Miss Havisham, as she looked them over, “no premium with the boy?” “Joe!” I remonstrated, for he made no reply at all.
1	Whatever her tone with me happened to be, I could put no trust in it, and build no hope on it; and yet I went on against trust and against hope.
1	Upon which Nathaniel Pipkin determined, that, come what might, he would develop the state of his feelings, without further delay.
1	It might be difficult to give an unselfish reason for being prepossessed against him.’ ‘Not difficult for me, I think, Clennam,’ returned his partner.
1	That every possible attention has been paid to his comfort, and that he is the object of every possible solicitude, I need not assure you, Madam.
1	There’s nothing to be ashamed of; it’s a matter of mutual accommodation, nothing more.
1	‘Dear Captain Cuttle,’ said Florence, when she came out with a parcel, the size of which greatly disappointed the Captain, who had expected to see a porter following with a bale of goods, ‘I don’t want this money, indeed.
1	'She has not moved, and will not till we are gone.'
1	You recollect my mentioning Sarah, as the one that has something the matter with her spine?’ ‘Perfectly!’ ‘She clenched both her hands,’ said Traddles, looking at me in dismay; ‘shut her eyes; turned lead-colour; became perfectly stiff; and took nothing for two days but toast-and-water, administered with a tea-spoon.’ ‘What a very unpleasant girl, Traddles!’ I remarked.
1	Before Oliver had time to look round, Sikes had caught him under the arms; and in three or four seconds he and Toby were lying on the grass on the other side.
1	'I can do that pretty well, I know,' said Bolter.
1	And if from them to my hat, how it came into the state in which you see it.
1	There are dusty wooden ledges and cornices poked in and out over the altar, and over the screen and round the gallery, and over the inscription about what the Master and Wardens of the Worshipful Company did in one thousand six hundred and ninety-four.
1	‘Not that I want any inducement but yourself, Misses Brown, I’m sure.
1	There seemed to be a near affinity between us.
1	You’re her brother after all; as you told him the last time you met, he can’t alter that.’ ‘He would if he could, confound him for that and all other kindnesses,’ said the young man impatiently.
1	And when she went away in the packet before daylight, by herself--me pretending to be her servant, and seeing her safe aboard--she was just the same.
1	Long miles of road then opened out before my mind; and, toiling on, I saw a ragged way-worn boy, forsaken and neglected, who should come to call even the heart now beating against mine, his own.
1	On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when the waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason, and carried it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr. Jarvis Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived, on his way to dine with the Doctor.
1	‘A POOR widow, ma’am,’ said Ralph, with a powerful emphasis on that little adjective which conveys so much.
1	Well, say Georgeute--I mean Georgiana.’ ‘You were going to remark of Georgiana--?’ Lammle moodily hinted, after waiting in vain.
1	He had a momentary idea of knocking Scrooge down with it, holding him, and calling to the people in the court for help and a strait-waistcoat.
1	I might have felt happier if I had been.
1	"Was Miss Barbary at all connected with your ladyship's family?"
1	Stryver was rich; had married a florid widow with property and three boys, who had nothing particularly shining about them but the straight hair of their dumpling heads.
1	‘Then you knew the man before?’ ‘Not before; afterwards.
1	Tell her that I said I never could forget her gentle manner, or her beautiful face, or her sweet kind disposition that was better than all.
1	Show 'em how you scratch.
1	Mr Witherden, sir, as we have the honour to be members of the same profession--to say nothing of that other gentleman having been my lodger, and having partaken, as one may say, of the hospitality of my roof--I think you might have given me the refusal of this offer in the first instance.
1	Detaining her in his embrace, he said, ‘I may assure you now, my favourite child, that I am made happy by the sound decision at which you have arrived.
1	Oliver's clothes had been torn in the beating he had received; his face was bruised and scratched; and his hair scattered over his forehead.
1	‘Why the bookseller that sold me the Wonderful Museum--where’s the Wonderful Museum?’ He was on his knees on the floor in a moment, groping eagerly among the books.
1	He has told me in the strongest manner that he has never been his old self for one single minute since I first brought him to see you.
1	‘No, sir, I haven’t,’ replied the boy.
1	I admit that _I_ am a spy, and that it is considered a discreditable station--though it must be filled by somebody; but this gentleman is no spy, and why should he so demean himself as to make himself one?” “I play my Ace, Mr. Barsad,” said Carton, taking the answer on himself, and looking at his watch, “without any scruple, in a very few minutes.” “I should have hoped, gentlemen both,” said the spy, always striving to hook Mr. Lorry into the discussion, “that your respect for my sister--” “I could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally relieving her of her brother,” said Sydney Carton.
1	Mr Carker bared himself to the tops and bottoms of his gums: making the watchful Toodle Junior tremble more and more: and acknowledged the Instrument-maker’s politeness in his most affable manner.
1	'Go up alonger this drivelling sick man,' he says to his wife, 'and Magwitch, lend her a hand, will you?'
1	‘What,’ he repeated presently, ‘would Mr. Bounderby say?’  All the way to Stone Lodge, as with grave indignation he led the two delinquents home, he repeated at intervals ‘What would Mr. Bounderby say?’—as if Mr. Bounderby had been Mrs. Grundy.
1	On the first occasion Mr. Thomas Traddles was left--let me say, in short, in the lurch.
1	He was a strong, loose, round-shouldered, shuffling, shaggy fellow, on whom his clothes sat negligently: with a good deal of hair and whisker, deepened in its natural tint, perhaps by smoke and coal-dust: hard knotty hands: and a square forehead, as coarse in grain as the bark of an oak.
1	'Wot's come of young Bates?'
1	Then reseating himself in his chair, he watched his looks and manner: anxiously, it is true, but with the open front of a gentleman who feels he has taken no part which he need excuse or palliate.
1	‘I have been waiting,’ he begins, ‘for some time, to be summoned back to my duty near you.’ After several times forming her lips, which she knows he is closely watching, into the shape of some other hesitating reply, and then into none, she answers: ‘Duty, sir?’ ‘The duty of teaching you, serving you as your faithful music-master.’ ‘I have left off that study.’ ‘Not left off, I think.
1	How I remained on deck, staring about me, until we came alongside the dock, and how, though I had had as many eyes as Argus, I should have had them all wide open, and all employed on new objects—are topics which I will not prolong this chapter to discuss.
1	‘Have you come far this morning, gentlemen?’ inquired Mr. Pickwick.
1	He is tough to a fault is Joseph:” but it’s a great name, Sir.
1	Everybody who comes in, is glad to know him.
1	If it be at all, it can only be by one of these.” “Or both,” said Darnay.
1	Maggy counted as nobody, and she was by.
1	We had sunk our voices, almost to a whisper, and continued to speak in that tone.
1	Quite a blessing, I am sure.’ ‘Pardon me,’ returned Clennam, ‘but I am not in Mr Henry Gowan’s confidence.
1	He broke off thus in answer to Richard, who addressed him as he came into the room.
1	So ‘tis with her little bonnets and that.
1	Intelligence of the event is sent to Mr Dombey in town, who waits upon Cousin Feenix (not yet able to make up his mind for Baden-Baden), who has just received it too.
1	You took him under your roof."
1	I presented him with a half-share in my boat, which was the occasion of his often coming down to Hammersmith; and my possession of a half-share in his chambers often took me up to London.
1	‘Do you decline it, sir?’ ‘I have no alternative but to do so,’ replied Nicholas.
1	‘You will allow me, my dear, if you please, to judge for myself,’ said Mrs. Nickleby.
1	Mr. Cruncher's temper was not at all improved when he came to his breakfast.
1	Why, take a look at ‘em and see.
1	But no;’ said Sir Mulberry, stopping short.
1	This,’ referring to the little porch, ‘is better than where you were.
1	The base word money should never be breathed near it!"
1	His business with Mr Fledgeby will very soon be transacted, and then you can go up.
1	why not?’ ‘Because it would destroy all the delusion, and take away all the interest, wouldn’t it?’ replied the little man.
1	It was afterwards pretended to Mr. Wickfield, by that rascal,--and proved, too, by figures,--that he had possessed himself of the money (on general instructions, he said) to keep other deficiencies and difficulties from the light.
1	It grew fainter and fainter in the distance, and at length died away altogether; but on I bounded, through marsh and rivulet, over fence and wall, with a wild shout which was taken up by the strange beings that flocked around me on every side, and swelled the sound, till it pierced the air.
1	Now, the noise of the wheels resolved itself into some wild tune in which he could recognise scraps of airs he knew; now, there was nothing in his ears but a stunning and bewildering sound, like rushing water.
1	I have long been in Allan Woodcourt's confidence, although he was not, until yesterday, a few hours before you came here, in mine.
1	'Yes,' said the Jew, as suddenly rousing himself.
1	You heroine!’ Her own eyes filled under his praises.
1	"You see what he is!"
1	I never saw Pa take snuff before in my life, but he takes one pinch out of Mr. Turveydrop's box regularly and keeps putting it to his nose and taking it away again all the evening."
1	‘You must promise me first,’ said the schoolmaster, ‘that you’ll not be noisy, or at least, if you are, that you’ll go away and be so--away out of the village I mean.
1	Three men, who had by this time advanced some distance into the field, stopped to take counsel together.
1	When dinner was done, Mr. Wickfield taking no wine, and I desiring none, we went up-stairs; where Agnes and her little charges sang and played, and worked.
1	Tim, you villain, what do you say to that, sir?’ ‘I am jealous of both of ‘em,’ said Tim, ‘and mean to look out for another situation; so provide yourselves, gentlemen, if you please.’ Tim thought this such an exquisite, unparalleled, and most extraordinary joke, that he laid his pen upon the inkstand, and rather tumbling off his stool than getting down with his usual deliberation, laughed till he was quite faint, shaking his head all the time so that little particles of powder flew palpably about the office.
1	"I think I am, miss," she replied.
1	I’m sure she was the beautifullest creature ever was,’ said Barbara.
1	Some vagabond, supposed to be a fellow of the name of Lett, who is now, or who lately was, in prison as a felon, blew up this monument two years ago, and it is now a melancholy ruin, with a long fragment of iron railing hanging dejectedly from its top, and waving to and fro like a wild ivy branch or broken vine stem.
1	‘Let him alone, will you, Misses Brown?’ cried Rob, pushing away her hand.
1	Nonsense, I never heard of him!"
1	Issuing forth, then, upon the main, Captain Cuttle took Miss Nipper round the waist, and bore her to the island also.
1	I have wanted you, my love, most sadly.’ ‘You said you were engaged, and I stayed away,’ she answered, without turning her head.
1	‘Well,’ said that gentleman, ‘if you leave me to suggest our destination, I say Bath.
1	Oliver:  who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise, and the air, and the drink which had been forced upon him:  put his hand mechanically into that which Sikes extended for the purpose.
1	This dashing young Barnacle, in a word, was likely to become a statesman, and to make a figure.
1	But, no Hundreds of people came to see the sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain for the fulfilment of Miss Pross's prediction.
1	Then, it faltered, as if much surprised, and uttered my name, and I cried out,-- “Estella!” “I am greatly changed.
1	What has brought Mrs. Rouncewell to town so unexpectedly?
1	“Ey!” he said, “it was as good as anoother; that was a’ a matther of opinion”; and fell to looking at the fire, staring round the room, and whistling a little.
1	I would rather you dropped the subject, Phib; at the same time, I must say, that if ‘Tilda Price would take pattern by somebody--not me particularly--’ ‘Oh yes; you, miss,’ interposed Phib.
1	As I watched him in silence, he put his hand into the corner at his side, and took up a gun with a brass-bound stock.
1	It is the curse of such a nature--it is a main part of the heavy retribution on itself it bears within itself--that while deference and concession swell its evil qualities, and are the food it grows upon, resistance and a questioning of its exacting claims, foster it too, no less.
1	'Lend a hand to the girl, can't you?'
1	‘To be sure,’ rejoined Mrs. Squeers, ‘and he didn’t take anything to eat with him; that I’ll answer for.
1	Mr. Darnay presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree, but he was only One.
1	‘O’ course I know very well as no man in his right senses would suppose as anythink would make me give it up agin when I’d once got it.
1	The trooper flushes angrily and hesitates a moment, but holds out his two hands, clasped together, and says, "There!
1	You never cared for me.’ ‘Tharp’th the word!’ said Sleary, at the door.
1	But if you have that purpose, you had better stop on the threshold of your scheme.
1	Not the least eager of the eyes assembled, were the eyes of those who could not read.
1	‘“D,”’ the old woman read aloud, when he had formed the letter.
1	Mrs. Piper, as in duty bound, is of the same opinion, holding that a private station is better than public applause, and thanking heaven for her own (and, by implication, Mrs. Perkins') respectability.
1	A Hand at Cards Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded her way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the Pont-Neuf, reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases she had to make.
1	‘We should only have put one another out of countenance,’ she thought, ‘and we do that quite often enough as it is.’ Yet she had sufficient curiosity about his room, to run up to it with the least possible delay, and make a close inspection of its contents.
1	I was therefore not very much surprised when we got home, and Ada and I retired upstairs, to find Ada more silent than usual, though I was not quite prepared for her coming into my arms and beginning to speak to me, with her face hidden.
1	But I knowed you couldn't be that.” “It is just the time,” said I.
1	He had been to call upon the dear old infant--so he called Mr. Skimpole--and the dear old infant had told him where we were, and he had told the dear old infant he was bent on coming to see us, and the dear old infant had directly wanted to come too; and so he had brought him.
1	This is a five-pound note, so you will have to bring me back, ten shillings change.'
1	The old man, in aiming a purposeless blow at Mr. Guppy, or at nothing, feebly swings himself round and comes with his face against the wall.
1	Micawber don’t mean any harm, poor fellow: but, if I were you, I wouldn’t lend him anything.’ ‘My dear Copperfield,’ returned Traddles, smiling, ‘I haven’t got anything to lend.’ ‘You have got a name, you know,’ said I.
1	I must get back quickly.'
1	For though she ain’t no call to doubt my love, and doen’t--and doen’t,’ he repeated, with a quiet assurance of the truth of what he said, ‘there’s shame steps in, and keeps betwixt us.’ I read, in every word of his plain impressive way of delivering himself, new evidence of his having thought of this one topic, in every feature it presented.
1	Your mother being dead, I knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody could, and as when I had last heard of you you were on your own estate in the West Indies--whither, as you well know, you retired upon your mother's death to escape the consequences of vicious courses here--I made the voyage.
1	Hastily cloaked and muffled, and stealing away.
1	All places are alike to me, sir.
1	It showed me many new occasions on which people triumphed over me, when they made a pretence of treating me with consideration, or doing me a service.
1	I also play a game, and words are without power over it.’ Now that he was confronted with Cavalletto, and knew that his story was known--whatever thin disguise he had worn, he dropped; and faced it out, with a bare face, as the infamous wretch he was.
1	"Mr. Jarndyce," said Sir Leicester in reply as he bowed and seated himself, "I do myself the honour of calling here--" "You do ME the honour, Sir Leicester."
1	Her shoes came up at the heel, her hair grew bright and neat, her hands were always clean.
1	and I may say uncle too, all in one.
1	I protest against any one of us here who have known what we have known, and have seen what we have seen, setting up any pretension that puts Amy at a moment’s disadvantage, or to the cost of a moment’s pain.
1	But I must go elsewhere and seek what I have not found here.
1	‘I don’t remember forms or faces now, but I know the girl was beautiful.
1	"He's in all manner of places, all at wanst."
1	Mr. Guppy's eye comes back and meets Mr. Smallweed's eye.
1	Happy with your best friends, happy in your old home, happy in the power of doing a great deal of good, and happy in the undeserved love of the best of men."
1	‘A sovereign cure for the gout,’ said Mr. Pickwick, hastily producing his note-book--‘what is it?’ ‘The gout, Sir,’ replied Mr. Weller, ‘the gout is a complaint as arises from too much ease and comfort.
1	He appeared one morning in his usual agreeable way and as full of pleasant spirits as ever.
1	Theer come along one day, when I was out a-working on the land, a traveller from our own Norfolk or Suffolk in England (I doen’t rightly mind which), and of course we took him in, and giv him to eat and drink, and made him welcome.
1	We talk about the tyranny of words, but we like to tyrannize over them too; we are fond of having a large superfluous establishment of words to wait upon us on great occasions; we think it looks important, and sounds well.
1	He heard me respectfully but without much heeding these words, which I spoke a little turned from him, already on my way to the door; he was observing (this they afterwards told me) my height and figure, which seemed to catch his attention all at once.
1	There was no day; it was gone as soon as come--and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence, and short in its fleeting hours.
1	No magic dwelling-place in magic story, shut up in the heart of a thick wood, was ever more solitary and deserted to the fancy, than was her father’s mansion in its grim reality, as it stood lowering on the street: always by night, when lights were shining from neighbouring windows, a blot upon its scanty brightness; always by day, a frown upon its never-smiling face.
1	There was an universal cry of ‘Alive or dead?’ and then a deep, profound hush.
1	I will name no names, Joseph, but so they are pleased to call him up town, and I have seen that man.” “I swear I don't see him here,” said I.
1	‘Your poor brother--’ ‘My poor brother, ma’am,’ interposed Ralph tartly, ‘had no idea what business was--was unacquainted, I verily believe, with the very meaning of the word.’ ‘I fear he was,’ said Mrs. Nickleby, with her handkerchief to her eyes.
1	‘Hollo!’ said Mr. Pickwick in his turn, seeing that his companion was armed with a gun, and that another lay ready on the grass; ‘what’s going forward?’ ‘Why, your friend and I,’ replied the host, ‘are going out rook-shooting before breakfast.
1	And in illustration it may be observed, that if Mr Brass, not being over-suspicious, had, without prying and listening, left his sister to manage the conference on their joint behalf, or prying and listening, had not been in such a mighty hurry to anticipate her (which he would not have been, but for his distrust and jealousy), he would probably have found himself much better off in the end.
1	So successful were his efforts, that even the deaf old lady insisted on having one or two of his best jokes retailed through the trumpet; and even she condescended to observe to the spinster aunt, that ‘He’ (meaning Jingle) ‘was an impudent young fellow:’ a sentiment in which all her relations then and there present thoroughly coincided.
1	He brought his gun with him, as a curiosity.
1	‘Oh, thank’ee, Mrs Richards, don’t it!’ returned the sharp girl.
1	“Barkis is willin’,” says you.’ This extremely artful suggestion Mr. Barkis accompanied with a nudge of his elbow that gave me quite a stitch in my side.
1	I would unhesitatingly mention Mr. Vholes.
1	‘Might you be looking for a Boarding-House?’ Pleasant inquired, taking her observant stand on one side of the fire.
1	We thought you were dead!’ ‘Not yet,’ said Mr. Murdstone.
1	It is the first time that the house has been arranged for occupation since its late changes, and the happy pair are looked for every minute.
1	‘Here, wait a minute, Uncle,’ he continued, catching up a candle, ‘till I run upstairs, and get another jacket on, and then I’ll be off.
1	He immediately looked at the dish and began to carve.
1	It had remained so for a long time.
1	‘She was born in Hanover, New Hampshire, on the twenty-first of December, 1829.
1	"To whom will our debt be transferred?"
1	“Truly, you did well,” said the Marquis, felicitously sensible that such vermin were not to ruffle him, “to see a thief accompanying my carriage, and not open that great mouth of yours.
1	Only hear what I have got to say--only hear me.’ ‘How did you come in our garden?’ faltered the housemaid.
1	If we had come up with them this morning,’ he continued, after a thoughtful pause, ‘I was ready to prove a pretty good claim.
1	‘It was crammed into my mouth.’ ‘Who crammed it?’ asked Miss Jenny.
1	Now, I observed that evening, as I had observed for some days past, that Ada and Richard were more than ever attached to each other's society, which was but natural, seeing that they were going to be separated so soon.
1	replied the man, glaring at the opposite wall.
1	That perils had thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and faster yet, he of course knew now.
1	Having entreated the old lady and gentleman to set their minds at rest on these absorbing points, for they might rely on his statement being the correct one, Mr Chuckster entertained them with theatrical chit-chat and the court circular; and so wound up a brilliant and fascinating conversation which he had maintained alone, and without any assistance whatever, for upwards of three-quarters of an hour.
1	‘I wish we had gone before.
1	Dear Mr Clennam, I have written a great deal about myself, but I must write a little more still, or what I wanted most of all to say in this weak letter would be left out of it.
1	Poor Nell!’ Mr Quilp unintentionally adopted the very best means he could have devised for the recovery of his young visitor, by patting her on the head.
1	But that makes no difference in their following their own religion and leaving all of us to ours.
1	‘Stand out of the way, dog.
1	Why should Barbara be cross?
1	_You_ are the child, are you?’ ‘Yes, ma’am.’ ‘I am sorry I haven’t got anything for you,’ said the milliner, shaking her head.
1	But it might have done, if he could have read them.
1	Yes, I see my way now, right on."
1	Mr Boffin wishes you to know that he does not expect you to stay at home any evening, on the chance of his coming.
1	I seemed to pay the deepest attention to him, but I was wandering in a garden of Eden all the while, with Dora.
1	‘And pray, sir,’ said she, ‘if I may venture to ask a question appertaining to any subject on which you show reserve—which is indeed hardy in me, for I well know you have a reason for everything you do—have you received intelligence respecting the robbery?’ ‘Why, ma’am, no; not yet.
1	Pat his back, if you please.’ ‘Of course you think,’ said Berry, gently doing what she was asked, ‘that he has been nursed by his mother, too?’ ‘Betsey Jane,’ returned Mrs Wickam in her most solemn tones, ‘was put upon as that child has been put upon, and changed as that child has changed.
1	Oh!” for I was going to thank him, “I tell you at once, I am paid for my services, or I shouldn't render them.
1	‘I have an idea upon this subject,’ said Mr. Pott, ‘which I think may be very successfully adopted.
1	"I take upon myself, sir," said my guardian, laughing as he rang the bell, "to reply to your proposals on behalf of Miss Summerson.
1	Such weighing and mixing and chopping and grating, such dusting and washing and polishing, such snipping and weeding and trowelling and other small gardening, such making and mending and folding and airing, such diverse arrangements, and above all such severe study!
1	Is that it?’ said the schoolmaster.
1	It was a dry cold night, and the wind blew keenly, and the frost was white and hard.
1	‘I blame him for not living an hour longer.
1	Mr. Tulkinghorn goes upstairs, saying to himself, "These women were created to give trouble the whole earth over.
1	Condemned to a passage through the world by such narrow little dimly-lighted ways, and picking up so few specks or spots on the road!
1	Bright and happy as it was, there was something solemn in the long, deserted streets, from which, like bodies without souls, all habitual character and expression had departed, leaving but one dead uniform repose, that made them all alike.
1	"Oh, my dear Spyers, only let me have wengeance, and I shall die contented!
1	‘You are there, are you, my friend?’ he repeated, greedily biting his nails.
1	What we have said tonight is never to be said more.
1	"Nor I," said Richard moodily.
1	We fancy, too, that we can discern at the very end of the notes, some indistinct reference to ‘broiled bones’; and then the words ‘cold’ ‘without’ occur: but as any hypothesis we could found upon them must necessarily rest upon mere conjecture, we are not disposed to indulge in any of the speculations to which they may give rise.
1	Who did you want, ma’am?’ ‘Miss Dorrit.
1	Miss Dombey, Captain Gills is a friend of mine; and during the interval that is now elapsing, I believe it would afford Captain Gills pleasure to see me occasionally coming backwards and forwards here.
1	Again, Miss Murdstone, in a black velvet gown, that looks as if it had been made out of a pall, follows close upon me; then my mother; then her husband.
1	'Do you hear his worship ask if you've anything to say?'
1	As to me--will you never understand that I am incorrigible?” He asked the question with some appearance of scorn.
1	On the whole we deemed it the better course to lie where we were, until within an hour or so of the steamer's time, and then to get out in her track, and drift easily with the tide.
1	Now, my dear, put your arm a little further through mine, and hold it steady, and I shan't hurt you!"
1	“Take it in your right hand.
1	‘You have the head of two men.’ ‘My sex disqualifies me,’ she proceeded with merely a slight turn of her eyes in Jeremiah’s direction, ‘from taking a responsible part in the business, even if I had the ability; and therefore Mr Flintwinch combines my interest with his own, and conducts it.
1	It rose to such a height that he would have blindly encountered almost any risk, rather than meet the man of whom, two hours ago, he had been utterly regardless.
1	‘Do you hear, cook?’ said the lady abbess, stamping her foot impatiently.
1	We have all been mistaken over and over again.
1	The breakfast passed off in silence, for each of the party was brooding over his, or her, own personal grievances.
1	Mr Carker presently tried a canter; Rob was still in attendance.
1	But she was so affectionate and sweet-natured, and had such a pleasant manner of being both sly and shy at once, that she captivated me more than ever.
1	Pison yourself, Samivel, my boy, pison yourself, and you’ll be glad on it arterwards.’ With these affecting words, Mr. Weller looked steadfastly on his son, and turning slowly upon his heel, disappeared from his sight.
1	Everything sloped the wrong way: which in itself was an aggravation scarcely to be borne.
1	With all the novelty of my emancipation on me, I went to church with Joe, and thought perhaps the clergyman wouldn't have read that about the rich man and the kingdom of Heaven, if he had known all.
1	‘A place to live, and learn to live, and gather health of mind and body in,’ said the schoolmaster; ‘for this old house is yours.’ ‘Ours!’ cried the child.
1	I am not going to be eyed as if I had come from the Boffins, and sit silent under it.
1	‘You may consider yourself very fortunate in having escaped him so easily.
1	‘And what,’ asked Mr. Gradgrind, in a still lower voice, ‘did you read to your father, Jupe?’ ‘About the Fairies, sir, and the Dwarf, and the Hunchback, and the Genies,’ she sobbed out; ‘and about—’ ‘Hush!’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘that is enough.
1	It was a regular place of public entertainment for the poorer classes; a tavern where there was nothing to pay; a public breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper all the year round; a brick and mortar elysium, where it was all play and no work.
1	Know nothing of money questions.
1	Here am I, content to receive things childishly as they fall out, and I never take trouble!
1	Let me fall upon the ground!’  And he laid her down there, and saw the pride of his heart and the triumph of his system, lying, an insensible heap, at his feet.
1	Grant that he did foresee them; and even the cruelty to me—and who am I!—John Jasper, Music Master, vanishes!’— Once more, Mr. Grewgious could not but assent to this.
1	At these words Richard Swiviller withdrew his eyes from Mr Chegg’s face, and travelling down the middle of his nose and down his waistcoat and down his right leg, reached his toes again, and carefully surveyed him; this done, he crossed over, and coming up the other leg, and thence approaching by the waistcoat as before, said when had got to his eyes, ‘No sir, I haven’t.’ ‘Oh, indeed, sir!’ said Mr Cheggs.
1	After that, she took the baby out of its little cradle, and nursed it.
1	‘Nature of knowledge, Mr. Tartar?’ ‘I thought he seemed to be a young fellow in a poor way, and I asked his leave—only within a day or so—to share my flowers up there with him; that is to say, to extend my flower-garden to his windows.’ ‘Would you have the kindness to take seats?’ said Mr. Grewgious.
1	‘I am sure you would not.
1	If Wal’r was here--’ ‘Ah!
1	He never even seemed to come to his work on purpose, but would slouch in as if by mere accident; and when he went to the Jolly Bargemen to eat his dinner, or went away at night, he would slouch out, like Cain or the Wandering Jew, as if he had no idea where he was going and no intention of ever coming back.
1	You’re never safe vith ‘em, Mr. Pickwick, ven they vunce has designs on you; there’s no knowin’ vere to have ‘em; and vile you’re a-considering of it, they have you.
1	‘Not so poor as you think, my dear,’ returned Bella, ‘if you knew all.’ Indeed, though attained by some wonderful winding narrow stairs, which seemed to have been erected in a pure white chimney, and though very low in the ceiling, and very rugged in the floor, and rather blinking as to the proportions of its lattice window, it was a pleasanter room than that despised chamber once at home, in which Bella had first bemoaned the miseries of taking lodgers.
1	John Chivery, in his best clothes, with his tall hat under his arm, his ivory-handled cane genteelly embarrassing his deportment, and a bundle of cigars in his hand!
1	That’s aw enden ’twixt him and me.’ ‘Have you left his work, Stephen?’ asked Rachael, anxiously and quickly.
1	It seems you do not understand, or (so far as your power can go) intend that each of us shall take a separate course; and you expect from me instead, a homage you will never have.’ Although her face was still the same, there was emphatic confirmation of this ‘Never’ in the very breath she drew.
1	As, whenever the Reverend Septimus fell a-musing, his good mother took it to be an infallible sign that he ‘wanted support,’ the blooming old lady made all haste to the dining-room closet, to produce from it the support embodied in a glass of Constantia and a home-made biscuit.
1	Desperately, but not wildly, for she knew that if she lost distinctness of intention, all was lost and gone.
1	He would take the assertion of that honourable Pickwickian whose voice he had just heard--it was celebrated; but if the fame of that treatise were to extend to the farthest confines of the known world, the pride with which he should reflect on the authorship of that production would be as nothing compared with the pride with which he looked around him, on this, the proudest moment of his existence.
1	This poor ailing little creature has come to be what she is, surrounded by drunken people from her cradle--if she ever had one, Charley.’ ‘I don’t see what you have to do with her, for all that,’ said the boy.
1	"Among them odd heaps of old papers, this gentleman, when he comes into the property, naturally begins to rummage, don't you see?"
1	Bleeding Heart Yard had been harrowed by Mr Pancks, and cropped by Mr Casby, at the regular seasons; Mr Pancks had taken all the drudgery and all the dirt of the business as _his_ share; Mr Casby had taken all the profits, all the ethereal vapour, and all the moonshine, as his share; and, in the form of words which that benevolent beamer generally employed on Saturday evenings, when he twirled his fat thumbs after striking the week’s balance, ‘everything had been satisfactory to all parties--all parties--satisfactory, sir, to all parties.’ The Dock of the Steam-Tug, Pancks, had a leaden roof, which, frying in the very hot sunshine, may have heated the vessel.
1	That was what I meant, I acknowledged, though he was a very harmless person, even when we had had more of him.
1	It wouldn’t be respectable.’ Animated by this reflection, he stumps faster, and looks a long way before him, as a man with an ambitious project in abeyance often will do.
1	She had gone singing through the dim rooms, and moving with gay and lightsome step among their dusty treasures, making them older by her young life, and sterner and more grim by her gay and cheerful presence.
1	There is no doubt whatever that I was a lackadaisical young spooney; but there was a purity of heart in all this, that prevents my having quite a contemptuous recollection of it, let me laugh as I may.
1	I had never, at that time, seen such a metallic lady altogether as Miss Murdstone was.
1	She had obeyed without a murmur.
1	You’ll ask me how I make out about the pockets?
1	"I hope this marriage is for the best, guardian," said I when we three were on our road home.
1	On the present festive occasion he emerged from his room, when the blithe bells were going, the picture of misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitentials.
1	'Look at his togs, Fagin!'
1	There was another consultation a long way off, or else Paul dreamed it again; and then the Apothecary, coming back with Doctor and Mrs Blimber, said: ‘Yes, I think, Doctor Blimber, we may release this young gentleman from his books just now; the vacation being so very near at hand.’ ‘By all means,’ said Doctor Blimber.
1	‘Your husband, I take it, is not at home?’ he said.
1	You may know a black common fellow, or a black common boaster, when you see him (and no doubt you have a large acquaintance that way); but you are no judge of white men.’ This insulting allusion to his dark skin infuriates Neville to that violent degree, that he flings the dregs of his wine at Edwin Drood, and is in the act of flinging the goblet after it, when his arm is caught in the nick of time by Jasper.
1	When they turned into a narrow street, Stephen glanced at his window with a dread that always haunted his desolate home; but it was open, as he had left it, and no one was there.
1	No gracious ray of light is seen to fall on Florence, kneeling at the altar with her timid head bowed down.
1	And I hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand (as a clerk of your acquaintance has expanded) into a partner.
1	They were the happiest—O, of all the happy times we had together, sir!’ It was only now when her sorrow broke out, that Louisa looked at her.
1	A handsome little dinner was served immediately, and Mr Lammle sat sparkling at his end of the table, with his servant behind his chair, and HIS ever-lingering doubts upon the subject of his wages behind himself.
1	‘This, sir,’ said Bounderby, ‘is my wife, Mrs. Bounderby: Tom Gradgrind’s eldest daughter.
1	Herbert was my intimate companion and friend.
1	Sitting near her, with the white shoe, that had never been worn, in her hand, and her head bent as she looked at it, was an elegant lady whom I had never seen.
1	It was a curious little green box on four wheels, with a low place like a wine-bin for two behind, and an elevated perch for one in front, drawn by an immense brown horse, displaying great symmetry of bone.
1	He made up his mouth as if to whistle, but he didn’t whistle.
1	‘They were made for one another,’ said the Captain, mournfully; ‘but what signifies that now!’ ‘Upon my word and honour,’ cried Mr Toots, blurting out his words through a singular combination of awkward chuckles and emotion, ‘I’m even more sorry than I was before.
1	Oh, haven’t I got him!
1	April Fool Day after that, I says, 'Now, old chap, you're two and a eight in it.'
1	“Seven?” “And four?” “And eight?” “And six?” “And two?” “And ten?” And so on.
1	‘I am not doing office-work, Master Copperfield,’ said Uriah.
1	And Physician said, decidedly, yes he did.
1	The back of the establishment, though the chief entrance was there, so contracted that it merely represented in its connexion with the front, the handle of a flat iron set upright on its broadest end.
1	Any dinner, Jack?’ Mr. Jasper opens a door at the upper end of the room, and discloses a small inner room pleasantly lighted and prepared, wherein a comely dame is in the act of setting dishes on table.
1	‘Of course you know the Banker well?’ ‘Yes, sir,’ rejoined Mrs. Sparsit.
1	Crossing a courtyard which was all noise and bustle, and passing a couple of porters who seemed dressed to match the red fire engine which was wheeled away into a corner, they passed into an office where their business was to be transacted, and where Pell and Mr. Flasher left them standing for a few moments, while they went upstairs into the Will Office.
1	I could myself have kneeled down then, so far away, and blessed him in my rapture that he should be so truly good and brave.
1	With her own sweet tranquillity, she calmed my agitation; led me back to the time of our parting; spoke to me of Emily, whom she had visited, in secret, many times; spoke to me tenderly of Dora’s grave.
1	I seem to have been gone a twelvemonth!
1	As the tall man suddenly got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt.
1	‘Now, my dear sir--my dear sir,’ interposed the busy little man.
1	Is there no one there?’ ‘I left my dear young lady out of bed late last night,’ said Susan, nothing checked, ‘and I knew why, for you was ill Sir and she didn’t know how ill and that was enough to make her wretched as I saw it did.
1	Mr. Vholes hereupon addressed me again.
1	I want to speak to you.’ Behold me, on my gallant grey, bending at the side of Miss Mills, with my hand upon the carriage door!
1	There is a meagre tree outside, where the sparrows are chirping a little; and there is a blackbird in an eyelet-hole of sun in a dyer’s garret, over against the window, who whistles loudly whilst the service is performing; and there is the man with the wooden leg stumping away.
1	"No offence, sir," said Mr. George.
1	Looking after this man, Eugene saw him go in at the door by which he himself had just come out.
1	In trying and doubtful positions, youth, custom, a steady contemplation of the difficulties which surround us, and a familiarity with them, imperceptibly diminish our apprehensions and beget comparative indifference, if not a vague and reckless confidence in some relief, the means or nature of which we care not to foresee.
1	‘Thankee, sir,’ he said, taking it back.
1	I had kept Mr. Woodcourt's flowers.
1	I am not afraid of him, I am not proud, I am ready to take care of him, and shall not ill-treat him as some people (besides the asylum-folks) have done.” After a good deal of squabbling,’ said my aunt, ‘I got him; and he has been here ever since.
1	he’s a doing beautiful!’ responded Polly.
1	‘Say what you like,’ answered Mrs Gowan.
1	Then she sat swaying her body to and fro, and making gestures with her unnerved arm, which seemed intended as the accompaniment to a fit of laughter, though her face was stolid and drowsy.
1	"I don't know," says Sir Leicester, opening his eyes, "why Mr. Tulkinghorn should be worked to death.
1	Whereas she had put the lump of coarse bread into the swart, scaled, knotted hands of John Baptist (who had scarcely as much nail on his eight fingers and two thumbs as would have made out one for Monsieur Rigaud), with ready confidence; and, when he kissed her hand, had herself passed it caressingly over his face.
1	I were a coming to ’t.
1	Of her, however, Mr. Lillyvick took no notice: rather striving (so, at least, it seemed to Newman Noggs) to evade her observation, and to shrink into himself whenever he attracted her regards.
1	If, as your cousin Feenix says, the sword wears out the what’s-its-name--’ ‘The scabbard, perhaps,’ said Edith.
1	It was dated an hour and a half before dinner.
1	‘Show me one, and try,’ rejoined Squeers.
1	Unfortunates with wrongs, or with projects for the general welfare (and they had better have had wrongs at first, than have taken that bitter English recipe for certainly getting them), who in slow lapse of time and agony had passed safely through other public departments; who, according to rule, had been bullied in this, over-reached by that, and evaded by the other; got referred at last to the Circumlocution Office, and never reappeared in the light of day.
1	Oliver's heart sank at sight of her; for she had never left the bedside of her niece; and he trembled to think what change could have driven her away.
1	Miss Mowcher is down here.’ ‘Who?’ cried Steerforth, much astonished.
1	I am Mr Boffin’s Secretary.
1	Having delivered himself to this effect, Mr. Snodgrass bowed again, looked into the crown of his hat, and stepped towards the door.
1	Nothing but your wife.’ The light hand stole about his neck, and the voice came nearer--nearer.
1	‘Here; I’ll keep you company; come along!’ And away went the good-tempered old fellow down the slide, with a rapidity which came very close upon Mr. Weller, and beat the fat boy all to nothing.
1	'I am going to sit here, as long as I think proper, ma'am,' rejoined Mr. Bumble; 'and although I was _not_ snoring, I shall snore, gape, sneeze, laugh, or cry, as the humour strikes me; such being my prerogative.'
1	I am afraid we present opportunities to people to do wrong, that never ought to be presented.
1	If I am not, in a general way, as sensible as my friends could wish me to be, or as I could wish myself, I really am, upon my word and honour, particularly sensible of what is considerate and kind.
1	I will not tell you what misery he underwent, what agony of soul he knew, how great his mental struggle was.
1	The poor room was a happy room that morning.
1	‘Ith a fact,’ said Sleary, ‘and even knowin’ it, you couldn’t put your finger on him.
1	You needn’t hurry back, my love, if there is, for we don’t dine just yet, and there’s plenty of time.
1	The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had set it going.
1	I will mention the matter to-morrow morning when I take my seat."
1	Not that her sister noticed it; for she was divided between regret at the coming separation, and a lingering wish that she had been included in the plans for visiting England.
1	‘I’ve come on very fast, considering.’ ‘_You_ have come fast, considering!’ retorted Quilp; ‘you creep, you dog, you crawl, you measure distance like a worm.
1	The deeper he sank into this silence, the fainter hope there was--or so Darnay thought--of his softening in any slight degree.
1	Every petty tradesman is to begin to pity her now, is he?
1	Kit was disposed to be out of temper, as the best of us are too often--but he looked at the youngest child who was sleeping soundly, and from him to his other brother in the clothes-basket, and from him to their mother, who had been at work without complaint since morning, and thought it would be a better and kinder thing to be good-humoured.
1	“And if, Sir,” said the tenant, calling after him, “if you _would _have the goodness to suggest to the other ladies and gentlemen who are now engaged in haunting old empty houses, that they might be much more comfortable elsewhere, you will confer a very great benefit on society.” “I will,” replied the ghost; “we must be dull fellows--very dull fellows, indeed; I can’t imagine how we can have been so stupid.” With these words, the spirit disappeared; and what is rather remarkable,’ added the old man, with a shrewd look round the table, ‘he never came back again.’ ‘That ain’t bad, if it’s true,’ said the man in the Mosaic studs, lighting a fresh cigar.
1	I do assure you, father, that our first wish and intention is to consider your comfort.
1	But I have not the present means of raising the sum you have demanded.
1	‘Which friend?’ ‘Never mind,’ said Mr Fledgeby, shutting up one eye, ‘any of your friends, all your friends.
1	‘Oh, of course,’ said Jingle.
1	How glad he is to see us!
1	His dread and hatred of the place became so intense that he felt it a labour to draw his breath in it.
1	Then, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character, he said, in pity for his former self, "Poor boy!"
1	They was, to be sure and bring a note to you, Mr Carker, before you went out in the morning.
1	“What a number o’ cats you keep, Mr. Brooks,” says I, when I’d got intimate with him.
1	There was a low cinder fire in a rusty, unfixed grate; and an old three-cornered stained table, with some medicine bottles, a broken glass, and a few other domestic articles, was drawn out before it.
1	Mr Richard, sir--’ Dick, glancing at Miss Sally, saw that she was making signals to him, to acquaint her brother with the subject of their recent conversation.
1	He had found Coavinses in his way.
1	She tapped me several times upon the arm and nodded good-humouredly as if she were anxious I should understand that I had no cause to fear her, though she spoke so gloomily, and confided these awful secrets to me.
1	What proof had he of this?
1	Talk about somebody else.’ As Rob took another cautious survey of the yard, the old woman made a secret motion to her daughter.
1	She renewed the acquaintance of Mr and Mrs Boffin, as if Mr and Mrs Boffin had said of her what she had said of them, and as if Time alone could quite wear her injury out.
1	‘Now, you see, Rokesmith,’ he went on, ‘a literary man--WITH a wooden leg--is liable to jealousy.
1	He is in his humble way a public man, but it is not in that sphere that he finds happiness.
1	And I’ll swear it!’ ‘Where did he tell you so?’ ‘Outside,’ replied Riderhood, always beating it out, with his head determinedly set askew, and his eyes watchfully dividing their attention between his two auditors, ‘outside the door of the Six Jolly Fellowships, towards a quarter after twelve o’clock at midnight--but I will not in my conscience undertake to swear to so fine a matter as five minutes--on the night when he picked up the body.
1	Drat it all, thot’s what I want to know.’ So, in order that he might begin to enjoy himself at once, and lose no time, Mr. Browdie gave his wife a hearty kiss, and succeeded in wresting another from Miss Squeers, after a maidenly resistance of scratching and struggling on the part of that young lady, which was not quite over when they reached the Saracen’s Head.
1	“Doctor Manette, look upon the prisoner.
1	‘The old man uttered a loud yell which rang through the lonely fields like the howl of an evil spirit.
1	‘This is an old room,’ he remarked, with a sudden sprightliness of manner, looking round when he got near the door, ‘I have been so interested that I have not observed it.
1	And yet he was so terrible a man!
1	The children creep out of the temporary hut, which is like a gipsy tent upon the ground, and clap their hands and shout.
1	'If I could have done so, without doing heavy wrong to him I loved,' rejoined Rose, 'I could have--' 'Have received this declaration very differently?'
1	And why, my young friend?"
1	By way of being very knowing, and humouring him to the top of his bent, I went to the window, which commanded a beautiful prospect, and remarked, with an address upon which I greatly plumed myself: ‘What a delicious country you have about these lodgings of yours!’ ‘Poh!’ said he, moving his fingers carelessly over the notes of his instrument: ‘_Well enough for such an Institution as this_!’ I don’t think I was ever so taken aback in all my life.
1	Everything seemed altered as he ran along the streets.
1	So the dream increased in rapture every hour, as Mr Dorrit felt increasingly sensible that this connection had brought him forward indeed.
1	She slightly showed me her arm, and it was fearfully thin indeed.
1	"Am I to read it now?"
1	Physician was close upon him, and looked round the door too.
1	He was merely collecting himself to speak very plainly.
1	Mrs General’s dreams ought to have been varnished--if she had any--lying asleep in the arms of the good Saint Bernard, with the feathery snow falling on his house-top.
1	‘If you knew what I am undergoing for you!’ ‘Of course he knows it, love, and will never forget it,’ said Miss Ledrook.
1	I could not hear her disrespectfully mentioned, I added, without expressing my opinion in a decided tone.
1	‘Who is to begin?’ ‘I’ll begin,’ said Riderhood, ‘when I’ve smoked this here pipe out.’ He finished it with great deliberation, knocked out the ashes on the hob, and put it by.
1	In a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field, in among the piled mountains of cloud.
1	Don't let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some more of me.
1	“I sat with Provis last night, Handel, two good hours.” “Where was Clara?” “Dear little thing!” said Herbert.
1	The waiter retired, considerably astonished, and Mr. Pickwick motioned Jackson to a seat.
1	Let us make haste back.’ ‘Certainly!’ cried Brass, ‘the quicker, the better.
1	He sometimes took them to the street where she had lived; but new improvements had altered it so much, it was not like the same.
1	"And I said," I timidly reminded him, "but its mistress remained."
1	‘He went off dead.’ ‘Oh, that indeed,’ said Sam.
1	On my hurrying to speak to him and learn what had happened, he told me, after a word or two of preparation, that there had been a discovery at Sir Leicester Dedlock's.
1	It was quite as cadaverous as it had looked in the window, though in the grain of it there was that tinge of red which is sometimes to be observed in the skins of red-haired people.
1	It was profoundly dark; perplexed, with great beams, crossing and recrossing it at every possible angle; and through the broad chinks and crevices in the floor, the rapid river gleamed, far down below, like a legion of eyes.
1	‘I do, indeed,’ replied Doctor Slammer.
1	Such opportunities as I have been enabled to alienate from my domestic duties, I have devoted to corresponding at some length with my family.
1	It is disgraceful to the electors.
1	For is it likely that any human creature in his right senses would so lay himself open to be pointed at, by what I call the finger of scorn?’ Mr. Jasper shakes his head.
1	All sorts of vehicles of burden are in attendance, from a tilted waggon to a wheelbarrow.
1	Nevertheless, we moved onward, dexterously; and being well wrapped up, bade defiance to the weather, and enjoyed the journey.
1	I have never pampered myself, and should not be ill.
1	So I used to come out at night after they’d gone to bed, and feel about in the dark for bits of biscuit, or sangwitches that you’d left in the office, or even pieces of orange peel to put into cold water and make believe it was wine.
1	I know weel that if I was a lyin parisht i’ th’ road, yo’d feel it right to pass me by, as a forrenner and stranger.
1	Mr. Stiggins did not desire his hearers to be upon their guard against those false prophets and wretched mockers of religion, who, without sense to expound its first doctrines, or hearts to feel its first principles, are more dangerous members of society than the common criminal; imposing, as they necessarily do, upon the weakest and worst informed, casting scorn and contempt on what should be held most sacred, and bringing into partial disrepute large bodies of virtuous and well- conducted persons of many excellent sects and persuasions.
1	I could have made my profit.
1	Then he laughed about her, and asked me if I had ever seen such a fierce little piece of incomprehensibility.
1	Florence had often wished to speak to this man; yet she had never taken courage to do so, as he made no movement towards her.
1	Now it is even awful, stealing through it, to think of the live people who have slept in the solitary bedrooms, to say nothing of the dead.
1	All this he did, methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he could make.
1	Speaking as a sufferer by both, I don’t know that I wouldn’t as soon have the Merdle lot as your lot.
1	“'Do you honour me with your attention, Doctor?'
1	Sing out, “good-bye, Captain Cuttle,” when you’re in the passage, and shut the door.
1	As Mr. Grewgious’s idea of looking at a furnished lodging was to get on the opposite side of the street to a house with a suitable bill in the window, and stare at it; and then work his way tortuously to the back of the house, and stare at that; and then not go in, but make similar trials of another house, with the same result; their progress was but slow.
1	‘You can, if you like, you know,’ said Steerforth.
1	Oh, you Jew!’ The old man stood irresolute and uncertain for a moment, as if there might be further instructions for him in reserve.
1	It was all said in a moment, and they took me between them, wrapped in the cloak.
1	I am of your way of thinkin’.’ ‘Don’t make such a noise at this dead hour of the night.
1	‘But I am not like you.’ The Father of the Marshalsea said, with a shrug of modest self-depreciation, ‘Oh!
1	Oliver did as the old lady bade him; and, although she lamented grievously, meanwhile, that there was not even time to crimp the little frill that bordered his shirt-collar; he looked so delicate and handsome, despite that important personal advantage, that she went so far as to say:  looking at him with great complacency from head to foot, that she really didn't think it would have been possible, on the longest notice, to have made much difference in him for the better.
1	And wot little a man did get, would never prosper with him, Mr. Lorry.
1	She’s a very taking and agreeable woman?’ Conscience smote the gentle Twemlow pale.
1	I shall come home when I please, and go when I please.
1	I counted up to high numbers, to make sure of myself, and repeated passages that I knew in prose and verse.
1	And my guardian put a letter in my hand, without any ordinary beginning such as "My dear Jarndyce," but rushing at once into the words, "I swear if Miss Summerson do not come down and take possession of my house, which I vacate for her this day at one o'clock, P.M.," and then with the utmost seriousness, and in the most emphatic terms, going on to make the extraordinary declaration he had quoted.
1	St!’ They are in the act of ratifying the treaty of friendly move, by shaking hands upon it.
1	Is it true?” “Too true.” “Can I only serve you, Pip, by serving your friend?
1	‘You can bear me out in that, Sir?’ ‘Eh?’ cried Brass, looking from face to face with an expression of stupid amazement.
1	‘I won’t be silent,’ returned the nurse.
1	“He keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table.
1	Walking along the Strand, afterwards, and observing a hard mottled substance in the window of a ham and beef shop, which resembled marble, but was labelled ‘Mock Turtle’, I went in and bought a slab of it, which I have since seen reason to believe would have sufficed for fifteen people.
1	Your healths, gentlemen.’ With this expression of his feelings, Mr. Solomon Pell laid three small written cards before Mr. Weller’s friends, and, looking at the clock again, feared it was time to be walking.
1	'The cutting away when there's anything wrong, and the eating all the wittles when there's everything right; is that his branch?'
1	‘I should have thought the deadness was a mild word for it, if it had been named to me when we brought you in.
1	"Did you know this morning, now, that you were coming out on this errand?"
1	"An old acquaintance of yours, this road, Miss Summerson," said Mr. Bucket cheerfully.
1	A yellow-faced old gentleman from India, is going to take unto himself a young wife this morning, and six carriages full of company are expected, and Mrs Miff has been informed that the yellow-faced old gentleman could pave the road to church with diamonds and hardly miss them.
1	Three tumbrils faring away with their dread loads over the hushing snow.
1	On this point, as well as on all other possible points, Mr. Dick was convinced that my aunt was the wisest and most wonderful of women; as he repeatedly told me with infinite secrecy, and always in a whisper.
1	A fish of the sea or river?
1	So, as she slightly laughed and afterwards sat looking at the rain, she was as self-possessed and as free to occupy herself with her own thoughts as if she had been alone.
1	‘There’s a pair on ‘em, sir.’ ‘Jingle suspected my design, and set that fellow on you, with this story, I suppose?’ said Mr. Pickwick, half choking.
1	So the time went on; until it happened that Mr. Bounderby was called away from home by business which required his presence elsewhere, for three or four days.
1	For, all things moved so fast, and decree followed decree with that fierce precipitation, that now upon the third night of the autumn month of September, patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of Monseigneur's house, and had marked it with the tri-colour, and were drinking brandy in its state apartments.
1	Do you never hear any haunted noises here?’ ‘Noises,’ returned Mr Flintwinch.
1	"Secondly, what will satisfy you for the trouble of producing it?"
1	‘Yes,’ said my mother, faintly.
1	As long as eating was a novelty and an amusement, Maggy kept up pretty well.
1	Over and above that, Mistress Affery, by some means (it was not very difficult to guess, through the sharp arguments of her liege lord), had acquired such a lively conviction of the hazard of saying anything under any circumstances, that she had remained all this time in a corner guarding herself from approach with that symbolical instrument of hers; so that, when a word or two had been addressed to her by Flora, or even by the bottle-green patriarch himself, she had warded off conversation with the toasting-fork like a dumb woman.
1	‘Tupman,’ said the old gentleman, ‘you singled out that particular bird?’ ‘No,’ said Mr. Tupman--‘no.’ ‘You did,’ said Wardle.
1	That, and a sense that we were both a little afraid of Peggotty, and submitted ourselves in most things to her direction, were among the first opinions--if they may be so called--that I ever derived from what I saw.
1	I am sensible that so amiable a lady as the lovely and accomplished daughter of my friend Dombey will not require much urging; but I am happy to know, that I am supported by my friend Gay’s influence and approval.
1	At first, he began to doubt the reality of his adventures, but the acute pain in his shoulders when he attempted to rise, assured him that the kicking of the goblins was certainly not ideal.
1	Can you suppose there’s any harm in looking as cheerful and being as cheerful as our poor circumstances will permit?
1	Then, very strangely, I seemed to hear them, not in the reader's voice, but in the well-remembered voice of my godmother.
1	And I went on at a mighty rate, as if it could be done by walking.
1	When is he coming, Miss?’ ‘What a question!’ cried Miss Wren.
1	‘Did she tell you why?’ I inquired.
1	A’most the moment as she lighted heer, all so desolate, she found (as she believed) a friend; a decent woman as spoke to her about the needle-work as she had been brought up to do, about finding plenty of it fur her, about a lodging fur the night, and making secret inquiration concerning of me and all at home, tomorrow.
1	You needn’t tell me that, Papa Meagles.
1	‘Martha!’ said I, going to it.
1	On every rail and gate, wet lay clammy, and the marsh mist was so thick, that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our village--a direction which they never accepted, for they never came there--was invisible to me until I was quite close under it.
1	Such brains are fertile in expedients.
1	‘And what, my old lady,’ inquired Mr Boffin, when he also had sympathetically laughed: ‘what’s your views on the subject of the Bower?’ ‘Shut it up.
1	Upon no one, however, did it make a greater impression than on Mr. Giles himself; who, after labouring, for some hours, under the fear of having mortally wounded a fellow-creature, eagerly caught at this new idea, and favoured it to the utmost.
1	At six in the morning, I was in Covent Garden Market, buying a bouquet for Dora.
1	And besides,’ added Bella, laughing as she pointed a rallying finger at his face, ‘because I have got you in my power.
1	Nothing in the world, and no one in the world, could shake it or could move me."
1	at last and at least, Uncle Sol must be told,’ thought Walter, with a sigh.
1	They agreed that the weather was of high promise; and Clennam kept the talk in that safe direction until it had become easy again, when he gently diverted it to Henry Gowan and his quick sense and agreeable qualities when he was delicately dealt with; he likewise dwelt on the indisputable affection he entertained for his wife.
1	Don't you be afraid of my turning out of my way, right or left, or taking a sleep, or a wash, or a shave till I have found what I go in search of.
1	It also sends missionaries from hence among the Indian tribes.
1	Whether they were or not, did not appear; but they all had a weedy look.
1	‘You know, John dear,’ she said, cheerily reverting to their former conversation, ‘that I hope I may safely be trusted in great things.
1	I would have told him all my mother's letter, but he would not hear it then.
1	Mr. George, who has been looking first at one of them and then at the other, as if he were demented, takes his venerable acquaintance by the throat on receiving this request, and dragging him upright in his chair as easily as if he were a doll, appears in two minds whether or no to shake all future power of cushioning out of him and shake him into his grave.
1	Her worthy husband, setting aside his bread and butter, immediately discharges the cushion at her, crushes her against the side of her chair, and falls back in his own, overpowered.
1	I know what men they are from whom these schemes have come.
1	One of them was carrying an open letter from a young English artisan, who had been in New York a fortnight, to a friend near Manchester, whom he strongly urged to follow him.
1	She had got a baby--oh, there were a pair of babies when she gave birth to this child sitting here, that Friday night!--and what more did she want?’ Mr. Dick secretly shook his head at me, as if he thought there was no getting over this.
1	'It's no good being proper in this world,' said the first housemaid.
1	'You shall read them, if you behave well,' said the old gentleman kindly; 'and you will like that, better than looking at the outsides,--that is, some cases; because there are books of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts.'
1	And how well that delightful old soul Mrs. Rouncewell is looking.
1	‘For years, ma’am, I was one of the most miserable little wretches ever seen.
1	You’re a ready money man.
1	'There is nothing unusual in that,' said the gentleman.
1	I can't sleep.” It was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he said these words aloud under the fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more expressive of negligence than defiance.
1	You don’t think they’ve gone to sea, anyhow?’ ‘Not gone for sailors, certainly,’ returned the mother with a smile.
1	'What do you think would suit me now?
1	What was it that made me burn all over with a wish to chastise him severely for cutting away from his best friends, his pastors and masters?’ ‘It was parental instinct, sir,’ observed Squeers.
1	They were looking at the table (which was spread out in great array); for these young housekeepers are always nervous on such points, and like to see that everything is right.
1	In one corner stood the diminutive pair of top-boots in which Miss Snevellicci was accustomed to enact the little jockey, and, folded on a chair hard by, was a small parcel, which bore a very suspicious resemblance to the companion smalls.
1	Deeply as I felt my own unconscious part in his pollution of an honest home, I believed that if I had been brought face to face with him, I could not have uttered one reproach.
1	The last two or three stragglers were hurrying to the lodge, and he was following, when he caught sight of her in the doorway of the first house from the entrance.
1	‘Dear me!’ cried that unfortunate gentleman again, ‘I am worrited to that degree that I’m almost off my head.
1	"Because you'll come to that if you don't look out.
1	Please to get me a glass of water!’ I was too attentive to the Doctor and his wife, to give any heed to this request; and it made no impression on anybody else; so Mrs. Markleham panted, stared, and fanned herself.
1	‘Oh Di, you bad, forgetful dog!
1	His getting on his box, which I remember to have been decorated with an old weather-stained pea-green hammercloth moth-eaten into rags, was quite a work of time.
1	I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares, and cut into the Direction.
1	A merry Christmas to you, sir!"
1	‘I trust I shall have the pleasure of seeing you and your friend at my rooms, and of spending a pleasant evening with you, after this awkward mistake,’ said the little doctor; ‘are you disengaged this evening?’ ‘We have some friends here,’ replied Mr. Winkle, ‘and I should not like to leave them to-night.
1	Now, Joe, examining this iron with a smith's eye, declared it to have been filed asunder some time ago.
1	If you can ever give me help, rely upon it I will ask you for it.
1	What do we find, Mr Lightwood?
1	‘There was a very snug little party, consisting of Maria Lobbs and her cousin Kate, and three or four romping, good-humoured, rosy-cheeked girls.
1	‘I’m sorry I should drive you there,’ said Mrs. Gummidge.
1	‘My dear Paul,’ returned his sister, ‘you do Miss Tox but justice, as a man of your penetration was sure, I knew, to do.
1	‘Hear me, I say,’ said Ralph, ‘and not him.’ ‘Say what thou’st gotten to say then, sir,’ retorted John; ‘and tak’ care thou dinnot put up angry bluid which thou’dst betther try to quiet.’ ‘I should know YOU,’ said Ralph, ‘by your tongue; and HIM’ (pointing to Smike) ‘by his looks.’ ‘Don’t speak to him,’ said Nicholas, recovering his voice.
1	It was the queerest of rooms, fitted and furnished more like a luxurious amateur tap-room than anything else within the ken of Silas Wegg.
1	At no Mother’s knee but hers had he ever dwelt in his youth on hopeful promises, on playful fancies, on the harvests of tenderness and humility that lie hidden in the early-fostered seeds of the imagination; on the oaks of retreat from blighting winds, that have the germs of their strong roots in nursery acorns.
1	Life, for _you_, is a plum with the natural bloom on; it hasn’t been over-carefully wiped off for _you_—’ ‘Don’t stop, dear fellow.
1	Impossible!” “Well!” said Herbert, getting up with a lively shake as if he had been asleep, and stirring the fire, “now I'll endeavor to make myself agreeable again!” So he went round the room and shook the curtains out, put the chairs in their places, tidied the books and so forth that were lying about, looked into the hall, peeped into the letter-box, shut the door, and came back to his chair by the fire: where he sat down, nursing his left leg in both arms.
1	‘The two youngest are only nine and ten.
1	inquired Sikes, fixing his eyes on the Jew.
1	‘Catch the crystal globules--catch ‘em--bottle ‘em up--cork ‘em tight--put sealing wax on the top--seal ‘em with a cupid--label ‘em “Best quality”--and stow ‘em away in the fourteen binn, with a bar of iron on the top to keep the thunder off!’ Issuing these commands, as if there were a dozen attendants all actively engaged in their execution, he turned his velvet cap inside out, put it on with great dignity so as to obscure his right eye and three-fourths of his nose, and sticking his arms a-kimbo, looked very fiercely at a sparrow hard by, till the bird flew away, when he put his cap in his pocket with an air of great satisfaction, and addressed himself with respectful demeanour to Mrs. Nickleby.
1	The silence was at length broken by Mr. Tupman.
1	‘You know who bricks and mortar is, I suppose, sir?’ ‘I do not, indeed,’ replied Nicholas.
1	Who would have thought it!
1	I have just been hearing of you.
1	We thank you with all our hearts, and all our love and duty.
1	“Well?” said my sister, in her snappish way.
1	The young lady with the back did not appear for some time after Mrs Skewton’s death; observing to some particular friends, with her usual engaging little scream, that she couldn’t separate the family from a notion of tombstones, and horrors of that sort; but when she did come, she saw nothing wrong, except Mr Dombey’s wearing a bunch of gold seals to his watch, which shocked her very much, as an exploded superstition.
1	I WILL have it!’ But Neville throws him off, and pauses for an instant, in a raging passion, with the goblet yet in his uplifted hand.
1	Upon my honour, I will keep your secret.
1	Either their beauty or the beauty of her arms is particularly attractive to Mr. Bucket.
1	Nor do they see it any more that day.
1	'No,' said the old gentleman, shaking his head; 'it must be imagination.'
1	But no one knows the resources of that man’s intellect, except myself!’ She stopped for a moment to take my hand between hers, and went on: ‘It’s in vain, Trot, to recall the past, unless it works some influence upon the present.
1	The Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its whole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he could not hide the light: which streamed from under it, in an unbroken flood upon the ground.
1	Mutual confidence, so long preserved between us once, is restored, to know no further interruption.
1	Poor little thing, she's liable to spasms, and it's good for her to have her mind employed.
1	said the man, pushing her towards the door.
1	If you’ll be so good as give me your keys, my dear, I’ll attend to all this sort of thing in future.’ From that time, Miss Murdstone kept the keys in her own little jail all day, and under her pillow all night, and my mother had no more to do with them than I had.
1	It was plain that some extraordinary grudge was working in Miss Brass’s gentle breast, and that it was that which impelled her, without the smallest present cause, to rap the child with the blade of the knife, now on her hand, now on her head, and now on her back, as if she found it quite impossible to stand so close to her without administering a few slight knocks.
1	As he passed along towards Saint Antoine, he stopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror, and slightly altered the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat, and his coat-collar, and his wild hair.
1	But neither oaths, or prayers, nor words, WILL kill me, and therefore I live, and mean to live.’ ‘And his mother died!’ cried the old man, passionately clasping his hands and looking upward; ‘and this is Heaven’s justice!’ The other stood lounging with his foot upon a chair, and regarded him with a contemptuous sneer.
1	‘You will not be rid of me so easily, I promise you.
1	What wonder that days became as years in knitting them together!
1	Where they don’t want things done and find a man to do ‘em, that man’s off his legs; but where they do want things done and find a man to do ‘em, that man’s on his legs.
1	He knows his lesson, or he does not know it.’ ‘He does NOT know it,’ Miss Murdstone interposes awfully.
1	‘I have heard that you were kind enough on one of those occasions,’ said Arthur, catching at the opportunity as it drifted past him, ‘to mention Little Dorrit to my mother.’ ‘Little--?
1	I fancied, indeed, that he sometimes chuckled audibly over this reflection, but the carrier said he was only troubled with a cough.
1	God bless you!” and for a moment rests his heart against her bosom, and looks up at both of us, as if it was in pain--in agony.
1	Also, to declare how astounded I have been by the amazing changes I have seen around me on every side,—changes moral, changes physical, changes in the amount of land subdued and peopled, changes in the rise of vast new cities, changes in the growth of older cities almost out of recognition, changes in the graces and amenities of life, changes in the Press, without whose advancement no advancement can take place anywhere.
1	‘Hoity-toity!’ exclaimed Mrs Pipchin, shaking out her black bombazeen skirts, and plucking up all the ogress within her.
1	They says to one another, “Here comes the man as ain’t good enough for his own son!” Lizzie--!’ But, she stopped him with a cry.
1	‘What did you think of her, now?
1	"And when she went from here," I was proceeding, when Jenny's husband impatiently took me up.
1	The horse was a bay, a well-looking animal enough; but with something of a flash and dog-fighting air about him, nevertheless, which accorded both with the vehicle and his master.
1	I declare if I was Pa, I'd run away."
1	‘I was sorry, David, I remarked,’ said Mr. Murdstone, turning his head and his eyes stiffly towards me, ‘to observe that you are of a sullen disposition.
1	I feel that this will break my heart by-and-bye; but I will do my duty while I can, and when I leave her, God will raise up friends for her, as He did for me.” Her father had followed her, and would have fallen on his knees to both of them, but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him, crying: “No, no!
1	Monks was plainly disconcerted, and alarmed besides.
1	‘I see,’ said Sam, ‘a sort of brother-in-law o’ the have-his-carcass.
1	‘By your informant, if you have one.
1	I do not feel that I have the right to tell you what I know of her, for I acquired the knowledge confidentially, and under circumstances that bind me to silence.
1	"Love him like a brother!
1	‘There’s rummer things than women in this world though, mind you,’ said the man with the black eye, slowly filling a large Dutch pipe, with a most capacious bowl.
1	Three or four days of steady application tendered him master of all the facts it was essential to become acquainted with.
1	‘What do you mean by a pike-keeper?’ inquired Mr. Peter Magnus.
1	“Large tract of marshes about here, I believe?” said Drummle.
1	‘Back, ma’am--back!’ said the editor.
1	Those from the adjoining state of Connecticut, or from the states of Maine, Vermont, or New Hampshire, are admitted by a warrant from the state to which they respectively belong; or, failing that, must find security among their friends, for the payment of about twenty pounds English for their first year’s board and instruction, and ten for the second.
1	‘He has a proud stomach, this chap,’ said Mr F.’s relation, on being reseated.
1	Pale dawn again comes peeping through the windows: and, giving place to day, sees night withdraw into the vaults, and follows it, and drives it out, and hides among the dead.
1	He had scarcely set foot without the house, when his father stood before him.
1	Of cursing himself for being there, for having fled, for having let her go, for not having confronted and defied him.
1	I had advanced in fame and fortune, my domestic joy was perfect, I had been married ten happy years.
1	You go out at the gate by which you brought me in?” “Of course.” “I was weak and faint when you brought me in, and I am fainter now you take me out.
1	A rose lay beside her, and if she now and then glanced at the flower, it was with no infraction of her usual preoccupied air.
1	On the contrary, I am very cross, my dear.’ ‘As it is not with me, Fanny, I don’t mind,’ returned her sister, smiling.
1	My husband, fellow-citizen, is a good Republican and a bold man; he has deserved well of the Republic, and possesses its confidence.
1	What should I go and talk for?’ ‘Don’t you see the gentleman’s got a bottle and glass up there?’ returned the little man.
1	‘I’ll never forget you,’ pursued Florence.
1	Bring the matter clearly before yourself, mother.
1	When I was less foolish and more composed, my darling took her wedding-ring from her bosom, and kissed it, and put it on.
1	Think of their all meeting me with it, on my collecting days, here and there and everywhere.
1	‘There!’ said Mr Meagles, throwing open his arms.
1	‘I think it must.’ After more discussion it was agreed that it should be done, and Mrs Boffin summoned Bella to note down the little purchases that were necessary to set Betty up in trade.
1	Where are that old man and that child you speak of?’ ‘Sir?’ said Short, hesitating, and looking towards his friend.
1	Do it now, or Bricks is no longer so.
1	until the flattest echo in the neighbourhood seemed to catch the contagion and to laugh as enjoyingly as he did or as we did when we heard him laugh.
1	George, my faithful feller, how are you?’ George received this advance with a surly indifference, observing that he was well enough for the matter of that, and hammering lustily all the time.
1	A little wood-sawyer, having closed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door.
1	The lady lay with closed eyes on the outside of the bed, protected from the cold by the blankets and wrappers with which she had been covered when she revived from her fainting fit.
1	The service commenced with a hymn, to which succeeded an extemporary prayer.
1	They'll never expect to nab me there, after this country scent.
1	If you buried him fifty feet deep, and took me across his grave, I fancy I should know, if there wasn't a mark above it, that he lay buried there?'
1	Perhaps I HAVE allowed myself to brood too much.
1	With a pretty little party laid along with the other party.
1	And, if looking into this eye of mine, he dares to offer a word in answer, to retort upon him before he can take his breath, “Add another word to that, you dusty old dog, and you’re a beggar.”’ ‘Suppose he says nothing, Mr Wegg?’ ‘Then,’ replied Wegg, ‘we shall have come to an understanding with very little trouble, and I’ll break him and drive him, Mr Venus.
1	She then briskly resumed her work, and said with a sidelong glance of her eyes and chin at Mr Fledgeby: ‘Where d’ye live?’ ‘Albany, Piccadilly,’ replied Fledgeby.
1	Nor,’ said Little Dorrit, as he softly put her glass towards her, ‘nor thirsty.--I think Maggy might like something, perhaps.’ ‘We will make her find pockets presently for all there is here,’ said Clennam: ‘but before we awake her, there was a third thing to say.’ ‘Yes.
1	There’s a moral in everything, if we would only avail ourselves of it.
1	They have much to tell about the popularity of Walter, and the comforts he will have about him, and the quiet way in which it seems he has been working early and late, to make his cabin what the Captain calls ‘a picter,’ to surprise his little wife.
1	Nicholas walked till he was weary, but was not one bit the wiser; and indeed he came out of the Park at last a great deal more confused and perplexed than when he went in.
1	‘If reparation can be made to any one, if restitution can be made to any one, let us know it and make it.
1	The great part of us know well the other, and they all tell me.
1	After the lapse of some minutes, which appeared an immense time to little Paul Dombey on the table, Doctor Blimber came back.
1	Very like Jo and his order; very, very like!
1	Having got to this pass, he resolved as an exercise in perseverance, to betake himself again to the Circumlocution Office, and try what satisfaction he could get there.
1	I get on.” “You don't get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions,”  answered Carton, with a careless air; “I wish you would keep to that.
1	‘What is that?’ cried the child, earnestly.
1	The wind's getting round again, I am afraid.
1	‘Freely, freely.’ ‘Then, Captain Gills,’ said Mr Toots, ‘and Lieutenant Walters--are you aware that the most dreadful circumstances have been happening at Mr Dombey’s house, and that Miss Dombey herself has left her father, who, in my opinion,’ said Mr Toots, with great excitement, ‘is a Brute, that it would be a flattery to call a--a marble monument, or a bird of prey,--and that she is not to be found, and has gone no one knows where?’ ‘May I ask how you heard this?’ inquired Walter.
1	“Now, Mr. Pip, you know,” said Wemmick, “you and I understand one another.
1	Imagine one selected day struck out of it, and think how different its course would have been.
1	And a very handsome sum of money too, I think.
1	‘Pratty nigh for the prasant time, sir,’ replied John.
1	‘No one can harm him now,’ she said.
1	It had come on there, I dare say, a hundred times before, but I could not divest myself of an idea that it MIGHT lead to some result now.
1	At least I--I am not setting up my own poor opinion, you know, Mr Rokesmith,’ said Bella, excusing and explaining herself in a pretty shy way; ‘I am consulting you.’ ‘I noticed that sadness.
1	For, the boys and girls sat on the face of the inclined plane in two compact bodies, divided up the centre by a narrow interval; and Sissy, being at the corner of a row on the sunny side, came in for the beginning of a sunbeam, of which Bitzer, being at the corner of a row on the other side, a few rows in advance, caught the end.
1	Keep her out, Charley, if you love me truly, to the last!
1	Mr. Pickwick was not to be found.
1	What other course was left to take?
1	‘Where are the birds?’ asked Miss Betsey.
1	‘I do believe the woman hears me, and wants to make me break a wessel, so that she may have the pleasure of nursing me.
1	As nations are made to be taxed, so families are made to be butlered.
1	‘Sit down.’ The Secretary sat down.
1	Now or never!’ Bunsby didn’t then, and didn’t ever; for Mrs MacStinger immediately afterwards married him.
1	Alighting on his feet, he took Clennam by the button-hole, led him behind the pump, and pantingly produced from his pocket a bundle of papers.
1	Mrs Gowan--I mean the dowager, my polite friend’s mother--is intimate with Mrs Merdle, and I know these two to be on their visiting list.’ ‘If so, a more undeniable guarantee could not be given,’ said Mrs General to Mr Dorrit, raising her gloves and bowing her head, as if she were doing homage to some visible graven image.
1	cried Mr. Bumble, with ill-feigned enthusiasm, 'or is that little Oliver?
1	Miss Monflathers, however, rebuked this enthusiasm, and took occasion to reprove Mrs Jarley for not keeping her collection more select: observing that His Lordship had held certain opinions quite incompatible with wax-work honours, and adding something about a Dean and Chapter, which Mrs Jarley did not understand.
1	Unless you weep with pleasure to see me.
1	‘But the space,’ urged the grey-haired gentleman.
1	She was dry and sandy with working in the graves of deceased languages.
1	'But, my dear,' said Sowerberry, 'I want to ask your advice.'
1	'Come,' said Mr. Brownlow, 'these are not the characteristics of young Oliver Twist; so he needn't excite your wrath.'
1	A thick and dingy Turkey-carpet muffles the floor where he sits, attended by two candles in old-fashioned silver candlesticks that give a very insufficient light to his large room.
1	Then he added behind his hand, [‘Union, poor old fellow.
1	I am sure you won't betray me.
1	‘So it will; and to be sure I might have known that you would not be long in finding that out; for you have so much taste in all those matters, that really, as I often say to the young ladies, I do not know how, when, or where, you possibly could have acquired all you know--hem--Miss Nickleby and I are quite a pair, Madame Mantalini, only I am a little darker than Miss Nickleby, and--hem--I think my foot may be a little smaller.
1	All the while, the steamer’s lights moved spectrally a very little, as she lay-to, waiting the upshot of whatever accident had happened.
1	Mr Inspector watched the proceedings too, and kept his watching closely to himself.
1	The office was a front parlour, with a panelled wall.
1	Why didn’t you tell me your little history--that about you and the poor old gentleman?
1	Then he is half-eaten by the rats in an hour’s time; as that man was; and there an end.
1	Joe wore--’ ‘Tops!’ cried the mild man, rising in public estimation every Instant.
1	A few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry's destination.
1	At this moment, a low knocking at the cabin-door arrested his attention.
1	As if he wouldn’t!’ ‘Don’t let it put you out, Mr Wegg.
1	From the portico, from the eaves, from the parapet, from every ledge and post and pillar, drips the thawed snow.
1	With Barnacle junior, he signified his desire to confer; and found that young gentleman singeing the calves of his legs at the parental fire, and supporting his spine against the mantel-shelf.
1	He is not going to ask you for any more leave, Sir, he says.’ Mary might have been conscious that she had communicated this last intelligence with more warmth than seemed actually necessary, or she might have observed the good-humoured smile with which Mr. Pickwick regarded her, when she had finished speaking.
1	Mr. Smallweed is good enough to offer these affairs to me, but they are not in my way.
1	No occasion is very special to a man like you, who may do anything; but to a man like me, the case is widely different.’ ‘You have a tasteful place here, Carker,’ said Mr Dombey, condescending to stop upon the lawn, to look about him.
1	‘You are not very intimate with Miss Murdstone, are you?’ said Dora.
1	‘Miss Florence is quite well, Sir,’ Susan would add.
1	The banners were very well painted, and flaunted down the street famously.
1	On an accusation of murder.’ She started at the word, and her looks expressed her natural horror.
1	'Not to be done at all!'
1	He has a great deal of eloquence at his command, undoubtedly, but I am not quite favourable to his style myself.
1	His skin was so unwholesomely deficient in the natural tinge, that he looked as though, if he were cut, he would bleed white.
1	Just so had she first dimly seen the face which she now dimly saw again.
1	‘What right have I to be otherwise than thankful and happy!’ The Captain, who has not yet taken his seat at the table, but who has been fidgeting about for some time, and now stands hesitating in his place, looks doubtfully at Mr Gills, and says: ‘Sol!
1	‘Affery, my woman,’ said he, sidling at her with his fists clenched, and his elbows quivering with impatience to shake her, ‘you are at your old tricks.
1	What then?’ ‘The name of the master of the house is,’ said Dick.
1	Gonnows I were not a unkind husband to her.’ ‘I have heard all this before,’ said Mr. Bounderby.
1	Mr Carker the Manager pushed him backward into a corner--the boy submitting quietly, hardly venturing to breathe, and never once removing his eyes from his face--and rang the bell.
1	And Miss La Creevy was very kind too, and wonderfully talkative: not to Smike, for that would have made him uneasy at first, but to Nicholas and his sister.
1	"Yes, I am afraid so, Lady Dedlock."
1	‘Pyke, of what consequence to our friend, Sir Mulberry, is the good opinion of Mrs. Nickleby?’ ‘Of what consequence?’ echoed Pyke.
1	I am above the rest of mankind in such a case as that.
1	I am not afraid that I shall put a wrong construction on it, whatever it is.’ ‘Thank you.
1	And really he did look very like it.
1	I’ll look out for one like Christopher, and poison him--ha, ha, ha!
1	‘I can’t say I do.’ ‘I have a strong presentiment that we shall become intimately acquainted.--You have no feeling of that sort yet?’ ‘Not yet,’ said Mr Flintwinch.
1	What is it?’ retorted the member, looking shrewdly at him, with his head on one side.
1	Is it the case, mum?’ The worthy lady looked at Mr. Stiggins for a reply; that gentleman, with many rollings of the eye, clenched his throat with his right hand, and mimicked the act of swallowing, to intimate that he was athirst.
1	In another second or two, the nightcap was thrust out of the chaise-window, and a stentorian voice bellowed to the driver to stop:  which he did, as soon as he could pull up his horses.
1	She dared not go upstairs to hide her emotion, lest, in passing out at the door, she should meet him unexpectedly; besides which dread, she felt as though she never could come back again if she were summoned to his presence.
1	The green corn waved so beautifully, the larks sang so joyfully, the hedges were so full of wild flowers, the trees were so thickly out in leaf, the bean-fields, with a light wind blowing over them, filled the air with such a delicious fragrance!
1	Ever rising from the sea of my remembrance, is the image of the dear child as I knew her first, graced by my young love, and by her own, with every fascination wherein such love is rich.
1	Five-and-thirty pounds!’ ‘I am very glad,’ said the child, ‘so very, very glad.’ ‘I am on my way there now,’ resumed the schoolmaster.
1	He had been revolving in his mind whether any business was to be transacted, or whether he had been merely invited to partake of a glass of brandy-and-water, or a bowl of punch, or any similar professional compliment, and now the doubt was set at rest without his appearing at all eager for its solution.
1	He means to tell us, that a horrid female waterman is graceful!’ ‘Pardon me.
1	A low double knock at the bright brass knocker, a gleam of light into the road from the opened door, a brief pause for inquiry and answer and the door was shut, and they were housed.
1	I am safe.” “O dearest Charles, let me thank God for this on my knees as I have prayed to Him.” They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts.
1	‘He’s a deal pleasanter without his senses than with ‘em.
1	He tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it.” “Would he remember what took place in the relapse?” asked Mr. Lorry, with natural hesitation.
1	Whether I really had been down in Garden Court in the dead of the night, groping about for the boat that I supposed to be there; whether I had two or three times come to myself on the staircase with great terror, not knowing how I had got out of bed; whether I had found myself lighting the lamp, possessed by the idea that he was coming up the stairs, and that the lights were blown out; whether I had been inexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking, laughing, and groaning of some one, and had half suspected those sounds to be of my own making; whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark corner of the room, and a voice had called out, over and over again, that Miss Havisham was consuming within it,--these were things that I tried to settle with myself and get into some order, as I lay that morning on my bed.
1	Winkle, I presume?’ ‘My name is Winkle, sir.’ ‘You will not be surprised, sir, when I inform you that I have called here this morning on behalf of my friend, Doctor Slammer, of the 97th.’ ‘Doctor Slammer!’ said Mr. Winkle.
1	‘Rides rather rusty,’ said Mr. Roker, with a smile.
1	"Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, I mentioned yesterday evening that I wanted but a very little to complete this case.
1	‘No, I should hope not!
1	But don’t you tell my father!
1	Then I looked at my watch, and, finding that it was past nine, called again, “Is there any one here?” There being still no answer, I went out at the door, irresolute what to do.
1	"Not to be wondered at!"
1	‘Well, ma’am,’ said Ralph, impatiently, ‘the creditors have administered, you tell me, and there’s nothing left for you?’ ‘Nothing,’ replied Mrs. Nickleby.
1	I get mixed up with all sorts of things that I don’t quite understand, and I think there’s something rather weak in my--in my head, in short.’ The Captain nodded his own, as a mark of assent.
1	If there are six children, six people come to hold them in their laps.
1	I leave no other charge with you."
1	'I would rather walk slowly on, so as to gain a little time before I see her.
1	It was his naval way of mentioning my eyes."
1	‘They mark the graves of those who had very tender, loving friends.’ ‘I was sure they did!’ the child exclaimed.
1	You have received some considerable education already.
1	They had precisely the same incapacity for settling down to anything, as the prisoners used to have; they rather deteriorated one another, as the prisoners used to do; and they wore untidy dresses, and fell into a slouching way of life: still, always like the people in the Marshalsea.
1	"Take her, my old friend, and take my gratitude along with you.
1	‘Have you no mother?’ ‘No.’ ‘No father?’ ‘Yes, a very dear one.’ ‘Go home to him, and be afraid of me.
1	‘Yes,’ replied Nicholas, turning towards the corner from which the voice proceeded.
1	‘We don’t shave gentlemen in your line,’ remarked the young proprietor.
1	Mr. Winkle gave a last hopeless knock; the ladies were only a few doors off.
1	Take me as I am, and make the best of me."
1	At noon we went on board another steamboat, and reached the village of Lachine, nine miles from Montreal, by three o’clock.
1	He was your nat’ral born friend like, warn’t he, Pet?’ Florence had no words to answer with.
1	She looked up at it while she spoke, as if it were the fervent purpose of her own heart shining above her.
1	As they crossed the bridge, the clear steeples of the many churches looked as if they had advanced out of the murk that usually enshrouded them, and come much nearer.
1	His name?” “Barsad,” said Defarge, making it French by pronunciation.
1	‘I’m very glad indeed to hear it,’ said Miss Tox.
1	What’s that?’ ‘What?’ ‘That noise?’ ‘Ah Heaven, be quiet, cursed brigand!’ to a horse who shook his bells ‘What noise?’ ‘Behind.
1	Once, when there was a pause in the dancing, Lady Skettles told Paul that he seemed very fond of music.
1	"Belle," said the husband, turning to his wife with a smile, "I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon."
1	He married--an English lady--and I was one of the trustees.
1	‘Wery pleasant and comformable.’ The precise meaning which Mr. Weller attached to this last-mentioned adjective, did not appear; but, as it was evident from the tone in which he used it that it was a favourable expression, Mr. Pickwick was as well satisfied as if he had been thoroughly enlightened on the subject.
1	But the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it.
1	"George will look us up," says Mr. Bagnet.
1	The fire glows brightly on the panelled wall and palely on the window-glass, where, through the cold reflection of the blaze, the colder landscape shudders in the wind and a grey mist creeps along, the only traveller besides the waste of clouds.
1	In the wildness of her sorrow, shame, and terror, the forlorn girl hurried through the sunshine of a bright morning, as if it were the darkness of a winter night.
1	And what had been the fervency of all the prayers he had ever muttered, compared with those he poured forth, now, in the agony and passion of his supplication for the life and health of the gentle creature, who was tottering on the deep grave's verge!
1	I made acquaintance, on this journey, with a mild and modest young quaker, who opened the discourse by informing me, in a grave whisper, that his grandfather was the inventor of cold-drawn castor oil.
1	The latter, who had a candle in his hand, called his man to take it away.
1	The thing itself is an exaggeration of nastiness, which cannot be outdone.
1	“Ah,”  says he, “if I hadn’t been obliged to take that ugly article at the old broker’s valuation, I might have got something comfortable for the money.
1	Monseigneur was in his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without.
1	When, under cover of the night, I flew to Miss Mills, whom I saw by stealth in a back kitchen where there was a mangle, and implored Miss Mills to interpose between us and avert insanity.
1	That wasn’t much.’ ‘I am sorry for it,’ said Clennam: ‘not that it matters now, though.
1	Weariness of soul lies before her, as it lies behind--her Ariel has put a girdle of it round the whole earth, and it cannot be unclasped--but the imperfect remedy is always to fly from the last place where it has been experienced.
1	‘Decidedly not good,’ says Mrs Lammle.
1	Mrs. Sparsit was this lady’s name; and she was a prominent figure in attendance on Mr. Bounderby’s car, as it rolled along in triumph with the Bully of humility inside.
1	After the last shot, the Captain’s voice was heard to say, in feeble remonstrance from his own room, ‘Steady below!’ ‘Since you want Cap’en Cuttle, there he is!’ said Mrs MacStinger, with an angry motion of her hand.
1	These delays so protracted the journey that the short day was spent and the long night had closed in before we came to St. Albans, near to which town Bleak House was, we knew.
1	Of these, one was a man of six or eight and fifty, who sat on a chair near one of the entrances of the booth, with his hands folded on the top of his stick, and his chin appearing above them.
1	When he had made a suitable reply, Mr Brass wrung him by the hand, and fell into a brown study, as did Miss Sally likewise.
1	Now, there are more congratulations on this happiest of days, and more company, though not much; and now they leave the drawing-room, and range themselves at table in the dark-brown dining-room, which no confectioner can brighten up, let him garnish the exhausted negroes with as many flowers and love-knots as he will.
1	I only mean that I suppose some compensation is fair and reasonable in that sort of marriage.’ ‘Compensation to the lady, sir?’ asked Mr. Wickfield gravely.
1	There is something strange to me, even now, in the reflection that he never saw me; and something stranger yet in the shadowy remembrance that I have of my first childish associations with his white grave-stone in the churchyard, and of the indefinable compassion I used to feel for it lying out alone there in the dark night, when our little parlour was warm and bright with fire and candle, and the doors of our house were--almost cruelly, it seemed to me sometimes--bolted and locked against it.
1	“But supposing you did?” “It can't be supposed,” said Joe.
1	Now, Trot and Agnes, let us look the case of Betsey Trotwood in the face, and see how it stands.’ I observed Agnes turn pale, as she looked very attentively at my aunt.
1	"Passed through here on foot this evening about eight or nine.
1	Foremost among them, smooth Sampson Brass and Sally, arm in arm, claim our polite attention.
1	That gentleman had gradually passed through the various stages which precede the lethargy produced by dinner, and its consequences.
1	Mr and Mrs John Harmon’s first delightful occupation was, to set all matters right that had strayed in any way wrong, or that might, could, would, or should, have strayed in any way wrong, while their name was in abeyance.
1	The impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was self-evident.
1	Might, however, have been Stomach and not Mind.
1	"I am sorry to have kept you waiting, officer, but I am rather later than my usual hour this morning.
1	‘It’s not my gal!’ cried the old woman, tossing up her arms, and clasping her hands above her head.
1	‘Well, Sir,’ said Mr Chick, making a desperate plunge, after a long silence, and filling a glass of sherry; ‘I shall drink this, if you’ll allow me, Sir, to little Paul.’ ‘Bless him!’ murmured Miss Tox, taking a sip of wine.
1	It has engendered or confirmed in him a habit of putting off--and trusting to this, that, and the other chance, without knowing what chance--and dismissing everything as unsettled, uncertain, and confused.
1	"My Lady went out, Sir Leicester, before you were taken ill, and don't know of your illness yet."
1	His condition is a desperate one, Ma’am.
1	"My dear sir," cries Grandfather Smallweed, "would you do me a favour?
1	He never visited his sister, and had only seen her once since she went home: that is to say on the night when he still stuck close to Bounderby, as already related.
1	said the girl, stopping suddenly.
1	Everything belonging to Mr. Tartar had quarters of its own assigned to it: his maps and charts had their quarters; his books had theirs; his brushes had theirs; his boots had theirs; his clothes had theirs; his case-bottles had theirs; his telescopes and other instruments had theirs.
1	When we had come out again, and had got rid of the boys who had been put into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly tortured, and who were much disappointed to find that my friends were merely rallying round me, we went back to Pumblechook's.
1	‘You know, Ned,’ said Sol Gills, ‘why I left here.
1	Tears are signs of gladness as well as grief; but those which coursed down Rose's face, as she sat pensively at the window, still gazing in the same direction, seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy.
1	'Have you nothing to say to me?'
1	‘I hoped,’ faltered Mrs. Nickleby, ‘that you might have an opportunity of doing something for your brother’s children.
1	I reflected for some time, and then answered as if I had discovered a new idea, “I mean pretty well.” My sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me,--I had no shadow of defence, for Joe was busy in the forge,--when Mr. Pumblechook interposed with “No!
1	He says--" Sir Leicester is so long in taking out his eye-glass and adjusting it that my Lady looks a little irritated.
1	If I were to meet that most unparalleled despot in the streets to-morrow, I would fell him like a rotten tree!"
1	I don’t remember,’ said Mr Toots, after reflecting a little, ‘that I was ever better, thank you.’ ‘It’s very kind of you to come,’ said Florence, taking up her work, ‘I am very glad to see you.’ Mr Toots responded with a chuckle.
1	"My dear son," said Mr. Turveydrop, "you have four schools this afternoon.
1	‘You make pincushions,’ said Charley.
1	What is the spike that intervenes, and who has set it up?
1	Goes through the archvay, thinking how he should inwest the money--up comes the touter, touches his hat--“Licence, Sir, licence?”--“What’s that?” says my father.--“Licence, Sir,” says he.--“What licence?” says my father.--“Marriage licence,” says the touter.--“Dash my veskit,” says my father, “I never thought o’ that.”-- “I think you wants one, Sir,” says the touter.
1	‘Yo-yo-yo-yo-yoe!’ went the first boy.
1	She always has done it.
1	"They tell me there was no one here."
1	‘Why, as to the friendly move,’ observed the last-named gentleman, rubbing his knees peevishly, ‘one of my objections to it is, that it ‘Rome, brother,’ returned Wegg: ‘a city which (it may not be generally known) originated in twins and a wolf; and ended in Imperial marble: wasn’t built in a day.’ ‘Did I say it was?’ asked Venus.
1	They’re more or less younger than I am, and they’re playful.
1	‘Why,’ said the collector, with a rueful face, ‘they WILL have four bridesmaids; I’m afraid they’ll make it rather theatrical.’ ‘Oh no, not at all,’ replied Nicholas, with an awkward attempt to convert a laugh into a cough.
1	‘The articles of corn and coals,’ said Mrs. Micawber, still more argumentatively, ‘being equally out of the question, Mr. Copperfield, I naturally look round the world, and say, “What is there in which a person of Mr. Micawber’s talent is likely to succeed?” And I exclude the doing anything on commission, because commission is not a certainty.
1	"Being a prudent man and accustomed to take care of your own affairs, you begin to rummage among the papers as you have come into; don't you?"
1	The people of the village, too, of whom there was not one but grew to have a fondness for poor Nell; even among them, there was the same feeling; a tenderness towards her--a compassionate regard for her, increasing every day.
1	It greatly affected me to see him so, but I hoped he might become more yielding, and I remained silent.
1	By determining that the deprivation to which he condemned you, and which he forced upon you, shall always rest upon his head.’ It chanced to be a subtle string to sound, in her who had so spoken to her brother within the hour.
1	When he had got his shilling, and had in course of time completed the ascent to his box, and had got away (which appeared to relieve his mind), I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my hand and asked, Was Mr. Jaggers at home?
1	I trust in saying this--’ For a moment the lady, with a glass at her eye, stood transfixed and speechless before the two Miss Dorrits.
1	Our road wound through the pleasant valley of the Susquehanna; the river, dotted with innumerable green islands, lay upon our right; and on the left, a steep ascent, craggy with broken rock, and dark with pine trees.
1	Among men who have any sound and sterling qualities, there is nothing so contagious as pure openness of heart.
1	There is the salaried clerk--out of door, or in door, as the case may be--who devotes the major part of his thirty shillings a week to his Personal pleasure and adornments, repairs half-price to the Adelphi Theatre at least three times a week, dissipates majestically at the cider cellars afterwards, and is a dirty caricature of the fashion which expired six months ago.
1	‘Halls of slavery, Ma, is mere stuff and nonsense,’ returned the unmoved Irrepressible.
1	You must ever be the head and master here, father; and we feel how truly unnatural it would be in us if we failed to know it or if we failed to exert ourselves in every possible way to please you."
1	‘Oh, uncle, I am SO glad to see you,’ said Mrs. Kenwigs, kissing the collector affectionately on both cheeks.
1	‘Excellent,’ returned the mild man, becoming bold on his success.
1	‘There’s ever so many people in the river.’ ‘Tell ‘em to put on all the kettles!’ cried Miss Abbey.
1	I have nothing more to say, Charley dear, except, be good, and get learning, and only think of some things in the old life here, as if you had dreamed them in a dream last night.
1	It was evident, however, that the only intellectual exercise was that of imitation and memory.
1	He was not at Golden Square, and probably had been sent to execute some commission at a distance.
1	He wouldn't catch anybody else.
1	But he slumbered on, alike unconscious of the kind intentions of Miss Tox, the wonder of the Major, the early sorrows of his sister, and the stern visions of his father; and innocent that any spot of earth contained a Dombey or a Son.
1	‘Oh, no, Sir.’ ‘Very good.
1	“_He’s_ a Natural!” The remaining six members of the Eight Club laughed unanimously.
1	We are all quite well, and Fanny improves every day.
1	‘Or, if Yoicks would be in better keeping, consider that I said Yoicks.
1	It was a great comfort to be able to say to myself after tea, "Esther, my dear, I think you are quite sensible enough to sit down now and write a note of thanks to your host."
1	Not but what, Pip, if you had ever made objections to the business,--such as its being open to black and sut, or such-like,--not but what they would have been attended to, don't you see?” “Has the boy,” said Miss Havisham, “ever made any objection?
1	These letters Clennam answered with the aid of his pencil and pocket-book, on the spot; sending the father what he asked for, and excusing himself from compliance with the demand of the son.
1	Her old friend leaves a kind word for her, Miss Wade, if you should think proper to deliver it.’ She said nothing as to that; and Mr Meagles, taking his honest face out of the dull room, where it shone like a sun, took it to the Hotel where he had left Mrs Meagles, and where he made the Report: ‘Beaten, Mother; no effects!’ He took it next to the London Steam Packet, which sailed in the night; and next to the Marshalsea.
1	I was so softened and forgiving, going through the town, that I had half a mind to nod to my old enemy the butcher, and throw him five shillings to drink.
1	There is not much business done.
1	The next has no date whatever, which is in itself suspicious.
1	'I know it,' replied the Jew, tearing a newspaper from his pocket and pointing to it.
1	I know he will, Sir,’ said Job, with energy.
1	At the heart of it his mother presided, inflexible of face, indomitable of will, firmly holding all the secrets of her own and his father’s life, and austerely opposing herself, front to front, to the great final secret of all life.
1	I am far from strong.
1	‘Yes, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a kind of social widowhood upon her.
1	He disclosed, when he had done so, a broad heavy countenance with a beard of three days' growth, and two scowling eyes; one of which displayed various parti-coloured symptoms of having been recently damaged by a blow.
1	How do you do, Mr. Edwin?
1	‘And Winkle?’ added Mr. Tupman.
1	She saw me a-going about, miss," said Charley with a short laugh of the greatest delight and pride, "and she thought I looked like your maid!"
1	‘--I hardly know how to tell you--of a gentleman far above me and my way of life, who broke father’s death to me, and has shown an interest in me since.’ ‘Does he love you?’ Lizzie shook her head.
1	The door of the cell opened, and the attendants returned.
1	“And this,” said he, dandling my hands up and down in his, as he puffed at his pipe,--“and this is the gentleman what I made!
1	‘Is this anything that I can do?’ (Click!
1	‘I never saw a young fellow so regularly cut out for that line, since I’ve been in the profession.
1	‘Yes, sir,’ returned the boy.
1	And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse the manner of its composition, so, sublimer intelligences may read in the feeble shining of this earth of ours, every thought and act, every vice and virtue, of every responsible creature on it.
1	‘Ah!’ replied the stranger coolly, ‘Slammer--much obliged--polite attention--not ill now, Slammer--but when I am--knock you up.’ ‘You--you’re a shuffler, sir,’ gasped the furious doctor, ‘a poltroon--a coward--a liar--a--a--will nothing induce you to give me your card, sir!’ ‘Oh!
1	‘He’s coming to himself,’ said Peggotty.
1	He passed through Calais going to London, and there were reasons why he should not take them with him then, why he should wish to be able to put his hand upon them readily, and why he should distrust leaving them with people of his own sort.
1	It was pleasant weather, and on the road we made my domestic happiness the theme of conversation.
1	That’s the Fair, that is.’ ‘My friend,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘you don’t really mean to say that human beings live down in those wretched dungeons?’ ‘Don’t I?’ replied Mr. Roker, with indignant astonishment; ‘why ‘Live!--live down there!’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.
1	The disposition to ornament these pretty villas and render them attractive, leads to the culture of trees and flowers, and the laying out of well-kept gardens, the sight of which, to those who walk along the streets, is inexpressibly refreshing and agreeable.
1	Believe it, pray.’ The gentleman was moved, and put the hand she held out, to his lips, much as a tender father might kiss the hand of a dutiful child.
1	The young lady merely throwing off her simple bonnet, sat down to the piano as usual.
1	However, there it was—a barge with a little house in it, viewed from the outside; and a caravan at a fair, viewed from within: the gentlemen being accommodated, as the spectators usually are, in one of those locomotive museums of penny wonders; and the ladies being partitioned off by a red curtain, after the manner of the dwarfs and giants in the same establishments, whose private lives are passed in rather close exclusiveness.
1	If it appeared that he had spoken truly, the captain could be turned out of the house without noising the matter abroad, and they could easily account to the Porkenhams for his disappearance, by saying that he had been appointed, through the Court influence of his family, to the governor-generalship of Sierra Leone, of Saugur Point, or any other of those salubrious climates which enchant Europeans so much, that when they once get there, they can hardly ever prevail upon themselves to come back again.
1	I went first to your office, according to the direction of the papers found in the pockets, and there I see nobody but a chap of about my age who sent me on here.’ There was a curious mixture in the boy, of uncompleted savagery, and uncompleted civilization.
1	I pretended to put my balance away every night, but I didn’t.
1	We must expect change.’ ‘Of weather?’ asked Miss Tox, in her simplicity.
1	Some two or three are open, and women, with drooping heads bent down, are talking to the inmates.
1	Ecod, it’s a room start, is the mutual confidence!’ The entrance of Mrs. Browdie, with a smart cap on, and very many apologies for their having been detected in the act of breakfasting in the kitchen, stopped John in his discussion of this grave subject, and hastened the breakfast: which, being composed of vast mounds of toast, new-laid eggs, boiled ham, Yorkshire pie, and other cold substantials (of which heavy relays were constantly appearing from another kitchen under the direction of a very plump servant), was admirably adapted to the cold bleak morning, and received the utmost justice from all parties.
1	Finally, he made a start at the teapot, gustily rattled a quantity of tea into it from a canister, and set off for the common kitchen to fill it with hot water.
1	They had been lectured at, from their tenderest years; coursed, like little hares.
1	He’d have been here before now, you may be sure, but that he’s away on confidential business of your own.
1	They are sought by so many, and they are granted (comparatively) to so few!
1	I cannot say how it first presented itself to me, because I observed it in many slight particulars which were nothing in themselves and only became something when they were pieced together.
1	As usual it was full of boarders, was very large, and had a broad colonnade to every story of the house.
1	But we further agreed that he should pull down the blind in that part of his window which gave upon the east, whenever he saw us and all was right.
1	‘He forgets everything.’ ‘I will twist his demd nose off his countenance for leaving such a very pretty creature all alone by herself,’ said her husband.
1	It smote upon his heart to feel that she hid her thin, worn shoe.
1	The cathedral chimes had at once a sadder and a more remote sound to me, as I hurried on avoiding observation, than they had ever had before; so, the swell of the old organ was borne to my ears like funeral music; and the rooks, as they hovered about the gray tower and swung in the bare high trees of the priory garden, seemed to call to me that the place was changed, and that Estella was gone out of it for ever.
1	‘I can wait.’ ‘So can the young men, it seems, Fanny,’ observed Mrs. Browdie.
1	‘My name, sir,’ said his visitor, ‘is Josiah Bounderby, of Coketown.’ Mr. James Harthouse was very happy indeed (though he scarcely looked so) to have a pleasure he had long expected.
1	‘The mother stood some time, gazing with overflowing eyes upon her unfortunate child, who, all unconscious of her presence, was playing about the room.
1	Let us try our fortune with Mr Squeers at once; he can but refuse.’ ‘He won’t do that,’ said Ralph.
1	‘When she was a child,’ he said, lifting up his head soon after we were left alone, ‘she used to talk to me a deal about the sea, and about them coasts where the sea got to be dark blue, and to lay a-shining and a-shining in the sun.
1	‘Acquit me of impertinent curiosity, my dear Mrs. Bounderby.
1	‘I say again,’ said my aunt, ‘nobody knows what that man’s mind is except myself; and he’s the most amenable and friendly creature in existence.
1	‘I believe you’re right,’ said Dick.
1	‘I know it,’ replied Tim, surveying him through his spectacles.
1	He came in my way at last.
1	When I look back, I wonder how I can have been such a fool as to take you to so great an extent upon trust.’ ‘And when I look back--’ the bride cries, interrupting.
1	You had better say it.
1	There you’re a little bit fast.
1	He cannot be kept in his present state of suspense.”  “Mama,” said Annie, still crying, “would he be unhappy without me?
1	‘What is the matter?’ ‘Hush!’ replied Sir Mulberry, laying his hand on her arm.
1	"Stow cutting away, you know!"
1	Miss Dombey’s found!’ The boy with his open face, and flowing hair, and sparkling eyes, panting with pleasure and excitement, was wonderfully opposed to Mr Dombey, as he sat confronting him in his library chair.
1	‘Mr Merdle,’ observed Fanny, as a means of dismissing Mr Sparkler into the background, ‘is quite a theme of Papa’s, you must know, Mrs Merdle.’ ‘I have been--ha--disappointed, madam,’ said Mr Dorrit, ‘to understand from Mr Sparkler that there is no great--hum--probability of Mr Merdle’s coming abroad.’ ‘Why, indeed,’ said Mrs Merdle, ‘he is so much engaged and in such request, that I fear not.
1	Could not possibly have been better,’ replied Mr. Magnus.
1	It’s likely enough they took such liberties; I shouldn’t wonder!
1	How did I first know it myself?
1	She had oftentimes heard in days that were gone, how doctors would lift the hand of an insensible wounded person, and would drop it if the person were dead.
1	"I was barely twenty," said Mrs. Badger, "when I married Captain Swosser of the Royal Navy.
1	Bedroom fires blaze brightly all over the house, raising ghosts of grim furniture on wall and ceiling.
1	‘“I am the Genius of Despair and Suicide,” said the apparition.
1	I wouldn’t trust myself to that woman, young and handsome as she is, if I had wronged her; no, not for twice my proprietor’s money!
1	Fam’ly name, Headstone, sim’lar to Riderhood which is my own.
1	Now, I’m not a going to stand it, you know!’ said the milkman, still throwing his voice into the house, and glaring down the passage.
1	I _did_ sell them, and they're where you'll never get them.
1	What’s that?’ Paul was dreadfully frightened; but still he made a stand for the absent Glubb, though he did it trembling.
1	He is no doubt born with an appetite--probably, when he is in a safer state of health, he has an excellent appetite.
1	'It's all up, Fagin,' said Charley, when he and his new companion had been made known to each other.
1	Upon that, we all went into the next room, Mr. Kenge first, with my darling--it is so natural to me now that I can't help writing it; and there, plainly dressed in black and sitting in an arm-chair at a table near the fire, was his lordship, whose robe, trimmed with beautiful gold lace, was thrown upon another chair.
1	‘I hope, Mrs Dombey,’ addressing her after a moment’s silence, with especial distinctness; ‘that these alterations meet with your approval?’ ‘They are as handsome as they can be,’ she returned, with haughty carelessness.
1	Every man with whom he had to do was in his eyes a jury-man; and he must get that jury-man over, if he could.
1	‘Six years old!’ said Mr Dombey, settling his neckcloth--perhaps to hide an irrepressible smile that rather seemed to strike upon the surface of his face and glance away, as finding no resting-place, than to play there for an instant.
1	What I felt, in returning so auspiciously to the old familiar places, I shall not endeavour to describe.
1	Here is the table upon which he sat forlorn and strange, the ‘new boy’ of the school; and hither comes the distant cooing of the old boys, at their old lives in the old room on the old principle!
1	‘I don’t know that,’ muttered Rob, whose glance even wandered to the church tower, as if he might be there, with a supernatural power of hearing.
1	“Don't commit yourself,” said Mr. Jaggers, “and don't commit any one.
1	‘Is your heart mine still, dear Dora?’ said I, rapturously, for I knew by her clinging to me that it was.
1	‘Damme, Sir, she never wrapped up enough.
1	‘Why, there’s even less sense in this move than t’other,’ said Riderhood, following.
1	Look and see if he warn’t.’ ‘Quite right.’ ‘This one was the young woman in grey boots, and her linen marked with a cross.
1	What I had to do, was, to take my woodman’s axe in my hand, and clear my own way through the forest of difficulty, by cutting down the trees until I came to Dora.
1	‘In any case it is not your fault if you have not, Mr Rokesmith.’ ‘I hope you are wrong in that impression.
1	Come in.’ Laying his hand on the mulberry collar of the unresisting Job, Mr. Weller dragged him into the kitchen; and, locking the door, handed the key to Mr. Muzzle, who very coolly buttoned it up in a side pocket.
1	‘I recommend him to this splendid establishment of yours, as an opening which will lead him to fortune if he turns it to proper account.
1	‘Yes,’ said the old gentleman, tapping his desk emphatically, ‘here, in this room.
1	Brother Tadger, sir!’ said Mr. Stiggins, suddenly increasing in ferocity, and turning sharp round on the little man in the drab shorts, ‘_you _are drunk, sir!’ With this, Mr. Stiggins, entertaining a praiseworthy desire to promote the sobriety of the meeting, and to exclude therefrom all improper characters, hit Brother Tadger on the summit of the nose with such unerring aim, that the drab shorts disappeared like a flash of lightning.
1	The children were arranged in a semicircle round the new master, and he was soon listening to their dull, drawling, hesitating recital of those stories of engrossing interest which are to be found in the more antiquated spelling-books.
1	He therefore terminated the entertainment at the end of the third bottle.
1	He was the same as before with all the roadside people, but he looked graver when he sat by himself on the box.
1	It was such a very provoking question (for it had never in the most distant manner occurred to me), that I said, snappishly,-- “Biddy, what do you mean?” Biddy, having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands,--and the smell of a black-currant bush has ever since recalled to me that evening in the little garden by the side of the lane,--said, “Have you never considered that he may be proud?” “Proud?” I repeated, with disdainful emphasis.
1	She put her left hand in mine (I was sitting on that side), but kept her right upon the keys, going over and over them without striking any note.
1	The smoke that rose into the sky had lost its dingy hue and taken a brightness upon it.
1	She heard him with evident surprise, and with more marks of suppressed interest than he had seen in her; still they did not overcome her distant, proud, and self-secluded manner.
1	‘This--this,’ said he, ‘determines me.
1	But there are plenty of people anywhere, who'll do that for you.” “If there is bad blood between you and them,” said I, to soften it off a little.
1	He went into that part of his life, and a dark wild part it is.
1	She expected to see Jeremiah fast asleep or in a fit, but he was calmly seated in a chair, awake, and in his usual health.
1	One of our boys--gorging his-self with vittles, and then turning in; that’s their way--got a abscess on him last week.
1	There was soon but one person left of all the crowd, and he, with his hat under his arm and his snuff-box in his hand, slowly passed among the mirrors on his way out.
1	Some young fellows, you know, may be a little behind their station, perhaps, in point of education and behaviour, and may go a little wrong, you know, and get themselves and other people into a variety of fixes--and all that--but deuce take it, it’s delightful to reflect that they’ve got Blood in ‘em!
1	Above these, were range upon range of craggy steeps, grey rock, bright ice, and smooth verdure-specks of pasture, all gradually blending with the crowning snow.
1	“I replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by those who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go to France, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with me, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself, during the journey, under that worthy gentleman's protection.
1	That there was something kindred in their nature, something congenial in their souls, something mysteriously sympathetic in their bosoms, was evident.
1	I knew that Peggotty would come to me in my room.
1	‘Frank is a heedless, foolish fellow,’ he said, after Nicholas had paused for some time; ‘a very heedless, foolish fellow.
1	My inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house, and I dined in a little octagonal common-room, like a font.
1	The child looked frightened, but seemed not to understand him, which Mr Quilp observing, hastened to make his meaning more distinctly.
1	Copperfield, my daughter Dora, and my daughter Dora’s confidential friend!’ It was, no doubt, Mr. Spenlow’s voice, but I didn’t know it, and I didn’t care whose it was.
1	Micawber’s difficulties are almost overwhelming just at present,’ said Mrs. Micawber; ‘and whether it is possible to bring him through them, I don’t know.
1	a beautiful and happy time!’ A day or two after the Quilp tea-party at the Wilderness, Mr Swiveller walked into Sampson Brass’s office at the usual hour, and being alone in that Temple of Probity, placed his hat upon the desk, and taking from his pocket a small parcel of black crape, applied himself to folding and pinning the same upon it, after the manner of a hatband.
1	I am not here to make any promise, or give any pledge to anybody.
1	‘The landlord of the Yard,’ said Arthur Clennam, ‘is--’ ‘He is Mr Casby, by name, he is,’ said Plornish, ‘and Pancks, he collects the rents.
1	‘And it shall be of what we talked of long ago--many months--months is it, or weeks, or days?
1	Gradually, an unhappy shadow fell upon her beauty, and deepened every day.
1	Which, never failing to revert to his kind friends, and the opinion they must long ago have formed of him, were sad indeed.
1	Not that he could doubt (that, even with him, is impossible), but that nothing can prepare him for the blow."
1	You’ll be walking in your sleep next, my woman, and playing the whole round of your distempered antics.
1	It’s wery pleasant for the prospects.
1	Do you play?” “No!” returned the spy.
1	It comes of flowing on so quiet, and of that there rippling at the boat's head making a sort of a Sunday tune.
1	‘I beg your pardon, sir.’ ‘You know your room, for I showed it you before dinner; but I will accompany you to it once more.
1	‘One who sits on such an elevation as yours, and can sit there, unmoved, in all seasons--hasn’t much reason to know anything about the flight of time.
1	They agreed in nothing but their perfect neatness, their display of the whitest linen, and their storing-up, wheresoever the existence of a drawer, small or large, rendered it possible, of quantities of rose-leaves and sweet lavender.
1	For I am not so bad as I was,’ pleaded Tattycoram; ‘I am bad enough, but not so bad as I was, indeed.
1	‘It won’t do,’ said Nicholas, shaking his head; ‘I must try something else.’ It was much easier to make this resolution than to carry it into effect.
1	It was reassuring, on such a night, to be told that some of the inn-servants had agreed together to sit up until morning.
1	‘Two belated wanderers in the mazes of the law,’ said Eugene, attracted by the sound of footsteps, and glancing down as he spoke, ‘stray into the court.
1	‘Memorandum, “Will.”  Now, my dear,’ said Mr. Grewgious, referring to his notes, disposing of ‘Marriage’ with his pencil, and taking a paper from his pocket; ‘although.
1	She stood there, with her dark disdainful eyes again upon him; and he was riding on nevertheless, through town and country, light and darkness, wet weather and dry, over road and pavement, hill and valley, height and hollow, jaded and scared by the monotony of bells and wheels, and horses’ feet, and no rest.
1	"My dear child," said Mr. Turveydrop, "let me, even under the present exceptional circumstances, recommend strict punctuality.
1	The more he represses it, the more unjust he necessarily is.
1	Let her flower-garden, in which he never sets his foot, but which is yet maintained, among all his costly alterations, as if she had quitted it but yesterday, bear witness!
1	‘I think you’ll like her.’ ‘You know her very well?’ ‘Why, you see,’ said Fanny, with a frank action of her pretty shoulders, ‘in London one knows every one.
1	As the lower portions of these pantaloons became revealed, Bunsby stood confessed; his hands in their pockets, which were of vast size; and his gaze directed, not to Captain Cuttle or the ladies, but the mast-head.
1	And he eyed the Boffins with implacable eyes.
1	As it was, I took the path that led close by it.
1	We had heard nothing of him since he went away, that sunny afternoon.
1	“Seems you have been out after such?” asked the stranger.
1	Let me hear your story; where you come from; who brought you up; and how you got into the company in which I found you.
1	I’ll bring you out, and your friend too.
1	As she came beneath the lowering sky, a sense of being involved in a murky shade of Murder dropped upon her; and, as the tidal swell of the river broke at her feet without her seeing how it gathered, so, her thoughts startled her by rushing out of an unseen void and striking at her heart.
1	"I will never mention it," said I, "unless you should give me future occasion to do so."
1	Never however see the plaintive take a pick-axe or any other wepping far from it.
1	There were restoratives on the table; the room was made as airy as possible, and was darkened, and was very orderly and quiet.
1	On that day week, amply provided with all necessaries, I left it, inside the stagecoach, for Reading.
1	The church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven, as two figures emerged on London Bridge.
1	‘Ecod, if thot’s on’y a Poast Office, I’d loike to see where the Lord Mayor o’ Lunnun lives.’ So saying, John Browdie--for he it was--opened the coach-door, and tapping Mrs. Browdie, late Miss Price, on the cheek as he looked in, burst into a boisterous fit of laughter.
1	Boots and clothes is extra, and fires in winter-time is eightpence a day.’ ‘Why don’t you show ‘em yourself?
1	All this, and more, has happened in your own family, and to and through your own Lady.
1	Said she had peculiar occasion for it.’ ‘I think,’ observed Clennam musing, ‘I by chance know what occasion--I mean into whose pocket the money is to go.’ ‘Indeed?’ said Pancks.
1	‘The way father has been talking about you, Mr Clennam,’ said Mrs Plornish, ‘you hardly would believe.
1	There was an apartment at the side of the Boffin mansion, known as Mr Boffin’s room.
1	It was a sorrowful farewell.
1	Now, don’t do it any more.’ ‘I am not likely to have the opportunity,’ said Clennam.
1	‘Except that the account is against me, for I spend money to gratify my hatred, and you pocket it, and gratify yours at the same time.
1	'You--you--will be secret with me?'
1	Thereupon she said again, and again, ‘I beg your pardon, Amy,’ and ‘Forgive me, Amy,’ almost as passionately as she had said what she regretted.
1	bless your heart, Mrs Richards,’ cried Susan, ‘temporaries always orders permanencies here, didn’t you know that, why wherever was you born, Mrs Richards?
1	It is but due to her character to say, that in conjunction with her estimable husband, she had broken many and many a one.
1	"There's only a few words more."
1	My young friend, what is bondage?
1	It remains but to dismiss the leaders of the little crowd who have borne us company upon the road, and so to close the journey.
1	He acquitted himself very well, nevertheless; and Miss Blimber, commending him as giving promise of getting on fast, immediately provided him with subject B; from which he passed to C, and even D before dinner.
1	Just about that, and no less," returns Mrs. Bagnet, laughing and shaking her head.
1	I should wish it to be so deliberately said, and so deliberately considered.
1	Baffled boots from the vexed souls of disappointed outsiders.
1	But to take away the character of a lad that’s been a good servant to you, because he can’t afford to stand in his own light for your good, what a injury it is, and what a bad return for faithful service!
1	You say they are marks of finger-nails, and you set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child.
1	‘I think,’ he said, ‘my good friend Captain Cuttle mentioned something about being towed along in the wake of that day.
1	Nor can I forget, Major, on such an occasion as the present, how much I am indebted to it.’ ‘Dombey,’ says the Major, with appropriate action, ‘that is the hand of Joseph Bagstock: of plain old Joey B., Sir, if you like that better!
1	And everything a going on so well!
1	When I take the poker--so--and give it a dig--’ ‘Don’t disturb it, Charley, or it’ll be all in a blaze.
1	Dora--’ ‘Miss Spenlow, if you please,’ said her father, majestically.
1	I must have read very perspicuously, or the poor soul must have been deeply interested, for I remember she had a cloudy impression, after I had done, that they were a sort of vegetable.
1	What if I had seen him rush away, mad, in pursuit?
1	It only becomes enough when he has no money, and no clients, and no expectations, and no anything but debts.’ ‘Hah!’ said the cherub, a little depressed.
1	They cushioned me up on a large sofa by the fire, and then the comely landlady told me that I must travel no further to-night, but must go to bed.
1	When I come down, I’ll bring Madeline with me.
1	‘It’s all the same, Maggy,’ returned Little Dorrit, ‘all the same.’ ‘Is it all the same, mother?’ ‘Just the same.’ Maggy laughed, and immediately snored.
1	If you will have the kindness to step down to the Royal Exchange and to take the cocked-hat off the stoutest beadle’s head, you will find my card in the lining of the crown, wrapped up in a piece of blue paper.
1	Mr. Pickwick, do you see the old lady in the gauze turban?’ ‘The fat old lady?’ inquired Mr. Pickwick innocently.
1	It is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which I had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was, on that last occasion, open or shut.
1	Now, I ask you, Nickleby, as a man of the world; ‘Surely not,’ answered Ralph.
1	I think you must have seen that I was struck with those charms on the day when I waited at the Whytorseller.
1	We must get into the air; we must join our dear friend and brother, Riderhood.
1	We made much of Caddy, and Peepy too; and Caddy brightened exceedingly; and my guardian was as merry as we were; and we were all very happy indeed until Caddy went home at night in a hackney-coach, with Peepy fast asleep, but holding tight to the windmill.
1	sometimes arise in the best-regulated Families.
1	‘Yes, Miss, she is alive,’ returned Mrs Wickam with an air of triumph, for it was evident.
1	Mr. Jack Maldon was there, before us.
1	With the wreck of his possessions, he began to trade--in pictures first, and then in curious ancient things.
1	She writhes under her life.
1	I was all impatience, as I came along, to tell her.’ ‘Why, Kate,’ said Mrs. Nickleby, putting her feet upon the fender, and drawing her chair close to it, as if settling herself for a long talk.
1	Trembling beneath the weight of these reasons, Captain Cuttle lived a very close and retired life; seldom stirring abroad until after dark; venturing even then only into the obscurest streets; never going forth at all on Sundays; and both within and without the walls of his retreat, avoiding bonnets, as if they were worn by raging lions.
1	But the pleasure has outweighed the pain.
1	They are very charming apartments, sir.
1	No passion in the face, no avarice, no anxiety, no wild desire; all gentle, tranquil, and at peace.
1	It might be highly impolitic in Mr. C., after playing so long and so high, to leave off; it might be the reverse; I say nothing.
1	‘The bay mare splashed away, through the mud and water, with drooping ears; now and then tossing her head as if to express her disgust at this very ungentlemanly behaviour of the elements, but keeping a good pace notwithstanding, until a gust of wind, more furious than any that had yet assailed them, caused her to stop suddenly and plant her four feet firmly against the ground, to prevent her being blown over.
1	While poor excommunicated Miss Tox, who, if she were a fawner and toad-eater, was at least an honest and a constant one, and had ever borne a faithful friendship towards her impeacher and had been truly absorbed and swallowed up in devotion to the magnificence of Mr Dombey--while poor excommunicated Miss Tox watered her plants with her tears, and felt that it was winter in Princess’s Place.
1	The other name’s Hexam.’ Riah bent his head in assent.
1	One night I was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate, expending great efforts on the production of a letter to Joe.
1	‘Pray take me,’ said Bella.
1	‘Heigh ho hum!’ cried Mr Feeder, shaking himself like a cart-horse.
1	But what will you take?
1	The lady said, sir, the youngest Miss Dorrit.’ Mr Dorrit knitted his brows and rejoined, after a moment or two, ‘Inform Mrs Finching, sir,’ emphasising the name as if the innocent man were solely responsible for it, ‘that she can come up.’ He had reflected, in his momentary pause, that unless she were admitted she might leave some message, or might say something below, having a disgraceful reference to that former state of existence.
1	And am I to grovel in the dust for HIM to walk over?
1	It came to Clennam in his adversity, strongly and tenderly.
1	My impression is, after many years of consideration, that there never can have been anybody in the world who played worse.
1	We all went to London that afternoon, and finding two places in the mail, secured them.
1	And perhaps you wouldn’t mind,’ said Mr. Grewgious, ‘stepping over to the hotel in Furnival’s, and asking them to send in materials for laying the cloth.
1	As a blind in more senses than one, it reminded him that he was alone in the counting-house with the front door open.
1	for forty-one, ten, eleven and a half, and I am happy to recover my moral dignity, and to know that I can once more walk erect before my fellow man!’ With this introduction (which greatly affected him), Mr. Micawber placed his I.O.U.
1	the devil’s in this woman,’ muttered Arthur; adding with an ugly leer, ‘I said I trusted everything to you, Peg.
1	You are free to go, and we to follow.
1	You yourself wouldn’t hear of Joe, you very well know.
1	We have traced every name in schedules A and B, without meeting with that of Eatanswill; we have minutely examined every corner of the pocket county maps issued for the benefit of society by our distinguished publishers, and the same result has attended our investigation.
1	You remember Tom Martin, Neddy?’ said Roker, appealing to another man in the lodge, who was paring the mud off his shoes with a five-and-twenty-bladed pocket-knife.
1	‘Halloa, friend!’ said Eugene, calling after him, ‘are you blind?’ The man made no reply, but went his way.
1	Long after the ladies had retired, did the hot elder wine, well qualified with brandy and spice, go round, and round, and round again; and sound was the sleep and pleasant were the dreams that followed.
1	The old unhappy loss or want of something had, I am conscious, some place in my heart; but not to the embitterment of my life.
1	I may say, of myself and Copperfield, in words we have sung together before now, that     We twa hae run about the braes     And pu’d the gowans’ fine --in a figurative point of view--on several occasions.
1	But he corrected himself, and said, ‘Lor bless me!’ ‘That there man,’ said the Captain, ‘has left me in charge here by a piece of writing, but though he was a’most as good as my sworn brother, I know no more where he’s gone, or why he’s gone; if so be to seek his nevy, or if so be along of being not quite settled in his mind; than you do.
1	Tell me no more just now, or I might do it again.
1	As he walked briskly along the road, he heard behind him, the noise of some vehicle, approaching at a furious pace.
1	That blow partially recovered, she had gone to a vast expense to make such a figure before Mrs Dombey at home, as should dazzle the senses of that lady, and heap mortification, mountains high, on the head of Mrs Skewton.
1	It would have been easy to perceive that they had not slept all last night, even if Peggotty had failed to tell me of their still sitting just as I left them, when it was broad day.
1	I hear the bells.’ The wind brought the sounds of the church clock to the window.
1	‘I didn’t expect a visit from you, Charley,’ said his sister.
1	When Doctor Manette was released, you, his old domestic, had the charge of him, I know.
1	I promised myself that I would do something for them one of these days, and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a dinner of roast-beef and plum-pudding, a pint of ale, and a gallon of condescension, upon everybody in the village.
1	‘It was all there was,’ returned my aunt.
1	You know what Ma is--and I needn't make poor Pa more miserable by "But would it not be adding to his unhappiness to marry without his knowledge or consent, my dear?"
1	‘Oh yes, dear!’ ‘Whose, Floy?’ ‘Your old nurse’s.
1	He is making believe that he thinks of her good and not his own.
1	How do you do, sir?” and shook hands.
1	Mrs. Rouncewell, so many years housekeeper at Chesney Wold, sits within the chaise; and by her side sits Mrs. Bagnet with her grey cloak and umbrella.
1	Her other hand pressed hard upon the table, and again the curious stir was observable in her, as if she were going to rise.
1	They all got to work without loss of time, and very busy they were.
1	At length, the clock was hidden from his sight by some envious shutters, then the church steeples proclaimed eleven at night, then the quarter past, and then the conviction seemed to obtrude itself on his mind that it was no use tarrying there any longer.
1	The Jew nodded his head towards Nancy, who was still gazing at the fire; and intimated, by a sign, that he would have her told to leave the room.
1	Kiss it!” “Do so, as he wishes it,” I said to Herbert.
1	On the contrary, they rouse my indignation when I see them in action.’ ‘Alfred!’ ‘They rouse my indignation, my dear, against the unworthy persons, and give me a combative desire to stand between Mr Boffin and all such persons.
1	‘Number twenty-two wants his boots.’ ‘Ask number twenty-two, vether he’ll have ‘em now, or vait till he gets ‘em,’ was the reply.
1	He had also to pay for the two drawings, with many thanks, and, advancing to the little table, he laid upon it a bank note, folded in an envelope and sealed.
1	Curse this iron on my sore leg!
1	Still, the Doctor walked among the terrors with a steady head.
1	But being in company with the brother of a doosed fine gal--well educated too--with no biggodd nonsense about her--at the period alluded to--’ ‘There!
1	‘I know something of that hand, too.
1	There was no need of any caution this time, and no fear of being detained by having to play out a return match with Daniel Quilp’s boy.
1	I should certainly not have gone, but for the reference to my Uncle Provis.
1	Not that I reproach myself.
1	That it was strongly felt, and that there was a lively hope that it would prosper, there can be no doubt.
1	We are here, my love.’ The beautiful lady released her hold of Florence, and pressing her lips once more upon her face, withdrew hurriedly, and joined them.
1	“Don't be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross.
1	That done, he looked at the cork, unscrewed it from the corkscrew, laid each separately on the table, and, with the end of the sailor’s knot of his neckerchief, dusted the inside of the neck of the bottle.
1	I will not Pursue my Question.’ But the lumpy gentleman, unwilling to give it up, again madly said, ‘ESKER,’ and again spake no more.
1	Mr Feeder made in reply, a comic speech chequered with sentiment.
1	On meeting my eye, he said plainly, by a momentary and silent pause in that attitude, “Indeed?
1	‘At twenty minutes before seven, then,’ said Mr. Pyke, rising, ‘the coach will be here.
1	It is noticed, by the bye, that these damsels become, within the limits of decorum, more skittish when thus intrusted with the concrete representation of their sex, than when dividing the representation with Miss Twinkleton’s young ladies.
1	What would he do with coals?
1	He and his deaf assistant were sitting before the fire.
1	Mr. Pickwick’s case had not gone off in so particularly happy a manner, up to this point, that it could very well afford to have any additional suspicion cast upon it.
1	What a rattle I am!
1	It is in reference to your letter to Mr and Mrs Boffin, and this is what it is.
1	By the noisome ways through which they descended into that pit, they gradually emerge from it, the crowd flitting, and whistling, and skulking about them until they come to the verge, where restoration of the bull's-eyes is made to Darby.
1	He perceives with astonishment that supposing the present government to be overthrown, the limited choice of the Crown, in the formation of a new ministry, would lie between Lord Coodle and Sir Thomas Doodle--supposing it to be impossible for the Duke of Foodle to act with Goodle, which may be assumed to be the case in consequence of the breach arising out of that affair with Hoodle.
1	He found Golden Square in due course; Mr. Noggs, who had stepped out for a minute or so to the public-house, was opening the door with a latch-key, as he reached the steps.
1	"I have sent him to the other end of the room," observed Miss Jellyby, drawing her chair nearer ours, "because I don't want him to hear the conversation.
1	“Cobbey would persist in sniffing while he was a-eating his dinner, and said that the beef was so strong it made him.”--Very good, Cobbey, we’ll see if we can’t make you sniff a little without beef.
1	And I did hope it might just hint a caution.
1	‘I am sorry you have,’ rejoined Mr. Gregsbury, turning his back upon him.
1	At the inn we found Mr. Boythorn on horseback, waiting with an open carriage to take us to his house, which was a few miles off.
1	‘Oh, you’ve come back, have you!’ said Mrs. Weller.
1	Suspected and Denounced enemy of the Republic, Aristocrat, one of a family of tyrants, one of a race proscribed, for that they had used their abolished privileges to the infamous oppression of the people.
1	I hear Neville moving too.
1	Spiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings; and sometimes, when Oliver walked softly into a room, the mice would scamper across the floor, and run back terrified to their holes.
1	And such voice he’s in!’ Little Dorrit gave him her hand, and smilingly said she had not seen him this long time.
1	We’re going to have a wedding--a real wedding this time.’ ‘A wedding!’ exclaimed Mr. Snodgrass, turning very pale.
1	Seated, like an African chief, on one of these pieces of matting, the dwarf was regaling himself in the parlour, with bread and cheese and beer, when he observed without appearing to do so, that a boy was prying in at the outer door.
1	Hear me!’ ‘Unless you are a more obstinate and more persisting woman than even I know you to be,’ Mr Flintwinch interposed, ‘you had better leave Mr Rigaud, Mr Blandois, Mr Beelzebub, to tell it in his own way.
1	‘There--that’s enough.’ ‘Enough!’ cried Nicholas, advancing towards him.
1	When they can be got to believe that the kettle is made of the precious metals, in that fact lies the whole power of men like our late lamented.
1	‘Frederick,’ said he, ‘you and Fanny sup at your lodgings to-night, I know.
1	‘Among the best, my dear.’ ‘I should have thought, myself, it was so easy to add the usual kind of one,’ said Bella, with a toss of her curls.
1	‘Thank you,’ said Mrs Wilfer.
1	Hence Sir Leicester yields up his family legs to the family disorder as if he held his name and fortune on that feudal tenure.
1	I am disposed to think he had made no will.’ ‘Oh, I know he had!’ said I.
1	'Of course it couldn't,' replied Sikes; 'I know'd that, directly I see him coming through Clerkenwell, with the books under his arm.
1	Here Mr. Drummle looked at his boots and I looked at mine, and then Mr. Drummle looked at my boots, and I looked at his.
1	She then requested Kate to follow her, and after several feints on the part of Mr. Mantalini to attract the young lady’s attention, they went away: leaving that gentleman extended at full length on the sofa, with his heels in the air and a newspaper in his hand.
1	When I remembered where I was at that untimely hour, a feeling stole upon me that made me get up, afraid of I don’t know what, and walk about.
1	The figure of a man advanced in life, whose smooth grey eyebrows seemed to move to the ticking as the fire-light flickered on them, sat in an arm-chair, with his list shoes on the rug, and his thumbs slowly revolving over one another.
1	Nicholas looked upon the sleepers; at first, with the air of one who gazes upon a scene which, though familiar to him, has lost none of its sorrowful effect in consequence; and, afterwards, with a more intense and searching scrutiny, as a man would who missed something his eye was accustomed to meet, and had expected to rest upon.
1	When they move once more, Mr. Crisparkle is seen to look up at the sky, and to point before him.
1	You be off, ma’am, this minute, and fetch a little more brandy, or we shall have you in hysterics.’ By this time, the rings had begun to fall from the debtor’s irresolute hands, like leaves from a wintry tree.
1	‘You didn’t know me, but I knew two friends of yours that were stopping at the Peacock at Eatanswill, at the time of the election.’ ‘Oh, indeed!’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.
1	At last, having been (always attended by the cat) all over the house and having seen the whole stock of miscellaneous lumber, which was certainly curious, we came into the back part of the shop.
1	Even I, safe as an Englishman, and even Tellson's, important as they are to French credit, avoid all naming of the matter.
1	But this presses first.’ He debated principally whether he should write to young Drood, or whether he should speak to Jasper.
1	Mr Dombey’s mansion, if it be a gap among the other houses any longer, is only so because it is not to be vied with in its brightness, and haughtily casts them off.
1	‘It ain’t that she’s not as pretty as ever, for she’s prettier--I do assure you, she is prettier.
1	Mr. Bumble no sooner uttered Oliver's name, in explanation of his errand, than Mrs. Bedwin, who had been listening at the parlour door, hastened into the passage in a breathless state.
1	Which I meantersay, if the ghost of a man's own father cannot be allowed to claim his attention, what can, Sir?
1	Old Mrs Pipchin dozing in an easy chair, often changed to Miss Tox, or his aunt; and Paul was quite content to shut his eyes again, and see what happened next, without emotion.
1	If he takes and sends me out I must go.
1	We have stated them awkwardly, I dare say.’ ‘That I dare say you have,’ retorted her mother, briskly.
1	Not a wured to Mas’r Davy?’ There was a trembling upon her, that I can see now.
1	But remember, my dear, your future is between you two.
1	His steps echoed through the low building with a hollow sound, and he almost feared to be alone, it was so still and quiet.
1	Will you repeat it, my dear?’ Mrs Boffin complied, by reciting the verses in which this obliging offer had been made, exactly as she had received them.
1	Nor, that, when we met one night, and spoke together in the room yonder, over the way, she listened at the door.’ ‘Mas’r Davy!’ he replied in astonishment.
1	While assisting at the literary evenings, he even went so far, on two or three occasions, as to correct Mr Wegg when he grossly mispronounced a word, or made nonsense of a passage; insomuch that Mr Wegg took to surveying his course in the day, and to making arrangements for getting round rocks at night instead of running straight upon them.
1	They were good qualities, without which no high place can be meritoriously won, but like fire and water, though excellent servants, they were very bad masters.
1	‘It’s a large sum to Mr. Nickleby,’ he said, in a dolorous voice.
1	‘I was never up the river,’ added Rosa.
1	As Estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the door, Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her, with a ravenous intensity that was of its kind quite dreadful.
1	But to give it you short and handy, I'll put it at once into a mouthful of English.
1	The same kind friend had, with Mr. Losberne's assistance, cautiously stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that so recently taken place.
1	The Principal and instrument soon drove off together to a stable-yard in High Holborn, where a remarkably fine grey gelding, worth, at the lowest figure, seventy-five guineas (not taking into account the value of the shot he had been made to swallow for the improvement of his form), was to be parted with for a twenty-pound note, in consequence of his having run away last week with Mrs Captain Barbary of Cheltenham, who wasn’t up to a horse of his courage, and who, in mere spite, insisted on selling him for that ridiculous sum: or, in other words, on giving him away.
1	The dog growled again; and licking his lips, eyed Oliver as if he were anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay.
1	In short, my aunt, seeing how enraptured I was with the premises, took them for a month, with leave to remain for twelve months when that time was out.
1	He knew now that she was beautiful; he did not dispute that she was graceful and winning, and that in the bright dawn of her womanhood she had come upon him, a surprise.
1	‘Come home with me then,’ said Mr. Crummles, ‘and my boys shall go with you after dinner, and show you the most likely place.’ The offer was not to be refused; Nicholas and Mr. Crummles gave Mrs Crummles an arm each, and walked up the street in stately array.
1	Kate’s picture, too, would be in at least half-a-dozen of the annuals, and on the opposite page would appear, in delicate type, ‘Lines on contemplating the Portrait of Lady Mulberry Hawk.
1	‘Now, I’ll be plain with you, Veneering,’ says Podsnap, knitting his brows.
1	I could not say so, of course, or show that I knew anything about it.
1	I don't come in to stare about me.
1	Through all the rooms he wandered, as he always did, like the last person on earth who had any business to approach them.
1	‘Overpowering, really!’ ‘Do you think I don’t know,’ said my aunt, turning a deaf ear to the sister, and continuing to address the brother, and to shake her head at him with infinite expression, ‘what kind of life you must have led that poor, unhappy, misdirected baby?
1	‘Now, don’t be in a flutter, ma’am; you’ll be taken great care of.
1	Some of us will be dying in a workhouse next.’ ‘As the persons you have cited,’ quietly remarked the Secretary, ‘thought they would, if I remember, sir.’ ‘And very creditable in ‘em too,’ said Mr Boffin.
1	Innocent, in the mist through which she saw her father, and the prison, and the turbid living river that flowed through it and flowed on.
1	For, it was he addressed him with a severe countenance, and who had come in quietly by the folding-doors.
1	Thus, they had toiled along the dusty road, taking little heed of any object within sight, save when they stepped aside to allow a wider passage for the mail-coaches which were whirling out of town, until they passed through Highgate archway; when the foremost traveller stopped and called impatiently to his companion, 'Come on, can't yer?
1	‘I thought you might have know’d him without it,’ said Mr Boffin slightly disappointed.
1	Well might Barbara’s mother say to Kit’s mother that the gallery was the place to see from, and wonder it wasn’t much dearer than the boxes; well might Barbara feel doubtful whether to laugh or cry, in her flutter of delight.
1	‘Tilda Price has faults--many faults--but I wish her well, and above all I wish her married; for I think it highly desirable--most desirable from the very nature of her failings--that she should be married as soon as possible.
1	I told her so, and told her that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of that country.
1	‘Come!’ retorted Bounderby, stopping to wheel round upon him, ‘let’s have none of _your_ interruptions.
1	‘Never I mind!’ said John, ‘no, nor never nobody mind, say’st thou, schoolmeasther.
1	I come to the second.
1	I will only say, at parting, that you do him a great wrong.’ ‘I do him no wrong,’ she returned.
1	Tied, of your own noble will, to a ruined man!
1	There might be medical doctors at the present hour, a picking up their guineas where a honest tradesman don't pick up his fardens--fardens!
1	Wot are you bustin’ vith, now?’ ‘Sammy,’ said Mr. Weller, wiping his forehead, ‘I’m afeerd that vun o’ these days I shall laugh myself into a appleplexy, my boy.’ ‘Vell, then, wot do you do it for?’ said Sam.
1	‘I find it so,’ replied the man.
1	‘Now,’ said Mortimer, ‘what is it?’ ‘Governors Both,’ returned the man, in what he meant to be a wheedling tone, ‘which on you might be Lawyer Lightwood?’ ‘Lawyer Lightwood,’ ducking at him with a servile air, ‘I am a man as gets my living, and as seeks to get my living, by the sweat of my brow.
1	‘You do right, child,’ said Miss Abbey, ‘to speak well of those who deserve well of you.’ ‘Right or wrong,’ muttered Miss Wren, inaudibly, with a visible hitch of her chin, ‘I mean to do it, and you may make up your mind to THAT, old lady.’ ‘Here is the paper, madam,’ said the Jew, delivering into Miss Potterson’s hands the original document drawn up by Rokesmith, and signed by Riderhood.
1	We carried in the steerage nearly a hundred passengers: a little world of poverty: and as we came to know individuals among them by sight, from looking down upon the deck where they took the air in the daytime, and cooked their food, and very often ate it too, we became curious to know their histories, and with what expectations they had gone out to America, and on what errands they were going home, and what their circumstances were.
1	‘_You_ know you must keep up your spirits, mother, and not be lonesome because I’m not at home.
1	There is no mystery in it; there is an unfathomable mystery in the meanest of them, for ever.—Supposing we were to reverse our arithmetic for material objects, and to govern these awful unknown quantities by other means!
1	Two; four; and two is six,’ measuring on the pavement.
1	He’d take fire and blow up while he was about it.’ ‘And so you would be rid of him,’ said Lizzie, humouring her.
1	Then Lord Decimus evaded and wandered away, while he was getting his man up to the mark.
1	My good mother lived in the country."
1	‘Is it possible that I had the honour, sir, of officiating when--?’ ‘Yes,’ said I.
1	“What have I done!” I knew not how to answer, or how to comfort her.
1	He reached the yard; and his passion vanished in a moment.
1	‘Don’t let him go alone!’ screamed the females.
1	I was waiting for you, Mr. Harthouse, till it came down as _I_ never saw it come down before.
1	Being left to himself, the savage had a dance, all alone.
1	ha!’ His good-humour being in some degree restored by the vision of Ralph Nickleby swallowing, perforce, a five-shilling piece, Newman slowly brought forth from his desk one of those portable bottles, currently known as pocket-pistols, and shaking the same close to his ear so as to produce a rippling sound very cool and pleasant to listen to, suffered his features to relax, and took a gurgling drink, which relaxed them still more.
1	‘You decline to answer, do you?
1	"I've got a high pair as belonged to mother."
1	‘Your father can be free within this week.
1	The poor dear girls should have their disappointment broken to them gently, and, as the first preliminary, Miss Twinkleton should be confided in by Rosa, even in advance of the reappearance of Mr. Grewgious.
1	I am only unfortunate to have come in the way.
1	Look at them," glancing at the sleepers on the ground.
1	‘Yes; uncle Lillyvick, I would,’ returned Miss Morleena, with the energy of both her parents combined; ‘but not aunt Lillyvick.
1	And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One!
1	‘Wal’r!’ cried the Captain, looking down upon him in amazement.
1	Both were flushed, flustered, and rumpled, by the late scuffle; and Wegg, in coming to the ground, had received a humming knock on the back of his devoted head, which caused him still to rub it with an air of having been highly--but disagreeably--astonished.
1	‘My love, how you tremble!’ ‘Because I KNOW you’re going to scold me,’ exclaimed Dora, in a piteous voice.
1	Filled with this idea, he advanced at once, but stealthily.
1	Rick mistrusts and suspects me--goes to lawyers, and is taught to mistrust and suspect me.
1	I have not lived in a walking country, you know.’ ‘True,’ says Mr. Crisparkle.
1	‘Take care he don’t hear you, sir, or you may be sorry for it.’ ‘Oh, pray, Jane--’ said Miss Sophy.
1	If he had been murdered, and so artfully disfigured, or concealed, or both, as that the murderer hoped identification to be impossible, except from something that he wore, assuredly the murderer would seek to remove from the body the most lasting, the best known, and the most easily recognisable, things upon it.
1	The snow lay on the ground, frozen into a hard thick crust, so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways and corners were affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad:  which, as if expending increased fury on such prey as it found, caught it savagely up in clouds, and, whirling it into a thousand misty eddies, scattered it in air.
1	Without waiting for a reply, he inquired of the boys whether any one among them knew anything of their missing schoolmate.
1	And then the dream grew dim, and faded.
1	‘Yes sure!’ said she, when the business was opened, ‘Mrs Milvey had the kindness to write to me, ma’am, and I got Sloppy to read it.
1	The sun was down, the light had gradually stolen from the roof, and the shadow had crept upward.
1	Give me,” said Joe, “a good book, or a good newspaper, and sit me down afore a good fire, and I ask no better.
1	Also, notwithstanding their martial appearance, broad square shoulders, and heavy tread, whether there are within the same limits two more simple and unaccustomed children in all the Smallweedy affairs of life.
1	But I--I am afraid there’s something the matter with them.
1	I had become, in the Murdstone and Grinby time, however short or long it may have been, so unused to the sports and games of boys, that I knew I was awkward and inexperienced in the commonest things belonging to them.
1	One of the officers brought it to me as a curiosity.
1	Truly, Mr Sownds the Beadle has good reason to feel himself in office, as he suns his portly figure on the church steps, waiting for the marriage hour.
1	I rather thought he might have been here today, sir.
1	As it so happened that I never saw Mr. Skimpole again, I may at once finish what I know of his history.
1	Wy don’t you give in, and tell the Chancellorship that you’re wery sorry for makin’ his court contemptible, and you won’t do so no more?’ The cobbler put his pipe in the corner of his mouth, while he smiled, and then brought it back to its old place again; but said nothing.
1	‘And what then, pray?’ ‘Why, then you may go as soon as you like,’ says Mrs Pipchin.
1	The moment he ceased, she looked at him again.
1	Nickleby, there is terrible news for you, and I am sent to beg you will come with me directly,’ said a voice he seemed to recognise.
1	He shook my hand and said no more.
1	‘Oh-h!’ ‘I should be glad to countermine him, respecting the handsome gal, your friend.
1	The swarm and buzz, and going up and down, endure for days.
1	Will you come and see me today, at any time you like to appoint?
1	I love him so much, and so dearly, that when I sometimes think my life may be but a weary one, I am proud of it and glad of it.
1	Not so much in point of amount as owing to the peculiar and pressing nature of liabilities Mr. C. has incurred and the means he has of liquidating or meeting the same.
1	‘That was my speculation, Miss Wade.
1	"My physician, Mr. Woodcourt, my dear, who was so exceedingly attentive to me.
1	So forget and forgive all round, George.
1	‘Well,’ said Mary, ‘I never did!’ ‘O’ course not,’ said Sam, ‘and nobody never did, nor never vill neither; and here am I a-walkin’ about like the wandering Jew--a sportin’ character you have perhaps heerd on Mary, my dear, as vos alvays doin’ a match agin’ time, and never vent to sleep--looking arter this here Miss Arabella Allen.’ ‘Miss who?’ said Mary, in great astonishment.
1	Bob Glamour, William Williams, and Jonathan of the no surname, all shake hands with one another round, and with the doctor too.
1	It is a handsome city, but distractingly regular.
1	The horses belonging to the bar, the judge, and witnesses, were tied to temporary racks set up roughly in the road; by which is to be understood, a forest path, nearly knee-deep in mud and slime.
1	Let me raise your head.
1	Why, here’s a dismal face for ladies’ company!--my pretty sister too, whom you have so often asked me about.
1	So, Mr and Mrs Alfred Lammle had to prompt, and this is how they prompted.
1	It was a little disconcerting to me, to find, when I was being helped up behind the coach, that I was supposed to have eaten all the dinner without any assistance.
1	Boiling water hissed and heaved within dilapidated walls; whence, also, the glare and roar of flames came issuing forth; and mounds of ashes blocked up rights of way, and wholly changed the law and custom of the neighbourhood.
1	Mr. Chitling was older in years than the Dodger: having perhaps numbered eighteen winters; but there was a degree of deference in his deportment towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that he felt himself conscious of a slight inferiority in point of genius and professional aquirements.
1	He added, ‘And besides, you know it’s likely that you’ll soon have your sister--’ ‘Dearest Amy, yes!’ cried Mrs Sparkler with a sigh of affection.
1	But here I am, left with all the ridiculous parts of the situation remaining, and, added to them all, this ridiculous dress!
1	‘To see the clinging of that pretty little thing to her uncle,’ said Mr. Omer; ‘to see the way she holds on to him, tighter and tighter, and closer and closer, every day, is to see a sight.
1	And so she used to sit propped up in a great arm-chair, with her beautiful complexion and rosy lips, staring at me--or not so much at me, I think, as at nothing--while I busily stitched away and told her every one of my secrets.
1	The city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already-- it had not been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air.
1	‘I must be a prisoner for a little while,’ said Agnes, ‘but here are the old books, Trotwood, and the old music.’ ‘Even the old flowers are here,’ said I, looking round; ‘or the old kinds.’ ‘I have found a pleasure,’ returned Agnes, smiling, ‘while you have been absent, in keeping everything as it used to be when we were children.
1	Two taps were now heard on the outside of the window.
1	"Yes, so you did say about ten.
1	His endeavouring to hoist himself on to a very high window-seat, and his slipping down again, appeared to prepare Toots’s mind for the reception of a discovery.
1	But from this day, the Sparsit action upon Mr. Bounderby threw Louisa and James Harthouse more together, and strengthened the dangerous alienation from her husband and confidence against him with another, into which she had fallen by degrees so fine that she could not retrace them if she tried.
1	In a preposterous coat, like a beadle’s, with cuffs and flaps exaggerated to an unspeakable extent; in an immense waistcoat, knee-breeches, buckled shoes, and a mad cocked hat; with nothing fitting him, and everything of coarse material, moth-eaten and full of holes; with seams in his black face, where fear and heat had started through the greasy composition daubed all over it; anything so grimly, detestably, ridiculously shameful as the whelp in his comic livery, Mr. Gradgrind never could by any other means have believed in, weighable and measurable fact though it was.
1	“Less coarse and common?” said Miss Havisham, playing with Estella's hair.
1	One night, the third after Nelly’s interview with Mrs Quilp, the old man, who had been weak and ill all day, said he should not leave home.
1	You know how few our wants are--John’s and mine--and what little use we have for money, after the life we have led together for so many years; and now that he is earning an income that is ample for us, through your kindness.
1	Aye, Emily, beautiful and drooping, cling to him with the utmost trust of thy bruised heart; for he has clung to thee, with all the might of his great love!
1	From the blacksmith's.” “Halloa!” said the sergeant, staring at Joe.
1	‘You will take cold in the evening air,’ urged the spinster aunt affectionately.
1	You, to be sure!’ observed my aunt, ‘and you can’t fan it away, my military friend!’) ‘It was the first unhappiness of my new life,’ said Annie.
1	‘What’s put marriage in your head?’ She answered with such a start, that it quite awoke me.
1	She has rather a scaly appearance.
1	He had taken scarcely anything to eat or drink since early in the morning, and felt quite worn out and exhausted.
1	When there was any little hint of anything being in the wind, he got lost directly.
1	Mr. Guppy, slightly nudging his friend to take another look, makes a shuffling bow to Mr. Tulkinghorn, who returns it with an easy nod.
1	And then I hope I shall have my little John Harmon to show you.’ Mr Rokesmith, who was at the wheel adjusting the skirts of her dress, suddenly looked behind him, and around him, and then looked up at her, with a face so pale that Mrs Boffin cried: ‘Gracious!’ And after a moment, ‘What’s the matter, sir?’ ‘How can you show her the Dead?’ returned Mr Rokesmith.
1	And be sure that close to little Georgiana, also under inspection by the same gingerous gentleman, sits Fledgeby.
1	There were two great aloes, in tubs, on the turf outside the windows; the broad hard leaves of which plant (looking as if they were made of painted tin) have ever since, by association, been symbolical to me of silence and retirement.
1	Mr. Snawley’s house was on the extreme borders of some new settlements adjoining Somers Town, and Mr. Squeers had taken lodgings therein for a short time, as his stay was longer than usual, and the Saracen, having experience of Master Wackford’s appetite, had declined to receive him on any other terms than as a full-grown customer.
1	The two shots were fired, as nearly as possible, at the same instant.
1	Startled by a ring at the door, he hastily concluded this operation, and locked the press; but there was no need for any particular hurry, as the discreet Peg seldom knew the bell was rung unless she happened to cast her dim eyes upwards, and to see it shaking against the kitchen ceiling.
1	"It is close at hand.
1	Better than any novel-book _I_ ever see!'
1	This became so bewildering and suggested the possibility of so many Mr. Turveydrops that I said, "Esther, you must make up your mind to abandon this subject altogether and attend to Caddy."
1	On charges of inviolable secrecy, confidences were interchanged respecting golden youth of England expected to call, ‘at home,’ on the first opportunity.
1	Perfect unconsciousness of what had happened in the home that existed no more, even the deep slumber of exhaustion could not produce.
1	"Lady Dedlock, if I may speak plainly--" "By all means."
1	She does not care to go about with us; she is lost in the society we have here; our tastes are evidently not her tastes.
1	He found himself jostled among a crowd of people, chiefly women, who were huddled together in a dirty frowsy room, at the upper end of which was a raised platform railed off from the rest, with a dock for the prisoners on the left hand against the wall, a box for the witnesses in the middle, and a desk for the magistrates on the right; the awful locality last named, being screened off by a partition which concealed the bench from the common gaze, and left the vulgar to imagine (if they could) the full majesty of justice.
1	What are my agony and indignation next day, when I hear a flying rumour that the Misses Nettingall have stood Miss Shepherd in the stocks for turning in her toes!
1	How much more to hers!
1	He would bear nothing but his pride.
1	What devil have you conjured into the dog?’ ‘I have done nothing to him.’ ‘Get out of his sight or I can’t hold the wild beast!
1	Sharply on the part of Edwin Drood.
1	Is that a weapon in your hand?” “No; I am not armed.” “What is it in your hand?” “You shall know directly.
1	Mr Clennam, would you oblige me--hum--with a blue neckcloth you will find in that drawer at your elbow.
1	‘Well,’ said Mr. Pickwick, as Sam and his companion drew nigh, ‘you will see how your health becomes, and think about it meanwhile.
1	Dozing and dreaming, without the power of reckoning time, so that a minute might have been an hour and an hour a minute, some abiding impression of a garden stole over him--a garden of flowers, with a damp warm wind gently stirring their scents.
1	"Tony," says Mr. Guppy as they walk towards the court, "once again understand me, as a friend.
1	An inconstant elf, he knows not himself, Nor his own changing mind an hour, He’ll smile in your face, and, with wry grimace, He’ll wither your youngest flower.
1	‘There is only one phenomenon, sir,’ replied Mr. Crummles impressively, ‘and that’s a girl.’ ‘Very true,’ said Nicholas.
1	But all these occurrences preceded the final day.
1	Her pensive form was not long idle at the door.
1	I am getting old, Tom, and have lost nearly all my nails.
1	‘Perhaps not,’ said Fascination Fledgeby, with great quickness of repartee; ‘but I expect it will be devilish warm to-morrow.’ He threw off another little scintillation.
1	It will be better done without my being by.
1	That, this patriot would be produced before them.
1	I thought it best not to show him, you see, if it could be helped; for he’s a-shaking all over, like--Blight’s simile is perhaps inspired by the surrounding dishes of sweets--‘like Glue Monge.’ ‘Sharp boy again,’ returns Eugene.
1	It was sufficiently late in the year for the orchards to be ruddy with ripe apples; and in a few places the hop-pickers were already at work.
1	At last, he couldn't help shutting 'em, to ease 'em a minute; and the very moment he did so, he hears Chickweed a-roaring out, "Here he is!"
1	"George," says Mrs. Bagnet, working busily, "if I thought you cross enough to think of anything that a shrill old soldier's wife--who could have bitten her tongue off afterwards and ought to have done it almost--said this morning, I don't know what I shouldn't say to you now."
1	The old man took off his hat--he had no memory for the words--but he said amen, and that they were very good.
1	‘If you can’t bear the looks of a poor thing, it would be better to tell her so at once, and not go and shut her out like that, hurting her feelings and breaking her heart at ten year old, poor thing!’ ‘It’s to ease my head, Maggy.’ ‘Well, and if you cry to ease your head, Little Mother, let me cry too.
1	He was left to himself, however, and there was comfort in that.
1	For as her murderous perspective, before the doing of the deed, however subtle the precautions for its commission, would have been closed up by a gigantic dilatation of the hateful figure, preventing her from seeing any consequences beyond it; and as those consequences would have rushed in, in an unimagined flood, the moment the figure was laid low--which always happens when a murder is done; so, now she sees that when he used to be on the watch before her, and she used to think, "if some mortal stroke would but fall on this old man and take him from my way!"
1	Shall we tell the lamentations that ensued when Miss Wardle found herself deserted by the faithless Jingle?
1	What would they have contracted?
1	‘Yes, my darling!’ ‘Why, how did you come here, dearest?’ ‘I—I don’t quite know,’ said Rosa with a blush; ‘unless I am dreaming!’ Why with a blush?
1	You fall into that habit, and then who notices or minds?
1	They’ll bother her head off, I think, before they have done with her.
1	The very best materials, too!’ ‘Lor, you’ll be so smart,’ said Miss Tox, ‘that your husband won’t know you; will you, Sir?’ ‘I should know her,’ said Toodle, gruffly, ‘anyhows and anywheres.’ Toodle was evidently not to be bought over.
1	It’s a world of change.
1	He wants to see some fragment in Captain Hawdon's writing.
1	‘Emma,’ he returned, ‘that view of the question is, at such a moment, irresistible.
1	‘Yes, yes,’ says the other.
1	Some injurious suspicion lodged itself in his brain, that she wanted to supplant Mrs Bangham, and that she was given to drinking.
1	This Kit is one of your honest people; one of your fair characters; a prowling prying hound; a hypocrite; a double-faced, white-livered, sneaking spy; a crouching cur to those that feed and coax him, and a barking yelping dog to all besides.’ ‘Fearfully eloquent!’ cried Brass with a sneeze.
1	"Mrs. Chadband--this gentleman's wife--Reverend Mr.
1	Whatever they could prove (which is usually anything you like), they proved there, in an army constantly strengthening by the arrival of new recruits.
1	This position not being the most comfortable one he could have chosen for himself, he managed to stagger to his feet, and, holding on by the admiral, looked round for his host.
1	"If she is, she has reason to be.
1	Guard, my carpet- bag!’ Bidding the other passengers good-night, in a rather snappish manner, the stranger alighted.
1	‘Can’t be done, sir,’ returned Pancks.
1	Old Bailey Spi--i--ies!” “Why, to be sure!” exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he had assisted.
1	‘Why, in a measure means,’ returned Squeers, ‘as it may be, that it wasn’t all on my account, because you had some old grudge to satisfy, too.’ ‘If I had not had,’ said Ralph, in no way abashed by the reminder, ‘do you think I should have helped you?’ ‘Why no, I don’t suppose you would,’ Squeers replied.
1	When that person discloses, my part in this business will cease and determine.
1	He could not have quaked more, through his whole being, before the teeth, though he had come into the service of some powerful enchanter, and they had been his strongest spells.
1	But he cared, beyond all expression, for his wife, as a most precious and sweet commodity that was always looking up, and that never was worth less than all the gold in the world.
1	On the following day, I visited a plantation or farm, of about twelve hundred acres, on the opposite bank of the river.
1	Now, for example, Mr. Traddles,’ said Mrs. Micawber, assuming a profound air, ‘a judge, or even say a Chancellor.
1	Let me tie your neck-handkerchief into a regular good bow, for you’re a regular beau yourself, Father, if ever there was one.’ With this filial joke his daughter smartened him up, and gave him a loving hug, and stood at the door with her weak child in her arms, and her strong child tumbling down the steps, looking after her little old father as he toddled away with his arm under Little Dorrit’s.
1	The water-wheel of the paper-mill was audible there, and seemed to have a softening influence on the bright wintry scene.
1	Give yourself a little treat!’ ‘No thank’ee, Ma’am,’ returned the Captain very humbly.
1	Master Charley Bates, having laughed heartily again, resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes.
1	By degrees they let him know that doubts have arisen, that inquiries are to be made, and perhaps he may be pardoned after all.
1	At this moment, there walked into the room:  supporting himself by a thick stick:  a stout old gentleman, rather lame in one leg, who was dressed in a blue coat, striped waistcoat, nankeen breeches and gaiters, and a broad-brimmed white hat, with the sides turned up with green.
1	They stood in the daylight before a crowd so vast, that if all the people in the world could have been brought together into one space, they could not have looked, he thought, more numerous; and they all abhorred him, and there was not one pitying or friendly eye among the millions that were fastened on his face.
1	Not a fortified town that they passed in all their journey was as strong, not a Cathedral summit was as high, as Mr Dorrit’s castle.
1	You come and ask me in the street to take you for a Secretary, and I take you.
1	A piece of red cloth with which that phantom had been stiffened in its lifetime was now laid bare, and poked itself up, at the back of the old man’s neck, into a confusion of grey hair and rusty stock and buckle which altogether nearly poked his hat off.
1	They had only been two days in the house, when Florence, being in an arbour in the garden one warm morning, musingly observant of a youthful group upon the turf, through some intervening boughs,--and wreathing flowers for the head of one little creature among them who was the pet and plaything of the rest, heard this same lady and her niece, in pacing up and down a sheltered nook close by, speak of herself.
1	Her limpid blue eyes were fixed upon me, her semi-transparent hands were clasped together, pallor overspread her aquiline features, and, though encouraged to proceed, she never did proceed a word further.
1	Don't deceive yourself, my dear.
1	‘Ain’t you the idlest vagabond in London?’ The impeachment, while it much affected Mr Toodle Junior, attached to his character so justly, that he could not say a word in denial.
1	‘There’s hemp-seed sown for you, my fine fellow!’ ‘I’m sure, Sir,’ returned the wretched Biler, blubbering again, and again having recourse to his coat-cuff: ‘I shouldn’t care, sometimes, if it was growed too.
1	This last discovery was made by the two friends in pursuing their inquiries.
1	‘Do you know how this stone came here, my friend?’ inquired the benevolent Mr. Pickwick.
1	As the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment, the undertaker turned to go away.
1	Mr. James he began to be restless again.
1	How could it be foreseen!’ Then he stopped, and asked aloud: ‘Where do they live?’ Pleasant further explained that only the daughter had resided with the father at the time of his accidental death, and that she had immediately afterwards quitted the neighbourhood.
1	"You will do me the kindness to remember, sir, that I am not at present placed?"
1	But the subject so survived all day, nevertheless, that Miss Ferdinand got into new trouble by surreptitiously clapping on a paper moustache at dinner-time, and going through the motions of aiming a water-bottle at Miss Giggles, who drew a table-spoon in defence.
1	The preparation consisted in the despatch of her maid to Paris under the protection of the Courier, for the purchase of that outfit for a bride on which it would be extremely low, in the present narrative, to bestow an English name, but to which (on a vulgar principle it observes of adhering to the language in which it professes to be written) it declines to give a French one.
1	We call this a state of childishness, but it is the same poor hollow mockery of it, that death is of sleep.
1	‘If he hasn’t been,’ said Mrs. Nickleby, ‘and got, from somewhere or other, a couple of roots of those flowers that I said I was so fond of, the other night, and asked you if you were not--no, that YOU said YOU were so fond of, the other night, and asked me if I wasn’t--it’s the same thing.
1	What is your remark on that proportion?
1	It was after breakfast, and we had been summoned in from the playground, when Mr. Sharp entered and said: ‘David Copperfield is to go into the parlour.’ I expected a hamper from Peggotty, and brightened at the order.
1	‘You were in the tiptop fashion, and all the rest of it,’ said Mr. Bounderby.
1	“I don't wish to make a display of my feelings, but I have habitually thought of you more in the night than I am quite equal to.” “Then don't think of me,” retorted Miss Havisham.
1	We were speaking of York Minster just now.
1	His nose and chin were sharp and prominent, his jaws had fallen inwards from loss of teeth, his face was shrivelled and yellow, save where the cheeks were streaked with the colour of a dry winter apple; and where his beard had been, there lingered yet a few grey tufts which seemed, like the ragged eyebrows, to denote the badness of the soil from which they sprung.
1	That I assert no cause whatever of complaint against her.
1	Will you go, Edith?’ ‘Will I go!’ she repeated, turning very red, and breathing quickly as she looked round at her mother.
1	Woe to the defaulter whose appeal lay to the tribunal where those severe eyes presided.
1	All those lights were extinguished before I could sound the words.’ ‘Light ‘em up again!’ said Mr Meagles.
1	He is a young man of an impetuous temper and of little or no experience; and I saw no reason why such a hero should be lifted out of nature.
1	What time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon its tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside.
1	Her little light curls were as crisp as ever, and she had already her spectacles on, which made Paul wonder whether she went to bed in them.
1	Internal shame and external circumstances may bring the contest to a close in a week, or a day; but, it has been a contest for years, and is only fought out after a long balance of victory.
1	"It is not," said Mr. Woodcourt, "his being so much younger or older, or thinner or fatter, or paler or ruddier, as there being upon his face such a singular expression.
1	‘Oh my stars and what’s-their-names!’ she went on, clapping a hand on each of her little knees, and glancing shrewdly at me, ‘I’m of too full a habit, that’s the fact, Steerforth.
1	YOU have got YOUR nose out of joint.
1	Nor is that all; my house has been destroyed--razed to the ground.
1	‘It’s a deal too good to be married in, master,’ rejoined Peg, after a short inspection of the suit.
1	said she, putting her hand into her reticule, "I have nothing here but documents, my dear Fitz Jarndyce; I must borrow a pocket handkerchief."
1	So expressive it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller, wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.
1	In truth she is not a hard lady naturally, and the time has been when the sight of the venerable figure suing to her with such strong earnestness would have moved her to great compassion.
1	You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
1	Of such melodious strings is Miss Pleasant Riderhood formed.’ ‘Then it IS the lady as formerly objected?’ said Wegg.
1	It is a pretty sight!” “In a word,” said Madame Defarge, coming out of her short abstraction, “I cannot trust my husband in this matter.
1	‘I--if I may venture to say so--oppose all change in her.’ ‘Then at all events she shall press you to stay,’ returned Mrs. Nickleby.
1	Of sunset once again, and nightfall.
1	O, I don’t think so.
1	‘I might even,’ he reflected, ‘be apprehended as having been concerned in my own murder!’ Therefore, best to send it to the daughter under cover by the post.
1	And as to Belzoni, I suppose he’s dead;—I’m sure I hope he is—and how can his legs or his chokes concern you?’ ‘It is nearly time for your return, Rosa.
1	He says it is to you.’ ‘Yes, I do say so,’ interposed the boy.
1	Squeers eyed his companion slyly, at the conclusion of this little dialogue, and finding that he had grown thoughtful and appeared in nowise disposed to volunteer any observations, contented himself with lashing the pony until they reached their journey’s end.
1	"But is the secret safe so far?"
1	'I hope not, sir,' said Mrs. Bedwin.
1	He then dressed for dinner, by taking off his glazed hat and putting on his coat.
1	On the other hand, she often looked at him, with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but his face never showed the least consciousness.
1	Not near him!’ ‘What’s his name, Captain Cuttle?’ inquired Walter, determined to be interested in the Captain’s friend.
1	At least, if I could--but I shall come to all that by and by, and it is mere idleness to go on about it now.
1	‘See what men put away and forget, or mean to destroy, and don’t!’ He then added in a slow tone, ‘As--ton--ish--ing!’ And as he rolled his eyes all round the room, Wegg and Venus likewise rolled their eyes all round the room.
1	She is a very superior young lady, of very remarkable attractions, graces, and virtues.
1	‘I’m glad to hear it,’ returned the other.
1	‘Be so good,’ said Jeremiah, closing the house door, and taking a pretty sharp survey of the smiling visitor in his turn, ‘as to step into my counting-house.--It’s all right, I tell you!’ petulantly breaking off to answer the voice up-stairs, still unsatisfied, though Affery was there, speaking in persuasive tones.
1	‘You’re wanted, Sir.’ ‘Who wants me?’ Lowten looked at Mr. Pickwick, and coughed.
1	‘Eh?’ replied the man, holding the door in his hand, and honouring the inquirer with a stare and a broad grin, ‘Lord, no.’ ‘I came by her own appointment,’ said Kate; ‘I am--I am--to be employed here.’ ‘Oh!
1	The Jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed to be at all bewildered, either by the darkness of the night, or the intricacies of the way.
1	‘Haply,’ he said, turning his furrowed face slowly about, that he might as it were individually address the whole audience, those both near and distant; ‘haply, when this question has been tak’n up and discoosed, there’ll be a threat to turn out if I’m let to work among yo.
1	‘Sorry to deprive you of a pipe, Wegg,’ he said, filling his own, ‘but you can’t do both together.
1	Walter retraced his steps as quickly as he could, and entered the gloomy house with a sorrowful foreboding.
1	I found a great many foxes, disparaging whole vineyards of inaccessible grapes; but I found very few foxes whom I would have trusted within reach of a bunch.
1	The darkness is augmented and confused, by flying dust from the earth, dry twigs from the trees, and great ragged fragments from the rooks’ nests up in the tower.
1	‘I have been thinking,’ Jenny went on, ‘as I sat at work to-day, what a thing it would be, if I should be able to have your company till I am married, or at least courted.
1	We were soon in Saint Albans and alighted a little before day, when I was just beginning to arrange and comprehend the occurrences of the night and really to believe that they were not a dream.
1	Whether it was because we had sat there so long, or because Steerforth was resolved not to lose the advantage he had gained, I do not know; but we did not remain in the dining-room more than five minutes after her departure.
1	‘I am bound to believe you, and of course I do believe you,’ said Mr. Wickfield.
1	‘That’s right!’ It was from Peggotty; something less legible than usual, and brief.
1	If you knew how I have looked for you, Mr. Weller--’ ‘Wery hard, indeed, I s’pose?’ said Sam drily.
1	‘Talk of fairies!’ cried Mr. Kenwigs ‘I never see anybody so light to be alive, never.
1	Let me explain to you what I mean.’ ‘I think I don’t want to know,’ said Dora.
1	“Where did you get swords from?” “Out of a cupboard,” said I.
1	And his trust is not a very difficult one, for it is only an annuity of a hundred and fifteen pounds.
1	Yet there is something a little wrong about it in despite of its immense advantages.
1	‘She is glad, glad, to be rich, that he may have the money.
1	Half-length portraits in crayons abounded all through the house, but were so dispersed that I found the brother of a youthful officer of mine in the china-closet and the grey old age of my pretty young bride, with a flower in her bodice, in the breakfast-room.
1	There is a magic in the sound.
1	Then, he would bury in a quart pot, as much of his countenance as the dimensions of the quart pot admitted of its receiving, and take another look at Sam and Mr. Pickwick.
1	He looks to it, flushed and fitfully, to do something with his interests and bring them to some settlement.
1	Rosa, with fresh tears, kneels at her feet and kisses her hand.
1	They saw the vault covered, and the stone fixed down.
1	I was such a child, and so little, that frequently when I went into the bar of a strange public-house for a glass of ale or porter, to moisten what I had had for dinner, they were afraid to give it me.
1	It makes me shiver, Mr. George.
1	We are not accustomed to carry things with the same hand or to look at 'em from the same point.
1	‘That won’t do here!’ ‘If you had brought me (except for Doyce’s sake) twice what I have lost,’ cried Arthur, ‘you would not have given me the pleasure that you give me in this news.’ ‘Why, of course, of course,’ assented Mr Meagles.
1	‘Naturally, Mr Headstone, I have a good deal of influence with her.
1	As he raised his head from stooping to do so, he found the landlady beside him.
1	It must be the theme of general conversation.
1	Then I feared that the young man would lose his situation and that I might ruin him.
1	Have no antecedents, no established character, no cultivation, no ideas, no manners; have Shares.
1	The latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to imply a doubt of its reception; for Mr. Fagin and his young friend had not met, since she had interfered in behalf of Oliver.
1	‘You were about to speak, young gentleman; what were you going to say?’ ‘Merely that I almost hoped--I mean to say, thought--you had some object in consulting those advertisements,’ said Nicholas.
1	‘Take care, then!’ Rob expressed in a number of short bows his lively understanding of this caution, and was bowing himself back to the door, greatly relieved by the prospect of getting on the outside of it, when his patron stopped him.
1	Nay, the high priests of this worship had the man before them as a protest against their meanness.
1	'He has likewise attempted, sir, to murder the female servant,' said Mr. Bumble, with a face of ashy paleness.
1	She asked and gave no quarter.
1	‘Nervous,’ said Bob Sawyer complacently.
1	I don’t know how long we were going, and to this hour I know as little where we went.
1	My dearest Louisa, I cannot go myself, or let you go, in this hard abuse of your power.’ Mrs. Sparsit saw him detain her with his encircling arm, and heard him then and there, within her (Mrs. Sparsit’s) greedy hearing, tell her how he loved her, and how she was the stake for which he ardently desired to play away all that he had in life.
1	‘What have I been a-doing of?’ asked Mr. Raddle.
1	Mr Dombey receiving this announcement with perfect equanimity, they took leave of that gentleman, and presently departed under the protection of Mr Chick; who, when they had turned their backs upon the house and left its master in his usual solitary state, put his hands in his pockets, threw himself back in the carriage, and whistled ‘With a hey ho chevy!’ all through; conveying into his face as he did so, an expression of such gloomy and terrible defiance, that Mrs Chick dared not protest, or in any way molest him.
1	After a hearty breakfast, the four gentlemen sallied forth to walk to Gravesend, followed by a man bearing the stone in its deal box.
1	After several imperfect words, which vainly attempted to struggle to the surface, but were drowned and washed away by the strong tide of her tears, she spake.
1	She must take her chance.’ Mrs. Nickleby becomes acquainted with Messrs Pyke and Pluck, whose Affection and Interest are beyond all Bounds Mrs. Nickleby had not felt so proud and important for many a day, as when, on reaching home, she gave herself wholly up to the pleasant visions which had accompanied her on her way thither.
1	Give him sixpence, or five shillings, or five pound ten--you are arithmeticians, and I am not--and get rid of him!"
1	“He han't no call to say so.” “But does he say so?” “It would turn a man's blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell of it, sir,” said the landlord.
1	‘Go on.’ ‘You see,’ proceeded Mr Meagles ‘it might put us wrong with our son-in-law, it might even put us wrong with our daughter, and it might lead to a great deal of domestic trouble.
1	“Pooh!” said he, “I didn't care much for it.
1	But thou know’st our old agreement.
1	Mr. Bounderby and his shadow had not stood near Louisa, who held her father’s arm, but in a retired place by themselves.
1	In this manner they were fed at the discretion of their master.
1	It was something of a blow to the little woman, that when we were within twenty miles of our destination, it became clearly necessary to put this baby to bed.
1	Well, Pip; this same identical, which his manners is given to blusterous, come to me at the Bargemen (wot a pipe and a pint of beer do give refreshment to the workingman, sir, and do not over stimilate), and his word were, 'Joseph, Miss Havisham she wish to speak to you.
1	Mr. Tulkinghorn hurries to the landing and calls, "Miss Flite!
1	She wore at her side a gentleman’s gold watch, if I might judge from its size and make, with an appropriate chain and seals; she had some linen at her throat not unlike a shirt-collar, and things at her wrists like little shirt-wristbands.
1	‘Very soon now, Florence: very soon.’ Edith bent her head a little, so as to press the blooming cheek of Florence against her own, and for some few moments remained thus silent.
1	‘Will you go on, sir,’ said the old gentleman, gravely, ‘or are we to wait here for you till it’s too late for our appointment?’ The pony remained immoveable.
1	The father opened the room door for us and bowed us out in a manner, I must acknowledge, worthy of his shining original.
1	And therefore I am very glad to get out of his way and to go home with my friend Jarndyce."
1	Mr. Bucket compares the faces with one eye shut up, while Mr. Bagnet smokes in stolid satisfaction.
1	All.’ ‘All the debts for which he had been imprisoned here, all my life and longer?’ ‘No doubt.’ There was something of uncertainty and remonstrance in her look; something that was not all satisfaction.
1	And what’s more,--the boat’s drove tight by the tide ‘atwixt two tiers of barges.
1	‘I’ll tell you what, sir,’ he said; ‘the talent of this child is not to be imagined.
1	‘You’ll be asked the question down town,’ said the man.
1	‘It’s very kind of you.
1	I believe she conceals them, and always will conceal them, even from herself.
1	Hour after hour had he sat on his mother’s knee, and with childish sympathy watched the tears that stole down her face, and then crept quietly away into some dark corner, and sobbed himself to sleep.
1	Finally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom, I was truly wretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I should never like Joe's trade.
1	This is a boy, sir, who had a fancy for plunging into eighteen feet of water, with his clothes on, and bringing up a blind man’s dog, who was being drowned by the weight of his chain and collar, while his master stood wringing his hands upon the bank, bewailing the loss of his guide and friend.
1	The blinds were all drawn down, and the inscription Pubsey and Co. seemed to doze in the counting-house window on the ground-floor giving on the sleepy street.
1	The peril of an old servant and a good one, whose only crime was fidelity to himself and his family, stared him so reproachfully in the face, that, as he walked to and fro in the Temple considering what to do, he almost hid his face from the passersby.
1	But he called till he was hoarse; nobody paid the least attention to him.
1	And speaking of Gaspard (ah, poor Gaspard!
1	But when the time came for the child to say ‘Good-night, Papa,’ and go to bed, Florence would sob and tremble as she raised her face to him, and could look no more.
1	Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with solitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one o'clock.
1	She tried hard to retain her firmness, but he saw it melting away under his eyes.
1	You know I am English.” “I perceive your tongue is,” returned madame; “and what the tongue is, I suppose the man is.” He did not take the identification as a compliment; but he made the best of it, and turned it off with a laugh.
1	‘Like a bee, Sir,’ said Mrs Blimber, with uplifted eyes, ‘about to plunge into a garden of the choicest flowers, and sip the sweets for the first time Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Terence, Plautus, Cicero.
1	Let’s talk!’ ‘Do you always live here, sir?’ asked Rosa.
1	All I desire, Mr. Copperfield, is, that it should be forgotten.
1	somewhere, anywhere, for refuge, never more to look upon the place from which she fled!
1	You are welcome to all you have kept from me.’ ‘Are those of your own name dear to you?’ said the man emphatically.
1	What was she a doing of, when you went in today?” asked Mr. Pumblechook.
1	Mr Chick, finding that his destiny was, for the time, against him, said no more, and walked off.
1	‘Dead, Mr. Peggotty?’ I hinted, after a respectful pause.
1	Both times I thought (though that may easily be my mistake), that he hardly looked as if he had met me by accident.’ ‘Did he say anything?’ ‘No; he only nodded and put his head on one side.’ ‘The devil take his head!’ mused Clennam, still looking at the fire; ‘it’s always on one side.’ He roused himself to persuade her to put some wine to her lips, and to touch something to eat--it was very difficult, she was so timid and shy--and then said, musing again: ‘Is my mother at all changed to you?’ ‘Oh, not at all.
1	Here’s a match, and now where’s the candle?
1	I am sorry to see you sitting in the street."
1	‘I am going up stairs to Mr Fledgeby’s.’ ‘You cannot do that at this moment.
1	The storm soon began to pass upon its way.
1	And still the sick old woman looks into the corner, where the stone arm--part of a figure of some tomb, she says--is raised to strike her.
1	He has proved himself so different from me and has done so much to raise himself while I've been soldiering that I haven't brass enough in my composition to see him in this place and under this charge.
1	Now, my dear, about that crib at Chertsey; when is it to be done, Bill, eh?
1	I could be here in the day, and turn in the night.
1	I pretend to no claim upon you, Mr. C., but for the zealous and active discharge--not the languid and routine discharge, sir: that much credit I stipulate for--of my professional duty.
1	Receive at parting;’ here he gave him a southern embrace, and kissed him soundly on both cheeks; ‘the word of a gentleman!
1	Now, the unfortunate deceased was himself a lawyer and had a pretty tight hold of me.
1	You and I are very different creatures."
1	Mr. Winkle, catching sight of a lady’s face at the window of the sedan, turned hastily round, plied the knocker with all his might and main, and called frantically upon the chairman to take the chair away again.
1	"My dear Jarndyce," returned Mr. Skimpole, his genial face irradiated by the comicality of this idea, "what am I to do?
1	I am sure I shall be very happy to show London to you.
1	* A remarkable instance of the prophetic force of Mr. Jingle’s imagination; this dialogue occurring in the year 1827, and the Revolution in 1830.
1	As shadows of her fond imagination, she could give them equal place in her own bosom, and wrong them with no doubts.
1	I have started up so vividly impressed by it, that its fury has yet seemed raging in my quiet room, in the still night.
1	'You're very, very kind to me, ma'am,' said Oliver.
1	Or, if he was at any time inclined to relieve his mind by singing a comic song or dancing a hornpipe, and was obliged to do it to the Dead March in Saul, he might find himself put out in the execution of his lively intentions.’ ‘Poor Pa!’ thought Bella, as she hung upon his arm.
1	I remember dreaming night after night, of being with my mother as she used to be, or of going to a party at Mr. Peggotty’s, or of travelling outside the stage-coach, or of dining again with my unfortunate friend the waiter, and in all these circumstances making people scream and stare, by the unhappy disclosure that I had nothing on but my little night-shirt, and that placard.
1	You have never been a companion before, have you?’ Mrs. Nickleby, who had been eagerly watching her opportunity, came dexterously in, before Kate could reply.
1	One might fancy the season over, and most of the houses gone out of town for ever with their masters.
1	He had worn all his rust off long ago, but nothing would file his spiky head down.
1	‘My head’s a bit light, and my feet are a bit heavy,’ said old Betty, leaning her face drowsily on the breast of the woman who had spoken before.
1	The noise of the rain did not disturb him much; but it attracted his attention sufficiently to make him raise his head sometimes, as if he were rather remonstrating with the elements.
1	The little man seemed rather baffled by these several repulses, and a short consultation took place between him and the two plump gentlemen.
1	Don't believe that I'll leave you or yours in the lurch, Mat.
1	When she DID say that Mr. Tulkinghorn, being always denied to her by his employer (which I had no doubt at the time was a foreign mode of viewing a clerk), she would do herself the pleasure of continually calling at my place until she was let in here.
1	‘And she has a right to do as she likes, I hope, Quilp,’ said the old lady trembling, partly with anger and partly with a secret fear of her impish son-in-law.
1	"I intend to, Mat," replies the other.
1	"Why do you point away?"
1	After great consternation had been excited in the mind of Mrs. Cluppins, by an attempt on the part of Tommy to recount how he had been cross-examined regarding the cupboard then in action (which was fortunately nipped in the bud by his imbibing half a glass of the old crusted ‘the wrong way,’ and thereby endangering his life for some seconds), the party walked forth in quest of a Hampstead stage.
1	Springing a Mine Refreshed by sleep, Mr. Bucket rises betimes in the morning and prepares for a field-day.
1	‘Pray, my dear, allow me to conclude.
1	I am prepared to do the usual thing which I have done regularly and to keep this matter going.
1	After all, the question is still where?” “At extermination,” said madame.
1	I think about a great many things,’ replied Paul.
1	‘Quite, quite, dear brother; and I cannot tell you how happy I am that I have acted as you would have had me.’ ‘You don’t regret?’ ‘N--n--no,’ said Kate timidly, tracing some pattern upon the ground with her little foot.
1	They had nearly crossed the bridge, when a gentleman came coolly sauntering towards them, with a cigar in his mouth, his coat thrown back, and his hands behind him.
1	I suppose they have not done trying on yet.
1	“They ain't worth much, then.
1	The hopes I have been encouraged to form that you come from that lady, do not deceive me, I trust.’ ‘I left her within an hour.’ ‘At—!’ ‘At her father’s.’ Mr. Harthouse’s face lengthened in spite of his coolness, and his perplexity increased.
1	‘Well, well, Miss Harriet,’ he said, with a disappointed air, ‘this is not to the purpose.
1	Yielding to this fancy, and pleased to find that its indulgence beguiled the sick boy of many tedious hours, and never failed to afford him matter for thought and conversation afterwards, Nicholas made such spots the scenes of their daily rambles: driving him from place to place in a little pony-chair, and supporting him on his arm while they walked slowly among these old haunts, or lingered in the sunlight to take long parting looks of those which were most quiet and beautiful.
1	Their entrance, whether by premeditation or a simultaneous impulse, was the signal of revolt.
1	The turkey in the poultry-yard, always troubled with a class-grievance (probably Christmas), may be reminiscent of that summer morning wrongfully taken from him when he got into the lane among the felled trees, where there was a barn and barley.
1	He flung him in, bolted it, and turned the key.
1	Here it was that Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass were seated on the evening after the conclusion of the election, with several other temporary inmates of the house, smoking and drinking.
1	‘You are a happy fellow.
1	Not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was, Oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence, and was not quite certain whether he ought to laugh or cry.
1	Well?” “When you first caused me to be brought here, Miss Havisham, when I belonged to the village over yonder, that I wish I had never left, I suppose I did really come here, as any other chance boy might have come,--as a kind of servant, to gratify a want or a whim, and to be paid for it?” “Ay, Pip,” replied Miss Havisham, steadily nodding her head; “you did.” “And that Mr. Jaggers--” “Mr.
1	There they stand yet, without the motion of a hand.
1	His cold and distant nature had neither sought one, nor found one.
1	“No, I don’t,” says the man.
1	In a moment, Harriet was at the door; and the other, rising from her seat at her beck, came slowly, and with no conciliatory look, towards her.
1	I suppose," said Mr. Turveydrop, shutting his eyes and lifting up his shoulders with modest consciousness, "that I must show myself, as usual, about town."
1	A morsel of bread.’ ‘Do you see that?’ returned the man hoarsely, pointing to a kind of bundle on the ground.
1	Diwisions among such must come, and must be met as they come.
1	He don’t care for me, as I care for him!’ cried Mrs Brown, lifting up her skinny hands.
1	It’s Monday morning.’ ‘At once, if you please, Sir, by all means,’ returned Brass.
1	“I am going to tell you.
1	You have not acquired, under Mr. and Mrs. M’Choakumchild, anything like that amount of exact knowledge which I looked for.
1	Sit on our staircase and read.
1	Where was I brought from?’ Boldwig!
1	This is the separation that there is between us!
1	So, Stephen Blackpool’s tombstone, with her father’s record of his death, was almost of the Present, for she knew it was to be.
1	Have you no remembrance of what has been said between us?
1	Bishop then--jauntily stepping out a little with his well-shaped right leg, as though he said to Mr Merdle ‘don’t mind the apron; a mere form!’ put this case to his good friend: Whether it had occurred to his good friend, that Society might not unreasonably hope that one so blest in his undertakings, and whose example on his pedestal was so influential with it, would shed a little money in the direction of a mission or so to Africa?
1	It’s his trade to make the most of everything appertaining to the Cathedral, you know.’ ‘I may tell the Dean—I call expressly from the Dean—that you are all right again?’ The reply, with a slight smile, is: ‘Certainly; with my respects and thanks to the Dean.’ ‘I’m glad to hear that you expect young Drood.’ ‘I expect the dear fellow every moment.’ ‘Ah!
1	The view it commands of Cook's Court at one end (not to mention a squint into Cursitor Street) and of Coavinses' the sheriff's officer's backyard at the other she regards as a prospect of unequalled beauty.
1	Here’s a game!’ Happily, too, the greater part of the boys came back low-spirited, and were not so boisterous at my expense as I had expected.
1	Finding that his watch has stopped, he turns into the jeweller’s shop, to have it wound and set.
1	And now let me take the liberty of asking you a question.
1	That spice of romance and love of the marvellous, of which there was a pretty strong infusion in the nature of young Walter Gay, and which the guardianship of his Uncle, old Solomon Gills, had not very much weakened by the waters of stern practical experience, was the occasion of his attaching an uncommon and delightful interest to the adventure of Florence with Good Mrs Brown.
1	‘I was going on with the little I had left to say.
1	The fact is, that Jack was invited down to a marriage--which I think took place in Berkshire?’ ‘Shropshire,’ said the bold mild man, finding himself appealed to.
1	She’ll never wake till it’s all over, and there goes the clock again!
1	There’s so much trouble in illness, and so much expense, and she’s seen such a lot of its being objected to.’ ‘But she never can have thought,’ said Mrs Boffin, ‘that I would grudge the dear child anything?’ ‘No mum, but she might have thought (as a habit-like) of its standing in Johnny’s light, and might have tried to bring him through it unbeknownst.’ Sloppy knew his ground well.
1	Would you come up-stairs and wait for her?’ ‘Thank you.’ Turning himself as slowly as he turned in his mind whatever he heard or said, he led the way up the narrow stairs.
1	‘You’re very good, Sir,’ returned Brass, ‘I am sure.
1	There could not well be more ink splashed about it, if it had been roofless from its first construction, and the skies had rained, snowed, hailed, and blown ink through the varying seasons of the year.
1	I congratulate you with all my heart, my dear.’ The good soft little fellow, drying his eyes, here, Bella put her arms round his neck and tenderly kissed him on the high road, passionately telling him he was the best of fathers and the best of friends, and that on her wedding-morning she would go down on her knees to him and beg his pardon for having ever teased him or seemed insensible to the worth of such a patient, sympathetic, genial, fresh young heart.
1	I only wish I wos, myself.
1	"I take it as a compliment."
1	‘He is a vagabond on his own statement,--is he not, Mr. Jinks?’ ‘Certainly, Sir.’ ‘Then I’ll commit him--I’ll commit him as such,’ said Mr. Nupkins.
1	Still I don’t say that I’m going to keep ‘em always there, for the sake of the beauty of the landscape.
1	The last man, whoever he is--and he may be a cobbler or some low vulgar dog for aught we know--will have a longer pedigree than the greatest nobleman now alive; and I contend that this is not fair.
1	He was the stateliest man in the company.
1	Her friendly indignation had an exemplary effect upon her husband, who shook his head at the trooper several times as a silent recommendation to him to yield.
1	‘What friend o’ yourn is dead?’ asks Durdles.
1	He fills his pipe, lights it, and marches up and down smoking, as his custom is, while Phil, raising a powerful odour of hot rolls and coffee, prepares breakfast.
1	‘Besides which,’ continued Mr. Gregsbury, ‘I should expect him, now and then, to go through a few figures in the printed tables, and to pick out a few results, so that I might come out pretty well on timber duty questions, and finance questions, and so on; and I should like him to get up a few little arguments about the disastrous effects of a return to cash payments and a metallic currency, with a touch now and then about the exportation of bullion, and the Emperor of Russia, and bank notes, and all that kind of thing, which it’s only necessary to talk fluently about, because nobody understands it.
1	Where did they go first, Rob?’ The wretched Grinder made a gasp, and a pause.
1	‘I am sure I don’t know what to do,’ said Mr Boffin.
1	It was Mr. Murdstone’s hand, and he kept it on my arm as he said: ‘What’s this?
1	His face appeared to me to be quite destitute of colour, and now that I saw him without his seeing me, I fully saw, for the first time, how worn away he was.
1	There being plenty of gravy to-day, Joe spooned into my plate, at this point, about half a pint.
1	So strong was the impression, that I stood under the beam shuddering from head to foot before I knew it was a fancy,--though to be sure I was there in an instant.
1	Some hopeful notion of seeing her, busily engaged in her daily duties, before she saw me, had been in my mind and was defeated.
1	‘I am glad to hear you admit so much, sir,’ retorted Mr. Honeythunder, in his most offensive manner; ‘and I candidly tell you that I didn’t expect it.’  Here he lowered heavily at Mr. Crisparkle again.
1	What’s she staring at?’ he added, in allusion to the daughter, whose eyes were fixed upon the face that now again looked out behind.
1	Finding him so very friendly and companionable, it was then that I asked for the pen and ink and paper, to write to Peggotty.
1	The little expedition down the river was delightful, and the little room overlooking the river into which they were shown for dinner was delightful.
1	‘Where’s the reason for it?
1	“Two or three months at most.” Herbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement, and said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must go away at the end of the week.
1	Dead, is he?” “Dead as mutton,” returned the other, “and can't be too dead.
1	It being quite dark, the Captain consented: peeping carefully out first, as he had been wont to do in his time of hiding from Mrs MacStinger; and arming himself with his large stick, in case of an appeal to arms being rendered necessary by any unforeseen circumstance.
1	There is a tie of many suffering years between us two, and it is the only tie I ever had on earth that Chancery has not broken."
1	Put the case that a woman, under such circumstances as you have mentioned, held her child concealed, and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal adviser, on his representing to her that he must know, with an eye to the latitude of his defence, how the fact stood about that child.
1	He so washes, and rubs, and scrubs, and smells, and washes, that he has not long restored himself with a glass of brandy and stood silently before the fire when Saint Paul's bell strikes twelve and all those other bells strike twelve from their towers of various heights in the dark air, and in their many tones.
1	Knitted, in her own stitches and her own symbols, it will always be as plain to her as the sun.
1	Get up, get up!’ Her mother rose, and cried, and wrung her hands, and stood at a little distance gazing on her.
1	That room was their boat; that audience were the maidens; and he (Mr. Anthony Humm), however unworthily, was ‘first oars’ (unbounded applause).
1	‘And ye steer with a rudder, don’t ye?
1	He had divested himself of his brown paper parcel, but had made no alteration in his attire, and was, if possible, more loquacious than ever.
1	‘We shall be happy,’ said Miss Clarissa, ‘to see Mr. Copperfield to dinner, every Sunday, if it should suit his convenience.
1	“Where are you going to, at Richmond?” I asked Estella.
1	Never done nothink to get myself into no trouble, 'sept in not moving on and the inkwhich.
1	But never mind him now.
1	Therefore, the next time little Jacob woke, Kit set himself to attract his wandering attention, and this not being a very difficult task (one sneeze effected it), he signed to him to rouse his mother.
1	When we stopped for supper I couldn’t muster courage to take any, though I should have liked it very much, but sat by the fire and said I didn’t want anything.
1	It wouldn't have loosened the knot, or kept the drop up, a minute longer.
1	When we came to ‘Here’s a hand, my trusty frere’, we all joined hands round the table; and when we declared we would ‘take a right gude Willie Waught’, and hadn’t the least idea what it meant, we were really affected.
1	You see the rock that lies in his course.
1	Therefore Walter gave two knocks.
1	The number and constant successions of these islands, all green and richly wooded; their fluctuating sizes, some so large that for half an hour together one among them will appear as the opposite bank of the river, and some so small that they are mere dimples on its broad bosom; their infinite variety of shapes; and the numberless combinations of beautiful forms which the trees growing on them present: all form a picture fraught with uncommon interest and pleasure.
1	There’s a providence in everything; everything works for the best; I have been tried today but on the whole I do not regret it.’ In which Christian spirit, Mrs Chick dried her eyes and smoothed her lap, and sat as became a person calm under a great wrong.
1	Whom shall we have?’ Our dear Merdle would then receive his instructions; and would sit heavily among the company at table and wander lumpishly about his drawing-rooms afterwards, only remarkable for appearing to have nothing to do with the entertainment beyond being in its way.
1	If you were a man of business, sergeant, you would not need to be informed that there are confidential reasons, very harmless in themselves, for many such wants in the profession to which I belong.
1	‘I can’t help myself!’ cried Mr Boffin, flouncing on the settle in a forlorn manner, with his hands deep in his pockets, as if his pockets had sunk.
1	Slightly observant of the smoky lights; of the people, pipe in mouth, playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes; of the one bare-breasted, bare-armed, soot-begrimed workman reading a journal aloud, and of the others listening to him; of the weapons worn, or laid aside to be resumed; of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep, who in the popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked, in that attitude, like slumbering bears or dogs; the two outlandish customers approached the counter, and showed what they wanted.
1	‘To hang himself!’ cried Mr. Lillyvick again.
1	I should not be at all surprised if he called to-day.
1	He was brushed and washed at the usual hour, and set off with his son to pursue his ostensible calling.
1	‘Here’s somebody comin’ at last, ma’am,’ said the short chairman.
1	"Then grant me this one great favour.
1	‘Here’s dinner been ready, half an hour, and no Walter!’ Turning round upon his stool behind the counter, Mr Gills looked out among the instruments in the window, to see if his nephew might be crossing the road.
1	There’s evidence,’ said my mother, sobbing; ‘ask Peggotty if I didn’t do very well when I wasn’t interfered with!’ ‘Edward,’ said Miss Murdstone, ‘let there be an end of this.
1	"Don't say that, don't say that.
1	‘Think well of what you do.’ ‘Yes, you had better think well,’ said Mr Boffin.
1	"And was christened so, my dear," said Mr. Bucket.
1	A dense justice in a corner is beguiled into a wink.
1	‘Then give me your hand,’ retorted Quilp.
1	‘When we worked like the neighbours, we suited one another.
1	Thinking of this, she did not turn away with a delicate indignation--too many of her own compassionate and tender sex too often do--but pitied her.
1	So Rosa went further in, and, when the clocks were striking ten, stood on P. J. T.’s doorsteps, wondering what P. J. T. had done with his street-door.
1	After each sitting was over, and the patron had departed, Mr Wegg invariably saw Mr Venus home.
1	A Light Shines on My Way      LXIII.
1	Nothing but a gentleman, Fagin!'
1	Mr. Sowerberry was much tickled at this: as of course he ought to be; and laughed a long time without cessation.
1	I think nothing can be plainer than that?’ ‘Shall I marry him?’ repeated Louisa, with great deliberation.
1	Mr Dorrit also had been utterly discomfited, and quite unable to assert himself in any way.
1	‘Barnet,’ to Master Skettles, who was revenging himself for the studies to come, on the plum-cake, ‘this is a young gentleman you ought to know.
1	‘Having your likeness taken, sir,’ replied the stout turnkey.
1	I can't talk about business till I've eat and drank; so produce the sustainance, and let's have a quiet fill-out for the first time these three days!'
1	Newman waited for the last stroke, and then knocked.
1	But as my aunt had swathed me up, I made no complaint of being inconvenienced.
1	All I have in the world is in this room, except the cottage; and that I have left Janet to let.
1	"Repeal it, my dear sir?
1	It was no nominal meal that we were going to make, but a vigorous reality.
1	‘I know the stick to be his, and he carried it last night.
1	The low arched door then opened, and the face came out.
1	I have not the power."
1	Two or three times, the matter in hand became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on him to get up, and steep his towels anew.
1	‘To vich sum, he has added for the house and bisness--’ ‘Lease, good-vill, stock, and fixters,’ interposed Mr. Weller.
1	I knew I recollected the face.’ It was, indeed, Tom, the ugly clerk.
1	‘Come on!’ said the cab-driver, sparring away like clockwork.
1	He quite laughed when I asked him the question, and said there was no fear; no man in his senses, or out of them, would put off in such a gale of wind, least of all Ham Peggotty, who had been born to seafaring.
1	‘The gentleman,’ said the stranger, ‘that advertised in the Times newspaper?’ ‘--Morning Post, Chronicle, Herald, and Advertiser, regarding the Academy called Dotheboys Hall at the delightful village of Dotheboys, near Greta Bridge in Yorkshire,’ added Mr. Squeers.
1	My father, Pip, he were given to drink, and when he were overtook with drink, he hammered away at my mother, most onmerciful.
1	As many restless spirits, who have hunted fortune, fame, or pleasure through the world, retire in their decline to where they first drew breath, vainly seeking to be children once again before they die, so we, less fortunate than they in early life, but happier in its closing scenes, will set up our rest again among our boyish haunts, and going home with no hope realised, that had its growth in manhood--carrying back nothing that we brought away, but our old yearnings to each other--saving no fragment from the wreck of life, but that which first endeared it--may be, indeed, but children as at first.
1	It is strange to know no more about either, and particularly you, than I was able to tell last night.
1	The Secretary would have attended her, but Mrs Wilfer advancing and saying with dignity, ‘Pardon me!
1	asked Noah, anxiously regarding him.
1	The influence pervaded the spirit in which they returned to the previous question.
1	Go on, Sammy.’ ‘“Lovely creetur,”’ repeated Sam.
1	The touch had its instantaneous effect.
1	Stand by!’ ‘But I couldn’t rest,’ said Florence, ‘without coming to ask you what you think about dear Walter--who is my brother now--and whether there is anything to fear, and whether you will not go and console his poor Uncle every day, until we have some intelligence of him?’ At these words Captain Cuttle, as by an involuntary gesture, clapped his hand to his head, on which the hard glazed hat was not, and looked discomfited.
1	‘For the parents of a boy named Dorker, who unfortunately--’ ‘--unfortunately died at Dotheboys Hall,’ said Ralph, finishing the sentence.
1	When these things were all forgotten, he hoped that Frank and he might still be warm friends, and that no word or thought of his humble home, or of her who was well contented to remain there and share his quiet fortunes, would ever again disturb the harmony between them.
1	"In all other respects, my dear mother, I'll be as tractable and obedient as you can wish; on this one alone, I stand out.
1	This testimony, so long as I live, and so long as my descendants have any legal right in my books, I shall cause to be republished, as an appendix to every copy of those two books of mine in which I have referred to America.
1	As it was, however, he kept his own secret; and went home late from the Instrument-maker’s house, wearing the glazed hat so much on one side, and carrying such a beaming expression in his eyes, that Mrs MacStinger (who might have been brought up at Doctor Blimber’s, she was such a Roman matron) fortified herself, at the first glimpse of him, behind the open street door, and refused to come out to the contemplation of her blessed infants, until he was securely lodged in his own room.
1	While one detachment rushed to the door and locked it, and another mounted on the desks and forms, the stoutest (and consequently the newest) boy seized the cane, and confronting Mrs. Squeers with a stern countenance, snatched off her cap and beaver bonnet, put them on his own head, armed himself with the wooden spoon, and bade her, on pain of death, go down upon her knees and take a dose directly.
1	Looks as if she knew all about it, don't she?
1	‘Forgive me; I could not help saying that.
1	‘Certainly not,’ chimed in Mrs. Sanders, who, from certain wistful glances at the little tin saucepan, seemed to be engaged in a mental calculation of the probable extent of the pettitoes, in the event of Sam’s being asked to stop to supper.
1	‘You know whether the cap fits you, Loo,’ returned her brother sulkily.
1	‘Please let me hold the pens,’ said Dora.
1	So go on my buck,’ said Mr Swiveller, taking his leave of the ceiling with a significant nod, ‘and let us see which of us will be tired first!’ Dismissing the subject of his downfall with these reflections, which were no doubt very profound, and are indeed not altogether unknown in certain systems of moral philosophy, Mr Swiveller shook off his despondency and assumed the cheerful ease of an irresponsible clerk.
1	One beautiful evening, when the first shades of twilight were beginning to settle upon the earth, Oliver sat at this window, intent upon his books.
1	We will never go away from here?’ The child shook her head and smiled.

1	For, though this celebration of to-day is all a mockery, he is my husband, and we must live.--Do you think it like?’ Twemlow, in a stunned condition, feigns to compare the portrait in his hand with the original looking towards him from his Mephistophelean corner.
1	Therefore I have particularly begged of Woodcourt, and I now particularly beg of you, my dear, not to move this subject with Rick.
1	‘Halloa!’ cried a voice inside.
1	Sir Mulberry merely paused in the act of drinking, and bade him either name his business or leave the table.
1	I shall never get its name now.
1	How do you do, Sir?
1	Two friends of the young man, whom we had attracted to the doorway and who stood there with their hands in their pockets, echoed the laugh noisily.
1	With an uneasy flush upon his face, and hesitation in his manner, he then said in a still lower tone than he had adopted yet: ‘Mrs Gowan, I scarcely know how to acquit myself of what I feel to be a duty, and yet I must ask you for your kind consideration in attempting to discharge it.
1	Brewer says, ‘Oh dear!’ Boots says, ‘Oh dear!’ Buffer says, ‘Oh dear!’ All, in a rumbling tone of protest.
1	Whether of questionable childishness or not in any other matters, Mr. Skimpole had a child's enjoyment of change and bright weather.
1	I dare say you do, Edward?’ ‘_I_ remember ‘em well enough,’ said the latter.
1	"In fact, I have just turned into my teens," says Mr. Jobling.
1	This guileless youth, descrying the position of affairs, which even his innocence could not mistake, limited his waiting to languishing admiringly against the sideboard when Bella didn’t want anything, and swooping at her when she did.
1	‘I would rather go alone, thank you.
1	So Mr. Krook addresses a crazy little woman who is his female lodger, who appears and vanishes in a breath, who soon returns accompanied by a testy medical man brought from his dinner, with a broad, snuffy upper lip and a broad Scotch tongue.
1	Monsieur, the uncle, commands the nephew to marry.
1	For more than a week she lay there, little altered outwardly, with her old handsome resolute frown that I so well knew carved upon her face.
1	Only don’t crow.’ ‘I crow!’ exclaimed Lammle, shrugging his shoulders.
1	Looking towards the setting sun, there lay, stretched out before my view, a vast expanse of level ground; unbroken, save by one thin line of trees, which scarcely amounted to a scratch upon the great blank; until it met the glowing sky, wherein it seemed to dip: mingling with its rich colours, and mellowing in its distant blue.
1	Adams, consult your own safety, and don’t remain here; the living before the dead; goodbye!’ With these words, he seized Sir Mulberry by the arm, and hurried him away.
1	‘If there were any good,’ he said, ‘I could do on this earth, I would do it, Walter, for you.
1	‘Pounds for two, I think, Mr. Squeers,’ said Mr. Snawley, solemnly.
1	Finding at last, however, that, although I had been all this time a very porcupine or hedgehog, bristling all over with determination, I had effected nothing, it began to occur to me that perhaps Dora’s mind was already formed.
1	‘You keep with us,’ said Mr Meagles, in a threatening kind of Way, ‘and I’ll introduce you presently.
1	It is possible that the gentleman may, on similar grounds, object to you.’ ‘I hope so,’ returned Arthur.
1	‘I begin to think,’ observed Lightwood, ‘that I never shall see him.’ ‘These things happen so oddly sometimes,’ said Bella with a steady countenance, ‘that there seems a kind of fatality in them.
1	A buzz then went round among the young gentlemen, of ‘Dombey’s going!’ ‘Little Dombey’s going!’ and there was a general move after Paul and Florence down the staircase and into the hall, in which the whole Blimber family were included.
1	There are Podsnap the Great, and Mrs Podsnap.
1	Her husband had no relations, and she was rich.
1	Light them, you!” The turnkey fired the little pile, which blazed high and hot.
1	You'll go down?” “Yes,” said I, casting my eyes over the note, which was exactly in those terms.
1	When old Mr Gilbert Clennam proposed his orphan nephew to my father for my husband, my father impressed upon me that his bringing-up had been, like mine, one of severe restraint.
1	It's hard enough to kill him, but it's wery hard to spile him, sir.” “Not at all,” retained the ancient clerk.
1	She made him our guardian, and he was a miserly wretch who grudged us food to eat, and clothes to wear.
1	‘Yes,’ said Mr. Jackson, biting his lip.
1	Scarcely venturing to breathe, and listening while he thinks, he conjures up a figure with his back towards him, and imagines it moving about in this next cell.
1	Mrs General conceded that high privilege, and here she was.
1	We have not half enough as it is.
1	We have had quite enough of the subject.’ Thus expressing himself, Mr. Pickwick led the conversation to different topics, and Mr. Winkle gradually appeared more at ease, though still very far from being completely so.
1	But this was the origin of a series of Sunday excursions that these two curious companions made together.
1	She is the same bright vision to me, at present, that she was before I made Walters’s acquaintance.
1	At last, the Aged read himself into a light slumber.
1	And at last he emerged from the room, bottle in hand, and, remarking that he was very sorry to say he had been making a fool of himself, begged to propose the health and happiness of Mr. and Mrs. Winkle, whose felicity, so far from envying, he would be the first to congratulate them upon.
1	Where’s your risk?’ ‘Why, you know,’ said Squeers, fidgeting in his chair, ‘if you come to that, I might say where’s yours?’ ‘You might say where’s mine!’ returned Ralph; ‘you may say where’s mine.
1	"So we talked a good deal about it, and so I said to Prince, 'Prince, as Miss Summerson--'" "I hope you didn't say 'Miss Summerson'?"
1	"That was when you never ought to have asked for the security, George, and when you never ought to have got it, all things considered.
1	If ever there were love in the world, I love her.
1	My deary, show me a better!
1	‘But it’s worth the pain of hearing, only to know that Mrs. Nickleby recovered it, isn’t it, Pluck?’ cried Mr. Pyke.
1	We had, on our way out, to cross a paved hall, with glass sides and roof, over which a vine was trained.
1	All the evening his eyes wandered to my aunt’s face, with an expression of the most dismal apprehension, as if he saw her growing thin on the spot.
1	You know that Sikes is dead; that Monks has confessed; that there is no hope of any further gain.
1	At length, a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed; and uttering it, the boy awoke.
1	It will be like coming to the old Bleak House again."
1	Dear Walter, I am very sorry too.’ ‘Goodness knows,’ exclaimed Miss Nipper, ‘there’s a many we could spare instead, if numbers is a object, Mrs Pipchin as a overseer would come cheap at her weight in gold, and if a knowledge of black slavery should be required, them Blimbers is the very people for the sitiwation.’ With that Miss Nipper untied her bonnet strings, and after looking vacantly for some moments into a little black teapot that was set forth with the usual homely service on the table, shook her head and a tin canister, and began unasked to make the tea.
1	Illimitable faith in, and immeasurable admiration of, the Commander of the Cautious Clara, succeeded, and threw the Captain into a wondering trance.
1	And what more could I possibly do, if I did believe it!’ ‘You are a singular politician,’ said Louisa.
1	I have no false pride.
1	I should think her like me.
1	But that didn’t last long; for Doctor Blimber, happening to change the position of his tight plump legs, as if he were going to get up, Toots swiftly vanished, and appeared no more.
1	All this was done with the greatest dispatch and without the waste of a moment; yet nobody was at all hurried.
1	It is even difficult for me to believe that there was a gap of full two months between my return to Salem House and the arrival of that birthday.
1	Every one must.’ ‘I hope so,’ said the cherub.
1	'” “The man says?” I observed, as Joe waited for me to speak.
1	I don’t wonder, I’m sure, at your being a little flurried by having a scene with this fellow, but it’s all over, my dear, and you’re righted, and it’s--and it’s ALL right!’ Which Mr Boffin repeated with a highly satisfied air of completeness and finality.
1	If they’re hard upon you, brother, as mayhap they are, give ‘em a wide berth, sheer off, and part company cheerily!’ ‘Captain Gills,’ returned Mr Toots, ‘I hardly know how it is, but after what you told me when I came here, for the first time, I--I feel that I’d rather think about Miss Dombey in your society than talk about her in almost anybody else’s.
1	Still Miss Tox said, think of the situation!
1	‘This,’ said Mrs Wilfer, presenting a cheek to be kissed, as sympathetic and responsive as the back of the bowl of a spoon, ‘is quite an honour!
1	‘And vere is George?’ inquired the old gentleman.
1	Mr. Grewgious smoothed his head and face, and stood looking at the fire.
1	‘I am pretty much as usual, sir,’ replied Miss Wren.
1	He came outside just now, and told me how that the uncle of a certain young lady who had been spirited away and married by a certain captain, lived in these parts; and how this uncle was so valiant and ferocious that he shouldn’t wonder if he were to follow the said captain to England, ‘and shoot him down in the street wherever he found him;’ in the feasibility of which strong measure I, being for the moment rather prone to contradiction, from feeling half asleep and very tired, declined to acquiesce: assuring him that if the uncle did resort to it, or gratified any other little whim of the like nature, he would find himself one morning prematurely throttled at the Old Bailey: and that he would do well to make his will before he went, as he would certainly want it before he had been in Britain very long.
1	The circumstance of having another listener to the wonders unfolded by Wegg, or, as it were, another calculator to cast up the guineas found in teapots, chimneys, racks and mangers, and other such banks of deposit, seemed greatly to heighten Mr Boffin’s enjoyment; while Silas Wegg, for his part, though of a jealous temperament which might under ordinary circumstances have resented the anatomist’s getting into favour, was so very anxious to keep his eye on that gentleman--lest, being too much left to himself, he should be tempted to play any tricks with the precious document in his keeping--that he never lost an opportunity of commending him to Mr Boffin’s notice as a third party whose company was much to be desired.
1	‘--are not to be combated by any one, and I address myself to no such hopeless task.
1	"It does her credit, Mat!"
1	The trees and the night are all that are here.” The servant who spoke, had thrown the blinds wide, had looked out into the vacant darkness, and stood with that blank behind him, looking round for instructions.
1	She raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl; then, bending them on the ground, she tossed her head with affected carelessness as she said: 'It's a hard matter to get to see you, lady.
1	I sit down by the fire, thinking with a blind remorse of all those secret feelings I have nourished since my marriage.
1	‘I think, father, I require a little time.’ ‘Papa is a preferable mode of address,’ observed Mrs General.
1	Why me?’ ‘Upon my honour, I think Mr Merdle reposes greater confidence in you than in any one.’ ‘On the contrary, he tells me absolutely nothing, even professionally.
1	Here’s the cottage, taking one time with another, will produce say seventy pounds a year.
1	So, Oliver kept very still; partly because he was anxious to obey the kind old lady in all things; and partly, to tell the truth, because he was completely exhausted with what he had already said.
1	Faring on and hiding, hiding and faring on, the poor harmless creature, as though she were a Murderess and the whole country were up after her, wore out the day, and gained the night.
1	The Courier, with agitation in his voice, announced ‘Miss Mairdale!’ Mr Dorrit’s overwrought heart bounded as he leaped up.
1	He wore a black velvet waistcoat, with thunder-and-lightning buttons; and a blue striped shirt, with a white false collar.
1	When it was impossible to sustain the concluding note any longer, the skipper bellowed forth a terrific ‘ahoy!’ intended in part as a friendly greeting, and in part to show that he was not at all breathed.
1	These, and other practical witticisms, coupled with the unaccountable absence of Mr. Tupman (who had suddenly disappeared, and was nowhere to be found), rendered their situation upon the whole rather more uncomfortable than pleasing or desirable.
1	Is she married?” “Yes.” It was a needless question, for a new desolation in the desolate house had told me so.
1	"For to-day, I have, my friend.
1	Beyond this; it might have restored her wit to my lady your mother--might, under the pressing little suspicion your wisdom has recognised, have persuaded her at last to announce, covertly, in the journals, that the difficulties of a certain contract would be removed by the appearance of a certain important party to it.
1	They like me for his sake, as I do everything I do in life for his sake.
1	The wall must be crumbled, the stone decayed, To pleasure his dainty whim; And the mouldering dust that years have made, Is a merry meal for him.
1	‘I ha’n’t got a glass,’ said Mary.
1	The members of the deputation looked fiercely at each other, and afterwards at the member.
1	And he is making hay of the grass which is flesh, for his three daughters.
1	‘Then you relieve my mind of a great dread, and a heavy weight,’ said Jasper; ‘I will do it.’ Mr. Crisparkle, delighted by the swiftness and completeness of his success, acknowledged it in the handsomest terms.
1	I began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting, when the clerk shoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw used, and tossing his fur cap out after him, left me alone.
1	Why, he would answer, “Away with it!” That’s what he would answer, gentlemen.
1	‘May I ask where it happened, Mr Twemlow?
1	‘Indeed, you have avoided me, Mr Carker,’ said Walter, with the tears rising to his eyes; so true was his compassion.
1	In Fashion It is but a glimpse of the world of fashion that we want on this same miry afternoon.
1	‘Charley Hexam, I am going home.
1	‘Joe, Joe!’ said the stout gentleman, when the citadel was taken, and the besiegers and besieged sat down to dinner.
1	‘Send my fellow here.’ ‘Gone to bed, sir.’ ‘Tell him to get up, and pack up.’ He wrote two more notes.
1	"You know what you have got to do.
1	‘You are a very old friend of my nephew’s, Mr. Micawber,’ said my aunt.
1	I thank you for the question.
1	Say no more to-night.’ ‘I feel the urgency of this,’ said Mr Carker, ‘because it is impossible to say what unforeseen consequences might arise, or how soon, from your being unacquainted with his state of mind.
1	‘Oh, always Wade.’ After looking at the philanthropic visage and the long silky white hair for a few seconds, during which Mr Casby twirled his thumbs, and smiled at the fire as if he were benevolently wishing it to burn him that he might forgive it, Arthur began: ‘I beg your pardon, Mr Casby--’ ‘Not so, not so,’ said the Patriarch, ‘not so.’ ‘--But, Miss Wade had an attendant with her--a young woman brought up by friends of mine, over whom her influence is not considered very salutary, and to whom I should be glad to have the opportunity of giving the assurance that she has not yet forfeited the interest of those protectors.’ ‘Really, really?’ returned the Patriarch.
1	As to the washerwoman pawning the clothes, and coming in a state of penitent intoxication to apologize, I suppose that might have happened several times to anybody.
1	He means plain Joe, Sir--Joey B.--Josh.
1	More striking still was some indefinable resemblance, in the face of Ralph, to both.
1	‘I am, sir,’ replied Mr. Pickwick.
1	In short, we heard of a great many missions of various sorts among this set of people, but nothing respecting them was half so clear to us as that it was Mr. Quale's mission to be in ecstasies with everybody else's mission and that it was the most popular mission of all.
1	In the same room, there is a very characteristic and life-like portrait by Mr. Sully, a distinguished American artist.
1	No child could have surpassed Captain Cuttle in inexperience of everything but wind and weather; in simplicity, credulity, and generous trustfulness.
1	My young friend, Trundle, I believe to be a very excellent and manly fellow; and his wife I know to be a very amiable and lovely girl, well qualified to transfer to another sphere of action the happiness which for twenty years she has diffused around her, in her father’s house.
1	Why, applause from the house when you first come on.
1	I waited for a few moments, until he could give me his undivided attention; and then proceeded to explain the precaution, that, it had occurred to me last night, it would be wise to take.
1	Ride on over all obstacles, and win the race!’ ‘And win what race?’ said I.
1	Don’t be too proud to come and see us, when you have made your fortune.’ ‘All right!’ said Tip, and went.
1	Yet that would be energy.’ ‘Precisely my view of the case, Eugene.
1	'You may depend upon me, young man,' answered Mr. Bumble, bowing himself gradually towards the ladder, with excessive politeness.
1	‘For the “How” I come to you.
1	So she was--so she was.’ ‘And our friend was soothing her anguish,’ said Mr. Winkle, rather maliciously.
1	‘Slurk, sir,’ repeated the gentleman haughtily.
1	It is good, until recalled.
1	‘Father, you have trained me from my cradle?’ ‘Yes, Louisa.’ ‘I curse the hour in which I was born to such a destiny.’ He looked at her in doubt and dread, vacantly repeating: ‘Curse the hour?
1	The coachman gave a tremendous double knock at the door, which was opened long before he had done, as quickly as if there had been a man behind it, with his hand tied to the latch.
1	That he himself had several times ‘reckoned up’ Gaffer, but had never been able to bring him to a satisfactory criminal total.
1	It happens without any aid of mine, pretty often.’ John Baptist having smoked his cigarette down to his fingers’ ends, Monsieur Rigaud had the magnanimity to throw him another.
1	His luck’s got fouled under the keels of the barges.
1	It was, to be a gentle, useful, quiet little fellow, always striving to secure the love and attachment of the rest; and though he was yet often to be seen at his old post on the stairs, or watching the waves and clouds from his solitary window, he was oftener found, too, among the other boys, modestly rendering them some little voluntary service.
1	I could only suggest that I should go down to Deal, where Richard was then stationed, and see him, and try if it were possible to avert the worst.
1	He may not deserve it, for we know no certain ill of him.
1	He is of what is called the old school--a phrase generally meaning any school that seems never to have been young--and wears knee-breeches tied with ribbons, and gaiters or stockings.
1	"I saw my ward oftener than she saw me," he added, cheerily making light of it, "and I always knew she was beloved, useful, and happy.
1	While the visit at the Doctor’s was still in progress, I observed that the postman brought two or three letters every morning for Uriah Heep, who remained at Highgate until the rest went back, it being a leisure time; and that these were always directed in a business-like manner by Mr. Micawber, who now assumed a round legal hand.
1	We found that a steamer for Hamburg was likely to suit our purpose best, and we directed our thoughts chiefly to that vessel.
1	He walked on, and she did not appear to hear his steps until he was close upon her.
1	‘A raw, slight stripling,’ continued Ralph, ‘against a man whose very weight might crush him; to say nothing of his skill in--I am right, I think,’ said Ralph, raising his eyes, ‘you WERE a patron of the ring once, were you not?’ The sick man made an impatient gesture, which Ralph chose to consider as one of acquiescence.
1	When I could cry no more, I began to think; and then the oppression on my breast was heaviest, and my grief a dull pain that there was no ease for.
1	‘I am sure I am glad to hear it, but I don’t know how.’ ‘Pitching somebody into a mud-cart,’ said Miss Wren.
1	Then do the swains appear with tea, with lemonade, with sandwiches, with homage.
1	Then they repaired to the usual family room, to receive Miss Bella with a becoming show of indifference.
1	Mr Plornish could not conceal his exultation in her accomplishments as a linguist.
1	None of them ever pay.
1	Describes, far more fully than the Court Newsman ever did, a Bachelor’s Party, given by Mr. Bob Sawyer at his Lodgings in the Borough 33.
1	‘Yes, yes, I understand that now,’ said Quilp; ‘but I was going to say, I was so deceived by that, your miserly way, the reputation you had among those who knew you of being rich, and your repeated assurances that you would make of my advances treble and quadruple the interest you paid me, that I’d have advanced you, even now, what you want, on your simple note of hand, if I hadn’t unexpectedly become acquainted with your secret way of life.’ ‘Who is it,’ retorted the old man desperately, ‘that, notwithstanding all my caution, told you?
1	‘You have thrown yourself away,’ said Eugene, shaking his head.
1	The mother looked young, and the daughter looked old; the mother's complexion was pink, and the daughter's was yellow; the mother set up for frivolity, and the daughter for theology.
1	He was obliged to take some mouldering fixtures that were on the place, and, among the rest, was a great lumbering wooden press for papers, with large glass doors, and a green curtain inside; a pretty useless thing for him, for he had no papers to put in it; and as to his clothes, he carried them about with him, and that wasn’t very hard work, either.
1	The clearance was effected at last; the Stryver arrears were handsomely fetched up; everything was got rid of until November should come with its fogs atmospheric, and fogs legal, and bring grist to the mill again.
1	But,’ said the Captain, as a quotation, ‘Though lost to sight, to memory dear, and England, Home, and Beauty!’ ‘Do you live here?’ asked Florence.
1	‘I am unhappily a widower,’ said I.
1	‘You know this gentleman, I believe?’ I made my gentleman a distant bow, and Peggotty barely recognized him.
1	Brooding over the fire, with his dried little head in his dried little hands, and his dried little elbows on his dried little knees, Twemlow is melancholy.
1	'If he hasn't peached, and is committed, there's no fear till he comes out again,' said Mr. Sikes, 'and then he must be taken care on.
1	I said, ‘Near London,’ which was all I knew.
1	The old house had been long ago pulled down, and a fine broad road was in its place.
1	Monks, still bearing that assumed name, retired with his portion to a distant part of the New World; where, having quickly squandered it, he once more fell into his old courses, and, after undergoing a long confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery, at length sunk under an attack of his old disorder, and died in prison.
1	“Really, is bad enough,” returned Miss Pross, “but better.
1	I make a respectable income by it.
1	‘But I don’t know your’n.’ ‘That’s quite another thing,’ said Bradley.
1	TIME went on in Coketown like its own machinery: so much material wrought up, so much fuel consumed, so many powers worn out, so much money made.
1	‘Never mind.’ There must be something very comprehensive in this phrase of ‘Never mind,’ for we do not recollect to have ever witnessed a quarrel in the street, at a theatre, public room, or elsewhere, in which it has not been the standard reply to all belligerent inquiries.
1	I was not aware that anything was wrong.
1	Rich colours, excellently blended, meet the eye at every turn; in the furniture--its proportions admirably devised to suit the shapes and sizes of the small rooms; on the walls; upon the floors; tingeing and subduing the light that comes in through the odd glass doors and windows here and there.
1	Suddenly the door was unlocked on the inside, and flung violently open.
1	A dinner party takes place at five; and at an evening party, they seldom sup later than eleven; so that it goes hard but one gets home, even from a rout, by midnight.
1	And as to being common, I don't make it out at all clear.
1	‘Are you better now, mother?’ asked one of the women.
1	Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard, and stolen it, while they were merry with the goose--a supposition at which the two young Cratchits became livid!
1	Nor did I ever regard him as having anything ludicrous about him--or anything but what was serious, honest, and good--in his tutor communication with me.
1	Supported only by a sense that she was bent on conquering in her life-long fight, she went on.
1	But Mr Toots shook his head, and wouldn’t hear of that being possible.
1	Hows’ever, none on ‘em answered; so they gave out that he’d run away, and she kep’ on the bis’ness.
1	My business habits had one other bright feature, which I called “leaving a Margin.” For example; supposing Herbert's debts to be one hundred and sixty-four pounds four-and-twopence, I would say, “Leave a margin, and put them down at two hundred.” Or, supposing my own to be four times as much, I would leave a margin, and put them down at seven hundred.
1	He had never conceived an aversion to her: it had not been worth his while or in his humour.
1	Well, Louisa, that’s worth a kiss, isn’t it?’ ‘You can take one, Mr. Bounderby,’ returned Louisa, when she had coldly paused, and slowly walked across the room, and ungraciously raised her cheek towards him, with her face turned away.
1	He’s as like his Papa as he can be.
1	There was no divided responsibility now; the whole burden of their two lives had fallen upon her, and henceforth she must think and act for both.
1	Whenever he looked back--as once or twice he did--her cordial face shone like a light upon his heart; but when he plodded on his way, and saw her not, the tears were in her eyes as she stood watching him.
1	Mr Codlin sat smiling in the chimney-corner, eyeing the landlord as with a roguish look he held the cover in his hand, and, feigning that his doing so was needful to the welfare of the cookery, suffered the delightful steam to tickle the nostrils of his guest.
1	‘No, my dear, no, not an atom from anybody’s hand but mine if you please.
1	By way of bringing her out dexterously, Miss Tox had made the inquiry as in condescension to an old acquaintance whom she hadn’t seen for a fortnight or so.
1	I looked at her, but I could not see her, I could not hear her, I could not draw my breath.
1	But that you have been trying me, and tampering with me, I am now sure.
1	Far be it from us, in the present comparatively imperfect state of the resources of our establishment, to endeavour to follow our distinguished townsman through the smoothly-flowing periods of his polished and highly-ornate address!
1	No man shall talk to Josiah Bounderby of Coketown about letters, with his mind in the state it’s in now.’ ‘Bounderby,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, in a tone of temperate remonstrance, ‘I speak of a very special letter I have written to you, in reference to Louisa.’ ‘Tom Gradgrind,’ replied Bounderby, knocking the flat of his hand several times with great vehemence on the table, ‘I speak of a very special messenger that has come to me, in reference to Louisa.
1	Widows, gentlemen, are not usually timorous, as my uncle used to say.
1	However, it was very soon after the mistake was made of putting some of the trouble out of King Charles’s head into my head, that the man first came.
1	The people was just as good to me, and I should have gone from town to town, maybe the country through, but that I got news of her being seen among them Swiss mountains yonder.
1	I am ashamed to seem so selfish, but I don’t really mean it.
1	‘You’ll have as much as I shall.
1	I thus became aware of the mutual relations between them and Mr. Pocket, which were exemplified in the following manner.
1	‘Oh I’ve run such a way after you!’ ‘What do you want with me?’ said Mr Abel.
1	‘No,’ thought Nicholas, ‘I have acted for the best.’ But, before he had gone five hundred yards, some other and different feeling would come upon him, and then he would lag again, and pulling his hat over his eyes, give way to the melancholy reflections which pressed thickly upon him.
1	Mr. Bumble shook his head with gloomy mystery, and said he wished he might come to good; whereunto Mr. Gamfield replied, that he wished he might come to him; which, although he agreed with the beadle in most matters, would seem to be a wish of a totally opposite description.
1	I’ll walk home wi’ you.’ ‘He might fall ill upon the journey back,’ said Sissy, faintly offering a worn-out scrap of hope; ‘and in such a case, there are many places on the road where he might stop.’ ‘But he is in none of them.
1	He had a quantity of hair and moustache--jet black, except at the shaggy ends, where it had a tinge of red--and a high hook nose.
1	Mr Feeder then told him, to his great joy, that his sister was invited, and that it was a half-yearly event, and that, as the holidays began that day, he could go away with his sister after the party, if he liked, which Paul interrupted him to say he would like, very much.
1	It was dingy enough and not at all clean, but furnished with an odd kind of shabby luxury, with a large footstool, a sofa, and plenty of cushions, an easy-chair, and plenty of pillows, a piano, books, drawing materials, music, newspapers, and a few sketches and pictures.
1	A rap at the door startled him in this occupation.
1	‘Do you know that person’s name?’ he inquired of the man in an audible voice; pointing out Sir Mulberry as he put the question.
1	He had made one step towards it, before he checked himself.
1	I am certain that you don't forget by what a noble character, Ada.
1	She often moralized over her work on the tricks and the manners of that venerable cheat, but made her little purchases elsewhere, and lived a secluded life.
1	We’re positively getting on, you know.
1	‘And you see, as I was saying, Mortimer,’ remarked Eugene aloud with the utmost coolness, as though there were no one within hearing by themselves: ‘and you see, as I was saying--undergoing grinding torments.’ It was not too strong a phrase for the occasion.
1	BLOTTON would only say then, that he repelled the hon.
1	In this city there are houses of correction (where the treadmills are, for women), the gates of which are very strong and heavy, and no doubt the keys too.
1	‘Coolish!’ observed Carker, stirring the fire.
1	If I were not dumb, you would be deaf.
1	Mr. Pickwick had felt some apprehensions in consequence of the unusual absence of his two friends, which their mysterious behaviour during the whole morning had by no means tended to diminish.
1	Many and many a time had my fingers longed to tear him.
1	The child uttered a suppressed shriek on beholding this agreeable figure; in their first surprise both she and the old man, not knowing what to say, and half doubting its reality, looked shrinkingly at it.
1	Fully persuaded, however, that Newman would not have solicited him to return unless there was some strong reason which required his presence at home, he resolved to go there, and hastened eastwards with all speed.
1	I walked through the streets; and, once more seeing my old adversary the butcher--now a constable, with his staff hanging up in the shop--went down to look at the place where I had fought him; and there meditated on Miss Shepherd and the eldest Miss Larkins, and all the idle loves and likings, and dislikings, of that time.
1	'Then you return my love?'
1	So, whether he lives or dies, what does it come to?
1	The moral sort of fellows might suppose that Mr. James Harthouse derived some comfortable reflections afterwards, from this prompt retreat, as one of his few actions that made any amends for anything, and as a token to himself that he had escaped the climax of a very bad business.
1	This reminds me that I have not been able to do so, and that I sometimes almost despair of ever being able to do so.
1	He spoke of it more than once on the remainder of the way home, and more than once when they got home.
1	Mrs Pipchin had kept watch and ward over little Paul and his sister for nearly twelve months.
1	‘And I do say, and will say, and must say,’ pursued his sister, pressing the foot of the wine-glass on Miss Tox’s hand, at each of the three clauses, ‘that Miss Tox has very prettily adapted the sentiment to the occasion.
1	But, somehow, it had all failed.
1	It was a house of dismal state, with a circular back to it, containing a whole suite of drawing-rooms looking upon a gravelled yard, where two gaunt trees, with blackened trunks and branches, rattled rather than rustled, their leaves were so smoked-dried.
1	It seemed, too, that Mr. and Miss Murdstone had gone out upon a visit in the neighbourhood, and would not return before night.
1	My wonder is, that you are not in earnest yourself, by this time, Agnes.’ Agnes laughed again, and shook her head.
1	Her strength held out to enable her to arrange the letter in her breast, so as that it could be seen that she had a paper there.
1	That's my view of such things, speaking as a child!"
1	‘You’re quite a stranger!’ ‘Yes.
1	We were in the very same room into which I had brought my blushing girl when her youthful lover, now her so altered husband, was the choice of her young heart, the very same room from which my guardian and I had watched them going away through the sunlight in the fresh bloom of their hope and promise.
1	She hurriedly addresses these lines to her husband, seals, and leaves them on her table:    If I am sought for, or accused of, his murder, believe    that I am wholly innocent.
1	‘Why, Arthur!’ she added with astonishment, seeing him first.
1	Bestowing something half-way between a smile and a frown upon his two companions, and again beckoning them to follow him, the man hastened across the apartment, which was of considerable extent, but low in the roof.
1	All regret will be unavailing, and deep and bitter it must be.
1	If you could make it convenient, Ma’am, to pass the word presently for them children to come for’ard, in a body, I should be glad to see ‘em.’ These innocent MacStingers were so many daggers to the Captain’s breast, when they appeared in a swarm, and tore at him with the confiding trustfulness he so little deserved.
1	We had all shaken hands cordially, and neither Herbert's eyes nor mine were quite dry, when I saw a four-oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way ahead of us, and row out into the same track.
1	In all these movements he was closely followed by the eyes of Edwin, as if that young gentleman expected to see the thorn in action.
1	Rivers and seas were formed to float their ships; rainbows gave them promise of fair weather; winds blew for or against their enterprises; stars and planets circled in their orbits, to preserve inviolate a system of which they were the centre.
1	‘Then you ought to be able to afford it, Sir,’ said the judge, reddening; for Mr. Justice Stareleigh’s temper bordered on the irritable, and brooked not contradiction.
1	He is intent upon various new expenses,--horses, and carriages, and lavish appearances of all kinds.
1	‘No offence, sir,’ said Wegg, humbly.
1	I was in one of the courts for a few minutes, and found it like those to which I have already referred.
1	Many a time I've heard my old fellow-serjeant of that name; and a moderate man he was in all respects, as ever I come across!"
1	"Did you hear me ask you where you have come from?"
1	As if there were a secret understanding between herself and Clennam of the most thrilling nature; as if the first of a train of post-chaises and four, extending all the way to Scotland, were at that moment round the corner; and as if she couldn’t (and wouldn’t) have walked into the Parish Church with him, under the shade of the family umbrella, with the Patriarchal blessing on her head, and the perfect concurrence of all mankind; Flora comforted her soul with agonies of mysterious signalling, expressing dread of discovery.
1	When I consider your character; when I consider that what has been known to me for hours, has been concealed by you for years; when I consider under what immediate pressure it has been forced from you at last; I come to the conclusion that I cannot but mistrust myself.’ He might have added more than all, when he saw the face now looking at him.
1	‘It’s all right,’ he said at last, ‘and now I’ll wish you good day, as it’s collecting day in the Yard.
1	Was there nobody else to come?’ ‘I beg your pardon, Sir,’ returned Walter.
1	Scrooge's niece's sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed the same opinion.
1	This is indeed an acquisition.
1	It’s much better he shouldn’t come to-night.’ The schoolmaster lighted a candle, fastened the window-shutter, and closed the door.
1	At every one of her adjectives she redoubled her kisses, and finally kissed his hat off, and then laughed immoderately when the wind took it and he ran after it.
1	Because you are in a state of darkness, because you are in a state of obscurity, because you are in a state of sinfulness, because you are in a state of bondage.
1	You observe that I say, I suppose.
1	Mrs. Nickleby, knowing of her son’s obligations to the honest Yorkshireman, had, after some demur, yielded her consent to Mr. and Mrs. Browdie being invited out to tea; in the way of which arrangement, there were at first sundry difficulties and obstacles, arising out of her not having had an opportunity of ‘calling’ upon Mrs. Browdie first; for although Mrs. Nickleby very often observed with much complacency (as most punctilious people do), that she had not an atom of pride or formality about her, still she was a great stickler for dignity and ceremonies; and as it was manifest that, until a call had been made, she could not be (politely speaking, and according to the laws of society) even cognisant of the fact of Mrs. Browdie’s existence, she felt her situation to be one of peculiar delicacy and difficulty.
1	Then he told me that you had spoken to him about me, and that he had found me employment in the House accordingly, and that I was expected to be attentive and punctual, and then he went away.
1	I shall go out of my senses, if I have to think that I have driven you away like this.’ His trembling voice and unfeigned earnestness brought Little Dorrit to a stop.
1	‘I shall work down to Ipswich the day arter to-morrow, Sir,’ said Mr. Weller the elder, ‘from the Bull in Whitechapel; and if you really mean to go, you’d better go with me.’ ‘So we had,’ said Mr. Pickwick; ‘very true; I can write to Bury, and tell them to meet me at Ipswich.
1	He pushed against the garden-gate; it was unlocked, and swung open on its hinges.
1	He made the cottage smaller than it need have been, by being so very much out of proportion to it.
1	Is that the reason, aunt?’ ‘Partly,’ said the lady, ‘but not all.
1	Then I would make a fact so disgraceful known, and boldly challenge society to set it right.
1	But, brother, brother, brother, I protest against it!’ It was extraordinary to see of what a burst of earnestness such a decrepit man was capable.
1	When I had groped my way, blindly, through these difficulties, and had mastered the alphabet, which was an Egyptian Temple in itself, there then appeared a procession of new horrors, called arbitrary characters; the most despotic characters I have ever known; who insisted, for instance, that a thing like the beginning of a cobweb, meant expectation, and that a pen-and-ink sky-rocket, stood for disadvantageous.
1	‘Don’t be hard upon him, Jowl,’ said Isaac List.
1	You were talking of tampering, just now.
1	They are both written in good faith, I have no doubt, and without any collusion.
1	And all in the house did the same.
1	But what--hey?--Lord forgive us!--Mrs Flintwinch muttered some ejaculation to this effect, and turned giddy.
1	It was a very small establishment, wherein a decent woman sat behind the counter working at her needle.
1	He lay there, listening to the noises in the street, quite tranquilly; not caring much how the time went, but watching it and watching everything about him with observing eyes.
1	And I hope that he may find it"--Mr. Bucket again looks grave--"to his satisfaction."
1	It was upon the whole a very distinguished party, for independently of the lesser theatrical lights who clustered on this occasion round Mr. Snittle Timberry, there was a literary gentleman present who had dramatised in his time two hundred and forty-seven novels as fast as they had come out--some of them faster than they had come out--and who WAS a literary gentleman in consequence.
1	Their Scotch bonnets, ornamented with plumes of jet black feathers, Mr Grinder carried on his instrument.
1	I think I observed, myself, that it was highly creditable to all concerned.
1	You see that?’ ‘Oh yes,’ replied Nicholas: ‘it’s very true, no doubt.’ ‘The great reason for not being married,’ resumed Mr. Lillyvick, ‘is the expense; that’s what’s kept me off, or else--Lord!’ said Mr. Lillyvick, snapping his fingers, ‘I might have had fifty women.’ ‘Fine women?’ asked Nicholas.
1	‘Very sorry!’ said the furious magistrate.
1	Some man fell in with a splash, and was pulled out again with a roar of laughter.
1	Now a person wouldn’t think it, fur to see this little thing alongside a rough-weather chap like me,’ said Mr. Peggotty, looking round at both of us, with infinite pride; ‘but the sea ain’t more salt in it than she has fondness in her for her uncle--a foolish little Em’ly!’ ‘Em’ly’s in the right in that, Mas’r Davy!’ said Ham.
1	What's Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books and having every item in 'em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you?
1	Anyways we will hope so now.
1	The noble lady’s condition on these delightful occasions was one compounded of heroic endurance and heroic forgiveness.
1	‘He must be done something with, brother Ned,’ said the other, warmly; ‘we must disregard his old scruples; they can’t be tolerated, or borne.
1	‘My good friend, Mr. Noggs, what news do you bring for me?’ Newman, with a steadfast and immovable aspect, and his fixed eye very fixed indeed, replied, suiting the action to the word, ‘A letter.
1	‘No, my dear,’ replied the collector, ‘no.
1	"So, as I happen to be in the habit of coming about your premises, you take me into your confidence, don't you?"
1	He’s what you may call a rasper, is Nickleby.
1	Sometimes, he saw the man upon the bed, by a red light; sometimes, by a blue; sometimes, he scarcely saw him in the darkness of the storm; sometimes he saw nothing of him in the blinding glare of palpitating white fire.
1	We pushed off again, and made what way we could.
1	‘I ask your pardons, Governors,’ replied the ghost, as before, ‘but probable you was not aware your door stood open.’ ‘What do you want?’ Hereunto the ghost again hoarsely replied, in its double-barrelled manner, ‘I ask your pardons, Governors, but might one on you be Lawyer Lightwood?’ ‘One of us is,’ said the owner of that name.
1	The account is now favourably balanced: my creditor has accepted a composition.
1	I see you there a many times, as plain as ever I see you on them misty marshes.
1	‘Oh, father, won’t I make ‘em squeak again!’ It was a proud moment in Mr. Squeers’s life, when he witnessed that burst of enthusiasm in his young child’s mind, and saw in it a foreshadowing of his future eminence.
1	and the bedpost was his own.
1	Then, too, here was Mrs General, got home from foreign parts, sending a Prune and a Prism by post every other day, demanding a new Testimonial by way of recommendation to some vacant appointment or other.
1	Her colour came and went once more; and once more, as she bent her head, I saw the same sad smile.
1	It was easier for Tip to bring her to her senses than for her to bring _him_ to understand that the Father of the Marshalsea would be beside himself if he knew the truth.
1	Go on; you are very right.’ ‘Well, sir, I have been thinking that if you were waiting in the back garden alone, and I was to let you in, at the door which opens into it, from the end of the passage, at exactly half-past eleven o’clock, you would be just in the very moment of time to assist me in frustrating the designs of this bad man, by whom I have been unfortunately ensnared.’ Here Mr. Trotter sighed deeply.
1	I thought of our house shut up and hushed.
1	This was a young lady who could be scarcely eighteen, of very slight and delicate figure, but exquisitely shaped, who, walking timidly up to the desk, made an inquiry, in a very low tone of voice, relative to some situation as governess, or companion to a lady.
1	‘It’s me--Short’--a voice called through the keyhole.
1	There was a pair of trousers there.
1	What happiness was ours that day, what joy, what rest, what hope, what gratitude, what bliss!
1	The company had departed for another town more than twenty miles off, and had opened there last night.
1	He observed us with a genial interest, but there seemed, if I may venture on such a contradiction, nothing selfish in it.
1	Well, well--then let us say I love thee dearly.’ ‘Indeed, indeed you do,’ replied the child with great earnestness, ‘Kit knows you do.’ Kit, who in despatching his bread and meat had been swallowing two-thirds of his knife at every mouthful with the coolness of a juggler, stopped short in his operations on being thus appealed to, and bawled ‘Nobody isn’t such a fool as to say he doosn’t,’ after which he incapacitated himself for further conversation by taking a most prodigious sandwich at one bite.
1	"Thank you, sir, I am sure," returns the stationer with his cough of deference.
1	The Evening of a Long Day      25.
1	"But nothing that might not be sent to a pattern young lady?"
1	Let moralists and philosophers say what they may, it is very questionable whether a guilty man would have felt half as much misery that night, as Kit did, being innocent.
1	‘Come away for tonight!’ ‘I will not, by G--,’ he replied.
1	Honesty is the best policy.--I always find it so myself.
1	I _do_ understand you before you pint it out.
1	Picture the sky both dark and wild, and the clouds, in fearful sympathy with the waves, making another ocean in the air.
1	And Pa (you good little Pa), you don’t take milk.
1	You so belong to the spot, and to them, Arthur, and we should every one of us have been so happy if it had fallen out--but, let us see--how’s the weather for travelling now?’ Mr Meagles broke off, cleared his throat, and got up to look out of the window.
1	The oyster shells he had been building a house with were still in the passage, but he was nowhere discoverable, and the cook supposed that he had "gone after the sheep."
1	To this, the figure beckoned them; at the same time drawing within its rays, as if to show that it had no desire to conceal itself or take them at an advantage.
1	Tell him, when he theeth our horthe begin to danthe, not to be afraid of being thpilt, but to look out for a pony-gig coming up.
1	One reflection disturbed him far more than any selfish considerations arising out of his own position.
1	It was not difficult to divine that the other house was of right the schoolmaster’s, and that he had chosen for himself the least commodious, in his care and regard for them.
1	I am sure you know me better.
1	Agnes and hospitality prevailed, however, and I conducted him to my fireside.
1	The clear red and white of her complexion was not so blooming and flower-like as usual, I thought, when she turned round; but she looked very pretty, Wonderfully pretty.
1	She did not replace my mother; no one could do that; but she came into a vacancy in my heart, which closed upon her, and I felt towards her something I have never felt for any other human being.
1	Having closed the door, to prevent being overheard, he sank into a chair, and said, in a low voice-- ‘“Hush!
1	Loud cries of ‘Shame,’ mingled with groans and hisses, prevailed for a quarter of an hour.
1	But, to tell me that I am not fit for it after all I have done for it--after all I have done for it,’ repeated Mr Merdle, with a wild emphasis that made his wife lift up her eyelids, ‘after all--all!--to tell me I have no right to mix with it after all, is a pretty reward.’ ‘I say,’ answered Mrs Merdle composedly, ‘that you ought to make yourself fit for it by being more degage, and less preoccupied.
1	But she soon cheered up, and we did wonders with it before we went to bed.
1	We were soon established in a snug hotel, which though smaller and far less splendid than many we put up at, it raised above them all in my remembrance, by having for its landlord the most obliging, considerate, and gentlemanly person I ever had to deal with.
1	Preparations were in progress for a moral little Mill somewhere on the rural circuit, and other Professors were backing this or that Heavy-Weight as good for such or such speech-making hits, so very much after the manner of the sporting publicans, that the intended Resolutions might have been Rounds.
1	And I said yes, and she said she knew only one or two places about here, but had lost her way and couldn't find them.
1	‘I, with poor father’s grave not even cleared of undeserved stain and shame, and he trying to clear it for me!
1	Given out on the Wednesday night at eight o'clock, brought in on the Thursday morning at half after nine."
1	He tries this, swings it, poises it, and lays it by, with the knapsack, on a window-seat.
1	From a very early age I have detected what those about me thought they hid from me.
1	‘On the very day when I last saw him,’ said I, ‘he told me that he had, and that his affairs were long since settled.’ Mr. Jorkins and old Tiffey shook their heads with one accord.
1	‘Nonsense,’ said the old gentleman; ‘it was not your fault that he fell in love with you, I suppose?
1	‘All of a sudden the coach stopped.
1	As he takes his seat with some difficulty and with an air of pain, Mr. Bucket draws a little nearer, standing with one of his large hands on the library-table.
1	However, she expressed herself very sorry to hear such a dismal account of her state of health, and shortly afterwards sat down with her grandfather and Mrs Jarley to breakfast.
1	His colour has turned to a livid white, and ominous marks have come to light about his nose, as if the finger of the very devil himself had, within the last few moments, touched it here and there.
1	'If you are in poverty or affliction I shall be truly glad to relieve you if I can,--I shall indeed.
1	The Doctor was sitting in his easy-chair by the fireside, and his young wife was on a stool at his feet.
1	We took things much more easily in the Commons than they could be taken anywhere else, he observed, and that set us, as a privileged class, apart.
1	They made no claim to his wealth; and the riches for which he had toiled all his days, and burdened his soul with so many evil deeds, were swept at last into the coffers of the state, and no man was the better or the happier for them.
1	The poorest women fall back, as I make my way along the crowded pavement.'
1	After    he had left me, I went out on pretence of walking in the    garden where I sometimes walk, but really to follow him    and make one last petition that he would not protract the    dreadful suspense on which I have been racked by him, you    do not know how long, but would mercifully strike next    morning.
1	‘We have been quarrelling here a little, Mr Rokesmith, but not more than we used; you know our agreeable ways among ourselves.
1	Mr George Sampson appears to me to be invited to participate in the--shall I say the--Elevation which has descended on the family with which he is ambitious, shall I say to Mingle?
1	Mr. Spenlow seemed to think, if he thought anything about the matter, that my aunt was the leader of the state party in our family, and that there was a rebel party commanded by somebody else--so I gathered at least from what he said, while we were waiting for Mr. Tiffey to make out Peggotty’s bill of costs.
1	There I saw him, lying on his back, with his legs extending to I don’t know where, gurglings taking place in his throat, stoppages in his nose, and his mouth open like a post-office.
1	‘My dear Copperfield,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘I need hardly tell you that to have beneath our roof, under existing circumstances, a mind like that which gleams--if I may be allowed the expression--which gleams--in your friend Traddles, is an unspeakable comfort.
1	One marriage guest there was, in reference to whose presence Mr Meagles felt a nearer interest and concern than in the attendance of the most elevated Barnacle expected; though he was far from insensible of the honour of having such company.
1	It was evident that something of great importance was in contemplation, but what that something was, not even Mrs. Bardell had been enabled to discover.
1	“I know better.” “Says you,” Pumblechook went on, “'Joseph, I have seen that man, and that man bears you no malice and bears me no malice.
1	I am now going to state three facts, which will startle a large class of readers on this side of the Atlantic, very much.
1	To Mr Eugene Wrayburn, in confidence, did Mrs John Harmon impart what she had known of the state of his wife’s affections, in his reckless time.
1	You are shocked, I dare say!
1	The remainder of the party (half-a-dozen perhaps) turned, and went back at a great rate.
1	‘Him!’ said the little fellow.
1	He expressed his satisfaction in placing himself in Mr Gowan’s hands, and trusted that he would have the pleasure, in their characters of private gentlemen, of improving his acquaintance.
1	I often heard it said, too, that she had ‘an unhappy temper.’ Well understanding what was meant by the convenient phrase, and wanting a companion with a knowledge of what I knew, I thought I would try to release the girl from her bondage and sense of injustice.
1	My aunt made her promised visit within a few days of the conference; and within a few more days, Dora’s aunts called upon her, in due state and form.
1	I have often recalled that cheerful party to my pleasant recollection since, and shall not easily forget, in junketings nearer home with friends of older date, my boon companions on the Prairie.
1	‘Played together.’ ‘Does she know your son as her admirer?’ ‘Oh!
1	Sol Gills, take an observation of your nevy.’ Following with his eyes the majestic action of the Captain’s hook, the old man looked at Walter.
1	It was not until I had brought him to kiss his sister, and had restored him to his place on my lap, and had shown him that Caddy was laughing (she laughed expressly for the purpose), that we could recall his peace of mind; even then it was for some time conditional on his taking us in turns by the chin and smoothing our faces all over with his hand.
1	I have another motive in coming: a motive of humanity.
1	Pitying his desolation, and watching him as he gradually settled down upon the pie, I made bold to say, “I am glad you enjoy it.” “Did you speak?” “I said I was glad you enjoyed it.” “Thankee, my boy.
1	Strange that Creation, designed expressly for Monseigneur, should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out!
1	I've got the upper hand over you, Fagin; and, d--me, I'll keep it.
1	Mrs Jarley was not slow to express her admiration at this happy result, and carried her young friend and pupil to inspect the remaining arrangements within doors, by virtue of which the passage had been already converted into a grove of green-baize hung with the inscription she had already seen (Mr Slum’s productions), and a highly ornamented table placed at the upper end for Mrs Jarley herself, at which she was to preside and take the money, in company with his Majesty King George the Third, Mr Grimaldi as clown, Mary Queen of Scots, an anonymous gentleman of the Quaker persuasion, and Mr Pitt holding in his hand a correct model of the bill for the imposition of the window duty.
1	‘Not such a one as this, Mr. Copperfield wouldn’t have liked,’ said Peggotty.
1	Do you hear, Hunt; do you hear?’ ‘I’ll not forget it, Sir.’ ‘I beg your pardon, Sir,’ said the other man, advancing, with his hand to his hat.
1	Distinctly as I recollect her look, I cannot say of what it was expressive, I cannot even say of what it is expressive to me now, rising again before my older judgement.
1	Over this, he mounted a long waistcoat of a broad pink-striped pattern, and over that again, a wide- skirted green coat, ornamented with large brass buttons, whereof the two which garnished the waist, were so far apart, that no man had ever beheld them both at the same time.
1	How can you be so inconsistent?’ ‘Jenny dear,’ began the old man gently, ‘it is the custom of our people to help--’ ‘Oh!
1	Indeed I don’t reproach you.
1	Because her faults have been intensified by her place in my father’s will, and she is already growing better.
1	According to the immemorial usage of waiters in all ages.
1	‘YOU’LL bring your threats here, will you?’ said Gride, whom jealousy of Nicholas and a sense of his own triumph had converted into a perfect fiend.
1	Arthur being far too ill to be spoken with on subjects of emotion or anxiety, and his recovery greatly depending on the repose into which his weakness could be hushed, Little Dorrit’s sole reliance during this heavy period was on Mr Meagles.
1	Thomas, ma’am, I doubt Mr. Thomas very much, ma’am, I don’t like his ways at all.’ ‘Bitzer,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, in a very impressive manner, ‘do you recollect my having said anything to you respecting names?’ ‘I beg your pardon, ma’am.
1	‘It is useless my addressing myself to a rash and headstrong old man who has a set purpose not to hear me.’ ‘Now, I won’t take that from you either,’ said Jeremiah.
1	‘You have sat me by your fire; you have given me food and money; you have bestowed your compassion on me!
1	Would it not have been better for his peace that I should not have been so brought before him?
1	But I suppose you’re too busy pocketing the ready money, to think of the debtors, eh?
1	"Miss Jellyby is a young lady who deeply respects you, and our first desire is to consider your comfort."
1	As the man rising from the deep would disappear the sooner for fighting with the water, so he in his desperate struggle went down again.
1	‘And they take no care of their clothes, and they never keep to the same fashions a month.
1	I don’t wish to say a single word that might be afterwards remembered as unpleasant; but it won’t do.’ ‘Sophronia, my love,’ her husband repeated in a bantering manner, ‘you hear?
1	As they hurried up to the coach, which was now in the open street and all ready for starting, Nicholas was not a little astonished to find himself suddenly clutched in a close and violent embrace, which nearly took him off his legs; nor was his amazement at all lessened by hearing the voice of Mr. Crummles exclaim, ‘It is he--my friend, my friend!’ ‘Bless my heart,’ cried Nicholas, struggling in the manager’s arms, ‘what are you about?’ The manager made no reply, but strained him to his breast again, exclaiming as he did so, ‘Farewell, my noble, my lion-hearted boy!’ In fact, Mr. Crummles, who could never lose any opportunity for professional display, had turned out for the express purpose of taking a public farewell of Nicholas; and to render it the more imposing, he was now, to that young gentleman’s most profound annoyance, inflicting upon him a rapid succession of stage embraces, which, as everybody knows, are performed by the embracer’s laying his or her chin on the shoulder of the object of affection, and looking over it.
1	He stored my mind with its first treasures, and stamped his character upon them all.
1	‘It was the salmon.’ (Somehow or other, it never is the wine, in these cases.)
1	‘A glass of brandy here!’ The brandy was brought; and Mr. Weller, after pulling his hair to Mr. Pickwick, and nodding to Sam, jerked it down his capacious throat as if it had been a small thimbleful.
1	I have thought, since, that its assuming that character was a necessary consequence of Mr. Murdstone’s firmness, which wouldn’t allow him to let anybody off from the utmost weight of the severest penalties he could find any excuse for.
1	He wore a loose black silk handkerchief round his neck, and such a very large coarse shirt collar, that it looked like a small sail.
1	It is one of those nooks, the turning into which out of the clashing street, imparts to the relieved pedestrian the sensation of having put cotton in his ears, and velvet soles on his boots.
1	‘Have a roast fowl,’ said Mrs MacStinger, ‘with a bit of weal stuffing and some egg sauce.
1	If the native packets I have already described be unlike anything we are in the habit of seeing on water, these western vessels are still more foreign to all the ideas we are accustomed to entertain of boats.
1	'But I will tell you,' retorted Sikes.
1	The garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was dim and dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door in the roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from the street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any other door of French construction.
1	I wish she was--How have you been, Misses Brown?’ ‘Ah!
1	‘I am deeply sensible, mother, that if this thought has never at any time flashed upon you, it must seem cruel and unnatural in me, even in this confidence, to breathe it.
1	"Why, then, miss," the old girl proceeded, untying the strings of her bonnet for more air, "you could as soon move Dover Castle as move George on this point unless you had got a new power to move him with.
1	Keeps her room when not actually bedridden, and hasn’t been out of it fifteen times in as many years, Arthur.’ They had walked into a spare, meagre dining-room.
1	They were Mr. Tupman and Mr. Jingle.
1	"My advice to you," returns Mrs. Bagnet, "is to light your pipe and tingle that way.
1	I’m a little hunchy villain and a monster, am I, Mrs Jiniwin?
1	Upon which door the turnkey knocked with the handle of his key.
1	He took the chair on which Walter had been sitting, and looked up at the skylight, until the day, by little and little, faded away, and the stars peeped down.
1	I have been prescribed bark, but I don’t take it, for I don’t wish to have any tone whatever given to my constitution.
1	When the latter was powerful with her, she usually sent up secret messages importing that she was not in parlour condition as to her attire, and that she solicited a sight of ‘her child’ in the kitchen; there, she would bless her child’s face, and bless her child’s heart, and hug her child, in a medley of tears and congratulations, chopping-boards, rolling-pins, and pie-crust, with the tenderness of an old attached servant, which is a very pretty tenderness indeed.
1	She slept, for their better security, in the room where the wax-work figures were, and she never retired to this place at night but she tortured herself--she could not help it--with imagining a resemblance, in some one or other of their death-like faces, to the dwarf, and this fancy would sometimes so gain upon her that she would almost believe he had removed the figure and stood within the clothes.
1	There was something in his way of spurning them out of their places with his heel, and getting them into the required position, that Clennam thought had an air of cruelty in it.
1	The sounds that came back were stifled by the lath and plaster, and it seemed moreover as though the speaker had uttered them from the interior of a mug or other drinking vessel; but they were in the voice of Newman, and conveyed a reply in the affirmative.
1	But quite apart from, and independent of, this source of popularity, Mr Swiveller had another, which promised to be equally enduring, and to lighten his position considerably.
1	He looked in my sleep, when I was quite a little child, and has looked in my sleep ever since, as he did just now.’ Nicholas endeavoured, by every persuasion and argument he could think of, to convince the terrified creature that his imagination had deceived him, and that this close resemblance between the creation of his dreams and the man he supposed he had seen was but a proof of it; but all in vain.
1	Besides which, the Native had private zests and flavours on a side-table, with which the Major daily scorched himself; to say nothing of strange machines out of which he spirited unknown liquids into the Major’s drink.
1	On all of which accounts, I should hope it was clear to you that I must have you, and that I'm damned if I don't have you.
1	They need to charge for dooble-latthers.
1	‘And to nothing else.’ They stood looking at each other; Mr. Gradgrind’s face as white as the pursuer’s.
1	When they stopped to gather a hedge flower, or listen to a bird, Nathaniel Pipkin stopped too, and pretended to be absorbed in meditation, as indeed he really was; for he was thinking what on earth he should ever do, when they turned back, as they inevitably must in time, and meet him face to face.
1	‘Well, I never!’ ejaculated the cook.
1	‘Do you remember going up to Mrs. Bardell’s house, one night in November last?’ Oh, yes, wery well.’ ‘Oh, you do remember that, Mr. Weller,’ said Serjeant Buzfuz, recovering his spirits; ‘I thought we should get at something at last.’ ‘I rayther thought that, too, sir,’ replied Sam; and at this the spectators tittered again.
1	‘Oh not that disagreeable name, say Flora!’ ‘Flora, is it worth troubling yourself afresh to enter into explanations?
1	Having read the first few lines, Mr Inspector mounted to that (for him) extraordinary pitch of emotion that he said, ‘Does either of you two gentlemen happen to have a pinch of snuff about him?’ Finding that neither had, he did quite as well without it, and read on.
1	‘I sold myself long ago.’ ‘My Lady, don’t believe her,’ croaked the old woman to Mrs Skewton; ‘don’t believe what she says.
1	And not silly?’ said my aunt.
1	Scattered about, in various holes and corners of the Temple, are certain dark and dirty chambers, in and out of which, all the morning in vacation, and half the evening too in term time, there may be seen constantly hurrying with bundles of papers under their arms, and protruding from their pockets, an almost uninterrupted succession of lawyers’ clerks.
1	‘Pretty well,’ said Ralph; ‘in another quarter of the town--at the East end; but I’ll send my clerk down to you, at five o’clock on Saturday, to take you there.
1	There was a Sir Somebody Dedlock, with a battle, a sprung-mine, volumes of smoke, flashes of lightning, a town on fire, and a stormed fort, all in full action between his horse's two hind legs, showing, he supposed, how little a Dedlock made of such trifles.
1	He had been asked if he came on business, and had answered No; he had come for the pleasure of seeing me, and had come a long way.
1	‘A dependence upon him,’ said Kate, ‘would embitter my whole life.
1	‘Never, Sir,’ rejoined Pott, pot-valiant in a double sense--‘never.’ With these words, Mr. Pott took up his position on an opposite settle, and selecting one from a little bundle of newspapers, began to read against his enemy.
1	A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge which she felt to be a new one.
1	‘Now really, another time, when I know what she would tell you but for this reason, and won’t, I have a great mind, my dear Doctor, to tell you myself.’ ‘I shall be glad if you will,’ returned the Doctor.
1	She’s not an aunt of mine, and I’ll never call her one.’ Immediately upon the utterance of these words, Mr. Lillyvick caught Miss Morleena up in his arms, and kissed her; and, being by this time at the door of the house where Mr. Kenwigs lodged (which, as has been before mentioned, usually stood wide open), he walked straight up into Mr Kenwigs’s sitting-room, and put Miss Morleena down in the midst.
1	There was no other question that I knew of in the world, and only Dora could give the answer to it.
1	He was not a coward: but these sounds; what had gone before; the strangeness of the place, which had confused him, even in his return from the hall; the frustration of his schemes (for, strange to say, he would have been much bolder, if they had succeeded); the unseasonable time; the recollection of having no one near to whom he could appeal for any friendly office; above all, the sudden sense, which made even his heart beat like lead, that the man whose confidence he had outraged, and whom he had so treacherously deceived, was there to recognise and challenge him with his mask plucked off his face; struck a panic through him.
1	‘Of course I did,’ said my aunt, ‘and was therefore easily silenced.
1	Don’t you know she has?
1	It does as well as anything else, for a time.
1	The hot-water pipes that trail themselves all over the house, the cushioned doors and windows, and the screens and curtains fail to supply the fires' deficiencies and to satisfy Sir Leicester's need.
1	The old man was up, betimes, next morning, and waited impatiently for the appearance of his new associate, who after a delay that seemed interminable, at length presented himself, and commenced a voracious assault on the breakfast.
1	It was soon done, and the gate of the Nuns’ House closed upon them.
1	How’s that?’ ‘I supposed he had come home,’ Pleasant explained.
1	I knew very well that if he could have had the power of seeing me as I was, he would consider the poor girl tarnished by having for a moment been, although most innocently, the subject of my great and distinguished patronage.
1	The handsome lady--so like, oh so like!--regarded me with a fixed look, and put her hand to her forehead.
1	The conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman.
1	“What do you come snivelling here for?” “I didn't go to do it, Mr. Wemmick.” “You did,” said Wemmick.
1	You’re casting your eye round the shop, Mr Wegg.
1	‘Wot’s that for, Sir?’ inquired Mr. Weller, directing Pell’s attention to the target in question.
1	That she couldn’t help it.
1	Have I a friend here?
1	‘You will wonder, perhaps,’ she said in a stronger tone, ‘that I can better bear to be known to you whom I have wronged, than to the son of my enemy who wronged me.--For she did wrong me!
1	"It is possible, Mr. Jarndyce, that the gentleman to whom, for the reasons I have mentioned, I refrain from making further allusion--it is possible, Mr. Jarndyce, that that gentleman may have done me the honour so far to misapprehend my character as to induce you to believe that you would not have been received by my local establishment in Lincolnshire with that urbanity, that courtesy, which its members are instructed to show to all ladies and gentlemen who present themselves at that house.
1	And you mustn’t,’ seating Bella beside her, and patting her hand, ‘you mustn’t feel a dislike to us to begin with, because we couldn’t help it, you know, my dear.’ With the natural tendency of youth to yield to candour and sweet temper, Miss Bella was so touched by the simplicity of this address that she frankly returned Mrs Boffin’s kiss.
1	Four hims and a her.
1	I was such a silly little creature!
1	I was a’most as well as I was.
1	Mr Dombey was resolved to show her that he was supreme.
1	But, as it is, I must never touch it, never!’ She besought him, more pathetically and earnestly, with her little supplicatory hand, than she could have done in any words.
1	Mr Carker the Manager drew a chair close before the fire, and fell to beating the coals softly with the poker.
1	Now, I was unwilling to put the direction-card on there, lest any of my landlord’s family should fathom what I was doing, and detain me; so I said to the young man that I would be glad if he would stop for a minute, when he came to the dead-wall of the King’s Bench prison.
1	They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay there a little--listening perhaps.
1	Doady will carry me upstairs before you go, and I won’t come down again till you come back; and you shall take Agnes a dreadfully scolding letter from me, because she has never been to see us!’ We agreed, without any more consultation, that we would both go, and that Dora was a little Impostor, who feigned to be rather unwell, because she liked to be petted.
1	That man’s your Father of the Marshalsea!’ Resigning herself to inevitable fate by making the best of those people, the Miggleses, and submitting her philosophy to the draught upon it, of which she had foreseen the likelihood in her interview with Arthur, Mrs Gowan handsomely resolved not to oppose her son’s marriage.
1	You may wonder at my    saying this so confidently with so little knowledge or    experience, but I know it for a certainty from my own    heart.
1	Mr. Bagnet, otherwise as immovable as a pump or a lamp-post, puts his large right hand on the top of his bald head as if to defend it from a shower-bath and looks with great uneasiness at Mrs. Bagnet.
1	‘Next,’ said Venus, blowing at his tea in his saucer, and looking over it at his confidential friend, ‘comes the question, What’s the course to be pursued?’ On this head, Silas Wegg had much to say.
1	He sat by a newly-lighted wood fire (the blighted and unfruitful year was prematurely cold), and on his honest and courageous face there was a deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw, or any object in the room distortedly reflect--a shade of horror.
1	‘I need look somewhat changed,’ he said, after a short silence; ‘for I have undergone some suffering, both of mind and body, since I left London.
1	Besides which, the walls were not thick, and, whenever he passed the evening at our house, we always knew of it by hearing one continual growl in the kitchen.
1	When the storm of dust had cleared away and the summer night was calm again, numbers of people choked up every avenue of access, and parties of diggers were formed to relieve one another in digging among the ruins.
1	While I had been away from home lately, Traddles had called twice or thrice.
1	'They resided,' said Mr. Brownlow, without seeming to hear the interruption, 'in a part of the country to which your father in his wandering had repaired, and where he had taken up his abode.
1	‘If you wouldn’t mind walking in, I’ll find him directly.’ They walked in; and Sissy, having set two chairs for them, sped away with a quick light step.
1	Gentlemen, our friend Mr. Whiffers (everybody looked at the individual in orange), our friend Mr. Whiffers has resigned.’ Universal astonishment fell upon the hearers.
1	In this same church, the pretty boy received all that will soon be left of him on earth--a name.
1	There had been shrieks from among the women convicts; but they had been stilled, and a hush had succeeded.
1	She hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl:  looking fearfully round, from time to time, as if, despite the sleeping draught, she expected every moment to feel the pressure of Sikes's heavy hand upon her shoulder; then, stooping softly over the bed, she kissed the robber's lips; and then opening and closing the room-door with noiseless touch, hurried from the house.
1	‘A curse upon you!’ she said, looking round at me, with a mingled expression of rage and grief.
1	The eye of Alexander MacStinger, who had been his favourite, was insupportable to the Captain; the voice of Juliana MacStinger, who was the picture of her mother, made a coward of him.
1	‘I am sorry to say, Mr. Copperfield, I can’t advance your object,’ said Mr. Jorkins, nervously.
1	And I’ll tell you why, Rokesmith.
1	Mr. Jasper seats himself upon another.
1	Making a desk of it, he stood there with his back to the old man, warming his knees, perusing the list at his leisure, and often returning to some lines of it, as though they were particularly interesting.
1	They seemed, however, to be more directly concerned than the others had been in the effective execution of the great principle of the office, as there was an awful inner apartment with a double door, in which the Circumlocution Sages appeared to be assembled in council, and out of which there was an imposing coming of papers, and into which there was an imposing going of papers, almost constantly; wherein another gentleman, number four, was the active instrument.
1	The only article in which Silas dealt, that was not hard, was gingerbread.
1	Louisa had known it, and seen it, without looking at her.
1	My Lady Dedlock has been down at what she calls, in familiar conversation, her "place" in Lincolnshire.
1	The room smelt close and unwholesome; the walls were dirt-discoloured; and the ceiling blackened.
1	That’s going according to the Scripter, that is.’ ‘Mr.
1	‘You’re thinking of a capital F perhaps?’ said the Captain.
1	said I, pretending to consider.
1	The depravity of the human heart is such--’ ‘You will oblige me, ma’am,’ interrupted Mr. Spenlow, ‘by confining yourself to facts.’ Miss Murdstone cast down her eyes, shook her head as if protesting against this unseemly interruption, and with frowning dignity resumed: ‘Since I am to confine myself to facts, I will state them as dryly as I can.
1	‘Come here, sir!’ said Mr. Creakle, beckoning to me.
1	You’ve got half the property, haven’t you?’ ‘Yes, yes.’ ‘Well then, don’t you be cowed.
1	Chris’en name, Bradley sim’lar to Roger which is my own.
1	I know what a multitude of things he has shut out for my sake, and how his anxious thoughts of me have shadowed his life, and weakened his strength and energy, by turning them always upon one idea.
1	It may be that if we knew more of such strange afflictions we might be the better able to alleviate their intensity.
1	Wal’r is a lad as’ll go through a deal o’ hard weather.
1	'Ain't you afraid of it, sir?
1	Ever forgiving and ever affable.
1	She could have stabbed him--poisoned him safely.
1	Now you shall fasten it on yourself, for good luck, if you will, George."
1	Silence was then proclaimed by the little man in the drab shorts, and Mr. Humm rose and said--That, with the permission of his Brick Lane Branch brothers and sisters, then and there present, the secretary would read the report of the Brick Lane Branch committee; a proposition which was again received with a demonstration of pocket-handkerchiefs.
1	To become a Guppy is the object of his ambition.
1	Would the lady object to my lighting the pair of candles on the chimneypiece, to throw a further light upon the subject?
1	‘Good evening, godmother!’ said Miss Jenny Wren.
1	‘Have a bit.’ ‘I couldn’t eat a morsel,’ replied his wife.
1	You may not care to please yourself, and you may not care to please him, but you are not a free agent as to pleasing: you are forced to do that, in spite of yourself, my dear; so it may be a question whether you may not as well please yourself too, if you can.’ Now, the very grossness of this flattery put Bella upon proving that she actually did please in spite of herself.
1	‘Tell him about the Memorial,’ said Mr. Dick.
1	And I considered whether, if it should signify any one of these meanings, which was so very likely, could I quite answer for myself?
1	'My Lord, my Lord, I know it would,' said I to him, 'and it would have been far better for me never to have heard the name of your high office, but unhappily for me, I can't undo the past, and the past drives me here!'
1	Remember them last races, Tommy.’ ‘Will you never leave off aggravating a man?’ said Codlin.
1	It did look bad; now didn’t it?’ ‘It looked so bad, Jenny,’ responded the old man, with gravity, ‘that I will straightway tell you what an impression it wrought upon me.
1	I didn't know there had been any.” “Estella,” said I, “do look at that fellow in the corner yonder, who is looking over here at us.” “Why should I look at him?” returned Estella, with her eyes on me instead.
1	“But how much would you tell him, Herbert?” “It is necessary to tell him very little.
1	‘They wanted all the happiness to come together.
1	But that you have gathered already?
1	The banquet was appointed for a Sunday, and Miss Rugg with her own hands stuffed a leg of mutton with oysters on the occasion, and sent it to the baker’s--not _the_ baker’s but an opposition establishment.
1	After which, appears Sophronia (whom Twemlow has seen twice in his lifetime), to thank Twemlow for counterfeiting the late Horatio Akershem Esquire, broadly of Yorkshire.
1	‘His residence--’ ‘Is at present at the Angel at Bury.’ ‘At Bury?’ ‘At Bury St. Edmunds, not many miles from here.
1	‘I speak to you for the sake of others.
1	‘“What do you want here?” roared Lobbs; “I suppose you have come after my daughter, now!” ‘Old Lobbs merely said this as a sneer: for he did not believe that mortal presumption could have carried Nathaniel Pipkin so far.
1	He said to me, “Come up to the top of the house, sir, and I’ll show you a handsome girl.
1	I was sorting those things on the chest, and not thinking of the old man or the children, but singing to myself, when all in a moment I felt there was a face growing out of the dark.’ ‘What face?’ asked her husband, looking about him.
1	He shivered all the while so violently, that it was quite as much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle between his teeth, without biting it off.
1	‘It was a vain threat.’ We drove away, out of town, to the churchyard at Hornsey.
1	This fellow, upon the slightest encouragement, would have mingled with his professional recollections the most detestable cant; but I am very much mistaken if he could have surpassed the unmitigated hypocrisy with which he declared that he blessed the day on which he came into that prison, and that he never would commit another robbery as long as he lived.
1	At this the two innocents, with their brains in that apparent danger, laughed, and Mrs Higden laughed, and the orphan laughed, and then the visitors laughed.
1	Austere faces, inexorable discipline, penance in this world and terror in the next--nothing graceful or gentle anywhere, and the void in my cowed heart everywhere--this was my childhood, if I may so misuse the word as to apply it to such a beginning of life.’ ‘Really though?’ said Mr Meagles, made very uncomfortable by the picture offered to his imagination.
1	So cold, so lonely, so dreary all!
1	What do you say now?” “I don't feel disposed to say much.
1	I am not so unconscionable as to think it likely that you would accept me on trust at first sight, and take me out of the very street.
1	The continued kindness of her sister was this comfort to Little Dorrit.
1	They always praised the child, her sense and beauty, and he was proud to hear them!
1	‘Humbly and submissively,’ returned the tragedian, scowling upwards.
1	Slouching at his side with his eyes upon the towing-path, Riderhood held his left hand open, with a certain slight drawing action towards himself.
1	‘Naturally, Miss Bella, you know.’ ‘Oh-h!’ said Mrs Wilfer, with a severely unconvinced look.
1	"So much the easier what I have to say, and so much the easier for us to agree," returned my guardian, his face irradiated by the gentleness and honour of his heart.
1	Confine yourself to yours, and ask me no question.’ ‘By Heaven, ma’am!’ he replied, making her another bow.
1	Miss Lavinia laughed a short laugh as she muttered, ‘Yes, to be sure.’ ‘And I require my audacious child,’ proceeded Mrs Wilfer, with a withering look at her youngest, on whom it had not the slightest effect, ‘to please to be just to her sister Bella; to remember that her sister Bella is much sought after; and that when her sister Bella accepts an attention, she considers herself to be conferring qui-i-ite as much honour,’--this with an indignant shiver,--‘as she receives.’ But, here Miss Bella repudiated, and said quietly, ‘I can speak for myself; you know, ma.
1	‘You must be aware, Mr. Copperfield,’ he added, looking restlessly in at the door again, ‘if Mr. Spenlow objects--’ ‘Personally, he does not object, sir,’ said I.
1	I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing to the contrary.
1	You don’t know what my state of mind towards you is.
1	The first mate, who whistled for it zealously, was much respected for his perseverance, and was regarded even by the unbelievers as a first-rate sailor.
1	It rushed away where it would, but it never, for an instant, lost itself in sleep.
1	All that I know is, your philosophy and your teaching will not save me.
1	‘My master, sir, is a very artful man.’ ‘I know he is,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	He seemed to have no strength, and he never once hit me hard, and he was always knocked down; but he would be up again in a moment, sponging himself or drinking out of the water-bottle, with the greatest satisfaction in seconding himself according to form, and then came at me with an air and a show that made me believe he really was going to do for me at last.
1	'It must have been something, love,' urged Mr. Bumble.
1	Rose made no reply, but played a little quicker, as though the words had roused her from some painful thoughts.
1	Who comes?” As if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of Saint Antoine Quarter to the wine-shop door, had been suddenly fired, a fast-spreading murmur came rushing along.
1	It was very soon after his interview with the Secretary, that he and Charley Hexam set out one leaden evening, not unnoticed by Miss Peecher, to have this desperate interview accomplished.
1	It was a Game called Yes and No, where Scrooge's nephew had to think of something, and the rest must find out what; he only answering to their questions yes or no, as the case was.
1	She would be deserted and reduced to ruin, and I should catch my death of cold in some broker’s shop.” ‘“Yes, but--” ‘“Don’t interrupt me,” said the old gentleman.
1	‘There’s where she sits, you see,’ said Eugene, when they were standing under the bank, roared and riven at by the wind.
1	Then was it not the sacred duty of the men of Coketown, with forefathers before them, an admiring world in company with them, and a posterity to come after them, to hurl out traitors from the tents they had pitched in a sacred and a God-like cause?
1	Whenever I fell into a thoughtful state, this subject was sure to present itself, and all my uneasiness was sure to be redoubled.
1	said he with his bright clear eyes on mine.
1	Your Papa’s a Dombey, child, if ever there was one,’ said Mrs Chick, drying both her eyes at once with great care on opposite corners of Miss Tox’s handkerchief ‘He’ll make an effort.
1	‘You have much too open and generous a countenance for that.’ ‘What an extraordinary observer you are!’ said Sir Mulberry Hawk.
1	I cannot rest until I know that we are not too late.
1	says Mr. Guppy, transferring his cross-examination.
1	‘Of course you do,’ retorted the dwarf, viciously snapping at his words.
1	There had been an old copy of the Pilgrim’s Progress, with strange plates, upon a shelf at home, over which she had often pored whole evenings, wondering whether it was true in every word, and where those distant countries with the curious names might be.
1	It’s his system.’ ‘Formed his daughter on his own model?’ suggested Harthouse.
1	But then, you see, you're broad in proportion and don't look it.
1	‘Amen to that,’ replied Sam, ‘and a fat and happy liven’ they’d get out of it!
1	I began, by being singularly cheerful and light-hearted; all sorts of half-forgotten things to talk about, came rushing into my mind, and made me hold forth in a most unwonted manner.
1	Apart from any inclinations of my own, I understood Wemmick's hint now.
1	To this they very readily agreed, and the proposition was accordingly acted upon; Mr. Ben Allen and Mr. Bob Sawyer betaking themselves to a sequestered pot- shop on the remotest confines of the Borough, behind the bar door of which their names had in other days very often appeared at the head of long and complex calculations worked in white chalk.
1	How can I meet the kindest friends that ever human creature had, with this dreadful charge upon me!’ Mr Brass rejoined that it would have been well for the prisoner if he had thought of that before and was about to make some other gloomy observations when the voice of the single gentleman was heard, demanding from above-stairs what was the matter, and what was the cause of all that noise and hurry.
1	She closed the window again, and sitting down upon the bed, thought of the life that was before them.
1	Uniting, and leaguing, and engaging to stand by one another.’ ‘It is much to be regretted,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, making her nose more Roman and her eyebrows more Coriolanian in the strength of her severity, ‘that the united masters allow of any such class-combinations.’ ‘Yes, ma’am,’ said Bitzer.
1	It would be rather late in the day.’ ‘Don’t mind me,’ returned James; ‘but take care when his wife is by, you know.’ ‘His wife?’ said Tom.
1	To die is our heavy portion, but, oh, let us die with life about us; when our cold hearts cease to beat, let warm hearts be beating near; let our last look be upon the bounds which God has set to his own bright skies, and not on stone walls and bars of iron!
1	The Captain never lost dignity, from having his ears boxed with the Latin Grammar.
1	I declare to you, on the faith of a gentleman, that I have long dismissed it from my mind.
1	A small portion of it at the stern is partitioned off for the ladies; and the bar is at the opposite extreme.
1	‘He was born here.’ We alighted; and followed the plain coffin to a corner I remember well, where the service was read consigning it to the dust.
1	A very contentious gentleman, who said it was his mission to be everybody's brother but who appeared to be on terms of coolness with the whole of his large family, completed the party.
1	‘Very well,’ returned Miss Blimber; ‘but this is all very different indeed from anything of that sort, Dombey, and I couldn’t think of permitting it.
1	As if I were never to have done with Caddy, I am reminded here of Peepy and old Mr. Turveydrop.
1	‘Always at home.’ This would seem to be secretly agreeable to Wegg, but he veils his feelings, and observes, ‘Strange.
1	I am not speaking to you politely; but, as you are aware, I am _not_ polite.
1	"And let me entreat you to consider that the clearing up of this mystery and the discovery of the real perpetrator of this deed may be of the last importance to others besides yourself."
1	‘She will try to do well,’ said little Em’ly.
1	Father, was that you calling me?
1	‘--that I will make no pretence of concealment.
1	‘I have stated the case, as such cases are usually stated among practical minds; I have stated it, as the case of your mother and myself was stated in its time.
1	You shall carry a letter to Ada from me, Esther, and you must both of you be more hopeful of me and not believe that I am quite cast away just yet, my dear."
1	He thought about it for a little while with a highly agreeable and whimsical expression of face, then quite gave it up and said in his most engaging manner, "You know what a child I am.
1	‘But I doubt if he could tell many people even their past or present fortunes.’ ‘Couldn’t have told the Princess hers?’ said Maggy.
1	I could hardly make them quarrel with me.
1	The second, that her brother had not made an effort.
1	said the undertaker:  raising the candle above his head, to get a better view of Oliver.
1	‘You will come to this marriage with me, John dear?’ ‘N--no, my love; I can’t do that.’ ‘You can’t do that, John?’ ‘No, my dear, it’s quite out of the question.
1	‘I have lived in the world for nigh sixty year, and I ought to know what it is.’ ‘You OUGHT to know, certainly,’ thought Nicholas; ‘but whether you do or not, is another question.’ ‘If a bachelor happens to have saved a little matter of money,’ said Mr Lillyvick, ‘his sisters and brothers, and nephews and nieces, look TO that money, and not to him; even if, by being a public character, he is the head of the family, or, as it may be, the main from which all the other little branches are turned on, they still wish him dead all the while, and get low-spirited every time they see him looking in good health, because they want to come into his little property.
1	It being Lizzie’s regular occupation when they were alone of an evening to brush out and smooth the long fair hair of the dolls’ dressmaker, she unfastened a ribbon that kept it back while the little creature was at her work, and it fell in a beautiful shower over the poor shoulders that were much in need of such adorning rain.
1	Had the birds, carrying some grains of it to a distance, dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds?
1	‘He and she?’ ‘What, Mr and Mrs Dombey?’ said Rob.
1	Very few loose papers are about.
1	On the next day, fresh search was made, and the inquiries renewed; but with no better success.
1	Mr. Bounderby’s first procedure was to shake Mrs. Sparsit off, and leave her to progress as she might through various stages of suffering on the floor.
1	‘I will, however,’ continued Madame Mantalini, drying her eyes, and speaking with great indignation, ‘say before you, and before everybody here, for the first time, and once for all, that I never will supply that man’s extravagances and viciousness again.
1	because he suffered her to lead him.
1	The ironmaster repeats her expression with a little emphasis.
1	I have not seen my mother this long time, and it lies upon my conscience, for it’s something to be loved as she loves her prodigal son.---Bah!
1	He swallowed a glassful and took up the paper again.
1	They would have scorned the action.
1	He read with young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a living tongue spoken all over the world, and he cultivated a taste for its stores of knowledge and fancy.
1	‘Speak out, Sam.’ ‘’Cause,’ rejoined Sam--‘’cause I’ve got a little bisness as I want to do.’ ‘What business?’ inquired Mr. Pickwick, surprised at Sam’s confused manner.
1	Those fleet messengers require the Analytical to see that their hats are deposited where they can be laid hold of at an instant’s notice; and they dine (remarkably well though) with the air of firemen in charge of an engine, expecting intelligence of some tremendous conflagration.
1	‘This will soon be over now, dear Mr Clennam.
1	“Oh, Pierre!” says the distressed lady; “would that I could shake off these painful thoughts.”--“Try, ma’am, try,” says the faithful servant; “rouse yourself, ma’am; be amused.”--“I will,” says the lady, “I will learn to suffer with fortitude.
1	To be sure, how the neighbourhood poured into court that afternoon while the cause was on!
1	It was a busy day; and night came on, and found them wondering that there was yet so much to do, and that it should be dark so soon.
1	Another knock, and still no answer.
1	The walls were ornamented with the choicest specimens of French paper, enriched with a gilded cornice of elegant design.
1	Allow me to catch you round the neck.
1	This position I continued to occupy during the whole interview, and from it I now saw Mr. and Miss Murdstone enter the room.
1	The schoolmeasther agin all England.
1	The other had that likeness too--as you have--but was not the same.
1	It was not exactly a hairdresser’s; that is to say, people of a coarse and vulgar turn of mind might have called it a barber’s; for they not only cut and curled ladies elegantly, and children carefully, but shaved gentlemen easily.
1	I knew his voice very well.
1	But Biddy said she was, and she said it decisively.
1	Nod away at him, Mr. Pip; that's what he likes.
1	“My own doing,” said Wemmick.
1	Wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket, and don't cry into your gruel; that's a very foolish action, Oliver.'
1	You can come at night.
1	It was unnecessary caution surely, and might have defeated itself.
1	The deficient buttons on his plaid frock had evidently been supplied from one of Mr. Jellyby's coats, they were so extremely brazen and so much too large.
1	If I did not feel this, and know, besides, that a changed behaviour in one she loved would break her heart, I should not feel my task so difficult of performance, or have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom, when I take what seems to me to be the strict line of duty.'
1	Mr. C. desires to be near his professional adviser, and I am far from objecting, for I court inquiry."
1	Oliver's vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in question, rendered this occurance highly probable.
1	‘What will you do?’ she asked him.
1	But all is over with me on earth, and this must be an Angel.
1	All is for her sake.
1	He found a pleasure in setting up Blandois as the type of elegance, and making him a satire upon others who piqued themselves on personal graces.
1	And Valentine," said Scrooge, "and his wild brother, Orson; there they go!
1	I know my cue; smart is the word.
1	A few faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us, but none came out.
1	I don't suppose there's a move on the board that would surprise ME, and as to this or that move having taken place, why my knowing it is no odds at all, any possible move whatever (provided it's in a wrong direction) being a probable move according to my experience.
1	He has no idea of the value of money.
1	The simple circumstance of being left alone with her husband and Mr. Bounderby, was sufficient to stun this admirable lady again without collision between herself and any other fact.
1	‘That done my Em’ly good,’ he resumed, after such emotion as I could not behold without sharing in; and as to my aunt, she wept with all her heart; ‘that done Em’ly good, and she begun to mend.
1	I thought he said as much?’ ‘The chances are very small, young lady—next to nothing—for a man who gets a bad name among them.’ ‘What shall I understand that you mean by a bad name?’ ‘The name of being troublesome.’ ‘Then, by the prejudices of his own class, and by the prejudices of the other, he is sacrificed alike?
1	We never make company of you.
1	There, he left his Principal alone; to wonder, as he rode away, how many thousand Plornishes there might be within a day or two’s journey of the Circumlocution Office, playing sundry curious variations on the same tune, which were not known by ear in that glorious institution.
1	Wonderful!” “It's a terrible thing, Joe; it ain't true.” “What are you telling of, Pip?” cried Joe, falling back in the greatest amazement.
1	But, on hearing from my aunt that I should sometimes come over on a Saturday, and that he could sometimes come and see me on a Wednesday, he revived; and vowed to make another kite for those occasions, of proportions greatly surpassing the present one.
1	In the miserable night he thought of it; in the dreary day, the wretched dawn, the ghostly, memory-haunted twilight.
1	The worst class of sum worked in the every-day world is cyphered by the diseased arithmeticians who are always in the rule of Subtraction as to the merits and successes of others, and never in Addition as to their own.
1	‘The usual thing!’ observed Doyce.
1	At nineteen, his hand had inscribed in chalk on that part of the wall which fronted her lodgings, on the occasion of her birthday, ‘Welcome sweet nursling of the Fairies!’ At twenty-three, the same hand falteringly presented cigars on Sundays to the Father of the Marshalsea, and Father of the queen of his soul.
1	‘A boy that can knock my door down,’ said Mrs MacStinger, contemptuously, ‘can get over that, I should hope!’ But Walter, taking this as a permission to enter, and getting over it, Mrs MacStinger immediately demanded whether an Englishwoman’s house was her castle or not; and whether she was to be broke in upon by ‘raff.’ On these subjects her thirst for information was still very importunate, when Walter, having made his way up the little staircase through an artificial fog occasioned by the washing, which covered the banisters with a clammy perspiration, entered Captain Cuttle’s room, and found that gentleman in ambush behind the door.
1	Very good.’ ‘And I do declare,’ cried Nicholas, with honest enthusiasm, ‘that in this effort I am influenced by no selfish or personal considerations, but by pity for her, and detestation and abhorrence of this scheme; and that I would do the same, were there twenty rivals in the field, and I the last and least favoured of them all.’ ‘You would, I believe,’ said Newman.
1	‘You won’t run so gaily to your old shabby home, my girl.
1	But he was sleeping soundly, and she softly withdrew.
1	'What the devil made you stand lingering there, in the wet?'
1	‘I hope they may become so,’ replied Mr. Pickwick.
1	He made quite a sister of me.
1	This wretched life, my love, of daily labour and fatigue, is more than you can bear, I am sure it is.
1	I hope, Mrs Dombey,’ he continued, after a few moments, during which, in his increasing haughtiness, he had improved on his idea, ‘I may not find it necessary ever to entrust Mr Carker with any message of objection or remonstrance to you; but as it would be derogatory to my position and reputation to be frequently holding trivial disputes with a lady upon whom I have conferred the highest distinction that it is in my power to bestow, I shall not scruple to avail myself of his services if I see occasion.’ ‘And now,’ he thought, rising in his moral magnificence, and rising a stiffer and more impenetrable man than ever, ‘she knows me and my resolution.’ The hand that had so pressed the bracelet was laid heavily upon her breast, but she looked at him still, with an unaltered face, and said in a low voice: ‘Wait!
1	Cordial farewells were exchanged, and the party separated.
1	‘Mum, sir, even here--my meaning, sir, exactly.’ ‘YOUR meaning exactly, you brazen scarecrow,--what’s your meaning?’ retorted Quilp.
1	I had often passed it before, during my residence in that neighbourhood, though never when I could choose another road.
1	It was very extraordinary that she should come, under such circumstances.’ Not feeling quite so sure of that, Nicholas thought it best to hold his peace.
1	“--At the back, there's a pig, and there are fowls and rabbits; then, I knock together my own little frame, you see, and grow cucumbers; and you'll judge at supper what sort of a salad I can raise.
1	I have often thought, since, what an odd, innocent, out-of-the-way kind of wedding it must have been!
1	‘The natural curiosity which forms the sole ornament of my professional museum,’ he resumes, ‘hereupon desires his Secretary--an individual of the hermit-crab or oyster species, and whose name, I think, is Chokesmith--but it doesn’t in the least matter--say Artichoke--to put himself in communication with Lizzie Hexam.
1	It was a chill dark autumn evening, and Captain Cuttle had ordered a fire to be kindled in the little back parlour, now more than ever like the cabin of a ship.
1	The lady happened to bend forward at the same time, and my uncle thought she looked more beautiful than she had done yet.
1	However, as he was plainly determined to be angry with her if she so much as asked him how he was, she only ventured to kiss his cheek, before accompanying him to Mrs Merdle’s with an anxious heart.
1	Mr. Wopsle, indeed, wildly cried out, “No!” with the feeble malice of a tired man; but, as he had no theory, and no coat on, he was unanimously set at naught,--not to mention his smoking hard behind, as he stood with his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp out: which was not calculated to inspire confidence.
1	And now the question is,’ proceeded Fledgeby, with the greatest reluctance, ‘will you have another egg?’ ‘No, I won’t,’ said Lammle, shortly.
1	The draggling ends of a bright-red neckerchief were then disclosed, and he had even been at the pains of dipping parts of it in some liquid, to give it the appearance of having become stained by wear.
1	It would be a wonder if I did not, being by the Chris’en name of Roger, which took it arter my own father, which took it from his own father, though which of our fam’ly fust took it nat’ral I will not in any ways mislead you by undertakin’ to say.
1	"It would be useless self-distress and torment to reckon up such chances and possibilities.
1	You know what I mean as well as any man."
1	without getting to the second, now burst forward, drew the ruler from his breast (apparently as a defensive weapon), and produced from his pocket a foolscap document, folded in the form of a large letter.
1	‘I had hoped it might not be so bad,’ he said: ‘but I had feared a heavy loss there, knowing the connection between her husband and the defaulter.’ ‘Yes.
1	Really, constable, you know," says Mr. Snagsby wistfully, and coughing behind his hand his cough of great perplexity and doubt, "really, that does seem a question.
1	It happened on one occasion, when he was doing me the honour of talking to me in the playground, that I hazarded the observation that something or somebody--I forget what now--was like something or somebody in Peregrine Pickle.
1	He then gravely repaired to another table, where his sister sat herself at her desk.
1	I am sure you would!’ said Florence.
1	"It was a great change from Captain Swosser to Professor Dingo," she resumed with a plaintive smile.
1	There is a tie of many suffering years between us two, and it is the only tie I ever had on earth that Chancery has not broken!"
1	How trifling all that had been occupying his time and thoughts for many weeks seemed to him during that sleepless night, and how constantly and incessantly present to his imagination was the one idea that Kate in the midst of some great trouble and distress might even then be looking--and vainly too--for him!
1	‘Now, Dombey,’ says the Major, ‘I am a man of the world.
1	Why was it so worrying to me to have her in our house, and confidential to me every night, when I yet felt that it was better and safer somehow that she should be there than anywhere else?
1	After looking at the surrounding objects for assurance that he was not in an odd dream, and after pacing a little while before the house, Arthur knocked at the door.
1	‘Have you anything to tell me?’ ‘To tell you, lady lass!’ replied the Captain, meeting her eyes in confusion.
1	‘Well, and how are you my buck?’ said Mr Chuckster, taking a stool.
1	Barnacle Junior, however, was announced as a lesser star, yet visible above the office horizon.
1	I lost everything, and had a sharp struggle for my life, weak as I was.’ ‘Did you get the parties punished?’ asked Pleasant.
1	Bar was there, and in full force.
1	I was about to observe that I again behold the serene spot where some of the happiest hours of my existence fleeted by.’ ‘Made so, I am sure, by Mrs. Micawber,’ said I.
1	And he further sees at that board (this he announces with pomp, as if exulting in the powers of an extraordinary telescope) his friend Mr Fledgeby, if he will permit him to call him so.
1	Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and delicate, and difficult to penetrate.
1	How she got it out, in her muffled state, Heaven knows; but she got it out somehow--there it was--and slipped it through the Secretary’s.
1	Also, the spoon is not generally used over-hand, but under.
1	I turned at the door, and he was still looking hard at me, while the two vile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open, and to force out of their swollen throats, “O, what a man he is!” Wemmick was out, and though he had been at his desk he could have done nothing for me.
1	Good money!’ Jeremiah picked the bill up, looked at the total with a bloodshot eye, took a small canvas bag from his pocket, and told the amount into his hand.
1	Then Kit began to wish they had not been quite so nimble; for the travelling-carriage which had been hired for the occasion was not to arrive until nine o’clock, and there was nothing but breakfast to fill up the intervening blank of one hour and a half.
1	Nor did the appearance of this unexpected visitor occasion the least embarrassment, (save in Kate, and that only to the extent of a blush or two at first,) for the old gentleman was so kind and cordial, and the young gentleman imitated him in this respect so well, that the usual stiffness and formality of a first meeting showed no signs of appearing, and Kate really more than once detected herself in the very act of wondering when it was going to begin.
1	I have told her so.
1	Speak.’ ‘Why, if you will have it, miss, it’s this,’ said the servant girl.
1	The man saw that the recognition was mutual, and beckoning to Ralph to take his former place under the tree, and not to stand in the falling rain, of which, in his first surprise, he had been quite regardless, addressed him in a hoarse, faint tone.
1	He is going towards the door with a candle in his hand when a knock comes.
1	The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent down, and he was very busy.
1	You have been dreaming.’ ‘My dear brother:’ she laid her head down on his pillow, and her hair flowed over him as if she would hide him from every one but herself: ‘is there nothing that you have to tell me?
1	'Pop that shawl away in my castor, Dodger, so that I may know where to find it when I cut; that's the time of day!
1	But never mind that at prethent.’ There was another silence; and then she exclaimed, sobbing with her hands before her face, ‘Oh, give me my clothes, give me my clothes, and let me go away before I break my heart!’ The women sadly bestirred themselves to get the clothes together—it was soon done, for they were not many—and to pack them in a basket which had often travelled with them.
1	I should wish to hear what accusation Towlinson can make!’ ‘Surely you must know, Louisa,’ observed Mr Dombey, ‘that I don’t question your natural devotion to, and regard for, the future head of my house.’ ‘I am glad to hear it, Paul,’ said Mrs Chick; ‘but really you are very odd, and sometimes talk very strangely, though without meaning it, I know.
1	And Veneering, M.P., how are things going on down at the house, and when will you turn out those terrible people for us?
1	‘This, at least, is the light, my dear Mr. Copperfield,’ pursued Mrs. Micawber, ‘in which I view the subject.
1	What Julia calls ‘society’, I see; among it Mr. Jack Maldon, from his Patent Place, sneering at the hand that gave it him, and speaking to me of the Doctor as ‘so charmingly antique’.
1	Mr Dombey, in the plenitude of his power, asked me--I had it from his own lips yesterday morning--to be his go-between to you, because he knows I am not agreeable to you, and because he intends that I shall be a punishment for your contumacy; and besides that, because he really does consider, that I, his paid servant, am an ambassador whom it is derogatory to the dignity--not of the lady to whom I have the happiness of speaking; she has no existence in his mind--but of his wife, a part of himself, to receive.
1	I will hear no more of the very genteel lady; I will hear no more of you.
1	No, but she knew where the school was.
1	It ain’t because I don’t love you.
1	saw again, which has long been engraven on my heart.
1	‘We have no Faith in the dear old Barons, who were the most delightful creatures--or in the dear old Priests, who were the most warlike of men--or even in the days of that inestimable Queen Bess, upon the wall there, which were so extremely golden.
1	At last I find it.
1	She took the place of eldest of the three, in all things but precedence; was the head of the fallen family; and bore, in her own heart, its anxieties and shames.
1	‘Never in my life,’ replied the cobbler.
1	I owe so much to him.
1	And now I can breathe again at last!’ Doyce darted in from behind the door, caught Arthur by both hands, and said the rest for himself.
1	He soon fell into a gentle doze, from which he was awakened by the light of a candle:  which, being brought near the bed, showed him a gentleman with a very large and loud-ticking gold watch in his hand, who felt his pulse, and said he was a great deal better.
1	In both, there were several knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with a manifest sense of power enthroned on their distress.
1	“She says many hard things of you, but you say nothing of her.
1	The greater the accumulation of deceit and trouble in the world, the brighter and the purer shone the star of Dora high above the world.
1	At the garden-gate of one of these he stopped, and Harriet alighted.
1	Mr. Bumble resigned his cup without another word; squeezed Mrs. Corney's little finger as she took it; and inflicting two open-handed slaps upon his laced waistcoat, gave a mighty sigh, and hitched his chair a very little morsel farther from the fire.
1	"You're a friend in need.
1	think of all I have given up, only this one night, for you.
1	Where’s your more than mother?
1	We sat in the dark for some time, breathless.
1	Who knows that better than I do?’ ‘Nothing will turn me from it, Flintwinch, when I have justified it to myself.
1	‘The fact is,’ began Bradley, with a mouth so dry that he had some difficulty in articulating his words: the consciousness of which rendered his manner still more ungainly and undecided; ‘the truth is, that Charley, having no secrets from me (to the best of my belief), has confided the whole of this matter to me.’ He came to a stop, and Lizzie asked: ‘what matter, sir?’ ‘I thought,’ returned the schoolmaster, stealing another look at her, and seeming to try in vain to sustain it; for the look dropped as it lighted on her eyes, ‘that it might be so superfluous as to be almost impertinent, to enter upon a definition of it.
1	And how shows this recreant conduct in a man on whom unequal laws are known to have fallen heavy?
1	Without entering into further explanations, I may repeat that the idol is down.
1	It was pleasant to observe that Mrs. Wemmick no longer unwound Wemmick's arm when it adapted itself to her figure, but sat in a high-backed chair against the wall, like a violoncello in its case, and submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have done.
1	‘I shall leave this here room, sir, just precisely at the wery same moment as you leaves it,’ responded Sam, speaking in a forcible manner, and seating himself with perfect gravity.
1	Don’t ask how;--we may regain it, and a great deal more;--but tell nobody, or trouble may come of it.
1	‘Do you recollect anything particular happening on the morning when you were first engaged by the defendant; eh, Mr. Weller?’ said Serjeant Buzfuz.
1	‘You are very kind,’ said Carker, ‘I shall be delighted to know them.
1	twenty years.” “At that time--I may ask, at what time, sir?” “I speak, miss, of twenty years ago.
1	I must clear my unfortunate partner’s reputation.
1	I ha’ seen an’ spok’n wi’ yor son, one night.
1	The sea had ebbed and flowed, through a whole year.
1	And now the rest of the company, highly excited and interested, always excepting Bishop, who had not the slightest idea that anything was going on, formed in one group round the fire in the next drawing-room, and pretended to be chatting easily on the infinite variety of small topics, while everybody’s thoughts and eyes were secretly straying towards the secluded pair.
1	‘Why, will it never stop, Floy?’ he would sometimes ask her.
1	‘And really,’ added Mr. Pickwick, after half an hour’s walking had brought them to the village, ‘really, for a misanthrope’s choice, this is one of the prettiest and most desirable places of residence I ever met with.’ In this opinion also, both Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass expressed their concurrence; and having been directed to the Leather Bottle, a clean and commodious village ale-house, the three travellers entered, and at once inquired for a gentleman of the name of Tupman.
1	‘I have noticed,’ said he; ‘—my name is Tartar.’ Neville inclined his head.
1	Does the thought-contracted brow of the local Sage or the lustrous eye of local Beauty inquire whose fortunes?
1	Shall I tell them to go away?’ ‘No,’ said Newman, rising.
1	I have never been in the way of learning compliments myself, and I don’t profess to understand the art of paying ’em.
1	‘You can easily have been kept away by business, and must not return till nearly midnight.’ ‘Then he will come straight here,’ retorted Newman.
1	Show what clothes you have brought, and what money, and say that I will send some more money.
1	Mr. John Jasper.’ ‘Has he a calling, good gentleman?’ ‘Calling?
1	But if you, being so full of learning, Mas’r Davy, could think of anything to say as might bring her to believe I wasn’t greatly hurt: still loving of her, and mourning for her: anything as might bring her to believe as I was not tired of my life, and yet was hoping fur to see her without blame, wheer the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest--anything as would ease her sorrowful mind, and yet not make her think as I could ever marry, or as ‘twas possible that anyone could ever be to me what she was--I should ask of you to say that--with my prayers for her--that was so dear.’ I pressed his manly hand again, and told him I would charge myself to do this as well as I could.
1	The sound was too much for Mr Mantalini.
1	Nor could I help bestowing many sorrowful thoughts upon the simple warriors whose hands and hearts were set there, in all truth and honesty; and who only learned in course of time from white men how to break their faith, and quibble out of forms and bonds.
1	‘This is a pollis case, is it?
1	You can go.’ Walter passed out at the door, and was about to close it after him, when, hearing the voices of the brothers again, and also the mention of his own name, he stood irresolutely, with his hand upon the lock, and the door ajar, uncertain whether to return or go away.
1	It gave you the face-ache to look at his apples, the stomach-ache to look at his oranges, the tooth-ache to look at his nuts.
1	“I have done my best for you, Mr. Darnay; and my best is as good as another man's, I believe.” It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, “Much better,” Mr. Lorry said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested object of squeezing himself back again.
1	No attempt at defiance being made, however, her face gradually relaxed, and became so pleasant, that I was emboldened to kiss and thank her; which I did with great heartiness, and with both my arms clasped round her neck.
1	Beyond a general impression of the distance before me, and of the young man with the donkey-cart having used me cruelly, I think I had no very urgent sense of my difficulties when I once again set off with my ninepence in my pocket.
1	"Oh, Esther, you would never guess!"
1	It’s no use my lagging on so far behind it.
1	Who’ll be made the fool of there, I wonder, to begin with--eh, Peg?’ Mrs. Sliderskew appeared to approve highly of this ingenious scheme, and expressed her satisfaction by various rackings and twitchings of her head and body, which by no means enhanced her charms.
1	To which Mrs Milvey added, taking thought for him, like the championing little wife she was; ‘Oh yes, detained at the last moment.
1	and Mrs. Crummles!’ or saw a little boy run back to stare them in the face, the severe expression of their countenances relaxed, for they felt it was popularity.
1	To whom Stephen made his obeisance, closing the door and standing near it, with his hat in his hand.
1	My uncle woke, rubbed his eyes, and jumped up in astonishment.
1	I should rather think I did.
1	"Indeed I am, my Lady.
1	But Oliver's thoughts, like those of most other people, although they were extremely ready and active to point out his difficulties, were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of surmounting them; so, after a good deal of thinking to no particular purpose, he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder, and trudged on.
1	After some helpless casting about, Mike brightened and began again:-- “He is dressed like a 'spectable pieman.
1	How CAN you ask such goose’s questions?’ ‘Do you regret anything, my love?’ ‘Regret anything?
1	Make haste down, and come out.
1	We began badly, and went on worse.
1	I took the indentures out of his hand and gave them to Miss Havisham.
1	I went forth last night on compulsion, and I learnt a lesson which is working now.
1	The Doctor sat in his study chair, covering his face with his hands.
1	We proceeded without a word being spoken.
1	Mr. Giles, seizing the boy by one leg and one arm (fortunately not the broken limb) lugged him straight into the hall, and deposited him at full length on the floor thereof.
1	I never see such a chap to eat and drink-- never.
1	“Yes, there!” “Where is he?” He crammed what little food was left, into the breast of his gray jacket.
1	‘Well then,’ replied Sir Mulberry, ‘I’m satisfied.
1	What have they done with my work?
1	He was dressed in a smartly-cut snuff-coloured coat, with large brass buttons; an orange neckerchief; a coarse, staring, shawl-pattern waistcoat; and drab breeches.
1	‘By George, you are right, Gowan.
1	Will you mind it, if I say something very, very silly?---more than usual?’ inquired Dora, peeping over my shoulder into my face.
1	"When she went from here, she went right away nor'ard by the high road.
1	Hot blood, hot blood.’ And the little man took a warning pinch, and shook his head doubtfully.
1	The girl drew closer to the table, and made no offer to leave the room, although she could see that Monks was pointing to her.
1	‘I would rather not ask, but the question is imposed upon me.
1	The topic is fraught with such danger to the bonnet, that Miss Lavinia gives another little scream, and begs me to understand that Dora is only to be looked at, and on no account to be touched.
1	I put such questions to Mr. Wopsle as, When did the man come in?
1	All men are not gifted alike.
1	‘No, indeed,’ returned his daughter.
1	‘Who is it?’ asked Louisa.
1	‘Post-mark, Strand, black wax, black border, woman’s hand, C. N. in the corner.’ ‘Black wax?’ said Mr. Nickleby, glancing at the letter.
1	Mr. Jinks looked serious instantly.
1	“It will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this moment,” said Madame Defarge.
1	Mr friend Mr Bounderby could never see any difference between leaving the Coketown ‘hands’ exactly as they were, and requiring them to be fed with turtle soup and venison out of gold spoons.
1	That's all I know,' said Sikes.
1	‘--K. then positively refused to sign.
1	Mew says the cat, Quack quack says the duck, and Bow-wow-wow says the dog.” I couldn’t tell you how it come into my head or where from, but it had so much the sound of a rasper that I own to you it astonished myself.
1	‘For Heaven’s sake, Affery,’ whispered Clennam, as she opened the door for him in the dark hall, and he groped his way to the sight of the night-sky, ‘what is going on here?’ Her own appearance was sufficiently ghastly, standing in the dark with her apron thrown over her head, and speaking behind it in a low, deadened voice.
1	‘No, sir,’ said Mr Meagles, shaking his head ruefully.
1	No; sight more unwonted still--there is a butterfly in the square--a real, live butterfly!
1	If not today, why then tomorrow.’ ‘And Emily?’ said Agnes and I, both together.
1	It was not that he looked many years older, though still dressed with the old scrupulous cleanliness; or that there was an unwholesome ruddiness upon his face; or that his eyes were full and bloodshot; or that there was a nervous trembling in his hand, the cause of which I knew, and had for some years seen at work.
1	‘Painfully aware, Miss Dorrit, I am sure,’ said Flora, ‘that to propose an adjournment to any place to one so far removed by fortune and so courted and caressed by the best society must ever appear intruding even if not a pie-shop far below your present sphere and a back-parlour though a civil man but if for the sake of Arthur--cannot overcome it more improper now than ever late Doyce and Clennam--one last remark I might wish to make one last explanation I might wish to offer perhaps your good nature might excuse under pretence of three kidney ones the humble place of conversation.’ Rightly interpreting this rather obscure speech, Little Dorrit returned that she was quite at Flora’s disposition.
1	With Hope, Joy, Youth, Peace, Rest, Life, Dust, Ashes, Waste, Want, Ruin, Despair, Madness, Death, Cunning, Folly, Words, Wigs, Rags, Sheepskin, Plunder, Precedent, Jargon, Gammon, and Spinach!"
1	‘And yet you took it very much to heart,’ said Bella.
1	"It is fifty years old."
1	“Is who dead, dear boy?” “Compeyson.” “He hopes I am, if he's alive, you may be sure,” with a fierce look.
1	We found Miss Jellyby trying to warm herself at the fire in the writing-room, which Priscilla was then lighting with a smutty parlour candlestick, throwing the candle in to make it burn better.
1	He has taken the matter so much to heart that he has remonstrated (in my presence he remonstrated) with Mr Eugene Wrayburn, if that be the name.
1	'No,' replied Mr. Limbkins; 'at least, as it's a nasty business, we think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered.'
1	You ought to see it out, and I won’t leave you.
1	Miss Mills alone could enter into my feelings thoroughly.
1	Sawyer!’ exclaimed the old lady, starting.
1	If, as he folds the handkerchief and carefully puts it up, it were able with an enchanted power to bring before him the place where she found it and the night-landscape near the cottage where it covered the little child, would he descry her there?
1	The family name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no other.” The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be lighted.
1	When I looked round, I could see the other lights coming in after us.
1	When you told me your own story, you told me plainly that you began adoring her the first time you saw her, when you were very young indeed.” “Very well, then,” said I, to whom this was a new and not unwelcome light, “I have never left off adoring her.
1	It was--what lasting reason have I to remember it!--a cold, harsh, winter day.
1	It shall and must be spoken.
1	‘Ah!’ replied Mr. Lillyvick, with another groan; this time not even disguised by a wheeze.
1	‘This fellow,’ said Mr Carker to Polly, giving him a gentle shake, ‘is your son, eh, Ma’am?’ ‘Yes, Sir,’ sobbed Polly, with a curtsey; ‘yes, Sir.’ ‘A bad son, I am afraid?’ said Mr Carker.
1	she said on a sudden.
1	The Secretary lost no time in getting to work, and his vigilance and method soon set their mark on the Golden Dustman’s affairs.
1	It would be a poor thing to gratify a prejudice against him.
1	‘Before I knew what to do, or whether I could do anything, there was a second conversation between the same two brothers, in which their sister was mentioned.
1	When we stood still, he got opposite to him, and drawing his hand across and across his open mouth with a curious expression of a sense of power, and turning up his eyes, and lowering his grey eyebrows until they appeared to be shut, seemed to scan every lineament of his face.
1	Defer this marriage for a week.
1	I would transact your business with people in your pay or employment.
1	‘Ay, I know that,’ was the reply; ‘but I have been very anxious to be at my journey’s end, and that makes the way seem long.’ ‘Well,’ remarked the coachman, ‘if the way seemed long with such cattle as you’ve sat behind, you MUST have been most uncommon anxious;’ and so saying, he let out his whip-lash and touched up a little boy on the calves of his legs by way of emphasis.
1	I reply, 'My growling friend, I DON'T defend them, but they are very agreeable to me.
1	Looking at the Jury and the turbulent audience, he might have thought that the usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were trying the honest men.
1	Florence, more agitated, paced her room; and paced the gallery outside; and looked out at the night, blurred and wavy with the raindrops on the glass, and the tears in her own eyes; and looked up at the hurry in the sky, so different from the repose below, and yet so tranquil and solitary.
1	‘And what is your name, my pale child?’ said Lady Skettles.
1	Would Mr Abel part with me, Sir, or is there anybody that could be fonder of the garden, ma’am?
1	‘Pray, go on, sir--disgraceful and rascally proceedings, I think you said?’ ‘I did,’ said Mr. Pickwick, thoroughly roused.
1	‘Well, ma’am,’ resumed Bounderby, ‘under these circumstances, I imagine it would not be agreeable to a character like yours to remain here, though you would be very welcome here.’ ‘Oh, dear no, sir, I could on no account think of that!’ Mrs. Sparsit shook her head, still in her highly superior manner, and a little changed the small cough—coughing now, as if the spirit of prophecy rose within her, but had better be coughed down.
1	As they turned back, Mr. Pickwick’s eye fell upon a small broken stone, partially buried in the ground, in front of a cottage door.
1	A Barnacle (assisted by a Barnacle) married the happy pair, and it behoved Lord Decimus Tite Barnacle himself to conduct Mrs Meagles to breakfast.
1	Mr and Mrs Lammle’s house in Sackville Street, Piccadilly, was but a temporary residence.
1	I am glad to think I have been the instrument of good to Mr. Wickfield, and that I may be more so.
1	‘But Mr. Nickleby pressed so much, sir--’ The fact was, that Ralph Nickleby had bribed the man, who, being anxious to earn his money with a view to future favours, held the door in his hand, and ventured to linger still.
1	Suddenly she arose; and hurrying on, in a direction quite opposite to that in which Sikes was awaiting her returned, quickened her pace, until it gradually resolved into a violent run.
1	‘My dear,’ assented her eminently practical parent, ‘quite true, quite true.’ ‘Why, father,’ she pursued, ‘what a strange question to ask _me_!
1	So unmatched were they, and opposed, so forced and linked together by a chain which adverse hazard and mischance had forged: that fancy might have imagined the pictures on the walls around them, startled by the unnatural conjunction, and observant of it in their several expressions.
1	I half expect the real master to come home presently, and say he is glad to see me.
1	“What is to be done with you?
1	You know Lagnier, the gentleman.
1	Some hurried eagerly to catch a glimpse of the winning horse; others darted to and fro, searching, no less eagerly, for the carriages they had left in quest of better stations.
1	You are to understand that his second visit to Edinburgh was for his own pleasure.
1	This sound being taken up by the Minders, swelled into a rapturous trio which gave general satisfaction.
1	"My friend in the city, Mr. George, has done a little business with a pupil of yours."
1	"I beg your pardon, grandmother.
1	‘Permit your devoted servant, when you leave here, to escort you home.’ ‘Thank you: I am not going home.’ ‘Not going home!’ said Blandois.
1	He is a child--an absolute child.
1	My guardian asked him what he meant.
1	I wish you good night, sir.’ He comprehended everybody present, in the respectful bow with which he followed these words, and disappeared.
1	‘I give you joy, Mr Toots!’ says old Sol.
1	Not that so sweet a disposition and so sound a nature could ever go very wrong even among the great visiting authorities who agreed that the Boffins were ‘charmingly vulgar’ (which for certain was not their own case in saying so), but that when she made a slip on the social ice on which all the children of Podsnappery, with genteel souls to be saved, are required to skate in circles, or to slide in long rows, she inevitably tripped Miss Bella up (so that young lady felt), and caused her to experience great confusion under the glances of the more skilful performers engaged in those ice-exercises.
1	This is why it was, that, even as he sat before her on his sofa, in the brilliant light of a bright Italian day, the wonderful city without and the splendours of an old palace within, she saw him at the moment in the long-familiar gloom of his Marshalsea lodging, and wished to take her seat beside him, and comfort him, and be again full of confidence with him, and of usefulness to him.
1	It was so much, however, to her who received it, that she turned from Defarge to his wife, and kissed one of the hands that knitted.
1	Mr. Solomon Pell, finding that nothing more was going forward, either in the eating or drinking way, took a friendly leave, and Sam and his father were left alone.
1	Unnatural emotion in a child, innocent of wrong!
1	Mr. Guppy and Mr. Richard Carstone divide the dignity of the office.
1	Such was the posture of affairs when Mr. Mantalini hurried in; and as that distinguished specimen had had a pretty extensive intercourse with Mr. Scaley’s fraternity in his bachelor days, and was, besides, very far from being taken by surprise on the present agitating occasion, he merely shrugged his shoulders, thrust his hands down to the bottom of his pockets, elevated his eyebrows, whistled a bar or two, swore an oath or two, and, sitting astride upon a chair, put the best face upon the matter with great composure and decency.
1	When the gaoler was gone, he thought in the same wandering way, “Now am I left, as if I were dead.” Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he turned from it with a sick feeling, and thought, “And here in these crawling creatures is the first condition of the body after death.” “Five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half.” The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell, counting its measurement, and the roar of the city arose like muffled drums with a wild swell of voices added to them.
1	‘The greater necessity for coolness, for reason, for consideration, for thought,’ said Newman, pausing at every alternate word, to look anxiously in his friend’s face.
1	A considerable scuffling within ensued, but nothing else.
1	He had scarcely done so, when there was a great uproar in the street, and the old lady hurrying to the window cried that Whisker had run away, upon which Kit darted out to the rescue, and the others followed.
1	The sky was blue, the larks were soaring high over the green corn, I thought all that countryside more beautiful and peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet.
1	The object in hand being to show that the prisoner went down, with some fellow-plotter untracked, in the Dover mail on that Friday night in November five years ago, and got out of the mail in the night, as a blind, at a place where he did not remain, but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more, to a garrison and dockyard, and there collected information; a witness was called to identify him as having been at the precise time required, in the coffee-room of an hotel in that garrison-and-dockyard town, waiting for another person.
1	“Besides, the cook has always been a very nice respectful woman, and said in the most natural manner when she came to look after the situation, that she felt I was born to be a Duchess.” There was a sofa where Mr. Pocket stood, and he dropped upon it in the attitude of the Dying Gladiator.
1	‘My sweetest Edith!’ cries an agitated voice upon the stairs.
1	Its deep fidelity and goodness were not to be adorned by me or any man.
1	"I want five hundred pound."
1	‘Is there room for me?’ said I.
1	I see you are going back to it,’ returned Clennam, wondering why.
1	This is idle talk.” So strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange his fixed look when he had ceased to speak, that Darnay felt his own hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it.
1	I am a honest man, that’s what I am.
1	Can I be so weak as to imagine that Mr. Micawber, wielding the rod of talent and of power in Australia, will be nothing in England?
1	Merely making a sign to a man at the bar, Fagin walked straight upstairs, and opening the door of a room, and softly insinuating himself into the chamber, looked anxiously about: shading his eyes with his hand, as if in search of some particular person.
1	‘There seems to have been tempestuous weather, Mr Gills, and she has probably been driven out of her course.’ ‘She is safe, I trust in Heaven!’ said old Sol.
1	‘How is your ward?’ asked Jasper, after a time, in a faint, fatigued voice.
1	Ham would bring Emily at the usual hour.
1	‘It is but one room you see.
1	When Mr. Bumble had scrupulously examined the coins, to see that they were genuine, and had put them up, with much satisfaction, in his waistcoat-pocket, he went on: 'Carry your memory back--let me see--twelve years, last winter.'
1	Eventually, however, they stumbled upon two small rooms up three pair of stairs, or rather two pair and a ladder, at a tobacconist’s shop, on the Common Hard: a dirty street leading down to the dockyard.
1	Prejudiced, I never have been otherwise than in favour of the United States.
1	But she had been in a condition of greatly increased suspicion and distrust, ever since the marriage; for, like most persons of her quality of mind, who form a strong and sincere attachment to one in the different station which Florence occupied, Susan was very jealous, and her jealousy naturally attached to Edith, who divided her old empire, and came between them.
1	‘Coketown, sir,’ said Bounderby, obstinately taking a chair, ‘is not the kind of place you have been accustomed to.
1	By the powerful old gentleman’s aid, even a hackney-coach gets over half a mile of ground.
1	He sat down, a little disconcerted by my presence, I thought, and without looking at me, drew his heavy sunburnt hand across and across his upper lip.
1	“That's the name for a thousand pound!” cried Jerry.
1	‘You know I have had losses, and am poorer than I used to be.
1	The only difference between us and the professors of virtue or benevolence, or philanthropy—never mind the name—is, that we know it is all meaningless, and say so; while they know it equally and will never say so.’ Why should she be shocked or warned by this reiteration?
1	And still Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer and nearer.
1	In those times a bed was always to be got there at any hour of the night, and the chamberlain, letting me in at his ready wicket, lighted the candle next in order on his shelf, and showed me straight into the bedroom next in order on his list.
1	How Mr. Winkle, instead of shooting at the Pigeon and killing the Crow, shot at the Crow and wounded the Pigeon; how the Dingley Dell Cricket Club played All-Muggleton, and how All- Muggleton dined at the Dingley Dell Expense; with other interesting and instructive Matters 8.
1	Less given to detail are the beggars who make sporting ventures.
1	Where is Tim Linkinwater?--for nothing at all, my dear brother, for nothing at all.’ ‘Perhaps it would be better to say something, brother Ned,’ suggested the other, mildly; ‘it would help to preserve habits of frugality, you know, and remove any painful sense of overwhelming obligations.
1	The same Mr. Crisparkle knows under my hand that I have devoted myself to the murderer’s discovery and destruction, be he whom he might, and that I determined to discuss the mystery with no one until I should hold the clue in which to entangle the murderer as in a net.
1	"I have no capital myself, but my mother has a little property which takes the form of an annuity"--here Mr. Guppy's mother rolled her head as if she never could sufficiently enjoy the observation, and put her handkerchief to her mouth, and again winked at me--"and a few pounds for expenses out of pocket in conducting business will never be wanting, free of interest, which is an advantage, you know," said Mr. Guppy feelingly.
1	Somehow, as I wrote to Agnes on a fine evening by my open window, and the remembrance of her clear calm eyes and gentle face came stealing over me, it shed such a peaceful influence upon the hurry and agitation in which I had been living lately, and of which my very happiness partook in some degree, that it soothed me into tears.
1	I should require to be crammed, sir.’ ‘I beg your pardon,’ interposed Nicholas, doubtful whether he had heard aright.
1	I see, as plain as plain can be, that your way is not ours, and that even if father could be got to forgive your taking it (which he never could be), that way of yours would be darkened by our way.
1	‘Thankee, sir, and good morning.’ Now, it happened that the gentleman, in his anxiety to impress upon Kit that he was not to tell anybody what had passed between them, followed him out to the door to repeat his caution, and it further happened that at that moment the eyes of Mr Richard Swiveller were turned in that direction, and beheld his mysterious friend and Kit together.
1	Here is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the moment; and I say, 'Uncle Scrooge!'"
1	He never misses a chance in his practice, which is a mark of respectability.
1	"My landlord, Krook," said the little old lady, condescending to him from her lofty station as she presented him to us.
1	They were close upon our heels; every man for himself, and each from the gallows!
1	Handsomer so, than any other woman in her best humour?’ ‘I tell you nothing,’ she returned, until you go back to that chair--except this, once again--Don’t come near me!
1	The two sons grew up as parsimonious as their sire.
1	He had insensibly acquired a new habit of shuffling into the picture-galleries, always with his twisted paper of snuff in his hand (much to the indignation of Miss Fanny, who had proposed the purchase of a gold box for him that the family might not be discredited, which he had absolutely refused to carry when it was bought); and of passing hours and hours before the portraits of renowned Venetians.
1	Mr. Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain, where suppliants for Mr. Jaggers's notice were lingering about as usual, and I returned to my watch in the street of the coach-office, with some three hours on hand.
1	Then why are we here, my friends?
1	We must make amends for this as soon as we can.
1	Kenge and Carboy are out of town, and the articled clerk has taken out a shooting license and gone down to his father's, and Mr. Guppy's two fellow-stipendiaries are away on leave.
1	Now I ask you, my dear sir, not only as your legal adviser, but as your very true friend, will you let slip the occasion of attaining all these objects, and doing all this good, for the paltry consideration of a few pounds finding their way into the pockets of a couple of rascals, to whom it makes no manner of difference, except that the more they gain, the more they’ll seek, and so the sooner be led into some piece of knavery that must end in a crash?
1	But, if you will please to see if my boatman is there, I shall be obliged to you.’ It left him no choice but to go down before them.
1	He found a likeness to his misfortune everywhere.
1	You are a credit to the school, and you will be a greater credit to it yet, and they will help you to get a living.
1	Rachael’s letter had gone, Rachael’s letter had been delivered.
1	When a man with the feelings of a gentleman finds himself engaged to a young lady, and it comes (even on the part of a member of the family) to vipers, you know!--I would merely put it to your own good feeling, you know,’ said Mr Sampson, in rather lame conclusion.
1	But now there was some cautious stir in the house; and Florence found that Mrs Pipchin had been awakened by one of those who sat up, had risen and had gone down to her father’s door.
1	‘I thought our good friend a little changed, and out of spirits, after he came this morning?’ said Clennam.
1	There was no rope-dancing for me; I danced on the bare ground and was larruped with the rope.’ Mr. Gradgrind, though hard enough, was by no means so rough a man as Mr. Bounderby.
1	But she never could, and she never did, find a phrase satisfactory to her perhaps-too-favourable estimate of my intellect.
1	‘I have communicated, both personally and by letter, with the club,’ resumed Mr. Pickwick, ‘acquainting them with my intention.
1	Those who had been kind to them, did not escape his search.
1	He stops hard by Waterloo Bridge and reads a playbill, decides to go to Astley's Theatre.
1	‘Do you see him here now?’ said the judge.
1	Behold him in pepper-and-salt pantaloons, with his watch-guard round his neck.
1	‘Now, gen’l’m’n, “fall on,” as the English said to the French when they fixed bagginets.’ It needed no second invitation to induce the party to yield full justice to the meal; and as little pressing did it require to induce Mr. Weller, the long gamekeeper, and the two boys, to station themselves on the grass, at a little distance, and do good execution upon a decent proportion of the viands.
1	Herbert would often come to Hammersmith when I was there, and I think at those seasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that the opening he was looking for, had not appeared yet.
1	Agnes and I were sitting by the fire, in our house in London, one night in spring, and three of our children were playing in the room, when I was told that a stranger wished to see me.
1	‘This is it, ain’t it?’ ‘Let me look,’ said Sam.
1	‘What next?’ The breakfast table at Mr Boffin’s was usually a very pleasant one, and was always presided over by Bella.
1	‘Say he dreamt it,’ replied Mr. Jingle coolly.
1	Now, when you take me in hand in my learning, Pip (and I tell you beforehand I am awful dull, most awful dull), Mrs. Joe mustn't see too much of what we're up to.
1	'I have saved you from being ill-used once, and I will again, and I do now,' continued the girl aloud; 'for those who would have fetched you, if I had not, would have been far more rough than me.
1	'Juries,' said Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane tightly, as was his wont when working into a passion: 'juries is ineddicated, vulgar, grovelling wretches.'
1	I’d do more by you than the rest of ‘em do, I fancy.’ ‘What would you do?’ he asked.
1	It was appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood in ignorance on the shore.
1	Mr. Bob Sawyer had himself purchased the spirits at a wine vaults in High Street, and had returned home preceding the bearer thereof, to preclude the possibility of their delivery at the wrong house.
1	'Fill this glass again,' he said, handing Mr. Bumble's empty tumbler to the landlord.
1	In the smaller public-houses, fiddles with all their might and main were squeaking out the tune to staggering feet; drunken men, oblivious of the burden of their song, joined in a senseless howl, which drowned the tinkling of the feeble bell and made them savage for their drink; vagabond groups assembled round the doors to see the stroller woman dance, and add their uproar to the shrill flageolet and deafening drum.
1	That gentleman, after looking at the table-cloth until the soul of the chief butler glowed with a noble resentment, went slowly up after the rest, and became of no account in the stream of people on the grand staircase.
1	‘Hollo, you fellow,’ said the angry Mr. Pickwick, ‘do you think we stole the horse?’ ‘I’m sure ye did,’ replied the red-headed man, with a grin which agitated his countenance from one auricular organ to the other.
1	Beautiful, elegant, accomplished, and powerful in her little world (for the world of fashion does not stretch ALL the way from pole to pole), her influence in Sir Leicester's house, however haughty and indifferent her manner, is greatly to improve it and refine it.
1	The Major gave her abundant opportunities of exhibiting this emotion: being profuse in his complaints, at dinner, of her desertion of him and Princess’s Place: and as he appeared to derive great enjoyment from making them, they all got on very well.
1	"You may read it in the whole room.
1	The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was destruction.
1	Remarkable documents,’ added the lawyer, raising his eyes to the ceiling, ‘most remarkable documents.
1	There is a light in each.
1	The strange man, after glancing at Joe, and seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me again when I had taken my seat, and then rubbed his leg--in a very odd way, as it struck me.
1	'Work'us,' said Noah, 'how's your mother?'
1	Whatever Mrs. Pardiggle said, Mr. Quale repeated to us; and just as he had drawn Mrs. Jellyby out, he drew Mrs. Pardiggle out.
1	Not that any one did, for Veneering, M.P., was always the authority for their being very rich, and perhaps believed it.
1	It began to rain, heavily, at the moment.
1	‘With Sir Barnet and his lady, I mean to say, Miss, and the young gentleman.
1	The other man, whom his companion had called Isaac, was of a more slender figure--stooping, and high in the shoulders--with a very ill-favoured face, and a most sinister and villainous squint.
1	That part of the world is at a safe distance.’ ‘Say here, then,’ rejoins the other, rising in a fury.
1	He was quick enough to observe; he had a good memory, and did not forget a word of the brother’s revelations.
1	For I was so little inclined to sleep myself that night that I sat up working.
1	How could I be unmindful of it, when I thought of you?’ ‘There is nothing,’ cried her friend, ‘no, nothing innocent or good, that dies, and is forgotten.
1	He was still more astonished to find that this firmness lasted; and that, under all the care and watching which ensued, Mrs. Maylie was ever ready and collected: performing all the duties which had devolved upon her, steadily, and, to all external appearances, even cheerfully.
1	Then, as I looked up at it, while it dripped, it seemed to my oppressed conscience like a phantom devoting me to the Hulks.
1	He stops there, looks round, and beckons Jo.
1	"Now, mademoiselle," repeats Mr. Bucket, making no demonstration except with the finger, "you sit down upon that sofy."
1	I could feel the muscles of the thin arm round my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her.
1	This was only for a moment; for Agnes softly said to him, ‘Papa!
1	His cursed life is not his own!” At the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd, which another instant would have brought upon him, the postmaster turned his horse into the yard, the escort rode in close upon his horse's flanks, and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates.
1	indeed, indeed!’ ‘Yes, and being practical people, a result has gradually sprung up in the minds of Mrs Meagles and myself which perhaps you may--or perhaps you may not--understand.
1	After a brief reflection, he called a hack-cabriolet, and bade the man drive towards Bethnal Green.
1	Shall we go away that morning, and stay in Kent until we go on board at Gravesend within a week?’ ‘If you please, Walter.
1	The register signed, and the fees paid, and the pew-opener (whose cough was very bad again) remembered, and the beadle gratified, and the sexton (who was accidentally on the doorsteps, looking with great interest at the weather) not forgotten, they got into the carriage again, and drove home in the same bleak fellowship.
1	As we went up, doors of rooms were opened and people’s heads put out; and we passed other people on the stairs, who were coming down.
1	The sisterhood, the maidens, flocking round the young waterman, and urging him along the stream of duty and of temperance.
1	He was very much pleased by my asking if I might sleep in my own little room, and I was pleased too; for I felt that I had done rather a great thing in making the request.
1	She had been to the theayter.
1	I am a very little boy, sir; and it is so--so--' 'So what?'
1	A soft glow seems to shine from within them, rather than upon them from without, such is their mellowness as they look forth on the hot corn-fields and the smoking roads that distantly wind among them.
1	On these occasions, Mrs MacStinger was knocked up by the policeman at a quarter before three in the morning, and rarely such before twelve o’clock next night.
1	So the little crazy lodger goes for the beadle, and the rest come out of the room.
1	He mentioned to me as a secret, that he is courting a young lady who has, as no doubt you are aware, a bedridden Pa.
1	When, according to our old custom, we sat before the fire at night, we often fell into this train; as naturally, and as consciously to each other, as if we had unreservedly said so.
1	I cannot breathe it.’ ‘We have breathed it together, for a long time,’ said the old man.
1	One was taken from me, with a warning, yesterday.
1	The church-clocks will strike the hours just the same, Sir Leicester, and the night will pass away just the same.
1	‘He is a sagacious man in business, and has had a good apprenticeship to it.’ After this, they conversed on different subjects until they arrived at their journey’s end.
1	‘And how did you know I was here?’ inquired Mary.
1	He proposed me afterwards; and he, and Mrs. Micawber, and I, took a review of our past acquaintance, in the course of which we sold the property all over again.
1	It is not in my power, or in the power of my brother Ned, to save you from the consequences.
1	Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House has chosen, so far as I may judge," and this was when he looked at me, "a very good companion for the young lady, and the arrangement altogether seems the best of which the circumstances admit."
1	It was a rimy morning, and very damp.
1	‘Thou and I are free of it now, Nell.
1	‘To the infant’s benefit, last year, on which occasion she repeated three of her most popular characters, and also appeared in the Fairy Porcupine, as originally performed by her, there was a house of no more than four pound twelve.’ ‘Is it possible?’ cried Nicholas.
1	Do not leave us!’ The child dropped her head, and put her hands before her face.
1	Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat, tights and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head.
1	They let him have his wish; and indeed he kept his word, and was, in his childish way, a lesson to them all.
1	Wal’r,’ said the Captain, his eyes glistening with the praise of his young friend, and his hook raised to announce a beautiful quotation, ‘is what you may call a out’ard and visible sign of an in’ard and spirited grasp, and when found make a note of.’ Florence, who did not quite understand this, though the Captain evidently thought it full of meaning, and highly satisfactory, mildly looked to him for something more.
1	Bunsby was accompanied by nothing but a large box, which he hauled into the shop with his own hands, and as soon as he had hauled in, sat upon.
1	We have partnerships of interest and convenience, friendships of interest and convenience, dealings of interest and convenience, marriages of interest and convenience, every day.’ She bit her blood-red lip; but without wavering in the dark, stern watch she kept upon him.
1	And Joram’s at work, at this minute, on a grey one with silver nails, not this measurement’--the measurement of the dancing child upon the counter--‘by a good two inches.---Will you take something?’ I thanked him, but declined.
1	But it looks like it.’ Having given her this back-handed reminder of her mutinous observations to the skeleton, Mr Lammle rose from table--perhaps, the better to conceal a smile, and a white dint or two about his nose--and took a turn on the carpet and came to the hearthrug.
1	You do see him, and mind you, it ain't every one as is admitted to that honour.
1	‘But can’t we have one last night more?’ ‘Not an hour--not a minute,’ replied Nicholas, impatiently.
1	‘Well,’ said I, glad to have closed the bargain, ‘I’ll take eighteenpence.’ ‘Oh, my liver!’ cried the old man, throwing the jacket on a shelf.
1	The communication performed its errand so well, that within ten minutes of the messenger’s return and report of its delivery, Miss Brass herself was announced.
1	They were lost on Squeers, however, whose gaze was fastened on the luckless Smike, as he inquired, according to custom in such cases, whether he had anything to say for himself.
1	Pressed to fall back upon a nominative case, he opined that they wos about as red as ever red could be.
1	He turned over the leaves.
1	It was pleasant to observe the fresh flowers in the room, the pet bird with a green bough shading his little cage, the breath of freshness and youth which seemed to rustle through the old dull house and hover round the child.
1	‘I shall be glad to see it again, I don’t deny, Miss,’ said the Nipper.
1	In     the course of debate, the deceased made some statements which Vinyard     pronounced false, and made use of violent and insulting language,     dealing largely in personalities, to which Mr. A. made no reply.
1	‘His dog Lion.’ Little Dorrit’s hand was in his, as he spoke.
1	‘My dearest Susan,’ replied Mr Toots, ‘do, do, if you possibly can, remember the medical man!
1	I was always confused and giddy at that place you took me from; and could never remember, and sometimes couldn’t even understand, what they said to me.

1	By resolving not to set right the wrong he did you.
1	The old man had gained the street corner, before he began to recover the effect of Toby Crackit's intelligence.
1	Besides, I couldn’t be such friends with any other dog but Jip; because he wouldn’t have known me before I was married, and wouldn’t have barked at Doady when he first came to our house.
1	Tope,’ said the waiter, brightening, as he rubbed his chin with his hand, ‘would be the likeliest party to inform in that line.’ ‘Who is Mr. Tope?’ inquired Dick Datchery.
1	But not because I repent of what I have said to you.
1	When it was given him, he drank his Majesty's health and compliments of the season, and took it all at a mouthful and smacked his lips.
1	The sky had partly cleared, but was very gloomy--even above us, where a few stars were shining.
1	Let me wet your lips again, and your forehead.
1	Major Bagstock, after long and frequent observation of Paul, across Princess’s Place, through his double-barrelled opera-glass; and after receiving many minute reports, daily, weekly, and monthly, on that subject, from the native who kept himself in constant communication with Miss Tox’s maid for that purpose; came to the conclusion that Dombey, Sir, was a man to be known, and that J.
1	And looking up, he sees the clerk looking down at him and marking him as he passes a lamp.
1	Not one o’ them letters,’ repeated the Captain, to make his declaration the more solemn and impressive, ‘was ever delivered unto Ed’ard Cuttle, Mariner, of England, as lives at home at ease, and doth improve each shining hour!’ ‘And posted by my own hand!
1	Richard said he was ready for anything.
1	‘What was it that you asked me?
1	The voices was very loud, Sir, and forced themselves upon my ear.’ ‘Well, Mrs. Cluppins, you were not listening, but you heard the voices.
1	Changes of glorious light from moving boughs, songs of birds, scents from gardens, woods, and fields—or, rather, from the one great garden of the whole cultivated island in its yielding time—penetrate into the Cathedral, subdue its earthy odour, and preach the Resurrection and the Life.
1	The old woman was so decent and contented, and made so light of her infirmities, though they had increased upon her since her former interview with Stephen, that they both took an interest in her.
1	He knew now that she was, indeed, a homeless wandering fugitive; but, richer to him so, than in all the wealth and pride of her right station, she seemed farther off than even on the height that had made him giddy in his boyish dreams.
1	All doubts upon the subject, if he had any, were speedily removed by the young lady's behaviour.
1	I think there are—Bounderby, you will be surprised to hear me say this—I think there are qualities in Louisa, which—which have been harshly neglected, and—and a little perverted.
1	And so large it is, you might see it anywheres.’ It was perfectly delightful to behold with what enthusiasm Mr. Peggotty became inspired when he thought of his little favourite.
1	The apertures, where doors and windows stood an hour ago, disclosed a mass of raging fire; walls rocked and crumbled into the burning well; the molten lead and iron poured down, white hot, upon the ground.
1	The other lady, too, as well as her husband, the short gentleman with the tall hat, were plainly on guard, according to a preconcerted plan; and the wretched man was so secured by Mrs MacStinger, that any effort at self-preservation by flight was rendered futile.
1	With which the head disappeared, and the door closed.
1	He was again painfully aware of a somnolent tendency in Frederick (which had no existence out of his own imagination), and after dinner, when Frederick had withdrawn, privately apologised to Mrs General for the poor man.
1	You are everything to her.’ ‘Am I?’ returned Sissy, shaking her head.
1	I glanced towards the centre of the room, where Miss Jellyby's lover, now engaged with single pupils, was undergoing greater drudgery than ever.
1	‘Or come,’ she added, dropping her voice suddenly, looking at him earnestly, and seeming in a moment to forget the object of her wrath, ‘give me something, or I’ll call it after you!’ ‘After me, old lady!’ returned the Manager, putting his hand in his pocket.
1	"But," said he, "that is not to be remembered now."
1	‘All right, Thquire!’ said Mr. Sleary, ‘your thon may be aboard-a-thip by thith time.
1	This garment hung so loosely on the figure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any artifice.
1	He was a brown-faced sun-burnt man, and appeared browner and more sun-burnt from having a white nightcap on.
1	With Buffer, Boots, and Brewer, Lady Tippins is eminently facetious on the subject of these Fathers of the Scrip-Church: surveying them through her eyeglass, and inquiring whether Boots and Brewer and Buffer think they will make her fortune if she makes love to them?
1	Mr and Mrs Sparkler were established in their own house: a little mansion, rather of the Tite Barnacle class, quite a triumph of inconvenience, with a perpetual smell in it of the day before yesterday’s soup and coach-horses, but extremely dear, as being exactly in the centre of the habitable globe.
1	I owe it, alike to others, and to myself.'
1	Upon this, Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz prayed a _tales_; the gentleman in black then proceeded to press into the special jury, two of the common jurymen; and a greengrocer and a chemist were caught directly.
1	‘You must knock again, if you please.’ There ain’t a bell, is there, ma’am?’ said the short chairman.
1	I have got other plans for this house.
1	Nothing seemed wanting to render the select circle complete, when Mr. Leo Hunter--whose department on these occasions, was to stand about in doorways, and talk to the less important people--suddenly called out-- ‘My dear; here’s Mr. Charles Fitz-Marshall.’ ‘Oh dear,’ said Mrs. Leo Hunter, ‘how anxiously I have been expecting him.
1	Let me start from my bed as I would, with the terror fresh upon me that he was discovered; let me sit listening, as I would with dread, for Herbert's returning step at night, lest it should be fleeter than ordinary, and winged with evil news,--for all that, and much more to like purpose, the round of things went on.
1	‘It never could have been bewitching, Davy.
1	Mas’r Davy, he can remember what she was; you may judge for your own self what she is; but neither of you can’t fully know what she has been, is, and will be, to my loving art.
1	Take hold of this cup and saucer, ostler.

1	‘When it was ‘tickerlerly given out that you wasn’t to go and worrit the wet nurse.’ ‘She don’t worry me,’ was the surprised rejoinder of Polly.
1	‘Twenty Eight,’ said a gentleman in spectacles, who had not yet spoken, ‘you complained last week, my good fellow, of the cocoa.
1	"You seem to forget," returned Mr. Woodcourt, "that I ask you to say nothing and have no interest in anything you say."
1	Besides which, all that I could have said of the Story to any purpose, I had endeavoured to say in it.
1	In a small dull yard below his window, there was a tree--green and flourishing enough, for such a place--and as the air stirred among its leaves, it threw a rippling shadow on the white wall.
1	Master Bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply, that he burst into another laugh; which laugh, meeting the coffee he was drinking, and carrying it down some wrong channel, very nearly terminated in his premature suffocation.
1	Well, you are a quiz!’ Mr. Tupman had no objection to earning the reputation at so cheap a rate: so he looked very knowing, and smiled mysteriously.
1	Mr. Harthouse has joined your father’s muster-roll.
1	After a while he softly seats himself upon the bedside with his face towards him--just as he sat in the law-writer's room--and touches his chest and heart.
1	If you don’t object to our old whim, Sir, let us devote this first glass to Walter and his wife.’ ‘To Walter and his wife!’ says Mr Dombey.
1	‘What a game girl you are, to be such a first-rate sister, Loo!’ whispered Tom.
1	Has been my late childhood?
1	‘Which way shall we take, Rosa?’ Rosa replies: ‘I want to go to the Lumps-of-Delight shop.’ ‘To the—?’ ‘A Turkish sweetmeat, sir.
1	"Have you got it here?"
1	‘What comes next?’ Making a dignified attempt to gather himself together, but, as it were, dropping half a dozen pieces of himself while he tried in vain to pick up one, Mr Dolls, swaying his head from side to side, regarded his questioner with what he supposed to be a haughty smile and a scornful glance.
1	I looked in, and saw him a sitting lonely by his fire, brooding over it.
1	Instead of proceeding with any more anecdotes, as he had evidently intended but a moment before, he gave a short dry cough, and said, ‘Well!
1	Blest with your hand, what means might I not find of advancing your interests and pushing your fortunes!
1	Isabella Wardle and Mr. Trundle ‘went partners,’ and Emily Wardle and Mr. Snodgrass did the same; and even Mr. Tupman and the spinster aunt established a joint- stock company of fish and flattery.
1	‘And Lizzie Hexam’s friend.’ ‘Here is a note from her, entreating you to accede to the request of Mr Mortimer Lightwood, the bearer.
1	May I, Walter’s Uncle?’ The Instrument-maker, without speaking, put her hand to his lips, and Susan Nipper, leaning back with her arms crossed, in the chair of presidency into which she had voted herself, bit one end of her bonnet strings, and heaved a gentle sigh as she looked up at the skylight.
1	‘Inspired by this idea and the sentiments it awakened, sir, and feeling as a mutual friend that badgering, baiting, and bullying, was not the sort of thing calculated to expand the souls and promote the social harmony of the contending parties, I took upon myself to suggest a course which is THE course to be adopted to the present occasion.
1	And thus, with a clatter of maids and valets--for it is one appurtenance of their cousinship that however difficult they may find it to keep themselves, they MUST keep maids and valets--the cousins disperse to the four winds of heaven; and the one wintry wind that blows to-day shakes a shower from the trees near the deserted house, as if all the cousins had been changed into leaves.
1	A flash in the pan or a shot?"
1	‘Sophronia, my dear, what portraits are you showing Twemlow?’ ‘Public characters, Alfred.’ ‘Show him the last of me.’ ‘Yes, Alfred.’ She puts the book down, takes another book up, turns the leaves, and presents the portrait to Twemlow.
1	I can keep this from Arthur, only by buying him off.
1	"I believe so," said Mr. Vholes.
1	He dressed and got out so quickly that he found himself at the corner of the patriarchal street nearly an hour before her time; but he was not sorry to have the opportunity of calming himself with a leisurely walk.
1	Sam looked after him, until he turned a corner of the road; and then set forward on his walk to London.
1	We must push on again tomorrow, for we are not rich enough to loiter.
1	The girls had gone home, when my name burst into bloom on Traddles’s door; and the sharp boy looked, all day, as if he had never heard of Sophy, shut up in a back room, glancing down from her work into a sooty little strip of garden with a pump in it.
1	Mercury departs in search of the iron gentleman, finds, and produces him.

1	Therefore I want to get him, for the present moment, into any poor lodging kept by decent people where he would be admitted.
1	For some minutes after he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint Antoine, the husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them, lest he should come back.
1	‘You interrupted us at a critical moment,’ said he, pointing to the man whom I had found in company with him; ‘this fellow will murder me one of these days.
1	Crisparkle,’ quoth the Dean, ‘human justice may err, but it must act according to its lights.
1	I hope our occupation is a blameless one?’ ‘“See here,” said the friar, taking the frame from her hand, “an intricate winding of gaudy colours, without purpose or object, unless it be that one day it is destined for some vain ornament, to minister to the pride of your frail and giddy sex.
1	At last I come to the sea.
1	‘And your sister’s temper is wearing.’ ‘I don’t mind, Pa.’ ‘And you must prepare yourself you know, my precious,’ said her father, with much gentleness, ‘for our looking very poor and meagre at home, and being at the best but very uncomfortable, after Mr Boffin’s house.’ ‘I don’t mind, Pa.
1	And so she never lifted her head up any more, and it was just an hour later when we laid it down on her own bed, because we found she was gone.” Biddy cried; the darkening garden, and the lane, and the stars that were coming out, were blurred in my own sight.
1	“Do this look like a forge?” replied Orlick, sending his glance all round him with an air of injury.
1	"IS he after his time?"
1	Bishop then betook himself up-stairs, and the other magnates gradually floated up after him until there was no one left below but Mr Merdle.
1	It would be sentimental, perhaps?
1	It was a picture of comfort, full of easy-chairs, cushions and footstools, worked by his mother’s hand, and with no sort of thing omitted that could help to render it complete.
1	I pass to worse news.
1	I have never told you, Trotwood, of her mother.
1	My construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct, for I read “wife of the Above” as a complimentary reference to my father's exaltation to a better world; and if any one of my deceased relations had been referred to as “Below,” I have no doubt I should have formed the worst opinions of that member of the family.
1	'He gets worse instead of better, I think,' said the elder lady.
1	‘No, Affery, no supper.’ ‘You shall if you like,’ said Affery.
1	‘I’ll try hard, dear mother, now.
1	‘O yes,’ he said, ‘quite well--why not?’ Sometimes he turned his head, and looked, with earnest gaze and outstretched neck, after some stranger in the crowd, until he disappeared from sight; but, to the question why he did this, he answered not a word.
1	To the home of Walter’s Uncle.
1	Holloa!’ But no Eugene replied.
1	After looking at Mrs. Gummidge for some moments, in sore distress of mind, he glanced at the Dutch clock, rose, snuffed the candle, and put it in the window.
1	‘Other things are all very well in their way, but give me Blood!’ ‘Oh!
1	If you deny them from any mistaken regard or fear for them, judge of my intentions by their recognition of this person as their old humble friend.’ ‘I always said it!’ cried the bride, ‘I knew she was not a common child!
1	“You would have been disposed of for so many shillings according to the market price of the article, and Dunstable the butcher would have come up to you as you lay in your straw, and he would have whipped you under his left arm, and with his right he would have tucked up his frock to get a penknife from out of his waistcoat-pocket, and he would have shed your blood and had your life.
1	If so, the answer was indefinite and vague.
1	It plaited itself into whatever I thought of, as a bodily pain would have done.
1	repeated Sikes turning round in his chair to confront her.
1	I persuaded her to give me a sitting or two, for the street-door case.
1	Ralph, who, while the attention of the other guests was attracted to the principals in the preceding scene, had eyed them like a wolf, appeared to breathe more freely now his niece was gone; the decanters passing quickly round, he leaned back in his chair, and turned his eyes from speaker to speaker, as they warmed with wine, with looks that seemed to search their hearts, and lay bare, for his distempered sport, every idle thought within them.
1	In front of a big book-case, in a big chair, behind a big table, and before a big volume, sat Mr. Nupkins, looking a full size larger than any one of them, big as they were.
1	‘What!’ said Nicholas, ‘cucumbers and vegetable marrows flying at the heads of the family as they walk in their own garden, and not meant impertinently!
1	You remember objecting to a word I used, as being too strong?
1	It was another and a stronger woman who was the victim, and there had been a struggle--in a barn.
1	The great door clanged behind him, and Monsieur the Marquis crossed a hall grim with certain old boar-spears, swords, and knives of the chase; grimmer with certain heavy riding-rods and riding-whips, of which many a peasant, gone to his benefactor Death, had felt the weight when his lord was angry.
1	For the moment, Mrs Lammle does not turn to them, but remains looking at Twemlow looking at Alfred’s portrait through his eyeglass.
1	The poor schoolmaster shook his head, and said that they barely filled the two forms.
1	‘Do you stay long, sir?’ ‘I have not at present the intention,’ said Mr Dorrit, ‘of--ha--exceeding a fortnight.’ ‘That’s a very short stay, after so long a journey,’ returned Mr Merdle.
1	What warning did I give that fellow, the first time he set foot in the house, when the express object of his visit was to know how he could knock Religion over, and floor the Established Church?
1	cries the woman, almost breathless.
1	The fine little boy with the blister on his nose is the eldest.
1	A soft voice seemed to whisper in her ear, ‘Florence, dear Florence, it is nothing but a dream!’ and stretching out her arms, she returned the caress of her new Mama, who then went out at the door in the light of the grey morning.
1	Dark and cold as the wintry day is, it is darker and colder in these deserted chambers than in many a hut that will barely exclude the weather; and though the servants heap fires in the grates and set the couches and the chairs within the warm glass screens that let their ruddy light shoot through to the furthest corners, there is a heavy cloud upon the rooms which no light will dispel.
1	"I know little enough, I am sure, thanks to Ma!
1	He said, ‘No, no, he had done quite right,’ but that was all.
1	‘I am sorry to trouble you, James,’ said the brother, gathering them up, ‘but--’ ‘Oh!
1	‘Your wife wants money, I suppose,’ said Mr Dombey, putting his hand in his pocket, and speaking (but that he always did) haughtily.
1	Her own little room too, where she had so often knelt down and prayed at night--prayed for the time which she hoped was dawning now--the little room where she had slept so peacefully, and dreamed such pleasant dreams!
1	Different from Jack Chinaman t’other side the court.
1	‘Yes, my bed, Sir,’ replied Sam, ‘I’m a prisoner.
1	‘I have been thinking, Davy,’ replied the sexton, ‘that she,’ he pointed to the grave, ‘must have been a deal older than you or me.’ ‘Seventy-nine,’ answered the old man with a shake of the head, ‘I tell you that I saw it.’ ‘Saw it?’ replied the sexton; ‘aye, but, Davy, women don’t always tell the truth about their age.’ ‘That’s true indeed,’ said the other old man, with a sudden sparkle in his eye.
1	My sweetest Edith, and my dearest Dombey, do we not know that any difference between you two--No, Flowers; not now.’ Flowers was the maid, who, finding gentlemen present, retreated with precipitation.
1	Now, if you get a good composition for this debt, which you long ago gave up for lost, you’ll stand my friend, and help me.
1	"I don't know nothink about no--where I was took by the beadle, do you mean?"
1	Give me a rope, a long rope.
1	Tea was served in a style no less polite than the dinner; and after tea, the young gentlemen rising and bowing as before, withdrew to fetch up the unfinished tasks of that day, or to get up the already looming tasks of to-morrow.
1	Him, Darnay heard with a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay stood divided between going away that he might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his word, when the thing that was to be, went on to shape itself out.
1	Its contents are known to nobody but himself and us.’ ‘Are you certain?’ demanded Nicholas, precipitately; ‘not even to my mother or sister?
1	'Upon my word I was not, sir,' replied Oliver, earnestly.
1	‘If you will take me for your wife, Walter, I will love you dearly.
1	I was determined to come through, and come to you.’ ‘What is the matter?’ ‘Nothing’s the matter, sir.
1	People to say that Mr Dombey--Mr Dombey!--was separated from his wife!
1	The books were not easy to procure; and the answer at several shops was, either that they were just out of them, or that they never kept them, or that they had had a great many last month, or that they expected a great many next week But Susan was not easily baffled in such an enterprise; and having entrapped a white-haired youth, in a black calico apron, from a library where she was known, to accompany her in her quest, she led him such a life in going up and down, that he exerted himself to the utmost, if it were only to get rid of her; and finally enabled her to return home in triumph.
1	Hoo much cash hast thee gotten?’ ‘Not much,’ said Nicholas, colouring, ‘but I can make it enough.
1	‘The more’s the pity, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit; ‘you are losing all your good old habits.
1	and the old girl herself, accompanied by Mr. Bagnet, appears.
1	The rope went out as before, the signal was made as before, and the windlass stopped.
1	"You will not desert this lady we are in search of; you will not abandon her on such a night and in such a state of mind as I know her to be in!"
1	The company amounted in number to some twenty-five or thirty, being composed of such members of the theatrical profession, then engaged or disengaged in London, as were numbered among the most intimate friends of Mr. and Mrs. Crummles.
1	'Of course I know that, my dear.
1	You are a far more competent judge of such affairs than I am.
1	Oh, dear me, I'm out of breath.
1	On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, Mr. Lorry came in late, from Tellson's, and sat himself down by Lucie and her husband in the dark window.
1	I am always disengaged after four or five o’clock, and I have time early in the morning.
1	How she got from story to story was a mystery beyond solution.
1	‘You had better let him go.
1	Sophy’s the fourth.’ ‘Is the mother living?’ I inquired.
1	‘I’ll take care of you.’ ‘You’re very kind,’ I gratefully returned.
1	‘If I had left myself any breath to cry with, I should have cried again.
1	His healthy state of mind appeared even to derive a gratification from Clennam’s position of embarrassment and isolation among the good company; and if Clennam had been in that condition with which Nobody was incessantly contending, he would have suspected it, and would have struggled with the suspicion as a meanness, even while he sat at the table.
1	It is, however, the possession, and the only possession except fifty shillings per annum and a very small box indifferently filled with clothing, of a lean young woman from a workhouse (by some supposed to have been christened Augusta) who, although she was farmed or contracted for during her growing time by an amiable benefactor of his species resident at Tooting, and cannot fail to have been developed under the most favourable circumstances, "has fits," which the parish can't account for.
1	I had some association with it, that struck upon my heart directly; but I was thinking of anything else when it came upon me, and was confused.
1	You are going to try matrimony.
1	My fancy is not able to get that far.’ As the low fire gleamed upon her, it showed her smiling, mournfully and abstractedly.
1	‘If you know anything of him, Harriet, except that he came from Venice--which we all know--tell it to Mr Clennam freely.’ ‘I know nothing more about him,’ said the girl.
1	‘How vexation, Chivery?’ asked the benignant father.
1	At this part of the recital Monks held his breath, and listened with a face of intense eagerness, though his eyes were not directed towards the speaker.
1	The Captain had next to consider where and why?
1	The way in which I listened to all the incidents of the house that made themselves audible to me; the ringing of bells, the opening and shutting of doors, the murmuring of voices, the footsteps on the stairs; to any laughing, whistling, or singing, outside, which seemed more dismal than anything else to me in my solitude and disgrace--the uncertain pace of the hours, especially at night, when I would wake thinking it was morning, and find that the family were not yet gone to bed, and that all the length of night had yet to come--the depressed dreams and nightmares I had--the return of day, noon, afternoon, evening, when the boys played in the churchyard, and I watched them from a distance within the room, being ashamed to show myself at the window lest they should know I was a prisoner--the strange sensation of never hearing myself speak--the fleeting intervals of something like cheerfulness, which came with eating and drinking, and went away with it--the setting in of rain one evening, with a fresh smell, and its coming down faster and faster between me and the church, until it and gathering night seemed to quench me in gloom, and fear, and remorse--all this appears to have gone round and round for years instead of days, it is so vividly and strongly stamped on my remembrance.
1	We found Mr. Micawber at his desk, in the turret office on the ground floor, either writing, or pretending to write, hard.
1	I see you pitch your Bargeman’s bundle into the river.
1	After running abstractedly over the keys for a few minutes, she fell into a low and very solemn air; and as she played it, they heard a sound as if she were weeping.
1	‘Ay!’ the Dean echoes; ‘Durdles, Durdles!’ ‘The truth is, sir,’ explains Jasper, ‘that my curiosity in the man was first really stimulated by Mr. Sapsea.
1	‘As I supposed from his not sending!’ thought Ralph.
1	Full of such thoughts, they turned into the long and sombre street.
1	Waiter!” “Yes, sir.” “Is that horse of mine ready?” “Brought round to the door, sir.” “I say.
1	Mr. Brownlow merely nodded to Mr. Grimwig, who disappearing with great alacrity, shortly returned, pushing in Mrs. Bumble, and dragging her unwilling consort after him.
1	I heard that one boy, who was a coal-merchant’s son, came as a set-off against the coal-bill, and was called, on that account, ‘Exchange or Barter’--a name selected from the arithmetic book as expressing this arrangement.
1	Then Mr Pancks descended and bore down upon him, with his utmost pressure of steam on.
1	I have no address, sir.
1	I only put it to yourself, sir."
1	He heard a shout--another--saw the face change from its vindictive passion to a faint sickness and terror--felt the earth tremble--knew in a moment that the rush was come--uttered a shriek--looked round--saw the red eyes, bleared and dim, in the daylight, close upon him--was beaten down, caught up, and whirled away upon a jagged mill, that spun him round and round, and struck him limb from limb, and licked his stream of life up with its fiery heat, and cast his mutilated fragments in the air.
1	I could see that twice or thrice he looked back as if to ascertain if I were still watching him, or perhaps to assure himself that I was not following at a distance.
1	‘I came here,’ said the military gentleman turning to Mrs Jarley--‘’pon my soul and honour I hardly know what I came here for.
1	They had left the town by night; no one had seen them go; no one had met them on the road; the driver of no coach, cart, or waggon, had seen any travellers answering their description; nobody had fallen in with them, or heard of them.
1	'He is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died; and that she told you something--' 'About the mother of the boy you named,' replied the matron interrupting him.
1	‘And how did you leave Mr. Jasper, reverend sir?’ said Mr. Grewgious.
1	‘I didn’t climb up the ladder in _them_.—Shouldn’t be so high up, if I had.’ Being left to saunter in the hall a minute or two while Mr. Gradgrind went up-stairs for the address, he opened the door of the children’s study and looked into that serene floor-clothed apartment, which, notwithstanding its book-cases and its cabinets and its variety of learned and philosophical appliances, had much of the genial aspect of a room devoted to hair-cutting.
1	And was it a hopeful or a promising thing anywhere?
1	He let it lie there for some time, as if he had not the courage to open it, but at length did so and turned deadly pale.
1	‘Of something that has made you sorrowful?’ There was a long pause.
1	No matter who invites you to stay elsewhere.
1	He looked back, as he went out at the door, upon the well-lighted and luxurious room, the beautiful and glittering objects everywhere displayed, the shape of Edith in its rich dress seated before her glass, and the face of Edith as the glass presented it to him; and betook himself to his old chamber of cogitation, carrying away with him a vivid picture in his mind of all these things, and a rambling and unaccountable speculation (such as sometimes comes into a man’s head) how they would all look when he saw them next.
1	‘The poor baron bore it all as long as he could, and when he could bear it no longer lost his appetite and his spirits, and sat himself gloomily and dejectedly down.
1	‘What is the matter?’ asked the visitor again.
1	She was not accustomed to think of herself, or to trouble any one with her emotions.
1	During this dialogue Mr. Tulkinghorn has stood aloof by the old portmanteau, with his hands behind him, equally removed, to all appearance, from all three kinds of interest exhibited near the bed--from the young surgeon's professional interest in death, noticeable as being quite apart from his remarks on the deceased as an individual; from the old man's unction; and the little crazy woman's awe.
1	‘On my return to Norwood, after the period of absence occasioned by my brother’s marriage,’ pursued Miss Murdstone in a disdainful voice, ‘and on the return of Miss Spenlow from her visit to her friend Miss Mills, I imagined that the manner of Miss Spenlow gave me greater occasion for suspicion than before.
1	Mr. Pickwick, feeling not a little disgusted with this dialogue, as well as with the air and manner of the two beings by whom it had been carried on, was about to inquire whether he could not be accommodated with a private sitting-room, when two or three strangers of genteel appearance entered, at sight of whom the boy threw his cigar into the fire, and whispering to Mr. Price that they had come to ‘make it all right’ for him, joined them at a table in the farther end of the room.
1	They exchanged one brief glance; there was a fire in the eyes of both, which could not be mistaken.
1	‘Oh, don’t talk to me about poor,’ returned my aunt.
1	Now has he made atonement to you--with his life!
1	"Not just at present, my Lady."
1	Up from among the fern in the hollow, and winding by the bridle-road among the trees, comes sometimes to this lonely spot the sound of horses' hoofs.
1	Naturally, we was both of us inclined to give such a subject a wide berth.
1	Hadn't you better go to bed?"
1	There he sat, taking his wine, and taking a good deal of it, for two hours; while Agnes played on the piano, worked, and talked to him and me.
1	Mr. Jaggers, putting a hand on my shoulder and walking me on at his side without saying anything to me, addressed himself to his followers.
1	‘Thank you Sir,’ said Brass, ‘thank you, I am sure.
1	It is for him to say, here and now, all he can; or to go hence, and do all he can.
1	Upon which Mrs. Bagnet, with her cloak, basket, and umbrella, goes home, bright-eyed again, to the rest of her family, and the comrades sally forth on the hopeful errand of mollifying Mr. Smallweed.
1	Coming before me, on this particular evening that I mention, mingled with the childish recollections and later fancies, the ghosts of half-formed hopes, the broken shadows of disappointments dimly seen and understood, the blending of experience and imagination, incidental to the occupation with which my thoughts had been busy, it was more than commonly suggestive.
1	You'll find, or I'm much mistaken, that the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn had the intention of communicating the whole to you as soon as he considered it ripe, and further, that he had given her ladyship so to understand.
1	‘’Cause I was always used to a four-poster afore I came here, and I find the legs of the table answer just as well,’ replied the cobbler.
1	‘The moral being--I believe that’s the right expression--of this exemplary person, derived its highest gratification from anathematizing his nearest relations and turning them out of doors.
1	‘That’s my handsome daughter,’ said the old woman.
1	She wants to have her share, which, if not the lion’s, is the greater part; and if she does not get it, she says, “_My mother will love me_.” ‘Her tendency to imitation is so strong, that it leads her to actions which must be entirely incomprehensible to her, and which can give her no other pleasure than the gratification of an internal faculty.
1	‘Oh you beauties!’ cried Susan Nipper, affecting to salute the door by which the ladies had departed.
1	We duly came back to breakfast, and Mrs. Jellyby sat at the head of the table and Mr. Jellyby at the foot.
1	Would that be it, Mr Wegg?’ ‘That would depend upon what it was, Mr Venus.
1	‘If one was the most dutiful child in existence (of course on the whole one hopes one is), isn’t she enough to make one want to poke her with something wooden, sitting there bolt upright in a corner?’ ‘Only suppose,’ returned Bella, ‘that poor Pa was to sit bolt upright in another corner.’ ‘My dear, he couldn’t do it,’ said Lavvy.
1	Good morning, sir!’ The Secretary pursued his way, not very much elevated in spirits by this conversation, and, arriving at the Boffin mansion, found Betty Higden waiting for him.
1	I showed it to him now, and he admired it highly.
1	You are, at least, as avaricious as you are revengeful.
1	Acting upon this suggestion, they adjourned to a neighbouring apartment, where Mr. Brittles, being called in, involved himself and his respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions and impossibilities, as tended to throw no particular light on anything, but the fact of his own strong mystification; except, indeed, his declarations that he shouldn't know the real boy, if he were put before him that instant; that he had only taken Oliver to be he, because Mr. Giles had said he was; and that Mr. Giles had, five minutes previously, admitted in the kitchen, that he began to be very much afraid he had been a little too hasty.
1	And, perhaps, unlearned as she was, she could have brought a dawning knowledge home to Mr Dombey at that early day, which would not then have struck him in the end like lightning.
1	That is according as the young gentleman has his original character formed.
1	The bedroom where the clutching old man had lost his grip on life, was left as he had left it.
1	In half an hour after our arrival, Mrs. Jellyby appeared; and in the course of an hour the various things necessary for breakfast straggled one by one into the dining-room.
1	More than that, we couldn’t improve the mills themselves, unless we laid down Turkey carpets on the floors.
1	‘When did I come here?
1	I had forgotten my threat.
1	Indeed, we were all more or less amused, except that miserable Mrs. Gummidge, whose courtship would appear to have been of an exactly parallel nature, she was so continually reminded by these transactions of the old one.
1	Dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started!
1	They provided Jenny with materials for plying her work, and she had a little table placed at the foot of his bed.
1	"I generally am near," returns Mr. Bucket, "being so fond of children.
1	‘Here he is!’ Perceiving himself to be the antecedent, Bradley looked from the watchman to the man.
1	We had better go in.” He recovered himself almost instantly.
1	‘You are quite sure?’ said Mrs. Pott, stealing a tender look at her visitor.
1	I had an uncle once, Madame Mantalini, who lived in Cheltenham, and had a most excellent business as a tobacconist--hem--who had such small feet, that they were no bigger than those which are usually joined to wooden legs--the most symmetrical feet, Madame Mantalini, that even you can imagine.’ ‘They must have had something of the appearance of club feet, Miss Knag,’ said Madame.
1	oh don’t!’ exclaimed Walter, who really felt a thrill of terror in seeing the old man weep.
1	She answered, looking all the while at her husband for leave.
1	Although Bleak House was not in Chancery, its master was, and it was stamped with the same seal.
1	‘Say you are sure I didn’t mean to.
1	In case I should be taking a liberty in putting your ladyship on your guard when there's no necessity for it, you will endeavour, I should hope, to outlive my presumption, and I shall endeavour to outlive your disapprobation.
1	I rang the bell, the servant came, and Mr. Guppy, laying his written card upon the table and making a dejected bow, departed.
1	But Mr. Tulkinghorn is not alone to-night to ponder at his usual length.
1	We tried to comfort the mother, and we whispered to her what Our Saviour said of children.
1	So ’tis wi’ Slackbridge every bit.’ Reverting for a moment to his former refuge, he observed a cautionary movement of her eyes towards the door.
1	‘If Gilbert Clennam, reduced to imbecility, at the point of death, and labouring under the delusion of some imaginary relenting towards a girl of whom he had heard that his nephew had once had a fancy for her which he had crushed out of him, and that she afterwards drooped away into melancholy and withdrawal from all who knew her--if, in that state of weakness, he dictated to me, whose life she had darkened with her sin, and who had been appointed to know her wickedness from her own hand and her own lips, a bequest meant as a recompense to her for supposed unmerited suffering; was there no difference between my spurning that injustice, and coveting mere money--a thing which you, and your comrades in the prisons, may steal from anyone?’ ‘Time presses, madame.
1	If you come to that, I’d sooner suspect your honesty than his.’ Miss Sally pulled out the tin snuff-box, and took a long, slow pinch, regarding her brother with a steady gaze all the time.
1	That learned man in a few hurried words explained the real state of the case.
1	The dust storm, driving between them and the placid sky, parted for a moment and showed them the stars.
1	‘Delightful young man, his Lordship,’ said the Master of the Ceremonies.
1	‘I’m afraid she’s worse this morning, my poor girl!’ said the man, suspending his work, and contemplating his ill-favoured child, with a compassion that was the more tender for being rougher.
1	Jo looks aghast at Mr. Bucket.
1	Mr Sownds the Beadle has long risen from the steps, and is in waiting with his cocked hat in his hand.
1	Believe me, Mr Clennam,’ said the sprightly young Barnacle in his pleasantest manner, ‘our place is not a wicked Giant to be charged at full tilt; but only a windmill showing you, as it grinds immense quantities of chaff, which way the country wind blows.’ ‘If I could believe that,’ said Clennam, ‘it would be a dismal prospect for all of us.’ ‘Oh!
1	At first, she seemed to wonder at the gentle compassion with which the Doctor spoke to her, and at his wish that she should have her mother with her, to relieve the dull monotony of her life.
1	The wine was so bitter cold that it forced a little scream from Miss Tox, which she had great difficulty in turning into a ‘Hem!’ The veal had come from such an airy pantry, that the first taste of it had struck a sensation as of cold lead to Mr Chick’s extremities.
1	"A solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still."
1	‘I have far other views in life, and why should you waste your own?’ ‘Mine!’ said the Secretary.
1	You wonder to hear me say A lady.
1	Her face being turned away from me and towards him, I could not see it.
1	For I believed one of two other persons to have become possessed of it, and to have turned it to this cruel account.
1	And if ever there were an unfeeling handsome chin that looked as if, for certain, it had never been, in familiar parlance, ‘chucked’ by the hand of man, it was the chin curbed up so tight and close by that laced bridle.
1	'Now,' said Fagin, when they had left the room, 'I'll go and get you that cash, Nancy.
1	My husband had been a guardian angel to him and Ada, and he blessed us both and wished us all the joy that life could yield us.
1	“Codlin’s my friend,” she says, with a tear of gratitude a trickling down her little eye; “Codlin’s my friend,” she says--“not Short.
1	‘Now, my own Dora,’ said I, ‘you are very childish, and are talking nonsense.
1	Little need to show that this detested family name had long been anathematised by Saint Antoine, and was wrought into the fatal register.
1	‘Have you more than one clerk, you parrot, that you ask the question?
1	It a little surprised me to find that she hesitated and was not so radiantly willing as I had expected.
1	Of course, if you do press me, sir, I shall know I am wrong and will tell you."
1	‘Do you see much of Mr. Wickfield?’ I asked, to change the subject.
1	Don’t go prancing and capering about!
1	Has the difficulty grown easier because of so many failures?"
1	His Lordship married, in seventeen ninety-seven, Lady Jemima Bilberry, who was the second daughter by the third marriage--no!
1	I offer you the box and the label to take care of, but I’ll take care of the paper.’ Silas hesitated a little longer, and then suddenly releasing his corner, and resuming his buoyant and benignant tone, exclaimed, ‘What’s life without trustfulness!
1	If I went to see our young friends in their present ill-regulated state of mind, I should give them pain.
1	Undertakers on duty would be sprightly beside them; and a collation of funeral-baked meats, in comparison with these meals, would be a sparkling festivity.
1	‘Ah,’ said the new-comer, ‘it’s a good thing for both of us, isn’t it?
1	Now for it.’ And, with a very grave face, Mr. Weller slowly read as follows-- ‘A select company of the Bath footmen presents their compliments to Mr. Weller, and requests the pleasure of his company this evening, to a friendly swarry, consisting of a boiled leg of mutton with the usual trimmings.
1	So we all are, down to the dog.
1	I use the word natural, in the sense of its being unaffected; there was something comic in his distraught way, as though it would have been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was very near being so.
1	But when she was gone, I looked about me for a place to hide my face in, and got behind one of the gates in the brewery-lane, and leaned my sleeve against the wall there, and leaned my forehead on it and cried.
1	‘T’ other’s a black-haired chap in mulberry livery, with a wery large head?’ ‘Yes, yes, he is,’ said Mr. Pickwick and Sam, with great earnestness.
1	“Come in, come in!” “I am afraid of it,” she answered, shuddering.
1	‘I am indeed.’ Mrs Clennam, with a gentleness of which the dreaming Affery had never dreamed her to be capable, drew down the face of her little seamstress, and kissed her on the forehead.
1	It is likely to induce people to contrast Mrs Dombey in her relation towards my daughter, with Mrs Dombey in her relation towards myself.
1	Do say something more?’ ‘I’ll say that,’ said the dwarf, seizing her by the arm, ‘and do that too, which undone and unsaid would be best for you, unless you go directly.’ ‘Has anything happened?’ cried his wife.
1	Let us go; do let us go.’ ‘Give me the money,’ returned the old man, ‘I must have it.
1	He is a sharp-eyed man--a quick keen man--and he takes in everybody's look at him, all at once, individually and collectively, in a manner that stamps him a remarkable man.
1	What’s your name?’ ‘Silas Wegg.--I don’t,’ said Mr Wegg, bestirring himself to take the same precaution as before, ‘I don’t know why Silas, and I don’t know why Wegg.’ ‘Now, Wegg,’ said Mr Boffin, hugging his stick closer, ‘I want to make a sort of offer to you.
1	I hope you may be able to think in your own conscience that it is nonsense; you’ll find your spirits all the better for it in this--you’ll excuse my being so free--in this burying-ground of a place; which is wearing of me down.
1	cried the man; 'it won't answer here.
1	Let him remember it in that room, years to come!
1	The crowd about him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant, and from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back; at last it got to Jerry: “Witnesses.” “For which side?” “Against.” “Against what side?” “The prisoner's.” The Judge, whose eyes had gone in the general direction, recalled them, leaned back in his seat, and looked steadily at the man whose life was in his hand, as Mr. Attorney-General rose to spin the rope, grind the axe, and hammer the nails into the scaffold.
1	Two or three diplomatic interviews, the result of great subtlety on Mr Wegg’s part, but assuming the mask of careless yielding to a fortuitous combination of circumstances impelling him towards Clerkenwell, had enabled him to complete his bargain with Mr Venus.
1	Don’t offer to leave us--not on any account--but always stick to me and say that I’m your friend.
1	'Why, he was so angry, Oliver, that he forgot even to ask after you!'
1	said my guardian; the post had brought him several letters, and he was writing.
1	He then folded it up with great care, pressed it smooth between his two hands, put it in his pocket, and seemed to put my aunt away with it.
1	I would oppose her in everything, and compete with her.
1	When Ada was singing in the dark room?"
1	‘The governor hisself’ll be down here presently.’ ‘He’s a-cabbin’ it, I suppose?’ said the father.
1	His travelling baggage is easily carried in his hand, and he repairs with it on foot, to a hybrid hotel in a little square behind Aldersgate Street, near the General Post Office.
1	In Mrs Boffin’s presence, sir, we had better drop it.’ Mr Wegg thus came out of his disadvantage with quite a chivalrous air, and not only that, but by dint of repeating with a manly delicacy, ‘In Mrs Boffin’s presence, sir, we had better drop it!’ turned the disadvantage on Boffin, who felt that he had committed himself in a very painful manner.
1	These are my fears, and these fears I found upon your own demeanour.
1	Presently a dark object was seen in it, bearing towards us on the tide.
1	I ask your pardon though,’ said the old man, ‘if I spoke rather rough at first.
1	said Mr. Turveydrop, rising with his high-shouldered bow.
1	And all friends is no backerder, if not no forarder.
1	Mr. Skimpole's general position there would have rendered it so without the addition of what he presently said.
1	It gave me the most inconsistent opinions of her.
1	"Then you ought to be, you know," says Mr. Bucket; "and a friend of mine that you'll hear of one day as a Royal Academy sculptor would stand something handsome to make a drawing of your proportions for the marble.
1	The old nursery form runs, “Riddle-me-riddle-me-ree, p’raps you can’t tell me what this may be?” My reply runs, “No.
1	She took him to her own chamber, and, still holding him by the hand as if she feared to lose him for an instant, gathered together the little stock she had, and hung her basket on her arm.
1	But still a cloud seemed to hang over his companions which that great man could not but be sensible of, and was wholly at a loss to account for.
1	I sit here of a night surrounded by the lovely trophies of my art, and what have they done for me?
1	But, fortunately for Nicholas, Ralph Nickleby did not; and although he cast about all that day, and kept a corner of his brain working on the one anxious subject through all the round of schemes and business that came with it, night found him at last, still harping on the same theme, and still pursuing the same unprofitable reflections.
1	If it had not been Charles, it would have been another.
1	May I--for Miss Dombey’s sake, and for my own--take your hand before I go?’ She gave him the gloved hand she had maimed last night.
1	There were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but the parting was soon over.
1	To-day she is at Chesney Wold; yesterday she was at her house in town; to-morrow she may be abroad, for anything the fashionable intelligence can with confidence predict.
1	He could not do it.
1	‘This young couple, the lost youth and Miss Rosa, my ward, though so long betrothed, and so long recognising their betrothal, and so near being married—’ Mr. Grewgious saw a staring white face, and two quivering white lips, in the easy-chair, and saw two muddy hands gripping its sides.
1	‘Nothing,’ replied that gentleman, who had had a short man standing on each of his feet for the quarter of an hour immediately preceding.
1	If he had previously sustained his firmness and fortitude, it had been by an effort which had cost him no little pain; but the warm welcome, the hearty manner, the homely unaffected commiseration, of the good old man, went to his heart, and no inward struggle could prevent his showing it.
1	My gentleman from Cloisterham, I’ll be there before ye, and bide your coming.
1	Who is he?’ His hair had latterly began to change its colour.
1	Though I was timid about saying it, I ventured because of the sorrowful tone in which he had spoken.
1	‘--Her grandmother did not know what to do with her, and for some years was very unkind to her indeed.
1	Mr. Bounderby (whom he just knew by sight), at lunch on chop and sherry.
1	It would be much kinder of you, Kate, to ask Mr. Linkinwater or Mr. Cheeryble to interfere in his behalf, and see him righted.
1	And Miss Ledrook said, ‘Upon my word!’ Upon which Miss Snevellicci said that Miss Ledrook was a giddy thing; and Miss Ledrook said that Miss Snevellicci needn’t colour up quite so much; and Miss Snevellicci beat Miss Ledrook, and Miss Ledrook beat Miss Snevellicci.
1	‘I would be something to you, if I might.’ ‘What?’ said Louisa, almost sternly.
1	Miss Podsnap’s life had been, from her first appearance on this planet, altogether of a shady order; for, Mr Podsnap’s young person was likely to get little good out of association with other young persons, and had therefore been restricted to companionship with not very congenial older persons, and with massive furniture.
1	That may be, in part, natural to it; in part, the result of affliction.
1	On examination, however, they turned out to be strictly correct.
1	Negro coachmen and white; in straw hats, black hats, white hats, glazed caps, fur caps; in coats of drab, black, brown, green, blue, nankeen, striped jean and linen; and there, in that one instance (look while it passes, or it will be too late), in suits of livery.
1	You could tell it nothing that would surprise it, unless, indeed, it redounded to my credit or honour, and then it would scout you for a liar.
1	I have attained the dignity of twenty-one.
1	Love some good girl that will be what I was once to uncle, and be true to you, and worthy of you, and know no shame but me.
1	Oliver nearly swooned after this frightful scene, and was so weak that for an hour or more, he had not the strength to walk.
1	Scarcely venturing to whisper, but substituting dumb show for words, Fagin, and the young Jew who had admitted them, pointed out the pane of glass to Noah, and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in the adjoining room.
1	“My patient died, two hours before midnight--at a time, by my watch, answering almost to the minute when I had first seen her.
1	An anxious quarter of a hour elapsed; the jury came back; the judge was fetched in.
1	As the captive men were faded and haggard, so the iron was rusty, the stone was slimy, the wood was rotten, the air was faint, the light was dim.
1	She saw me reading it--reading it of late--I did very often--She watched me, saw me put it in the box that fitted into this, the box is gone, she has stolen it.
1	Of Miss Lavinia, who acts as a semi-auxiliary bridesmaid, being the first to cry, and of her doing homage (as I take it) to the memory of Pidger, in sobs; of Miss Clarissa applying a smelling-bottle; of Agnes taking care of Dora; of my aunt endeavouring to represent herself as a model of sternness, with tears rolling down her face; of little Dora trembling very much, and making her responses in faint whispers.
1	‘Madeline is not the near relation of our benefactors, but she is closely bound to them by ties as dear; and I was first intrusted with her history, specially because they reposed unbounded confidence in me, and believed that I was as true as steel.
1	As was natural, the head-quarters and great gathering-place of Monseigneur, in London, was Tellson's Bank.
1	it’s very kind of you, Copperfield,’ returned Uriah, undulating all over, ‘and we all know what an amiable character yours is; but you know that the moment I spoke to you the other night, you knew what I meant.
1	If you had shown the white feather, and let him pull your nose, he’d have got it into the paper; if you had sworn the peace against him, it would have been in the paper too, and he’d have been just as much talked about as you--don’t you see?’ ‘Oh, certainly,’ rejoined Nicholas; ‘but suppose I were to turn the tables, and pull HIS nose, what then?
1	(“I really think this must be a man!” was Mr. Lorry's breathless reflection, simultaneously with his coming against the wall.)
1	She is out.’ ‘Indeed, sir?’ ‘Yes, John.
1	Try, that’s a dear soul!
1	At least, Madam, I would leave it to you to decide whether she shall know of it or not.

1	Wonderful Members of Parliament, who, little more than twenty years before, had made themselves merry with the wild railroad theories of engineers, and given them the liveliest rubs in cross-examination, went down into the north with their watches in their hands, and sent on messages before by the electric telegraph, to say that they were coming.
1	‘Well, I think it is,’ said Mr. Wardle.
1	‘Then, of course,’ said Mrs. S., ‘he must beg his way, and he could do that, nowhere, but on the public road.’ ‘That’s true,’ exclaimed Squeers, clapping his hands.
1	There never was such a goose.
1	I laid out twenty pound upon it.
1	‘She has been forgotten,’ he said, in a tone of pity not free from reproach.
1	That young man was generally required to read out of some book to the Captain, for one hour, every evening; and as the Captain implicitly believed that all books were true, he accumulated, by this means, many remarkable facts.
1	As I looked along the clustered roofs, with church-towers and spires shooting into the unusually clear air, the sun rose up, and a veil seemed to be drawn from the river, and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters.
1	with his protestation that he never thought his brother would have been half so glad to see him as all this!
1	Bob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler.
1	The loan from your lady and gentleman of twenty shillings to fit out a basket with, would be a fortune for me.
1	All this, Mrs. Snagsby, as an injured woman, and the friend of Mrs. Chadband, and the follower of Mr. Chadband, and the mourner of the late Mr. Tulkinghorn, is here to certify under the seal of confidence, with every possible confusion and involvement possible and impossible, having no pecuniary motive whatever, no scheme or project but the one mentioned, and bringing here, and taking everywhere, her own dense atmosphere of dust, arising from the ceaseless working of her mill of jealousy.
1	But that young gentleman, considering his nautical friend as merely in a state of preparation for the interview he was going to have, was quite satisfied, and did not review his own discreet conduct without chuckle.
1	Now you shall judge if I am worthy of belief, both as I was, and as I am.’ Still upon her knees, and with her eyes upon the fire, and the fire shining on her ruined beauty and her wild black hair, one long tress of which she pulled over her shoulder, and wound about her hand, and thoughtfully bit and tore while speaking, she went on: ‘When I was young and pretty, and this,’ plucking contemptuously at the hair she held, ‘was only handled delicately, and couldn’t be admired enough, my mother, who had not been very mindful of me as a child, found out my merits, and was fond of me, and proud of me.
1	Then, little woman, can I do better for a time than retain Mrs. Woodcourt here?"
1	In the reluctance he had felt to believe that she loved any one; in his desire to set that question at rest; in a half-formed consciousness he had had that there would be a kind of nobleness in his helping her love for any one, was there no suppressed something on his own side that he had hushed as it arose?
1	Recollect Bella; come, you must keep her spirits up, poor girl.’ The good old lady heard this, for her lip quivered as her son said it.
1	That’s the cause of my presenting myself here this morning.’ ‘I am very glad of any cause, sir,’ said the Notary, ‘which procures me the honour of this visit.’ ‘Sir,’ retorted the stranger, ‘you speak like a mere man of the world, and I think you something better.
1	I consumed the whole time in thinking how strange it was that I should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and crime; that, in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter evening, I should have first encountered it; that, it should have reappeared on two occasions, starting out like a stain that was faded but not gone; that, it should in this new way pervade my fortune and advancement.
1	Defamation of character: action for damages.
1	‘What do you mean?’ returned the angry mother.
1	Drawing her chair close to it, she sat there, for a little time, without speaking; but at length she raised her head, and looked round.
1	I’ll put him in harness, and I’ll bear him up tight, and I’ll break him and drive him.
1	Begin at once.’ ‘Certainly I will.
1	This is an extraordinary day in my calendar.
1	What do you want to conwey to your own father, you young Rip?
1	‘Yes, of course you did!
1	‘I shall be better presently.’ ‘You will be better presently, Lucretia!’ repeated Mrs Chick, with exceeding scorn.
1	said the gentleman who had spoken first.
1	You are acquainted with the young lady, most probably?” “Not personally,” said I.
1	But I will represent to you at once, that to argue against it with me is useless.’ ‘Good, sir,’ answered Mr Rugg, shrugging his shoulders.
1	Now, if my public duties were not a favourite child to me, if I were not occupied with large measures on a vast scale, these petty details might grieve me very much, Miss Summerson.
1	A paper fly-cage dangled from the ceiling, to which he occasionally raised his eyes in gloomy thought; and, as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy net-work, Mr. Bumble would heave a deep sigh, while a more gloomy shadow overspread his countenance.
1	Less guarded and more trustful?
1	It is made of bad intentions too.
1	‘I’ve got a little trifle here, now,’ said Mr Slum, taking off his hat which was full of scraps of paper, ‘a little trifle here, thrown off in the heat of the moment, which I should say was exactly the thing you wanted to set this place on fire with.
1	‘Your little boy is a very long time gone.’ ‘Why it’s a good long way to the Borough, sir,’ remonstrated Mrs. Bardell.
1	After a blank, I found that I was lying unbound, on the floor, in the same place, with my head on some one's knee.
1	‘I thought it better to come myself,’ said Mr. Pickwick, addressing Mr. Winkle, as Sam disencumbered him of his great-coat and travelling-shawl, ‘to ascertain, before I gave my consent to Sam’s employment in this matter, that you are quite in earnest and serious, with respect to this young lady.’ ‘Serious, from my heart--from my soul!’ returned Mr. Winkle, with great energy.
1	He has won the pool.” It was as much as I could do to assent.
1	The childish prayer of that old birthday when I had aspired to be industrious, contented, and true-hearted and to do good to some one and win some love to myself if I could came back into my mind with a reproachful sense of all the happiness I had since enjoyed and all the affectionate hearts that had been turned towards me.
1	She raised her eyes quickly, shook her head, and, in a kind of triumph, almost laughed.
1	He wonders what he did it for.
1	The wine flowed freely, as indeed it had done all day.
1	Let me stay a little while!"
1	He naturally loves a certain person, on my account; and acts solely for a certain person’s good.
1	But with Mrs. Wititterly the two titles were all sufficient; coarseness became humour, vulgarity softened itself down into the most charming eccentricity; insolence took the guise of an easy absence of reserve, attainable only by those who had had the good fortune to mix with high folks.
1	I begged permission to retain him, truly saying that he was not at all troublesome, and carried him upstairs and laid him on my bed.
1	That envoy found her on a little square of carpet, so extremely diminutive in reference to the size of her stone and marble floor that she looked as if she might have had it spread for the trying on of a ready-made pair of shoes; or as if she had come into possession of the enchanted piece of carpet, bought for forty purses by one of the three princes in the Arabian Nights, and had that moment been transported on it, at a wish, into a palatial saloon with which it had no connection.
1	Florence was the most grateful little creature in the world, and it was delightful to see her bright gratitude beaming in her face.
1	‘That night, in the silence and desolation of his miserable room, the wretched man knelt down by the dead body of his wife, and called on God to witness a terrible oath, that from that hour, he devoted himself to revenge her death and that of his child; that thenceforth to the last moment of his life, his whole energies should be directed to this one object; that his revenge should be protracted and terrible; that his hatred should be undying and inextinguishable; and should hunt its object through the world.
1	‘And there’s my sister Jemima at the door, I do declare’ cried Polly, ‘with my own sweet precious baby in her arms!’ The sight added such an extensive pair of wings to Polly’s impatience, that she set off down the Gardens at a run, and bouncing on Jemima, changed babies with her in a twinkling; to the unutterable astonishment of that young damsel, on whom the heir of the Dombeys seemed to have fallen from the clouds.
1	I live here with my brother.
1	As Coketown cast ashes not only on its own head but on the neighbourhood’s too—after the manner of those pious persons who do penance for their own sins by putting other people into sackcloth—it was customary for those who now and then thirsted for a draught of pure air, which is not absolutely the most wicked among the vanities of life, to get a few miles away by the railroad, and then begin their walk, or their lounge in the fields.
1	‘Why, no,’ says Mortimer; ‘remarkable thing, you are all wrong.
1	Express comes through at four, Sir.--It don’t stop.’ He passed his hand across his throbbing head, and looked at his watch.
1	I wish to lead up to it by degrees.
1	The glare of the sinking flame, reflected in the oaken panels whose carved tops were dimly seen in the dusky roof--the aged walls, where strange shadows came and went with every flickering of the fire--the solemn presence, within, of that decay which falls on senseless things the most enduring in their nature: and, without, and round about on every side, of Death--filled her with deep and thoughtful feelings, but with none of terror or alarm.
1	He was dressed in a particularly gorgeous manner, with plenty of articles of jewellery about him--all about three sizes larger than those which are usually worn by gentlemen--and a rough greatcoat to crown the whole.
1	The whole population were shy of him on these various counts of indictment, but especially the last, which involved a species of domestic treason; and he soon became so confirmed in his seclusion, that his only time for walking up and down was when the evening Club were assembled at their songs and toasts and sentiments, and when the yard was nearly left to the women and children.
1	All this looked tolerably expensive, I thought, and gave me an agreeable notion of a proctor’s business.
1	"Look at the boy you're waiting for, who's gone out to do me a good turn.
1	Never mind; I dare say I shall manage to recollect it, in the course of half an hour or so.’ The prim man arrived at this point just as the glasses came back, when Mr. Bob Sawyer, who had been absorbed in attention during the whole time, said he should very much like to hear the end of it, for, so far as it went, it was, without exception, the very best story he had ever heard.
1	You have so many things to think about,’ returned Mr Meagles, clapping him on the shoulder, as if his weakness must not be left to itself on any account.
1	But you were so much better than I, so necessary to me in every boyish hope and disappointment, that to have you to confide in, and rely upon in everything, became a second nature, supplanting for the time the first and greater one of loving you as I do!’ Still weeping, but not sadly--joyfully!
1	Not even the influence of the softer passion on the young gentlemen--and they all, to a boy, doted on Florence--could restrain them from taking quite a noisy leave of Paul; waving hats after him, pressing downstairs to shake hands with him, crying individually ‘Dombey, don’t forget me!’ and indulging in many such ebullitions of feeling, uncommon among those young Chesterfields.
1	He could make no way at all.
1	Sikes slackened his pace when they reached this spot:  the girl being quite unable to support any longer, the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked.
1	But I suppose there is a shock of regret which may exist without much tenderness.
1	Part with the child, unless it should be necessary to produce it to clear you, and then it shall be produced.
1	To return to my memorandum.
1	Do you, though?’ ‘Certainly,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	"You were going to say, thirdly?"
1	It rarely happens in the business streets that a tradesman, if I may venture to call anybody a tradesman, where everybody is a merchant, resides above his store; so that many occupations are often carried on in one house, and the whole front is covered with boards and inscriptions.
1	"Pray be careful of yourself, miss.
1	It went away into the distance, and what do you think it seemed to do as it moved with the waves?’ ‘Pitch,’ said Mr Toots.
1	No warmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him.
1	[Picture: Stephen Blackpool recovered from the Old Hell Shaft] ‘It ha’ shined upon me,’ he said reverently, ‘in my pain and trouble down below.
1	‘How far is it to any town or village?’ she asked of the husband.
1	"And to attend the court no more?"
1	I suppose your loyalty to John Jarndyce will allow that?"
1	‘Well, young man, now you _have _done it!’ said the short chairman.
1	And his hammer is handed him.
1	This was given out, sir, to a writer who lodges just over on the opposite side of the lane."
1	For that brief time, his face is knitted and stern.
1	Someone of a nobler character, and more worthy altogether than anyone I have ever seen here, must rise up, before I give my consent.
1	How can I think of you as being on equal terms with me?
1	He was very close to her just then, gentlemen, so he really ought to know.
1	His windows are dark and quiet, and his door is shut.
1	If the fire was to go out, through any accident, I verily believe she’d go out too, and never come to life again.’ As they looked at her, I looked at her also.
1	Notwithstanding that Mr Quilp had a strong conviction to the contrary, founded on his recollection of having carefully taken it out, he was fain to admit that this was possible, and therefore went grumbling to the door where, sure enough, he found it.
1	Nancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard, in which there were many:  which, to judge from the diversity of their appearance, were filled with several kinds of liquids.
1	Tim is a fine fellow.
1	How does that little old song go, which, under pretence of being cheerful, is by far the most lugubrious I ever heard in my life?
1	I am a particularly Angular man,’ proceeded Mr. Grewgious, as if it suddenly occurred to him to mention it, ‘and I am not used to give anything away.
1	I believed that the Doctor was right, and I had no worse suspicions.
1	‘This way,’ said the first speaker; ‘they notch in here--it’s the best place in the whole field;’ and the cricketer, panting on before, preceded them to the tent.
1	‘Now, shiny Villiam,’ said the hostler to the deputy hostler, ‘give the gen’lm’n the ribbons.’ Shiny Villiam’--so called, probably, from his sleek hair and oily countenance--placed the reins in Mr. Pickwick’s left hand; and the upper hostler thrust a whip into his right.
1	Are you, or ain’t you?’ ‘Go on, Mr Boffin; don’t appeal to me.’ ‘Not appeal to YOU,’ retorted Mr Boffin as if he hadn’t done so.
1	Without another word he led Nicholas into the passage, and thence into the official pantry at the end of it, where he thrust him into a chair, and mounting upon his high stool, sat, with his arms hanging, straight down by his sides, gazing fixedly upon him, as from a tower of observation.
1	Wal’r, as is already in your business!
1	The cheek a little worn, the eye a little larger in appearance, and more lustrous, but the haughty bearing just the same.
1	At this instant there came a violent gust of wind; the light was blown out; Mr. Winkle felt himself irresistibly impelled on to the steps; and the door blew to, with a loud crash.
1	But this was its usual aspect.
1	Then, there was a young lady who had made Mrs. Kenwigs’s dress, and who--it was the most convenient thing in the world--living in the two-pair back, gave up her bed to the baby, and got a little girl to watch it.
1	In this attitude he fell directly into a reverie from which he was only aroused by his wife’s calling to him from her ottoman, when they had been for some quarter of an hour alone.
1	Bradley got him round, with his back to the Lock, and still worked him backward.
1	The occupant of the pew in the hall, having said thus much, stirs the fire and leaves the triumvirate to warm themselves.
1	he said abruptly and fiercely.
1	You belong to much brighter and better scenes.
1	‘Thank you,’ said Mrs. Micawber.
1	Mr. Smallweed, beckoning Mr. Chadband, takes a moment's counsel with him in a whisper.
1	He had not heard my tap at the door, and only raised his eyes when I laid my hand upon his shoulder.
1	But he never forgot or pardoned that circumstance of the shilling; holding that if he had come back to get another he would have done well enough, but that his returning to work out the former gift was a stain upon his moral character which no penitence or contrition could ever wash away.
1	Hangin’s wulgar, so don’t you have nothin’ to say to that.
1	"Upon the whole, not so bad, sir," said Mrs. Blinder; "but certainly not so many as would have been if their father's calling had been different.
1	Mr Sampson Brass, who no doubt had his reasons for looking sharply about him, soon learnt to distinguish the pony’s trot and the clatter of the little chaise at the corner of the street.
1	‘I was coming to call for you, making sure to catch you before you left; but your mother and I have been talking over family affairs, and the time has slipped away so rapidly--’ ‘Well, now, hasn’t it?’ interposed Mrs. Nickleby, quite insensible to the sarcastic tone of Ralph’s last remark.
1	On the Day of Judgment.
1	No!’--I thought Peggotty would have thrown the candlestick away, she was so emphatic with it.
1	‘Well, Nelly,’ said the young fellow aloud.
1	of money?’ ‘No, no, no.
1	‘Get on a little faster; put a little more steam on, ma’am, pray.’ ‘This morning,’ said the old lady slowly--‘this morning, she--’ ‘She came back, ma’am, I suppose,’ said Bob, with great animation.
1	Here I am!’ Before Arthur could speak to him in his indignant wonder, Cavalletto followed him into the room.
1	I cannot leave him even now, without remembering with a pang, at once his modest fortitude and his great sorrow.
1	All the uses and scents of the brewery might have evaporated with its last reek of smoke.
1	‘That and to get a writing to be fust-hand Lock Keeper.
1	He uttered the word with a full round emphasis, dwelling upon it as long as he decently could, and when he could hold out no longer without attracting observation, stood gasping it to himself as if even that were a satisfaction.
1	With the same child’s heart within her, as of old: even with the child’s sweet timid eyes and clustering hair: Florence, as strange to her father in her early maiden bloom, as in her nursery time, crept down the staircase listening as she went, and drew near to his room.
1	The watches seemed to jostle, and to trip each other up.
1	They were at Millbank, and the river rolled on their left.
1	‘Well, no more they would, Mr. Noggs, and that’s very true,’ rejoined Mrs Nickleby.
1	Congratulations, Mr. Pip.” We shook hands,--he was always a remarkably short shaker,--and I thanked him.
1	‘My dear sir!’ for Mr. Dick was shaking hands with him again; ‘I am deeply sensible of your cordiality!’ ‘How do you find yourself?’ said Mr. Dick, with an anxious look.
1	And really the great friendship and consideration of personally associating Sophy with the joyful occasion, and inviting her to be a bridesmaid in conjunction with Miss Wickfield, demands my warmest thanks.
1	As I approached the house, I was strongly inclined to turn back, for I felt what a desperate attempt it was to make an impression on Mr. Skimpole and how extremely likely it was that he would signally defeat me.
1	The door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into the room and said something.
1	‘I don’t know but that yours may answer better, but I want the patience for it.’ ‘You were born a genius, Mr. Nickleby,’ said old Arthur.
1	B. the honour to accept it; and the greatest service Joe can render you, Ma’am, just now, is, to lead you into table!’ With this, the Major gave his arm to Edith; Mr Dombey led the way with Mrs Skewton; Mr Carker went last, smiling on the party.
1	as ghostly to the touch as to the sight!
1	I shouldn’t have given my mind to it again, I hope, if to this prison you had not been brought, and in an hour unfortunate for me, this day!’ (In his agitation Young John adopted his mother’s powerful construction of sentences.)
1	This discovery drove Mrs. Kenwigs to despair; for the hairdresser lived three streets and eight dangerous crossings off; Morleena could not be trusted to go there alone, even if such a proceeding were strictly proper: of which Mrs. Kenwigs had her doubts; Mr. Kenwigs had not returned from business; and there was nobody to take her.
1	Mr Dombey walks up to the drawing-room, to bide his time.
1	He was ‘going,’ he added, to St. Louis, to fetch his family, whom he had left behind; but he seemed in no great hurry to bring on these incumbrances, for when we moved away, he loitered back into the cabin, and was plainly bent on stopping there so long as his money lasted.
1	Turns the key upon her, mistress."
1	‘Heaven forgive me; but I shouldn’t cry my eyes quite out of my head, if they choked him.
1	The old woman you mentioned, sir—’ ‘The old woman I mentioned, ma’am,’ said Bounderby, cutting the matter short, as it was nothing to boast about, ‘is not laid hold of; but, she may take her oath she will be, if that is any satisfaction to her villainous old mind.
1	The very picture of a man whom nothing could move or soften.
1	Clothes are drying in the same yard; female slaves, with cotton handkerchiefs twisted round their heads are running to and fro on the hotel business; black waiters cross and recross with dishes in their hands; two great dogs are playing upon a mound of loose bricks in the centre of the little square; a pig is turning up his stomach to the sun, and grunting ‘that’s comfortable!’; and neither the men, nor the women, nor the dogs, nor the pig, nor any created creature, takes the smallest notice of the triangle, which is tingling madly all the time.
1	And take care they do not spoil you by flattery, child!"
1	Whether she saw it in a succession, on the part of the neglected child, to the affectionate concern so often expressed by her dead brother--or a love that sought to twine itself about the heart that had loved him, and that could not bear to be shut out from sympathy with such a sorrow, in such sad community of love and grief--or whether she only recognised the earnest and devoted spirit which, although discarded and repulsed, was wrung with tenderness long unreturned, and in the waste and solitude of this bereavement cried to him to seek a comfort in it, and to give some, by some small response--whatever may have been her understanding of it, it moved Miss Tox.
1	There was an improving party assembled on the auspicious occasion, who knew what everything they had to eat and drink was made of, and how it was imported or exported, and in what quantities, and in what bottoms, whether native or foreign, and all about it.
1	Clennam accepted the boon with a look of gratitude, and held it in his hand under the pressure of a little embarrassment, which was not relieved when Mr F.’s Aunt, elevating her voice into a cry of considerable power, exclaimed, ‘He has a proud stomach, this chap!
1	Come, straggling lights into the windows of the ugly houses; and you who do iniquity therein, do it at least with this dread scene shut out!
1	_You'll_ pay for this, my fine fellers.
1	But it is whispered that when he is most ferocious towards his old foe, he is really most considerate, and that Sir Leicester, in the dignity of being implacable, little supposes how much he is humoured.
1	"I was about to add," he presently goes on, "I was about to add, respecting this attack, that it was unfortunately simultaneous with a slight misunderstanding between my Lady and myself.
1	Roused into new strength and energy, and stimulated by the noise within the house which announced that an entrance had really been effected, he set his foot against the stack of chimneys, fastened one end of the rope tightly and firmly round it, and with the other made a strong running noose by the aid of his hands and teeth almost in a second.
1	Jemima, I don’t know what I should ever do with myself, if it wasn’t for Susan Nipper; I shouldn’t be here now but for her.’ ‘Oh do sit down, Miss Nipper, if you please,’ quoth Jemima.
1	It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the long expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!
1	None of that till one’s obliged to do it, sir.
1	I have never blamed you, and I never shall.’ He took her outstretched hand, and retained it in his.
1	The place was last painted or whitewashed beyond the memory of man, and the two chimneys smoke, and there is a loose outer surface of soot everywhere, and the dull cracked windows in their heavy frames have but one piece of character in them, which is a determination to be always dirty and always shut unless coerced.
1	So it is, and such is life.
1	I was at a loss to account for this surprising circumstance, and could not help giving my mind to speculations about it, until by and by Millers came down with the baby, which baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to Mrs. Pocket, when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket, baby and all, and was caught by Herbert and myself.
1	‘Stand by and knock again.
1	"I don't know how long I've been among the Spirits.
1	Isaac pocketed his gains with the air of a man who had quite made up his mind to win, all along, and was neither surprised nor pleased.
1	You remember dear little John Harmon, before he went to school?
1	‘Yesterday morning, when a letter was received from Mr. Wardle, stating that you would be home with his sister at night, the melancholy which had hung over our friend during the whole of the previous day, was observed to increase.
1	He seems to know that they have an inclination to shrink from him, partly for what he is and partly for what he has caused.
1	"It's very little at present, Charley.
1	‘Now,’ said Lightwood, ‘what’s your name?’ But further precaution was still due to the sweat of this honest fellow’s brow.
1	For the rest, I beg it may be understood, Mr Rokesmith, that there is an end of this between us, now and for ever.’ ‘Now and for ever,’ he repeated.
1	‘Am I right?’ said the Captain.
1	A most difficult position to carry off.
1	By this time, I should say,’ added Richard, getting his left cheek into profile, and looking complacently at the reflection of a very little scrap of whisker in the looking-glass; ‘by this time, I should say, the iron has entered into her soul.
1	‘Now, as you showed me in your face, Tom Gradgrind, that you wanted to speak to me,’ he resumed, ‘here I am.
1	‘Well, she’s unsettled at present,’ said Mr. Omer.
1	‘But I have been tied to the old woman all ni-ight.’ ‘Hear him,’ said Sir Mulberry, turning to his two friends.
1	Coming out of his fit of grief, he clenched his pocket-handkerchief once more.
1	If she had any lingering fancy in the nature of hope left, that Edith and her father might be happier together, in some distant time, she had none, now, that her father would ever love her.
1	‘No,’ said Mr Boffin, after a glance at the pavement, as if it were made of faces and he were trying to match the man’s, ‘I DON’T know you.’ ‘I am nobody,’ said the stranger, ‘and not likely to be known; but Mr Boffin’s wealth--’ ‘Oh!
1	What was it that he told thee?
1	‘She’s a fine creature,’ said Mr. Magnus.
1	‘But I wake when it blows, and tremble to think of Uncle Dan and Ham and believe I hear ‘em crying out for help.
1	But the young man caught her to his bosom; and imprinting one kiss on her beautiful forehead, hurried from the room.
1	You hear the truth.’ Whatever he had heard, and whether it deserved that name or another, it sank into Clennam’s mind.
1	‘It can’t be helped you know.
1	The trooper puts his hand into his breast and answers with a long breath, "I must do it, sir."
1	She says it with a kind of scorn--though not of Rosa--and sits brooding, looking dreamily at her.
1	Dinnot say a word till thou’st droonk it a’!
1	‘Again the light cloud passed across the picture, and again the subject changed.
1	Whenever Mr Carker was of the party, as he often was, during the progress of Mr Dombey’s recovery, and afterwards, Edith held herself more removed from her, and was more distant towards her, than at other times.
1	At this juncture, proclamation was made by another married lady, that the baby had begun to eat like anything; whereupon the two married ladies, already mentioned, rushed tumultuously into the bedroom to behold him in the act.
1	hear!’ said the smoking gentleman, in the Mosaic jewellery.
1	And yet will you tell me that I oughtn’t to go into Society?
1	‘Twice in the week,’ said Miss Clarissa, ‘but, as a rule, not oftener.’ I bowed again.
1	Mrs. Corney, with great propriety, turned her head away, and released her hand to get at her pocket-handkerchief; but insensibly replaced it in that of Mr. Bumble.
1	In a lighthouse.’ Mortimer laughed again, and Eugene, having laughed too for the first time, as if he found himself on reflection rather entertaining, relapsed into his usual gloom, and drowsily said, as he enjoyed his cigar, ‘No, there is no help for it; one of the prophetic deliveries of M. R. F. must for ever remain unfulfilled.
1	I found myself one of these, frantically imploring a knot of sailors whom I knew, not to let those two lost creatures perish before our eyes.
1	After a while and when it might be prudent, if you should want to slip Tom, Jack, or Richard on board a foreign packet-boat, there he is--ready.” Much comforted by these considerations, I thanked Wemmick again and again, and begged him to proceed.
1	"I know the wale," replies Jo, staring, "and the bonnet, and the gownd."
1	I came, one evening before sunset, down into a valley, where I was to rest.
1	The Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.
1	‘I wish to free you from the restraint which your present position imposes upon you, and to mark my sense of your fidelity and many excellent qualities, by enabling you to marry this girl at once, and to earn an independent livelihood for yourself and family.
1	There he is, you see!
1	‘Wery good power o’ suction, Sammy,’ said Mr. Weller the elder, looking into the pot, when his first-born had set it down half empty.
1	I hope you will not judge of me by my hesitating manner when I speak to you.
1	Attended by these her trusty companions, therefore, her honest sunburnt face looking cheerily out of a rough straw bonnet, Mrs. Bagnet now arrives, fresh-coloured and bright, in George's Shooting Gallery.
1	In plain commonplace matter-of-fact, then, it was a fine morning--so fine that you would scarcely have believed that the few months of an English summer had yet flown by.
1	‘Compose yourself, sir,’ said Clennam, ‘and take a little time to think.
1	‘You never cried Widdy Warning before you begun to-night,’ says Durdles, unexpectedly reminded of, or imagining, an injury.
1	‘We know nobody who would come here at this hour.’ Mrs. Nickleby surmised, however, that perhaps the counting-house was burnt down, or perhaps ‘the Mr. Cheerybles’ had sent to take Nicholas into partnership (which certainly appeared highly probable at that time of night), or perhaps Mr. Linkinwater had run away with the property, or perhaps Miss La Creevy was taken in, or perhaps-- But a hasty exclamation from Kate stopped her abruptly in her conjectures, and Ralph Nickleby walked into the room.
1	"Well," observed my guardian, half pleasantly, half seriously, "that's a great occasion and will give my fair cousin some necessary business to transact in assertion of her independence, and will make London a more convenient place for all of us.
1	After this wise remark he felt that he was scarcely shining with brilliancy, and became aware that he was nervous.
1	O, you must take the purse!
1	Take care of the dear husband you have recovered, and don't move your pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now, till you see me again!
1	Mr. Weevle reverts from this intelligence to the Galaxy portraits implicated, and seems to know the originals, and to be known of them.
1	I feel a particular interest in being acquainted with it.
1	Forgive your old guardian, in restoring him to his old place in your affections; and blot it out of your memory.
1	Sir Leicester is there, and she wishes to speak to him first.
1	But in a few minutes he would recklessly conjure up some undefinable means by which they were both to be made rich and happy for ever, and would become as gay as possible.
1	‘Pray, Mr Headstone, what is the name,’ he asked, again trying to make a diversion, ‘of young Hexam’s sister?’ ‘Her name is Lizzie,’ said the schoolmaster, with a strong contraction of his whole face.
1	Let me think now.’ The Father of the Marshalsea tapped his forehead [‘Memory weak.’) ‘John Edward, sir?
1	She sits in it, with an elbow on one of its arms, and her chin upon her hand, intent upon him.
1	At this second interchange of the Christian name, Madame Defarge, still using her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another grain of cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.
1	How can they go well together?
1	‘He means to say,’ said Job, advancing a few paces, ‘that if he is not carried off by the fever, he will pay the money back again.
1	The instant that she turned her head, the Captain sprung out of his chair, and interposed his hand.
1	"I really don't, sir," I returned.
1	'Is there--' demanded Monks with a faltering tongue,--'is there--no middle course?'
1	Finding, however, his English birth an insurmountable obstacle to his advancement in this pursuit (notwithstanding that his art was in high repute and favour), he assumed the name of an Italian image lad, with whom he had become acquainted; and afterwards tumbled with extraordinary success, and to overflowing audiences.
1	The servant takes as little heed of what he says as she seems to take of what she has said herself.
1	Tucked within the band were three small notes--one addressed to Ada, one to Richard, one to me.
1	‘Excuse me,’ replied Magnus, standing on the wheel.
1	‘You have promised and vowed.
1	‘Certainly,’ said he, aloud; ‘and Affery will light us, I dare say.’ Affery was excusing herself with ‘Don’t ask nothing of me, Arthur!’ when Mr Flintwinch stopped her with ‘Why not?
1	The pastrycook knew who was on his books, and in that knowledge could be calm, with a few glass cylinders of dowager peppermint-drops in his window, and half-a-dozen ancient specimens of currant-jelly.
1	She’ll speak to you about it herself, and now she’ll find you prepared, Affery.” That same day she spoke to me, and she said, “So, Affery, I understand that you and Jeremiah are going to be married.
1	On the last grievance as her climax, she laid great stress--and might have laid greater, had she known that if Mr Julius Handford had a twin brother upon earth, Mr John Rokesmith was the man.
1	It does just as well as another.
1	These ceremonies passed, Cornelia led Paul upstairs to the top of the house; which was rather a slow journey, on account of Paul being obliged to land both feet on every stair, before he mounted another.
1	All the praise that anyone can give to C. P. Barkis, she deserves, and more!
1	He had no time to think about the matter, however; for Mr. Bumble gave him a tap on the head, with his cane, to wake him up: and another on the back to make him lively: and bidding him to follow, conducted him into a large white-washed room, where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round a table.
1	Mr Dombey has gone home long ago.
1	‘It’s not put into his head to be buried.
1	‘Snodgrass!--since last Christmas!’ were the first broken words that issued from the lips of the confounded gentleman.
1	In that long imprisonment here, and in her own long confinement to her room, did his mother find a balance to be struck?
1	But totally to prevent any unpleasantness or mistake that might arise on what I consider an important point, to be made quite clear at the close of our acquaintance, I beg the leave of Mr Boffin and Mr John Harmon to repeat an observation which I have already had the pleasure of bringing under your notice.
1	Of all the king’s knights ‘tis the flower,           Always gay!’ Partly in his old habit of submission, partly because his not doing it might injure his benefactor, and partly because he would as soon do it as anything else, Cavalletto took up the Refrain this time.
1	Now he is struggling harder to get back.
1	He appeared surprised at this--I see him stop and look at me now--and after considering for a few moments, said he wanted to call on an old person who lived not far off, and that the best way would be for me to buy some bread, or whatever I liked best that was wholesome, and make my breakfast at her house, where we could get some milk.
1	These were all reasons for the greatest caution and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to Mrs. Maylie, whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the worthy doctor on the subject.
1	If I say I’ve an ambition to make your Agnes my Agnes, I have as good a right to it as another man.
1	His active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Tiny Tim before another word was spoken, escorted by his brother and sister to his stool before the fire; and while Bob, turning up his cuffs--as if, poor fellow, they were capable of being made more shabby--compounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round and round and put it on the hob to simmer; Master Peter, and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose, with which they soon returned in high procession.
1	There were traces of his gore in that spot, and I covered them with garden-mould from the eye of man.
1	‘Do the honours, Tommy, do the honours,’ said the other gentleman, tapping him reproachfully on the crown of the hat with his stick.
1	Monsieur says to him in effect, “My nephew, I introduce to you a lady of strong force of character, like myself--a resolved lady, a stern lady, a lady who has a will that can break the weak to powder: a lady without pity, without love, implacable, revengeful, cold as the stone, but raging as the fire.” Ah!
1	After completely exhausting herself, she stopped to take breath:  and, as if suddenly recollecting herself, and deploring her inability to do something she was bent upon, wrung her hands, and burst into tears.
1	After patting him on the head, and pressing his small hand again, he took leave of Doctor Blimber, Mrs Blimber, and Miss Blimber, with his usual polite frigidity, and walked out of the study.
1	“Will you accompany me,” said Mr. Lorry, joyfully relieved after reading this note aloud, “to where his wife resides?” “Yes,” returned Defarge.
1	Answer:"--which proved fatal to the inquiry for ten years--"Mr. Vholes is considered, in the profession, a MOST respectable man."
1	As that gentleman made his way among the crowding children to the door, Rob retreated on his mother, and took her and the baby in the same repentant hug.
1	At last, undressing himself with a gloomy resolution, he got into bed.
1	‘I don’t know what I wouldn’t give,’ said Polly, ‘to see the poor little dear before he gets used to ‘em.’ ‘Why, then, I tell you what, Mrs Richards,’ retorted Nipper, who had been admitted to her confidence, ‘see him and make your mind easy.’ ‘Mr Dombey wouldn’t like it,’ said Polly.
1	She laughed and nodded her head a great many times, and even repeated after Biddy, the words “Pip” and “Property.” But I doubt if they had more meaning in them than an election cry, and I cannot suggest a darker picture of her state of mind.
1	‘They are both a-going out fast.’ ‘Barkis, my dear!’ said Peggotty.
1	But John Baptist, widely staring, muttering a number of invocations and ejaculations, tremblingly backing into a corner, slipping on his trousers, and tying his coat by the two sleeves round his neck, manifested an unmistakable desire to escape by the door rather than renew the acquaintance.
1	The man knew her, and might by a fortunate chance see her, or hear of her; that was something, as enlisting one pair of eyes and ears the more.
1	The prison for the State at Sing Sing is, on the other hand, a model jail.
1	And now, I must confess, the recollection of what I had seen on that night when Mr. Maldon went away, first began to return upon me with a meaning it had never had, and to trouble me.
1	In the hard-grained face of Wegg, and in his stiff knotty figure (he looked like a German wooden toy), there was expressed a politic conciliation, which had no spontaneity in it.
1	Just as you cheat yourself into making out that you didn’t do all this business because you were a rigorous woman, all slight, and spite, and power, and unforgiveness, but because you were a servant and a minister, and were appointed to do it.
1	The wind sweeps jeeringly over Father, whips him with the frayed ends of his dress and his jagged hair, tries to turn him where he lies stark on his back, and force his face towards the rising sun, that he may be shamed the more.
1	That was, in other words, that this great statesman was always yet to be told that it behoved the Pilot of the ship to do anything but prosper in the private loaf and fish trade ashore, the crew being able, by dint of hard pumping, to keep the ship above water without him.
1	Messengers were sent to that place, and the whole town looked for Stephen to be brought in next day.
1	Neither had Mrs. Nickleby herself; which is, in some sort, an explanation of the circumstance.
1	In the little world in which children have their existence whosoever brings them up, there is nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice.
1	Then you must pay it between you or you must both be sued for it and both suffer.
1	Oh, Lord, yes, it's due east--must be!"
1	I wanted you to come and stay a few days with us.
1	The money was produced on both sides, and the Honourable Mr. Snobb was elected to the double office of stake-holder and time-keeper.
1	‘Ah!’ said Little Dorrit, shaking her head with the mild despair of a lifetime.
1	And I’ll--I’ll--’ Peggotty fell to kissing the keyhole, as she couldn’t kiss me.
1	‘Bring a bucket, and throw it all over her; it’ll do her good, and she richly deserves it.’ ‘Ugh, you brute!’ ejaculated the kind-hearted landlady.
1	‘Yes, sir.’ ‘What did you go away for?’ The fat boy looked hopelessly in the face of everybody at table, and stammered out that he didn’t know.
1	But as the pavements of Bristol are not the widest or cleanest upon earth, so its streets are not altogether the straightest or least intricate; and Mr. Winkle, being greatly puzzled by their manifold windings and twistings, looked about him for a decent shop in which he could apply afresh for counsel and instruction.
1	"Not a bit," said Coavinses.
1	Do you suppose, like her mother’s friends and my enemies--a curse upon them all!--that there is anything in what she has done for me but duty, sir, but duty?
1	He mightn’t like it else.—Bazzard!’ Bazzard reappeared.
1	My winnings would have been from them, my winnings would have been bestowed to the last farthing on a young sinless child whose life they would have sweetened and made happy.
1	The glowing love within the breast of his young daughter froze before it, and she stood and looked at him as if stricken into stone.
1	The books precisely matched as to size, and drawn up in line, like soldiers, looked in their cold, hard, slippery uniforms, as if they had but one idea among them, and that was a freezer.
1	‘Is that you?’ inquired Peg.
1	I always wondered on these occasions whether he ever thought of Mrs. Skimpole and the children, and in what point of view they presented themselves to his cosmopolitan mind.
1	‘I was here before the gates were opened, but I was afraid to come straight to you.
1	Thay farewell to your family, and tharp’th the word.’  With which he delicately retired.
1	Would I touch a penny, if I knew it, that had gone through his white hands--unless it was, indeed, that I could poison it, and send it back to him?
1	We were not in a grand way of business, but we had a good name, and worked for our profits, and did very well.
1	My dear sir,’ returned Mrs. Markleham, shaking her head and her fan, ‘you little know my poor Jack Maldon when you ask that question.
1	Then it stopped, and then went on, out of sight.
1	He was a mild, good-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow,--a sort of Hercules in strength, and also in weakness.
1	“If it had been possible, Miss Manette, that you could have returned the love of the man you see before yourself--flung away, wasted, drunken, poor creature of misuse as you know him to be--he would have been conscious this day and hour, in spite of his happiness, that he would bring you to misery, bring you to sorrow and repentance, blight you, disgrace you, pull you down with him.
1	Short beguiled the time with songs and jests, and made the best of everything that happened.
1	My aunt was a little more imperious and stern than usual, but I observed no other token of her preparing herself to receive the visitor so much dreaded by me.
1	You will be reclaimed and formed.
1	"But this is taking a good deal of trouble," said Mr. Skimpole in his light way, "when you are not in earnest after all."
1	There was something repressed in the strange man’s manner, and he walked with his eyes on the ground--though conscious, for all that, of Mr Boffin’s observation--and he spoke in a subdued voice.
1	I always made the journey first, before the changes of colours and the great landscapes and glittering processions began.
1	The time was come, now, when the wants of this little life were passing away from her.
1	She determined not to go to bed until Edith returned, and if she could not speak to her, at least to be sure that she was safe at home.
1	Do not, my dear Susan, exert yourself.
1	These were sitting, only yesterday evening, musing over a fragment of candle which must soon go out and leave them in the dark for the rest of their nights, when surely some Angel whispered the name of Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire, to their souls, imparting rays of hope, nay confidence, to which they had long been strangers!
1	Little Dorrit looked into a dim room, which seemed a spacious one to her, and grandly furnished.
1	Have you seen him, to your certain knowledge, before?” “When?” “I was returning from France a few days afterwards, and, at Calais, the prisoner came on board the packet-ship in which I returned, and made the voyage with me.” “At what hour did he come on board?” “At a little after midnight.” “In the dead of the night.
1	There seem to be hands dragging me from the door.
1	As no arguments I could urge, in my bewildered condition, had the least effect upon his modesty in inducing him to accept my bedroom, I was obliged to make the best arrangements I could, for his repose before the fire.
1	Admiralty said Mr Merdle was a wonderful man, Treasury said he was a new power in the country, and would be able to buy up the whole House of Commons.
1	‘Wheel him,’ said the captain--‘wheel him to the pound; and let us see whether he calls himself Punch when he comes to himself.
1	'If I ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her, whose goodness saved me from a life of indigence and suffering, when should I ever feel it, as I should to-night?
1	‘I will lead this life no longer.
1	You said you would be rested enough if you had a short nap.’ ‘I have had a short nap,’ said Double.
1	But I thought no worse of him, until the night of his departure for India.
1	But it was not my business.
1	The second greatest surprise I have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again, looking up at me out of a black eye.
1	‘I believe it is, Sir,’ said Mr. Peter Magnus.
1	The summonses served and his witnesses forewarned, the beadle goes to Mr. Krook's to keep a small appointment he has made with certain paupers, who, presently arriving, are conducted upstairs, where they leave the great eyes in the shutter something new to stare at, in that last shape which earthly lodgings take for No one--and for Every one.
1	It was only now that I began to tremble.
1	But if I had been more fit to be married I might have made you more so, too.
1	I am sure of it.
1	The child-like ingenuousness with which his visitor spoke, her modest fearlessness, her truthfulness which put all artifice aside, her entire forgetfulness of herself in her earnest quiet holding to the object with which she had come; all this, together with her reliance on his easily given promise—which in itself shamed him—presented something in which he was so inexperienced, and against which he knew any of his usual weapons would fall so powerless; that not a word could he rally to his relief.
1	‘Thank God for a good breakfast,’ said Squeers, when he had finished.
1	Noah's shouts were responded to, by a loud scream from Charlotte, and a louder from Mrs. Sowerberry; the former of whom rushed into the kitchen by a side-door, while the latter paused on the staircase till she was quite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human life, to come further down.
1	I should like to see such a Parliament anywhere else!
1	He asked me, first of all, whether I conferred a charm and a distinction on London by residing in it?
1	Is it to be hinted to me that I am wanting in affection for my precious treasure, the dearest little fellow that ever was!’ ‘Nobody never went and hinted no such a thing,’ said Peggotty.
1	The atmosphere of those Fairy palaces was like the breath of the simoom: and their inhabitants, wasting with heat, toiled languidly in the desert.
1	He is estranged from our eldest son and daughter, he has no pride in his twins, he looks with an eye of coldness even on the unoffending stranger who last became a member of our circle.
1	The little girls had gone to their own homes now, and she was alone by the fire, reading.
1	Mr. Stryver is here too, occasionally.
1	‘Now I could have killed her without a struggle; but the house was alarmed.
1	Not the least of these would have been a contention, always waging within it, between a tendency to dislike Mr Henry Gowan, if not to regard him with positive repugnance, and a whisper that the inclination was unworthy.
1	It is a very ill wind that blows nobody any good.
1	The elder brother never gained a stave, or raised his foot to mount one.
1	You had him there agin.
1	With a wild confusion before her, of people running up and down, and shouting, and wheels running over them, and boys fighting, and mad bulls coming up, and the nurse in the midst of all these dangers being torn to pieces, Florence screamed and ran.
1	This is all soul, you know, every bit of it.’ With this assurance Mr. Wititterly took up the prostrate form of Mrs. Wititterly, and carried her bodily off to bed.
1	"You have been everything I could desire, my love."
1	Mrs Perch, presenting the case in a new light, even shows that delicacy towards Mr Dombey, shut up in his own rooms, imperatively demands precipitate retreat.
1	Hold me, John, love.’ John caught her up in his arm, and lightly dashed into the room with her.
1	Having, by this open declaration of his feelings, quite precluded himself from offering Nicholas any cautious worldly advice (which had been his first intention), Mr. Noggs went straight to the point.
1	But the Temple, accustomed to tone down both the still life and the human life that has much to do with it, would soon get the better of all that.
1	‘That’s good sound argument,’ said the placid man.
1	In its delirium it imagines guineas pouring out of tea-pots, crown-pieces overflowing punch-bowls, old chairs and mattresses stuffed with Bank of England notes.
1	‘I met them at my uncle’s,’ said Kate, vexed to feel that she was colouring deeply, but unable to keep down the blood which rushed to her face whenever she thought of that man.
1	That how it was not to be expected, ma’am, that he should lose by it, his ways being, as you might say and utter no falsehood, paved with gold; but that how it was much to be regretted that something handsome hadn’t been got up to make it worth his while; for it was such and only such that knowed the heighth to which the bread and butchers’ meat had rose, and it was such and only such that both could and would bring that heighth down.
1	At all events he went on with much greater firmness and force of emphasis: though with a curious disposition to set his teeth, and with a curious tight-screwing movement of his right hand in the clenching palm of his left, like the action of one who was being physically hurt, and was unwilling to cry out.
1	There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped over his labour.
1	Mr. Carton had lounged in, but he made only Two.
1	Let me introduce the topic, Handel, by mentioning that in London it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouth,--for fear of accidents,--and that while the fork is reserved for that use, it is not put further in than necessary.
1	I have licensed this person.
1	‘For the Lord’s love don’t meddle with me!’ cried old Betty, all her fears crowding on her.
1	They rose up, in such quick succession, that he could hardly count them.
1	It might have been.’ ‘It might have been Rule Britannia,’ muttered Eugene, ‘but it wasn’t.
1	Having now carried his point and insisted on it, he left off.
1	Suddenly a very little counsel with a terrific bass voice arises, fully inflated, in the back settlements of the fog, and says, "Will your lordship allow me?
1	Old Square, Lincoln's Inn    Madam,    Jarndyce and Jarndyce    Our clt Mr. Jarndyce being abt to rece into his house,    under an Order of the Ct of Chy, a Ward of the Ct in this    cause, for whom he wishes to secure an elgble compn,    directs us to inform you that he will be glad of your    serces in the afsd capacity.
1	"What wheels on such a day as this, for gracious sake?"
1	But Mr. Mills, who was always doing something or other to annoy me--or I felt as if he were, which was the same thing--had brought his conduct to a climax, by taking it into his head that he would go to India.
1	It begun beautiful, then as it went out it shook a little and got unsteady, then as it took the turn to come home it had a rattle-like and lumbered a bit, then it come smooth, and so it went on till I scarce know’d which was mangle and which was Our Johnny.
1	Of a night when I was going upstairs to bed, she would invite me into her room, where she sat before the fire in a great chair; and, dear me, she would tell me about Morgan ap-Kerrig until I was quite low-spirited!
1	I could see nothing else but black darkness.
1	The man's face was thin and very pale; his hair and beard were grizzly; his eyes were bloodshot.
1	I would have told you that it was the only claim that you could give me to defend and guard you, which I dare accept and dare assert; but that if I had that right, I would regard it as a trust so precious and so priceless, that the undivided truth and fervour of my life would poorly acknowledge its worth.’ The head was still bent down, the tears still falling, and the bosom swelling with its sobs.
1	She saw the drowning figure rise to the surface, slightly struggle, and as if by instinct turn over on its back to float.
1	‘I never thought of Jack!’ Her swift and intent look at him as he said the words could no more be recalled than a flash of lightning can.
1	And thus jealousy gets into Cook's Court, Cursitor Street.
1	The monthly meetings of the Brick Lane Branch of the United Grand Junction Ebenezer Temperance Association were held in a large room, pleasantly and airily situated at the top of a safe and commodious ladder.
1	She was laughingly resolved to put Jip through the whole of his performances, before the coach came.
1	I intend to take Jerry.
1	He died soon after I left school.’ ‘Indeed!’ ‘Yes.
1	'Don't you seem to mind me.
1	‘It’s hard work,’ said Richard.
1	‘He is the most attentive young man I ever saw, Kate,’ said Mrs. Nickleby to her daughter one evening, when this last-named gentleman had been the subject of the worthy lady’s eulogium for some time, and Kate had sat perfectly silent.
1	Neither did I like to say, that I hoped he had not been too communicative to Uriah; or to inquire if they had talked much about me.
1	I must have a better vision than this; this is the poorest of all.
1	But there was a scandalized whisper of ‘Hush!’ ‘Immortally safe, sir,’ returned Uriah, writhing in the direction of the voice.
1	Age, Dora.’ ‘Do you think he is old?’ said Dora, astonished.
1	"But there you have the man.
1	“Inform the Tribunal of what you did that day within the Bastille, citizen.” “I knew,” said Defarge, looking down at his wife, who stood at the bottom of the steps on which he was raised, looking steadily up at him; “I knew that this prisoner, of whom I speak, had been confined in a cell known as One Hundred and Five, North Tower.
1	‘In the meantime,’ said the old gentleman rising, and laying his hand on Kit’s shoulder, ‘you have a great need of rest; for such a day as this would wear out the strongest man.
1	The name that Bella had so often seen in old newspapers, when she was an inmate of Mr Boffin’s house!
1	And now it appears they're firing warning of another.” “Who's firing?” said I.
1	_We_ know something of that family, eh, Dan?
1	The three children close together, and two of them relying solely on the third, and the third so young and yet with an air of age and steadiness that sat so strangely on the childish figure.
1	‘Incommoded, certainly,’ returned the young lady, ‘but not tired.’ The insinuating traveller complimented her on the justice of the distinction.
1	Also some vague idea that the old evil is drowned out of him, and that if he should happily come back to resume his occupation of the empty form that lies upon the bed, his spirit will be altered.
1	Every stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by prisoners--dates, names, complaints, and prayers.
1	Looked out upon a throng of men and women: not enough in number, or near enough, to fill the courtyard: not more than forty or fifty in all.
1	A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques.
1	I am not exactly aware,’ said Mr. Micawber, with the old roll in his voice, and the old indescribable air of saying something genteel, ‘what gowans may be, but I have no doubt that Copperfield and myself would frequently have taken a pull at them, if it had been feasible.’ Mr. Micawber, at the then present moment, took a pull at his punch.
1	Young Fledgeby was none of these.
1	It made her uneasy, and made them all uneasy, when I answered in this way.
1	I was in Peggotty’s arms before I got to the door, and she took me into the house.
1	We were all very low, and none the higher for pretending to be in spirits.
1	It was the house that had been empty, years ago.
1	Was I a happy man once, and have I lost happiness and all I had, for this!’ ‘If we were in the country now,’ said the child, with assumed cheerfulness, as they walked on looking about them for a shelter, we should find some good old tree, stretching out his green arms as if he loved us, and nodding and rustling as if he would have us fall asleep, thinking of him while he watched.
1	It only came from my heart.
1	She had no fear of the dear old grandfather, in whose love for her this disease of the brain had been engendered; but the man she had seen that night, wrapt in the game of chance, lurking in her room, and counting the money by the glimmering light, seemed like another creature in his shape, a monstrous distortion of his image, a something to recoil from, and be the more afraid of, because it bore a likeness to him, and kept close about her, as he did.
1	‘Then,’ said Traddles, ‘you must prepare to disgorge all that your rapacity has become possessed of, and to make restoration to the last farthing.
1	Presently they began to talk about aunts, and then I told them about mine; and about fathers and mothers, and then I told them about mine; and then Mrs. Heep began to talk about fathers-in-law, and then I began to tell her about mine--but stopped, because my aunt had advised me to observe a silence on that subject.
1	There was a dignified conclusiveness--not to add a grand convenience--in this way of getting rid of disagreeables which had done much towards establishing Mr Podsnap in his lofty place in Mr Podsnap’s satisfaction.
1	I cannot say that I was, at first, wholly incredulous as to the possibility of my lovely and accomplished relative having, very unfortunately, committed herself with the deceased person with white teeth; because in point of fact, one does see, in this world--which is remarkable for devilish strange arrangements, and for being decidedly the most unintelligible thing within a man’s experience--very odd conjunctions of that sort.
1	You shall do exactly as you have been doing since we have been together.
1	He told you himself, I'll be bound, my dear?"
1	Do I understand that the whole estate is found to have been absorbed in costs?"
1	The concern prospered, and the partners were fast friends.
1	Oh, a pretty sort of a man!
1	‘You’ll be glad to spend another shilling or so, in almond cakes, I dare say?’ I said, Yes, I should like that, too.
1	His coat is a colour, and cut, that never was the mode anywhere, at any period.
1	“Is there any noise in the streets?” she asked him.
1	Mr. Sowerberry rightly construed this, as an acquiescence in his proposition; it was speedily determined, therefore, that Oliver should be at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade; and, with this view, that he should accompany his master on the very next occasion of his services being required.
1	However, they booked twelve people inside; and the luggage (including such trifles as a large rocking-chair, and a good-sized dining-table) being at length made fast upon the roof, we started off in great state.
1	While I have sat in his presence recalling all my slights and wrongs, and deliberating whether I should not fly from the house at once and never see him again--I have loved him.
1	Why take the trouble?’ ‘Observe the legal mind!’ remarked Eugene, turning round to the furniture again, with an air of indolent rapture.
1	A distant response is heard from the yard, and Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Tupman come running down it, quite out of breath, for they have been having a glass of ale a-piece, and Mr. Pickwick’s fingers are so cold that he has been full five minutes before he could find the sixpence to pay for it.
1	No vestige of any dead body was to be seen upon the floating fragments.
1	He remained moody, obstinate, and unmoved.
1	Woe betide you if you fail to do it, or disobey me by a hair’s breadth.
1	To whom said Bella, in her light-hearted surprise: ‘Oh!
1	The professional gentleman who had given Kit the consolatory piece of information relative to the settlement of his trifle of business at the Old Bailey, and the probability of its being very soon disposed of, turned out to be quite correct in his prognostications.
1	‘That’s the respect and duty that I get from my own gal, but I’m wiser than you take me for.
1	I disposed of the parallel establishment by private contract, and we became as nearly one as could be expected under the circumstances.
1	Who threw that?” He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood, a moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him was the figure of a dark stout woman, knitting.
1	Their retreat was so chosen that while they could watch the river, they could watch the house.
1	It was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the wine should be carried out under the plane-tree, and they should sit there in the air.
1	‘It oughtn’t to be, Samivel,’ said Mr. Weller gravely.
1	‘Dear me, Miss Nickleby, I beg--’ It was in vain for Kate to protest that she was unwell, for the footsteps of the knockers, whoever they were, were already on the stairs.
1	As I made my way, so my son must make his; and his being married at present is out of the question.
1	After taking a glass of warm rum-and-water at a tavern close by, to collect his thoughts, the Captain made a rush down the court, lest its good effects should evaporate, and appeared suddenly to Mr Perch.
1	‘Nicholas--dear Nicholas--how can you give way thus?’ ‘It is such bitter reproach to me to know what you have undergone,’ returned her brother; ‘to see you so much altered, and yet so kind and patient--God!’ cried Nicholas, clenching his fist and suddenly changing his tone and manner, ‘it sets my whole blood on fire again.
1	Your grandmama, Kate, was exactly the same--precisely.
1	My conscience misgave me when I did it.
1	I am reviled or threatened every day by one man or another,’ said Ralph; ‘but things roll on just the same, and I don’t grow poorer either.’ ‘I neither revile nor threaten,’ rejoined the man.
1	Will you hand me that chair, sir, to put a-top of it?’ Venus handed him the chair.
1	How dare you?’ Miss Murdstone made a jail-delivery of her pocket-handkerchief, and held it before her eyes.
1	‘And the dear pretty one?’ said Mrs Gowan.

1	“Show me the way he went.

1	“If you had waited another moment, Biddy, you would have heard me say that I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening,--most likely on the evening before I go away.” Biddy said no more.
1	I don’t think her country will, till she is dead.
1	‘I was glad,’ said Arthur, very much at a loss, for his thoughts were on the brother before him; ‘to find him so well and cheerful.’ ‘Ha!’ muttered the old man, ‘yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!’ Arthur wondered what he could possibly want with the clarionet case.
1	‘You see, we could not know what you were beforehand, sir; could we?’ ‘Clearly not,’ said Mr. Crisparkle.
1	In my father’s earlier time, and in his uncle’s time before him, it was a place of business--really a place of business, and business resort.

1	You have no sooner changed your position, than it comes again in the arms; when you have fidgeted your limbs into all sorts of queer shapes, you have a sudden relapse in the nose, which you rub as if to rub it off--as there is no doubt you would, if you could.
1	MR. JAMES HARTHOUSE, ‘going in’ for his adopted party, soon began to score.
1	A bow of homage to Sir Leicester, a bow of gallantry to Volumnia, and a bow of recognition to the debilitated Cousin, to whom it airily says, "You are a swell about town, and you know me, and I know you."
1	Whether intentionally or accidentally, I don't know.
1	Yet Estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of mind, that I really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part in its production.
1	'Is there a little boy here?'

1	They are very beautiful, and they astonish me, but I am not collected enough--not familiar enough with myself, if you can quite understand what I mean--to have all the pleasure in them that I might have.
1	Damages, gentlemen--heavy damages is the only punishment with which you can visit him; the only recompense you can award to my client.
1	‘I--I--am used to be alone,’ said Florence.

1	‘A very proud man, Sir Thomas Grimble, with six grown-up and most lovely daughters, and the finest park in the county.’ ‘My dear mother,’ reasoned Nicholas, ‘do you suppose that the unfortunate outcast of a Yorkshire school was likely to receive many cards of invitation from the nobility and gentry in the neighbourhood?’ ‘Really, my dear, I don’t know why it should be so very extraordinary,’ said Mrs. Nickleby.
1	Under the temporary pressure of pecuniary liabilities, contracted with a view to their immediate liquidation, but remaining unliquidated through a combination of circumstances, I have been under the necessity of assuming a garb from which my natural instincts recoil--I allude to spectacles--and possessing myself of a cognomen, to which I can establish no legitimate pretensions.

1	“Because,” said I, “I began the service myself, more than two years ago, without his knowledge, and I don't want to be betrayed.
1	What was merry Christmas to Scrooge?
1	‘No vay,’ said Mr. Weller, ‘unless’--and a gleam of intelligence lighted up his countenance as he sank his voice to a whisper, and applied his mouth to the ear of his offspring--‘unless it is getting him out in a turn-up bedstead, unbeknown to the turnkeys, Sammy, or dressin’ him up like a old ‘ooman vith a green wail.’ Sam Weller received both of these suggestions with unexpected contempt, and again propounded his question.

1	‘Sometimes it has been rather hard to live,’ said Little Dorrit, in her soft voice, and timid uncomplaining way; ‘but I think not harder--as to that--than many people find it.’ ‘That’s well said!’ Mrs Clennam quickly returned.

1	Almost as much a stranger here as you, though born here, I came from Marseilles a little while ago.
1	What did Fledgeby say?’ ‘Oh, a likely thing, sir, that I am going to tell you everything, and be told nothing!
1	My Lady's state has a hollow look, thus gloomy and abandoned; and in the inner apartment, where Mr. Bucket last night made his secret perquisition, the traces of her dresses and her ornaments, even the mirrors accustomed to reflect them when they were a portion of herself, have a desolate and vacant air.
1	He yielded to my view of the matter, when convinced that I was honestly in earnest; and so, with his full consent, I start to-morrow morning.
1	They looked tempting; eight in number, circularly set out on a white plate on a tray covered with a white napkin, flanked by a slice of buttered French roll, and a little compact glass of cool wine and water; but she resisted all persuasions, and sent them down again--placing the act to her credit, no doubt, in her Eternal Day-Book.
1	Their upper house-maid, which is lady’s- maid too, told me all about it over the wash-house palin’s before the family was out of bed, one mornin’.’ ‘Wot, the wery next door to you?’ said Sam.
1	I could not find that he was worse than I.
1	‘Oh pray come to me, Julia, do, do!’ But Miss Mills, mistrusting the acceptability of her presence to the higher powers, had not yet gone; and we were all benighted in the Desert of Sahara.
1	They come to a building in the yard with an office on an upper floor.
1	The attendant did as she was told:  shaking her head meanwhile, to intimate that the woman would not die so easily; having done so, she resumed her seat by the side of the other nurse, who had by this time returned.
1	‘On such an occasion I will give you, Master Copperfield,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘in a little more flip,’ for we had been having some already, ‘the memory of my papa and mama.’ ‘Are they dead, ma’am?’ I inquired, after drinking the toast in a wine-glass.
1	I would die to help you.
1	‘We tied his legs under the apron and made’em fast to the chaise, to prevent his giving us the slip again.’ With hands trembling with delight, Squeers unloosened the cord; and Smike, to all appearance more dead than alive, was brought into the house and securely locked up in a cellar, until such time as Mr. Squeers should deem it expedient to operate upon him, in presence of the assembled school.
1	urges Mr. Guppy, raising his voice a little; but on his friend's once more warning him, "I tell you, you can't speak too low," he repeats his question without any sound at all, forming with his lips only the words, "What do you know?"

1	I could repeat the words in my mind, and I knew what they meant of themselves, but I attached no meaning to them in any other connexion.
1	Captain Cuttle’s the man, Uncle.
1	‘Wot’s the matter now?’ ‘Have a cup of tea, there’s a good soul,’ replied the buxom female coaxingly.

1	Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, was accused by the public prosecutor as an emigrant, whose life was forfeit to the Republic, under the decree which banished all emigrants on pain of Death.
1	Tell me what it was.’ ‘I rather grieve--I _do_ rather grieve to think,’ said the child, bursting into tears, ‘that those who die about us, are so soon forgotten.’ ‘And do you think,’ said the schoolmaster, marking the glance she had thrown around, ‘that an unvisited grave, a withered tree, a faded flower or two, are tokens of forgetfulness or cold neglect?
1	He collected the rents of whole colonies of filthy streets and alleys by the waterside, advanced money to the seamen and petty officers of merchant vessels, had a share in the ventures of divers mates of East Indiamen, smoked his smuggled cigars under the very nose of the Custom House, and made appointments on ‘Change with men in glazed hats and round jackets pretty well every day.
1	‘You’ll find it much pleasanter, Sir,’ urged another stout gentleman, who strongly resembled the other half of the roll of flannel aforesaid.
1	Perhaps it is.’ Mr. Pickwick might very probably have reasoned himself into the belief that it really was, had he not, just then happening to look out of the coach window, observed that the looks of the passengers betokened anything but respectful astonishment, and that various telegraphic communications appeared to be passing between them and some persons outside the vehicle, whereupon it occurred to him that these demonstrations might be, in some remote degree, referable to the humorous deportment of Mr. Robert Sawyer.
1	As he sat at his platter and mug, Riderhood saw him, again and yet again, steal a look at the neckerchief, as if he were correcting his slow observation and prompting his sluggish memory.
1	Take this light; go softly up the steps straight afore you, and along the little hall, to the street door; unfasten it, and let us in.'

1	Taking her eyes off the book, to test her memory of something in it, Lizzie was the first to see herself observed.
1	In this pensive, wayward, and uncertain state, people are apt to lounge and loiter without knowing why, to read placards on the walls with great attention and without the smallest idea of one word of their contents, and to stare most earnestly through shop-windows at things which they don’t see.
1	‘Kinder and kinder than I can tell.
1	I did not know how it was, but though there were only two of us, we were at once always cramped for room, and yet had always room enough to lose everything in.
1	The Major was to take the responsibility of ordering everything to eat and drink; and they were to have a late breakfast together every morning, and a late dinner together every day.
1	But I may as well tell you that I can find nothing the matter with Mr Merdle.
1	We must trust to you and time to set him right."
1	We are all going to the play, or coming home from it.
1	She has a fine face--originally of a character that would be rather called very pretty than handsome, but improved into classicality by the acquired expression of her fashionable state.
1	Tradesmen’s books hunger, and tradesmen’s mouths water, for the gold dust of the Golden Dustman.
1	My aunt, with every sort of expression but wonder discharged from her countenance, sat on the gravel, staring at me, until I began to cry; when she got up in a great hurry, collared me, and took me into the parlour.
1	‘But, bless you,’ pursued Mrs Boffin, ‘if you could have seen him of a night, at that time of it!
1	I gets my living by the sweat of my brow, and it’s good enough for ME.’ This had a modest self-denying appearance; but it soon turned out that as, by reason of the impossibility of standing the glass upright while there was anything in it, it required to be emptied as soon as filled, Mr Riderhood managed to drink in the proportion of three to one.
1	Seeing from this, that it was no private document; and as it seemed to relate to Bath, and was very short: Mr. Pick-wick unfolded it, lighted his bedroom candle that it might burn up well by the time he finished; and drawing his chair nearer the fire, read as follows-- ‘Less than two hundred years ago, on one of the public baths in this city, there appeared an inscription in honour of its mighty founder, the renowned Prince Bladud.
1	These completed, and the two alone again, it was pleasant to see (or would have been, if there had been any one to see it, which there never was), the old lady standing to say the Lord’s Prayer aloud, and her son, Minor Canon nevertheless, standing with bent head to hear it, he being within five years of forty: much as he had stood to hear the same words from the same lips when he was within five months of four.
1	No; yet something like it.
1	‘Ha ha!’ he would cry.
1	echoed the Jew, leaning back in his chair.
1	I said to Anastatia before leaving home just now to come to you--of course the first friend I have seen on a subject so momentous to me, my dear Twemlow--I said to Anastatia, “We must work.”’ ‘You were right, you were right,’ replies Twemlow.
1	The ‘young feller’ complying, Mr Chuckster put his hands in his pockets, and tried to look as if he were not minding the pony, but happened to be lounging there by accident.
1	If he forces us to it, they'll be producible, won't they?"
1	Their objects were as various as their demands.
1	But all that I have to say in this way, I have said.
1	When she did look up, the expression was not there.
1	“I know nothing of his life.
1	“Thankee!” said Wemmick, rubbing his hands.
1	I am happy to see you.
1	No one who can read, ever looks at a book, even unopened on a shelf, like one who cannot.
1	But the craft, the secrecy, the dark deep underhanded plotting, written in Mrs Boffin’s countenance, make me shudder.’ As an incontrovertible proof that those baleful attributes were all there, Mrs Wilfer shuddered on the spot.
1	"Or unless she fancies it's blood," said the woman.
1	Do you hear?---His life!’ Mrs. Steerforth, fallen back stiffly in her chair, and making no sound but a moan, cast her eyes upon her with a wide stare.

1	Seeing, or fancying, that I was suspected of an intention of carrying poison to him, I asked to be searched before I sat down at his bedside, and told the officer who was always there, that I was willing to do anything that would assure him of the singleness of my designs.
1	And above all, my dear, be sure you promise me your vote and interest and all sorts of plumpers for Pocket-Breaches; for we couldn’t think of spending sixpence on it, my love, and can only consent to be brought in by the spontaneous thingummies of the incorruptible whatdoyoucallums.
1	I'll go a little further with you; I'll say something more.” He bent down so low to frown at his boots, that he was able to rub the calves of his legs in the pause he made.
1	Let me tell you, Dan has done without ‘em!’ ‘What a load you take from my mind!’ cried Arthur.
1	I thought he had been dead!’ ‘Dead to me,’ returned my aunt, ‘but living.’ I sat in silent amazement.

1	He took it in one of his, and kissed it, and withdrew.
1	Rome will be a ugly customer to you, if you don't.
1	I walked past the house, and took several turns in the street, with that kind of hesitation which is natural to a man who is conscious that the visit he is about to pay is unexpected, and may not be very acceptable.
1	If it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, that's something; and I think I shook him yesterday."
1	cried Mr. Kenge, raising his voice.
1	I believe there has been in England, since the days of the STUARTS, no law so often infamously administered, no law so often openly violated, no law habitually so ill-supervised.
1	If you had only sent in to me when they were here!
1	I have never dreamed of the change in our fortunes itself; I have never dreamed of your coming back with me that memorable morning to break it; I have never even dreamed of you.
1	‘I am not certain, of course,’ said Mr. Pickwick, amidst profound silence and looks of general dismay; ‘but his manner to me this moment really was very alarming.
1	‘An acquisition indeed.’ As Mrs. Vincent Crummles recrossed back to the table, there bounded on to the stage from some mysterious inlet, a little girl in a dirty white frock with tucks up to the knees, short trousers, sandaled shoes, white spencer, pink gauze bonnet, green veil and curl papers; who turned a pirouette, cut twice in the air, turned another pirouette, then, looking off at the opposite wing, shrieked, bounded forward to within six inches of the footlights, and fell into a beautiful attitude of terror, as a shabby gentleman in an old pair of buff slippers came in at one powerful slide, and chattering his teeth, fiercely brandished a walking-stick.
1	It is such a beautiful place!’ ‘Is it?’ ‘It is like the inside of the most exquisite ship that ever sailed.
1	"I didn't mean to say anything about it, for it's not birthday talk, but you have got it out of me, you see, before I sit down.
1	All the best means are at once in action, and everybody present lends a hand, and a heart and soul.
1	What did he say?’ ‘Oh you know what papa is,’ rejoined Flora, ‘and how aggravatingly he sits looking beautiful and turning his thumbs over and over one another till he makes one giddy if one keeps one’s eyes upon him, he said when we were talking of you--I don’t know who began the subject Arthur (Doyce and Clennam) but I am sure it wasn’t me, at least I hope not but you really must excuse my confessing more on that point.’ ‘Certainly,’ said Arthur.
1	She had a crowd of cousins and acquaintances, and we had dances at her house, and went out to dances at other houses, and, both at home and out, she tormented my love beyond endurance.
1	But the greatest effect in these miserable lessons is when my mother (thinking nobody is observing her) tries to give me the cue by the motion of her lips.
1	I doubt if he had ever once thought of it before.
1	Go to my lawyer (you remember where; you have been there before) and show your independence now, will you?
1	The kindnesses you have secretly done for his advancement, and then disclosed to me, for my surprise and pleasure, have been, you will believe, but aggravations of the unhappiness and burden of my secret.’ She sunk down gently at the Doctor’s feet, though he did his utmost to prevent her; and said, looking up, tearfully, into his face: ‘Do not speak to me yet!
1	cried Mrs. Mann, starting back.
1	In a word, I was at liberty to do what I would, for three weeks or a month; and no other conditions were imposed upon my freedom than the before-mentioned thinking and looking about me, and a pledge to write three times a week and faithfully report myself.
1	I have been thinking that the law is the boy for me."
1	I knew a better way of going to work.
1	I will remain in the house in which it placed me, until I am entitled to leave it by the terms of my engagement; though, mind, I see these men no more.
1	You repent of your determination now, do you?’ ‘My determination!’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	Yet the bells, when they sounded, told me sorrowfully of change in everything; told me of their own age, and my pretty Dora’s youth; and of the many, never old, who had lived and loved and died, while the reverberations of the bells had hummed through the rusty armour of the Black Prince hanging up within, and, motes upon the deep of Time, had lost themselves in air, as circles do in water.
1	I should put 'em down at the figures of about eight and ten."
1	‘Do you see this?’ He showed me that it was covered with manuscript, very closely and laboriously written; but so plainly, that as I looked along the lines, I thought I saw some allusion to King Charles the First’s head again, in one or two places.
1	Do you know, Handel, he improves?” “I said to you I thought he was softened when I last saw him.” “So you did.
1	The sister was so apt a pupil, and the dancing-master had such abundant leisure to bestow upon her (for it took him a matter of ten weeks to set to his creditors, lead off, turn the Commissioners, and right and left back to his professional pursuits), that wonderful progress was made.
1	But Annie, in a spiritless unhappy way, only went whither she was led, and seemed to have no care for anything.
1	‘’Twas kind of you to meet me.
1	He had got at the core of that mystery now, he told us, and nothing could be plainer than that the will under which he and Ada were to take I don't know how many thousands of pounds must be finally established if there were any sense or justice in the Court of Chancery--but oh, what a great IF that sounded in my ears--and that this happy conclusion could not be much longer delayed.
1	The cart is shaken all to pieces, and the rugged road is very near its end.
1	I happened to turn my eyes towards this place, as I was thinking of many things; and I saw a figure beyond, dressed in a plain cloak.
1	We shall meet again soon.
1	"His son's name is the same, you know," said I.
1	And the Major whistled, and stared, and wondered, and dodged about his room, and could make nothing of it.
1	The brothers give a Banquet on a great Annual Occasion.
1	‘Nothing could be better,’ said the father-in-law, rubbing his hands.
1	‘It would be particularly comfortable, I think,’ replied Mr. Pickwick.
1	I never knew such a thing.
1	When I had got rid of him, which I thought it well to do without prolonging explanations, my mind was much troubled by these two circumstances taken together.
1	I heard that Mr. Mell was not a bad sort of fellow, but hadn’t a sixpence to bless himself with; and that there was no doubt that old Mrs. Mell, his mother, was as poor as job.
1	On the man’s stumbling into the room, Lizzie rose to leave it.
1	‘And you have--when you catch it--the Scarlatina.
1	Think how soon it will be over.’ ‘How soon it will be over!’ he repeats gloomily.
1	The strong tide, so swift, so deep, and certain, was like a congenial friend, in the morning stillness.
1	Throws his lordship's papers into the fire, my dear, if he won't pay the jeweller!"
1	Mr. Tulkinghorn wanted 'em and got 'em, but I looked 'em over first.
1	‘As to Rokesmith, that young man of mine,’ said Mr Boffin, dropping his voice and glancing towards the door with an apprehension of being overheard by some eavesdropper there, ‘it’s the same with him as with the footmen.
1	By the Lord, it’s a great name!’ said the Major, solemnly.
1	‘You have been betrayed, as all betrayers are.
1	And in due course there was bed; where, but for that resumption of the studies which took place in dreams, were rest and sweet forgetfulness.
1	Why, he was a poor creature to be taken by that delicate mock-modesty, and that hanging head!’ ‘Oh, for Heaven’s sake, spare me!’ exclaimed Emily.
1	“This is very discouraging,” said I.
1	No matter, Meagles; that would never do.
1	‘What do you say, Mr. Knuckleboy?’ inquired Mrs. Squeers.
1	‘Mr Clennam, will he pay all his debts before he leaves here?’ ‘No doubt.
1	The landlady, by no means satisfied with this assurance, which she considered an ingenious evasion of the question, rejoined that he had his reasons of course.
1	You Pancks,’ said Mrs Clennam, bending her brows upon him angrily, ‘you Casby’s clerk!
1	“You will not be late?” “I shall be there before the commencement.” “And before the tumbrils arrive.
1	She would love him dearly if he would suffer her, but he will not--though for no fault of hers; and she is greatly to be loved and pitied by all gentle hearts.’ More of the flowers that Florence held fell scattering on the ground; those that remained were wet, but not with dew; and her face dropped upon her laden hands.
1	This the landlady of the Break of Day chirpingly explained, calling between whiles, ‘Hola, my husband!’ out at the side door.
1	‘What is the matter?’ said Mr. Pickwick to the boy.
1	‘Why, here,’ said Mrs. Markleham, taking a letter from the chimney-piece above the Doctor’s head, ‘the dear fellow says to the Doctor himself--where is it?
1	(Captain Swosser's claret to your mistress, James!)
1	Your money has changed you to marble.
1	Taking his hands from the seat, and placing one of them within the other, as he settled himself on one leg, Mr. Littimer proceeded, with his eyes cast down, and his respectable head a little advanced, and a little on one side: ‘The young woman went on in this manner for some time, being occasionally low in her spirits, until I think she began to weary Mr. James by giving way to her low spirits and tempers of that kind; and things were not so comfortable.
1	What has my uncle heard from Yorkshire?’ Newman opened and shut his mouth, several times, as though he were trying his utmost to speak, but could make nothing of it, and finally fixed his eyes on Nicholas with a grim and ghastly stare.
1	And what’s more,--he’s in luck again, by George if he ain’t!’ Cold on the shore, in the raw cold of that leaden crisis in the four-and-twenty hours when the vital force of all the noblest and prettiest things that live is at its lowest, the three watchers looked each at the blank faces of the other two, and all at the blank face of Riderhood in his boat.
1	I should soon have made you a friendly visit.’ ‘Ah!’ said Flora, tossing her head.
1	Volumnia, with her innocent little scream, supposes so.
1	In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietly away, I saw a great flaming light spring up.
1	There was not the right taste about the premature productions, and they didn’t keep well.
1	My humour is not a trifling one, and my acknowledgment will be severe.’ ‘Oh a proud, hard gentleman!’ chuckled the old woman, shaking her head, and rubbing her shrivelled hands, ‘oh hard, hard, hard!
1	Pray don’t hurt the creature who is so fond of you!
1	Because she must have known whether it did or not.
1	*      *      *      *      * 'Stone dead!'
1	The sprightly Rob, whose sprightliness was very much diminished by the salutation, looked exceedingly dismayed, and said, with the water rising in his eyes: ‘Oh!
1	‘What--the--deyvle!’ With which broken ejaculations, he fixed his glass in his eye, and stared at Miss Nickleby in great surprise.
1	She restrained her tears by a great effort until she was alone upstairs, and then gave them vent.
1	Far in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed, beetling shop, below a pent-house roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and greasy offal, were bought.
1	Still, Mr. Tulkinghorn, sir, I must stipulate that if you have any word with me, that word is spoken in the presence of my friend."
1	Ada and Richard were lingering for a few moments by the fire, wondering whether Mrs. Jellyby had yet finished her dictation for the day, when Mr. Jarndyce, who had been out of the room, returned.
1	Say, both refer to Mr Clennam.
1	In busier periods of the year these bills disappear, and the houses swarm with legislators.
1	I light it--draw one puff--breathe the smoke out--there it goes--it’s Dolls!--it’s gone--and being gone you are a man again.’ ‘Your subject,’ said Mortimer, after lighting a cigar, and comforting himself with a whiff or two, ‘was scouts, Eugene.’ ‘Exactly.
1	‘Sit down, sir,’ said Mr Boffin, shaking hands with him.
1	"I begin to think I must be a swell in the Guards without knowing it."
1	Mr Lammle came on the scene last, for he was always late, and so were the frequenters always late; all hands being bound to be made late, by private information about the Bourse, and Greek and Spanish and India and Mexican and par and premium and discount and three quarters and seven eighths.
1	Unmindful of her stealthy tread, her victim holds his course in fancied triumph.
1	In this world you need meet no more.'
1	Nobody was ever on any account to give anybody anything, or render anybody help without purchase.
1	Morning after morning they roamed about the town together, pursuing this singular research.
1	After some rubbing of the lower part of his face, and some looking at us with those bad eyes, over his grisly fingers, he made one more address to me, half whining, and half abusive.
1	After several times falling short of my destination and as often overshooting it, I came unexpectedly round a corner, upon Mill Pond Bank.
1	He could pave the way, he said, in half an hour, and then they would go down to Brentford.
1	I wouldn’t cry!’ COKETOWN, to which Messrs. Bounderby and Gradgrind now walked, was a triumph of fact; it had no greater taint of fancy in it than Mrs. Gradgrind herself.
1	You had no such thing in contemplation when I was with you.’ ‘No,’ replied Crummles, ‘I hadn’t then.
1	“I was standing by a minute, on the chance of company.” “You are late,” I remarked.
1	‘I don’t know of what—of everything, I think.’ ‘Say not another word,’ returned Mr. Gradgrind.
1	‘To London.’ ‘Have you any home to go to?’ ‘I think I have a mother.
1	‘If so, he ought to know best.’ ‘No, my dear; nor it ain’t that, neither.
1	He gladly agreed to hire it.
1	This done, he went on direct to Defarge's, and went in.
1	The wind carried away the striking of the great multitude of city church clocks, for those lay to leeward of them; but there were bells to windward that told them of its being One--Two--Three.
1	The healthy, strong- made man, who could have borne almost any fatigue of active exertion, was wasting beneath the close confinement and unhealthy atmosphere of a crowded prison.
1	‘He must be a very weak, and foolish, and inconsiderate man,’ said Mrs. Nickleby; ‘blamable indeed--at least I suppose other people would consider him so; of course I can’t be expected to express any opinion on that point, especially after always defending your poor dear papa when other people blamed him for making proposals to me; and to be sure there can be no doubt that he has taken a very singular way of showing it.
1	Ralph exchanged his dreamy posture for his accustomed business attitude: the face of Newman disappeared, and the train of thought took to flight, all simultaneously, and in an instant.
1	In such scenes and occupations the time wore on until nine o’clock, when Kate, jaded and dispirited with the occurrences of the day, hastened from the confinement of the workroom, to join her mother at the street corner, and walk home:--the more sadly, from having to disguise her real feelings, and feign to participate in all the sanguine visions of her companion.
1	‘Why do you answer it?’ was his reception of his brother.
1	I think if you could see her now--if you would go and see her--she would move your admiration and compassion.’ The Manager inclined his head, and showed his teeth, as who should say, in answer to some careless small-talk, ‘Dear me!
1	And then he showed me, proved by elaborate calculations in his pocket-book, that supposing he had contracted, say, two hundred pounds of debt in six months out of the army; and that he contracted no debt at all within a corresponding period in the army--as to which he had quite made up his mind; this step must involve a saving of four hundred pounds in a year, or two thousand pounds in five years, which was a considerable sum.
1	‘I mean the gentleman up-stairs,’ said Kit, turning to Richard Swiveller.
1	I know you send me away for my good.’ ‘O, Charley, Charley, Heaven above us knows I do!’ ‘Yes yes.
1	Steerforth not yet appearing, which induced me to apprehend that he must be ill, I left the Commons early on the third day, and walked out to Highgate.
1	The people of the house knew what to do; the proper authorities were soon brought; and they took an equable business-like possession of the deceased, and of what had been his property, with no greater disturbance of manner or countenance than usually attends the winding-up of a clock.
1	Stretched upon a mattress on the floor, lay Noah Claypole, fast asleep.
1	“Ah!” said the girl; “but you see she don't.” She said it so finally, and in such an undiscussible way, that Mr. Pumblechook, though in a condition of ruffled dignity, could not protest.
1	Speak up, you crabbed image for the sign of a walking-stick shop, and say you saw him put it there!"
1	‘I have been in the habit of thinking that there was nothing wanting to be done for him; that it was all settled and over; in short, of not thinking at all about it.
1	But unless I had taken the life of Trabb's boy on that occasion, I really do not even now see what I could have done save endure.
1	Not Rosa?’  Then a second handsome face appearing.
1	He was the herald of the family procession.
1	Tattycoram, I’ll not ask that lady whether she believes what she has said, even in the anger and ill blood in which I and my friend here equally know she has spoken, though she subdues herself, with a determination that any one who has once seen her is not likely to forget.
1	Ma and Africa, together, upset the whole house directly.
1	Also, to record that wherever I have been, in the smallest places equally with the largest, I have been received with unsurpassable politeness, delicacy, sweet temper, hospitality, consideration, and with unsurpassable respect for the privacy daily enforced upon me by the nature of my avocation here and the state of my health.
1	Mind my words, it shall be done.’ ‘But how?’ said Dick.
1	'It is never too late,' said Rose, 'for penitence and atonement.'
1	Are you astonished?” Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, “Why should I be astonished?” “You approve?” Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, “Why should I not approve?” “Well!” said his friend Stryver, “you take it more easily than I fancied you would, and are less mercenary on my behalf than I thought you would be; though, to be sure, you know well enough by this time that your ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will.
1	You are quite aware of that?” “Quite, sir.” “I communicated to Magwitch--in New South Wales--when he first wrote to me--from New South Wales--the caution that he must not expect me ever to deviate from the strict line of fact.
1	“You know where to deliver it?” “Will you undertake to explain, that we suppose it to have been addressed here, on the chance of our knowing where to forward it, and that it has been here some time?” “I will do so.
1	"May be, I have not."
1	How should he, Nupkins, meet the eye of old Porkenham at the next quarter-sessions!
1	What is wanting to it?’ ‘You--you shall be informed in the other interview.’ Then he said, as if in a burst of irrepressible despair, ‘I--I leave it all incomplete!
1	‘Yes.’  Then she uncovered her head, and letting her cloak and hood fall where they might, stood looking at him: so colourless, so dishevelled, so defiant and despairing, that he was afraid of her.
1	While he was thus employed his features gradually relaxed into what was with him a cheerful smile, but which in any other man would have been a ghastly grin of pain, and when the child looked up again she found that he was regarding her with extraordinary favour and complacency.
1	‘That is all you know of him from the fellow-prisoner?’ ‘In substance, all.’ ‘And was the fellow-prisoner his accomplice and a murderer, too?
1	‘Dear boy, I know it, but I can’t give it.
1	‘And now, my own dear Davy,’ said Peggotty, ‘if, while you’re a prentice, you should want any money to spend; or if, when you’re out of your time, my dear, you should want any to set you up (and you must do one or other, or both, my darling); who has such a good right to ask leave to lend it you, as my sweet girl’s own old stupid me!’ I was not so savagely independent as to say anything in reply, but that if ever I borrowed money of anyone, I would borrow it of her.
1	He would have walked in, and was in the very act of doing so, indeed, when catching sight of Mr. Weller, he involuntarily shrank back a pace or two, and stood gazing on the unexpected scene before him, perfectly motionless with amazement and terror.
1	Richard, who was now in a professor's house in London, was able to be with us less frequently than before; my guardian still maintained the same reserve; and so time passed until the commission was obtained and Richard received directions with it to join a regiment in Ireland.
1	Do I understand that you will take her with you?"
1	Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the question of rebuilding Tellson's.
1	The woman’s was the first reached.
1	My dear, don't you give your mind to that again, or I shall link your feet together at the ankles."
1	Worse than that, we found such an unusual crowd in the Court of Chancery that it was full to the door, and we could neither see nor hear what was passing within.
1	I was bad enough there, but I have been so much worse here.
1	Can anybody doubt how all this has been brought about?’ ‘I should scarcely think they could,’ said Kate mildly.
1	‘Plornish finds it so,’ she returned.
1	Jingle, will you step with us into the next room for a moment?’ Mr. Jingle assented, and the quartette walked into an empty apartment.
1	"Friend and legal adviser," said Mr. Skimpole.
1	He looked in a hurried manner at the graves, then anxiously at the child, then pressed her to his side, and bade her stop to rest.
1	In its small proportions, it was not unlike the kind of place usually assigned to a gate-porter in Paris.
1	Oh!” “Ah-h-h!” growled the journeyman, between his teeth, “I'd hold you, if you was my wife.
1	I had not considered how I could thank him, my gratitude lying too deep in my heart for that; but I now began to consider how I could meet him without thanking him, and felt it would be very difficult indeed.
1	"No, you don't do yourself justice.
1	Sooth to say, poor Paul had better reason for his tears than sons of that age often have, for he had lost his second mother--his first, so far as he knew--by a stroke as sudden as that natural affliction which had darkened the beginning of his life.
1	Martha made the same impatient gesture with her crouching shoulders, in reply; and he was glad and happy.
1	‘I said that theer was on’y one thing furder,’ he proceeded with a grave smile, when he had made up his little bundle again, and put it in his pocket; ‘but theer was two.
1	It was a cold hard easterly morning when he latched the garden gate and turned away.
1	‘They have some business here; and I took advantage of their coming, to come too.
1	Do you hear?’ she added, waiting with some apparent inconsistency FOR an answer.
1	To which Mr. Guppy says, "Who's conspiring?"
1	The Jew saw that it would be hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of Miss Nancy's rage; and, shrinking involuntarily back a few paces, cast a glance, half imploring and half cowardly, at Sikes: as if to hint that he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue.
1	Which he did with his boots on, and an umbrella under his arm.
1	You’ve seen this gentleman before, I think?’ Mr. Pickwick shook hands with Mr. Benjamin Allen, and his friends followed his example.
1	However, they were grown up and had their own way, and they made the most of it.
1	‘Let him look to that!
1	At about this time, too, I made three discoveries: first, that Mrs. Crupp was a martyr to a curious disorder called ‘the spazzums’, which was generally accompanied with inflammation of the nose, and required to be constantly treated with peppermint; secondly, that something peculiar in the temperature of my pantry, made the brandy-bottles burst; thirdly, that I was alone in the world, and much given to record that circumstance in fragments of English versification.
1	Bending over a steaming vessel of tea, and looking through the steam, and breathing forth the steam, like a malignant Chinese enchantress engaged in the performance of unholy rites, Mr F.’s Aunt put down her great teacup and exclaimed, ‘Drat him, if he an’t come back again!’ It would seem from the foregoing exclamation that this uncompromising relative of the lamented Mr F., measuring time by the acuteness of her sensations and not by the clock, supposed Clennam to have lately gone away; whereas at least a quarter of a year had elapsed since he had had the temerity to present himself before her.
1	cries Phil, who has started from his chair and unaccountably begun to sidle away.
1	Of which remarkable gentlewoman it may be finally observed, that there surely never was a gentlewoman of whose transcendent fitness for any vacant appointment on the face of this earth, so many people were (as the warmth of her Testimonials evinced) so perfectly satisfied--or who was so very unfortunate in having a large circle of ardent and distinguished admirers, who never themselves happened to want her in any capacity.
1	The Jews with the fifty-bladed penknives shut them up in despair; the men with the pocket-books made pocket-books of them.
1	It was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle: the development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious way at the rest, was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off.
1	‘I said, now candidly,’ Mr Fledgeby explained, a little put out.
1	A big, loud man, with a stare, and a metallic laugh.
1	At home, in my own room, I am sometimes moved to cry out, ‘Oh, Miss Shepherd!’ in a transport of love.
1	‘The reaction, my lord, the reaction,’ said Mr. Wititterly.
1	You’re hammer and tongs, already, you two?’ he said, coolly stroking his face.
1	If the inkstand had been where the old gentleman thought it was, he would have dipped his pen into it, and signed the indentures, and Oliver would have been straightway hurried off.
1	It was difficult, however, to be sure of this; the Commander having no trace of expression in his face when sober.
1	I never saw in any face there, thank heaven, on my birthday, that it would have been better if I had never been born.
1	I am very impressible myself, by nature.
1	I was so, when I first saw you making the mistake of not leaving us alone; because I perceived that you were inexperienced and sanguine, and had--I hope you’ll not object to my saying--some simplicity?’ ‘Not at all.’ ‘Some simplicity.
1	‘Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘have the goodness to step downstairs.’ ‘Cert’nly, sir,’ replied Mr. Weller; and acting on Mr. Pickwick’s gentle hint, Sam retired.
1	I pass the greater part of the long vacation here.
1	In case the accompanying paper is not legally written, it matters very little, for there is no one interested but you and he, and my plain wish is, that if he is living he should have what little there may be, and if (as I fear) otherwise, that you should have it, Ned.
1	When we had passed the village and the church and the churchyard, and were out on the marshes and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on, I began to combine Miss Havisham and Estella with the prospect, in my usual way.
1	I was afraid I had said something shocking.
1	“You had a child once, whom you loved and lost.” A stronger pressure on my hand.
1	The languid stillness of the place was only broken by the chirping of this fire and by the voice of one of the Doctors, who was wandering slowly through a perfect library of evidence, and stopping to put up, from time to time, at little roadside inns of argument on the journey.
1	'You don't mean to say he died?'
1	"I rose in life that way."
1	Very, very, strong feelings.’ With a shaking hand, Bradley took out his handkerchief and wiped his brow.
1	‘I mean, Papa, what can it do?’ returned Paul, folding his arms (they were hardly long enough to fold), and looking at the fire, and up at him, and at the fire, and up at him again.
1	Rachael was there, sitting by the bed.
1	She laughs and talks, and seems to like it.
1	And now a surprise occurred, so overwhelming and terrific that Captain Cuttle, unsupported by the presence of Bunsby, must have sunk beneath it, and been a lost man from that fatal hour.
1	That I swear.’ ‘You needn’t take the trouble of swearing,’ said Mr Lammle to the skeleton; ‘once more, it doesn’t matter.
1	On Friday the Ninth of June in the present year, Mr and Mrs Boffin (in their manuscript dress of receiving Mr and Mrs Lammle at breakfast) were on the South Eastern Railway with me, in a terribly destructive accident.
1	If I could ever set this right!
1	His only trouble was, the swift and rapid river.
1	‘What a prophet you have shown yourself, Mister Copperfield!’ pursued Uriah.
1	Some future traveller, visiting, from motives of curiosity, not unmingled, let us hope, with sympathy, the place of confinement allotted to debtors in this city, may, and I trust will, Ponder, as he traces on its wall, inscribed with a rusty nail,                               ‘The obscure initials, ‘P.S.
1	Dry toast and warm tea offered him every night and morning when he couldn’t swallow anything--a candle in his bedroom on the very night he died--the best dictionary sent up for him to lay his head upon--I don’t regret it though.
1	"I am inclined to think," returned my guardian, "that Miss Summerson has seen too much of the effects of the court and the cause to exert any influence in their favour.
1	I saw it move a little more, and a hand softly interpose to keep it open.
1	The shoes that had so often tumbled off by the way, he preserved in his own room; and, sitting in the little back parlour of an evening, he had drawn a whole gallery of fancy portraits of Good Mrs Brown.
1	It was never so well worth your while to get me out of this country as it is to-night.
1	‘I point out to you, sir, with indignation, that--hum--the--ha--delicacy and peculiarity of your father’s position should strike you dumb, sir, if nothing else should, in laying down such--ha--such unnatural principles.
1	It was a strangely unreal ride through the old squalid streets, with a sensation of being raised out of them into an airy world of wealth and grandeur.
1	Not being prepared, however, it alarmed him the more; so away he went like the wind, with the old gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him.
1	With his very ears a bright purple shot with crimson, he pent up his indignation, however, and said: ‘You’d like to keep her here for a time?’ ‘I—I had intended to recommend, my dear Bounderby, that you should allow Louisa to remain here on a visit, and be attended by Sissy (I mean of course Cecilia Jupe), who understands her, and in whom she trusts.’ ‘I gather from all this, Tom Gradgrind,’ said Bounderby, standing up with his hands in his pockets, ‘that you are of opinion that there’s what people call some incompatibility between Loo Bounderby and myself.’ ‘I fear there is at present a general incompatibility between Louisa, and—and—and almost all the relations in which I have placed her,’ was her father’s sorrowful reply.
1	Even the male performers stopped in their conversation, and echoed the word ‘Going!’ although some among them (and they had been the loudest in their congratulations that day) winked at each other as though they would not be sorry to lose such a favoured rival; an opinion, indeed, which the honest Mr. Folair, who was ready dressed for the savage, openly stated in so many words to a demon with whom he was sharing a pot of porter.
1	To complete the group, it is necessary to recognise in this disconcerted dodger, an individual very pale from sea-sickness, who had shaved his beard and brushed his hair, last, at Liverpool: and whose only article of dress (linen not included) were a pair of dreadnought trousers; a blue jacket, formerly admired upon the Thames at Richmond; no stockings; and one slipper.
1	After resuming her place at his side, and tenderly touching his hands and his head, she said: ‘Eugene, dear, you made me go out, but I ought to have stayed with you.
1	Her visitor watched her as she did so.
1	"Why is it best, sir?"
1	As a means towards his composure and self-possession, he entered into a more minute examination of the office than he had yet had time to make; looked into the wig-box, the books, and ink-bottle; untied and inspected all the papers; carved a few devices on the table with a sharp blade of Mr Brass’s penknife; and wrote his name on the inside of the wooden coal-scuttle.
1	Is it yet coming on?’ ‘Why, no, sir,’ retorted Mr Flintwinch.
1	Mr. Pip, there are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about that watch; there's not a man, a woman, or a child, among them, who wouldn't identify the smallest link in that chain, and drop it as if it was red hot, if inveigled into touching it.” At first with such discourse, and afterwards with conversation of a more general nature, did Mr. Wemmick and I beguile the time and the road, until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the district of Walworth.
1	Touch him upon money, and you touch no booby then.
1	It is Young John, I think; is it not?’ ‘Yes, sir,’ returned Young John.
1	Miss Madeline, I kiss your hand.’ ‘We will shake hands, Gride,’ said Mr. Bray, extending his, as old Arthur bowed.
1	There, at the very core of London, in the heart of its business and animation, in the midst of a whirl of noise and motion: stemming as it were the giant currents of life that flow ceaselessly on from different quarters, and meet beneath its walls: stands Newgate; and in that crowded street on which it frowns so darkly--within a few feet of the squalid tottering houses--upon the very spot on which the vendors of soup and fish and damaged fruit are now plying their trades--scores of human beings, amidst a roar of sounds to which even the tumult of a great city is as nothing, four, six, or eight strong men at a time, have been hurried violently and swiftly from the world, when the scene has been rendered frightful with excess of human life; when curious eyes have glared from casement and house-top, and wall and pillar; and when, in the mass of white and upturned faces, the dying wretch, in his all-comprehensive look of agony, has met not one--not one--that bore the impress of pity or compassion.
1	That’s all over.’ The Father of the Marshalsea glanced at a passing Collegian with whom he was on friendly terms, as who should say, ‘An enfeebled old man, this; but he is my brother, sir, my brother, and the voice of Nature is potent!’ and steered his brother clear of the handle of the pump by the threadbare sleeve.
1	Hey, old intriguer?’ Jeremiah, with his eyes upon his mistress, made no reply.
1	And I begged and prayed my aunt--I forget in what terms now, but I remember that they affected me very much then--to befriend and protect me, for my father’s sake.
1	We looked at one another, half laughing at our being like the children in the wood, when a curious little old woman in a squeezed bonnet and carrying a reticule came curtsying and smiling up to us with an air of great ceremony.
1	It seemed that he had several times opened his mouth when alone with Richard after dinner, as if he had something on his mind, but had always shut it again, to Richard's extreme confusion, without saying anything.
1	Let all the lovers get out of the way, and talk among themselves, if they’ve anything to say.
1	This letter will show how true I spoke, and they will be thankful for me.’ The Deputy Lock opened the letter with a grave face, which underwent no change as he eyed its contents.
1	There were two of the traitor’s own blood--his renounced brother and sister--on whom the weight of his guilt rested almost more heavily, at this time, than on the man whom he had so deeply injured.
1	Therefore I make the entreaty I have now preferred, and I hope you will have sufficient consideration for me to accede to it."
1	Do I never read how they grow heartsick of it and give it up, after having let themselves drop so low, and how they after all die out for want of help?
1	'I hope so,' replied the child.
1	The Defarges, husband and wife, The Vengeance, and Jacques Three, were in the first press, and at no great distance from him in the Hall.
1	‘Oh no!’ ‘That’s well,’ remarked Miss Price.
1	‘I hope, Towlinson,’ says Miss Tox, who, in her instruction of the Toodle family, has acquired an admonitorial tone, and a habit of improving passing occasions, ‘that what has happened here, will be a warning to you, Towlinson.’ ‘Thank you, Miss, I’m sure,’ says Towlinson.
1	I hurried away to the parlour; and there I found Mr. Creakle, sitting at his breakfast with the cane and a newspaper before him, and Mrs. Creakle with an opened letter in her hand.
1	‘Well, Sir!’ said the Major.
1	It must often happen with miscellaneous ones.’ ‘With ribs (I grant you) always.
1	It was with a heavy heart that Nicholas soon afterwards--no, not retired; there was no retirement there--followed--to his dirty and crowded dormitory.
1	But if you do need to be; if you do truly feel at heart that you have indeed been towards me what you have called yourself to-night, and that there is nothing for us in this life but separation; then Heaven help you, and Heaven bless you!’ The purity with which in these words she expressed something of her own love and her own suffering, made a deep impression on him for the passing time.
1	He has handed me the keys of all his books and papers--here they are jingling in this pocket--and the only charge he has given me is “Let Mr Clennam have the means of putting himself on a perfect equality with me as to knowing whatever I know.
1	He would come triumphantly flying out of Vesuvius and Aetna ahead of the lava, and would boil unharmed in the hot springs of Iceland, and would float majestically down the Ganges and the Nile.
1	‘Hopes Ma won’t be angry, but is happily married to Mr John Rokesmith, and didn’t mention it beforehand to avoid words, and please tell darling you, and love to me, and I should like to know what you’d have said if any other unmarried member of the family had done it!’ He read the letter, and faintly exclaimed ‘Dear me!’ ‘You may well say Dear me!’ rejoined Mrs Wilfer, in a deep tone.
1	We want to brisk her up, and brisk her about, and give her a change.’ ‘That’s it!’ said the open-hearted Mrs Boffin.
1	New zig-zags sprung into the cruel pattern sometimes, when she saw it through a burst of tears; but beautified or hardened still, always over it and under it and through it, she was fain to look in her solitude, seeing everything with that ineffaceable brand.
1	And yet his interest in youth and hopefulness was not extinguished with the other embers of his soul, for he watched the boy’s earnest countenance as he spoke with unusual sympathy, though with an inexplicable show of trouble and compassion, which escaped into his looks, however hard he strove to hold it prisoner.
1	‘I must admit the wine.
1	We seem, to me, to have been months over Peregrine, and months more over the other stories.
1	‘Then I tell you what, Mr Noggs, if you want to keep in the good books in that quarter, you had better not call her the old lady any more, for I suspect she wouldn’t be best pleased to hear you.
1	We will look before we leap, and take plenty of time about it."
1	Chase was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and they were roughly hustled and maltreated.
1	‘Yes; I have seen him twice.’ ‘Isn’t HE a charming creature?’ ‘Indeed he does not strike me as being so, by any means,’ replied Kate.
1	There really is no reason why I should hesitate to say that I know very well that any little delicacy I might have had in making a request to you is quite removed.
1	When I can run about again as I used to do, Doady, let us go and see those places where we were such a silly couple, shall we?
1	If I might embrace him once!
1	The object of her regret was not long in coming to her, for the news soon spread over the house that Susan Nipper had had a disturbance with Mrs Pipchin, and that they had both appealed to Mr Dombey, and that there had been an unprecedented piece of work in Mr Dombey’s room, and that Susan was going.
1	‘You’re a young traveller, my child,’ he said, laying his hand gently on her head.
1	Ever busily winding the golden thread which bound her husband, and her father, and herself, and her old directress and companion, in a life of quiet bliss, Lucie sat in the still house in the tranquilly resounding corner, listening to the echoing footsteps of years.
1	We shall be very glad to have you for a neighbour--very glad; delighted, I’m sure--but in any other character it’s quite impossible, quite.
1	It’s thought, down on the beach, she’ll go to pieces every moment.’ The excited voice went clamouring along the staircase; and I wrapped myself in my clothes as quickly as I could, and ran into the street.
1	She did not raise her head.
1	With a part of this, it would be necessary to buy some clothes, for she had none but those she wore.
1	Mr. Bumble walked on with long strides; little Oliver, firmly grasping his gold-laced cuff, trotted beside him, inquiring at the end of every quarter of a mile whether they were 'nearly there.'
1	And the oncommonest workman can't show himself oncommon in a gridiron,--for a gridiron IS a gridiron,” said Joe, steadfastly impressing it upon me, as if he were endeavouring to rouse me from a fixed delusion, “and you may haim at what you like, but a gridiron it will come out, either by your leave or again your leave, and you can't help yourself--” “My dear Joe,” I cried, in desperation, taking hold of his coat, “don't go on in that way.
1	Away, and still away, onward and onward ever: glimpses of cottage-homes, of houses, mansions, rich estates, of husbandry and handicraft, of people, of old roads and paths that look deserted, small, and insignificant as they are left behind: and so they do, and what else is there but such glimpses, in the track of the indomitable monster, Death!
1	Damn that boy; he’s gone to sleep again.
1	When he was out of employment, I couldn’t always keep him near me.
1	I apologise.’ ‘Humbly and submissively?’ said Nicholas.
1	Master Skettles was to be a new boy after the vacation, and Fame had been busy, in Mr Feeder’s room, with his father, who was in the House of Commons, and of whom Mr Feeder had said that when he did catch the Speaker’s eye (which he had been expected to do for three or four years), it was anticipated that he would rather touch up the Radicals.
1	When he cared to talk, he talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing, which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness, was very rarely pierced by the light within him.
1	‘You wonder to hear me say that,’ remarked the old woman, shaking her head.
1	He is getting quite slow and lazy.’ ‘I suspect, my dear,’ said my aunt quietly working by her side, ‘he has a worse disorder than that.
1	“Do you suppose it will still be years hence, Mr. Jaggers?” Mr. Jaggers shook his head,--not in negativing the question, but in altogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer it,--and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked, when my eyes strayed up to them, as if they had come to a crisis in their suspended attention, and were going to sneeze.
1	‘Further away, dear Nell, pray further away.’ ‘We must go on, indeed,’ said the child, yielding to his restless wish.
1	The rim of his right ear has     been bit or cut off.’     ‘Fifty dollars reward, for my fellow Edward.
1	“I haven't begun insuring yet,” he replied.
1	'You shall give nothing at all,' said Miss Maylie, smiling; 'for, as I told you before, we shall employ you in a hundred ways; and if you only take half the trouble to please us, that you promise now, you will make me very happy indeed.'
1	‘Ah, Florence, believe me never more than now!’ ‘Why do you go away from me so often, and keep away?’ asked Florence.
1	‘To-night we three will put up at a City Hotel.
1	How Mr Toots melted away, and Mr Feeder changed into Mrs Pipchin, Paul never thought of asking; neither was he at all curious to know; but when he saw Mrs Pipchin standing at the bottom of the bed, instead of Mr Feeder, he cried out, ‘Mrs Pipchin, don’t tell Florence!’ ‘Don’t tell Florence what, my little Paul?’ said Mrs Pipchin, coming round to the bedside, and sitting down in the chair.
1	‘Did you give your son the name of Ham, because you lived in a sort of ark?’ Mr. Peggotty seemed to think it a deep idea, but answered: ‘No, sir.
1	‘But you are spoiling them for me,’ said I, as he stirred it quickly with a piece of burning wood, striking out of it a train of red-hot sparks that went careering up the little chimney, and roaring out into the air.
1	said Mr. Kenge, leading the way back.
1	‘Wasn’t it prime!’ ‘This King had a daughter, who was the wisest and most beautiful Princess that ever was seen.
1	Not at all excited by these stupendous calculations, Smallweed dismisses his friends with a cool nod and remains behind to take a little admiring notice of Polly, as opportunity may serve, and to read the daily papers, which are so very large in proportion to himself, shorn of his hat, that when he holds up the Times to run his eye over the columns, he seems to have retired for the night and to have disappeared under the bedclothes.
1	“Pardon me, Mr. Sapsea; you appear warm, sir.” “I have been warm,” I said, “and on your account.”  Having stated the circumstances at some length (my generosity almost overpowered him), I asked him his name.
1	It was not that _he_ looked to them, but that Society looked to them.
1	I have done this,” she says, “and I’ve vasted time and substance on them as has done it more than me; but I hope ven I’m gone, Veller, that you’ll think on me as I wos afore I know’d them people, and as I raly wos by natur.” ‘“Susan,” says I--I wos took up wery short by this, Samivel; I von’t deny it, my boy--“Susan,” I says, “you’ve been a wery good vife to me, altogether; don’t say nothin’ at all about it; keep a good heart, my dear; and you’ll live to see me punch that ‘ere Stiggins’s head yet.” She smiled at this, Samivel,’ said the old gentleman, stifling a sigh with his pipe, ‘but she died arter all!’ ‘Vell,’ said Sam, venturing to offer a little homely consolation, after the lapse of three or four minutes, consumed by the old gentleman in slowly shaking his head from side to side, and solemnly smoking, ‘vell, gov’nor, ve must all come to it, one day or another.’ ‘So we must, Sammy,’ said Mr. Weller the elder.
1	The keeper had brought her a chair on which she sat in the middle of the porch between us.
1	But I shall rally, my dear Dombey, in the morning; do not fear for me, or be uneasy on my account.
1	The last thing I saw was Littimer’s unruffled eye; fraught, as I fancied, with the silent conviction that I was very young indeed.
1	‘I am sure you must be very tired,’ said the mama, turning to Miss Snevellicci.
1	I wanted a little inspiration, a little freshening up, a little change of ideas, and-- ‘Pon my soul and honour,’ said the military gentleman, checking himself and looking round the room, ‘what a devilish classical thing this is!
1	No Other Country is so Favoured as This Country.’ ‘And ozer countries?--’ the foreign gentleman was beginning, when Mr Podsnap put him right again.
1	‘You don’t like to hear the name of the cause?’ said the little man, still busying himself with the knot.
1	‘You are deep, Captain Cuttle,’ pursued Carker, with the easy and vivacious frankness of a man of the world who knew the world too well to be ruffled by any discovery of misdoing, when it did not immediately concern himself, ‘but you are not quite out of soundings, either--neither you nor your absent friend, Captain.
1	'Not now, for the world,' replied the young lady.
1	And you know Mr. Lorry.” “I know Mr. Lorry, sir, much better than I know the Bailey.
1	‘It was a long way for him,’ said I, ‘for he had nothing to uphold him on the journey.’ ‘Wasn’t he fed, poor thing?’ asked Dora.
1	My aunt, on the other hand, was in a composed frame of mind, which was a lesson to all of us--to me, I am sure.
1	‘Mr Boffin, I happened to be in Chancery Lane this morning, when I saw you going along before me.
1	In the course of this day’s journey, as on subsequent occasions, we encountered some Englishmen (small farmers, perhaps, or country publicans at home) who were settled in America, and were travelling on their own affairs.
1	‘I beg your pardon, sir, for interrupting you,’ said Mr. Pickwick; ‘but before you proceed to express, and act upon, any opinion you may have formed on the statements which have been made here, I must claim my right to be heard so far as I am personally concerned.’ ‘Hold your tongue, Sir,’ said the magistrate peremptorily.
1	So should I. I was wrong.
1	‘We are not,’ roared Mr. Pickwick, in a tone which, to any dispassionate listener, carried conviction with it.
1	As its silent track in the water disappeared, the prayer that had broken up out of his heart for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors, ended in the words, “I am the resurrection and the life.” Mr. Lorry was already out when he got back, and it was easy to surmise where the good old man was gone.
1	There lived in those days, round the corner--in Bishopsgate Street Without--one Brogley, sworn broker and appraiser, who kept a shop where every description of second-hand furniture was exhibited in the most uncomfortable aspect, and under circumstances and in combinations the most completely foreign to its purpose.
1	‘It’s prime meat,’ rejoined his lady.
1	And now I began to wonder at myself for being in the coach, and to doubt whether I had sufficient reason for being there, and to consider whether I should get out presently and go back, and to argue against ever heeding an anonymous communication, and, in short, to pass through all those phases of contradiction and indecision to which I suppose very few hurried people are strangers.
1	He was Mr Merdle’s last gift to Society.
1	Rose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance; but that might have been the effect of her recent illness.
1	Mr. Bucket handed me in and took his own seat on the box.
1	The President asked, why had he returned to France when he did, and not sooner?
1	‘This plan, you see, Sir, has been gradually introduced into all the prisons for debt,’ said Mr. Trotter.
1	Judy, not interested in what she has often heard, begins to collect in a basin various tributary streams of tea, from the bottoms of cups and saucers and from the bottom of the tea-pot for the little charwoman's evening meal.
1	A Suffolk Punch, when he’s a good un, is worth his weight in gold.
1	“And why not, citizen?” “He is going to pay the forfeit: it will be paid in five minutes more.
1	But yer must know, Work'us, yer mother was a regular right-down bad 'un.'
1	‘That’s real flesh and blood!
1	Or paid off--like a ship's company.
1	The scorer not committed, the scored debited with what is against him.
1	I am bound to say so now.
1	He would have taken his gaiters off his legs, to give away.
1	And that is my sensation," says Mr. George, looking round upon the company, "at the present moment."
1	‘And the second floor?’ said Mr. Grewgious, on finding the first satisfactory.
1	‘Pon my soul, an amazing little creature!’ Barbara was the subject of Mr Chuckster’s commendations; and as she was lingering near the carriage (all being now ready for its departure), that gentleman was suddenly seized with a strong interest in the proceedings, which impelled him to swagger down the garden, and take up his position at a convenient ogling distance.
1	I began to think there was something disorderly in his being there at all, even if he had not been in the habit of putting his foot in the salt or the melted butter.
1	‘Is your business done, Alfred?’ inquired the lady.
1	I say what I mean.
1	Therefore she begged to be excused from any further attendance on the top set, until things were as they formerly was, and as they could be wished to be; and further mentioned that her little book would be found upon the breakfast-table every Saturday morning, when she requested an immediate settlement of the same, with the benevolent view of saving trouble ‘and an ill-conwenience’ to all parties.
1	Dear grandfather, let us leave this sad place to-morrow, and beg our way from door to door.’ The old man covered his face with his hands, and hid it in the pillow of the couch on which he lay.
1	Nor you, sweet-tempered Biddy!” “Your appetite's been touched like by your accident,” said the landlord, glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat.
1	The washing accommodations were primitive.
1	The poor relations caught the people who they thought would like it, and, when the game flagged, got caught themselves.
1	She did not rise also, but said, having looked at him in the meanwhile with a fixed look of suspicion, and lips angrily compressed: ‘He was the chosen associate of your dear friend, Mr Gowan, was he not?
1	‘I am the son of a country gentleman,’ returned Nicholas, ‘your equal in birth and education, and your superior I trust in everything besides.
1	I look back on the time I write of; I invoke the innocent figure that I dearly loved, to come out from the mists and shadows of the past, and turn its gentle head towards me once again; and I can still declare that this one little speech was constantly in my memory.
1	Ve-ry happy, I am sure!"
1	I have put these considerations to you, my dear Sir, very feebly and imperfectly, but I ask you to think of them.
1	shut the door upon the wretched creature who is in it now, and put its screen before a place, quite unsurpassed in all the vice, neglect, and devilry, of the worst old town in Europe.
1	A pot of beer had appeared from the Jolly Bargemen, and they were sharing it by turns in a peaceable manner.
1	I should have gone to bed with a sore heart indeed under any other roof but that which sheltered little Em’ly’s head.
1	‘When I say lovely,’ said Bar, ‘I always mean you.’ ‘You never mean anything, I think,’ returned Mrs Merdle (not displeased).
1	Do not think so poorly of me as to believe that I feign a love I do not feel.
1	It sent the most insurrectionary tune into the world that was ever composed.
1	The general opinion among this class of gentlemen was, that it was a weak thing in Dombey, and he’d live to repent it.
1	Implicit faith in the deception was the first article of his creed.
1	Does her credit, under the circumstances, in my opinion!’ She still looked faint and pale.
1	"And so have I," cried Peter.
1	I'll have no feelings here.
1	“Miss Manette, look upon the prisoner.” To be confronted with such pity, and such earnest youth and beauty, was far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd.
1	They’re true to one another, faithfo’ to one another, ’fectionate to one another, e’en to death.
1	Both these heads of information were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr. Jaggers, of the possessions he supposed I should inherit.
1	Mr. Smallweed is quite clear that he had better not.
1	Perhaps that will be considered an acceptable course of proceeding.
1	‘Yes,’ said the Doctor, who, with his half-shut eyes, and his usual smile, seemed to survey Paul with the sort of interest that might attach to some choice little animal he was going to stuff.
1	'Yes, sir, rather thirsty,' answered Oliver.
1	This was bad, but not the worst.
1	Though he was soon satisfied that he had dismissed the idea as romantic and unlikely--though possible, there was no denying--he could not help pursuing it so far as to entertain within himself a picture of what his condition would be, if he should discover such an imposture when he was grown old.
1	Or if it was partly, was it wholly and entirely?
1	‘You’ll find it a most amazing stool to sit down upon, you may depend,’ returned Mr Brass.
1	Thus Mr. Snevellicci had no sooner swallowed another glassful than he smiled upon all present in happy forgetfulness of having exhibited symptoms of pugnacity, and proposed ‘The ladies!
1	Perhaps we shall change that,’ said Mr Boffin with a threatening roll of his head.
1	Pray am I at all near the mark in my picture?’ As abrupt in his conclusion as in his commencement and progress, he jerked this inquiry at Edwin, and stopped when one might have supposed him in the middle of his oration.
1	In pursuance of this determination, little Oliver, to his excessive astonishment, was released from bondage, and ordered to put himself into a clean shirt.
1	Having no reply ready, he could do no better than embrace her.
1	then this is not my natural manner?’ she rejoined.
1	The cry is taken up by a hundred voices, and the crowd accumulate at every turning.
1	It only wants attending to.
1	Bunsby, who was one of those sages who act upon conviction, took some days to get the conviction thoroughly into his mind, that he had received a letter to this effect.
1	He is called to the bar; and with admirable industry and self-denial has scraped another hundred pounds together, to fee a Conveyancer whose chambers he attends.
1	His white apron flaps languidly in the air, his head gradually droops upon his breast, he takes very long winks with both eyes at once; even he is unable to withstand the soporific influence of the place, and is gradually falling asleep.
1	His high personal popularity, and the clearness of his answers, made a great impression; but, as he proceeded, as he showed that the Accused was his first friend on his release from his long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in England, always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in their exile; that, so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat government there, he had actually been tried for his life by it, as the foe of England and friend of the United States--as he brought these circumstances into view, with the greatest discretion and with the straightforward force of truth and earnestness, the Jury and the populace became one.
1	Still the restless mind went, following and counting, ever farther, ever higher, as to the summit of a mighty tower that it took years to climb.
1	Arthur, my dear fellow, confess at once that you expected me before.’ ‘I did,’ said Arthur; ‘but Amy told me--’ ‘Little Dorrit.
1	As I consider myself responsible for him, Mr Gills,’ here he smiled a wide smile at Rob, who shook before it: ‘I shall be glad if you’ll look sharply after him, and report his behaviour to me.
1	I shall not fail to correspond.
1	Always Merdle.’ ‘Very strange how these runs on an infatuation prevail,’ said Arthur.
1	Alfred said, “Don’t come back, Sophronia, until you have seen Mr Boffin, and told him all.
1	‘I am for Highgate tonight.
1	‘Stand back here, will you, and let me knock.’ Anything that makes a noise is satisfactory to a crowd.
1	We can’t be happy together for five minutes in the evening, but some intrusive female knocks at the door, and says, ‘Oh, if you please, Miss Dora, would you step upstairs!’ Miss Clarissa and my aunt roam all over London, to find out articles of furniture for Dora and me to look at.
1	'I am sorry,' stammered Oliver, confused by the strange man's wild look.
1	Jasper was that, Tope?’ ‘Yes, Mr. Dean.’ ‘He has stayed late.’ ‘Yes, Mr. Dean.
1	I am sure, although absorbed in gazing at the water, that her shawl was off her shoulders, and that she was muffling her hands in it, in an unsettled and bewildered way, more like the action of a sleep-walker than a waking person.
1	You see how composed he has become, and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me now.
1	Ada suggested that it was comfortable to know that Mr. Jellyby did not mean these destructive sentiments.
1	On Steerforth’s replying in the affirmative, she pushed a chair against it, and begging the assistance of my hand, mounted up, pretty nimbly, to the top, as if it were a stage.
1	One: I remember his changing a small folded paper from one pocket to another, after we came out, which he had not touched before.
1	His door being shut, she softly opened it and spoke to him, approaching his bed with a noiseless step.
1	‘Therefore I can judge,’ said Mr Perch, shaking his head and speaking in a silvery murmur, ‘of the feelings of such as is at all peculiarly sitiwated in this most painful rewelation.’ Here Mr Perch waited to be confided in; and receiving no confidence, coughed behind his hand.
1	You have no young child?"
1	No, Copperfield!’ shaking his head.
1	He had a wonderful satisfaction in seeing him, and in commenting on his decayed condition after he was gone.
1	‘Oh, quite enough to get, Sir, as the soldier said ven they ordered him three hundred and fifty lashes,’ replied Sam.
1	Affery, remembering that the clever one had said he would explain himself further in four-and-twenty hours’ time, determined for her part that his taking himself off within that period with all he could get, was the final satisfactory sum and substance of his promised explanation; but she held her peace, devoutly thankful to be quit of him.
1	The meek man supposed he did, but supposed that had absolutely nothing to do with it, if its laws were well administered.
1	The tradesmen held that he was a sort of lawyer, and the other neighbours opined that he was a kind of general agent; both of which guesses were as correct and definite as guesses about other people’s affairs usually are, or need to be.
1	After lingering at the finger-post for a few minutes to see the stilts frisking away in the moonlight and the bearer of the drum toiling slowly after them, he blew a few notes upon the trumpet as a parting salute, and hastened with all speed to follow Mr Codlin.
1	Rachael will coom then; and arterwards I’ll see thee safe t’ thy Travellers’ lodgin.
1	‘You are very good,’ said Gowan.
1	‘Tell him I was hearty, and sent my respects.
1	'I heerd it now, quite apparent,' resumed Mr. Giles.
1	But as this is the Fellowships, gentlemen, where the lights are, I recommend dropping the subject.
1	We must have our national schools to walk at the head of, and we must have our standing armies.
1	I have no occasion to relate that I succeeded.
1	"I presume this is your other ward, Miss Clare?"
1	‘I mean,’ he explained, ‘that young ways were never my ways.
1	Stately among these restless Insects, were two or three large ships, moving with slow majestic pace, as creatures of a prouder kind, disdainful of their puny journeys, and making for the broad sea.
1	‘Do you not, sir--without intending it--of a surety without intending it--sometimes mingle the character I fairly earn in your employment, with the character which it is your policy that I should bear?’ ‘I don’t find it worth my while to cut things so fine as to go into the inquiry,’ Fascination coolly answered.
1	‘Twelve shillings a week, even when they are an old man’s wages, bury themselves.’ ‘I should like to know what you really are worth,’ returned Fledgeby, with whom his growing rich on that stipend and gratitude was a very convenient fiction.
1	Let him rot there.’ ‘Certainly, sir.
1	So, in the rosy evening, one might watch the ever-widening beauty of the landscape--beyond the newly-released workers wending home--beyond the silver river--beyond the deep green fields of corn, so prospering, that the loiterers in their narrow threads of pathway seemed to float immersed breast-high--beyond the hedgerows and the clumps of trees--beyond the windmills on the ridge--away to where the sky appeared to meet the earth, as if there were no immensity of space between mankind and Heaven.
1	She made use of me to tease other admirers, and she turned the very familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting a constant slight on my devotion to her.
1	With all that ruin at my feet and about me, it seemed a natural place for me, that day.
1	How do you suppose you are ever to get through life, if you’re such a coward as this?
1	Counterfeit stock got into circulation.
1	She remembered well, that even the old woman who had robbed her when a little child--whose image and whose house, and all she had said and done, were stamped upon her recollection, with the enduring sharpness of a fearful impression made at that early period of life--had spoken fondly of her daughter, and how terribly even she had cried out in the pain of hopeless separation from her child.
1	You can’t put any confidence in him, sir.
1	Our old selves weren’t people of fortune; our new selves are; it’s a great difference.’ ‘Ah!’ said Mrs Boffin, pausing in her work again, softly to draw a long breath and to look at the fire.
1	However, the permission was given, and was never retracted; for when the month was out, Peggotty and I were ready to depart.
1	‘Had I not seen, at a morning concert, the demdest little fascinator in all the world, and while that little fascinator is my wife, may not all the countesses and dowagers in England be--’ Mr. Mantalini did not finish the sentence, but he gave Madame Mantalini a very loud kiss, which Madame Mantalini returned; after which, there seemed to be some more kissing mixed up with the progress of the breakfast.
1	I’ll be more communicative with you.
1	‘The speculations of an Angular man,’ resumed Mr. Grewgious, still sitting and speaking exactly as before, ‘are probably erroneous on so globular a topic.
1	Wouldn’t that make a difference, Copperfield?
1	And what do we live for but sympathy!
1	‘See that the boiler’s full.
1	Out they came forthwith; Mr Witherden, who was short, chubby, fresh-coloured, brisk, and pompous, leading the old lady with extreme politeness, and the father and son following them, arm in arm.
1	And then they began to fish.
1	‘Still, it is a triumph to me to know that he is so true to himself, and to his name of Dombey; although, of course, I always knew he would be.
1	‘More care!’ said the old man in a shrill voice, ‘more care of Nelly!
1	With a view to their rational and moral enjoyment, Brother Mordlin had adapted the beautiful words of ‘Who hasn’t heard of a Jolly Young Waterman?’ to the tune of the Old Hundredth, which he would request them to join him in singing (great applause).
1	He never came there heated with wine.
1	Take my word, it’s nothing whatever.
1	cried the old gentleman, bursting out with the rage he had kept down so long, 'd--n me!
1	The site is beautiful: and from the top there is a charming panoramic view of the whole town and neighbourhood.
1	Miss Fanny awakened much affectionate uneasiness in her sister’s mind that day by passing the greater part of it in violent fits of embracing her, and in alternately giving her brooches, and wishing herself dead.
1	“I'm not a going back.
1	Mr. Fang sat silent for some minutes, and then, turning round to the prosecutor, said in a towering passion.
1	I have seen it many times since then, by sunlight and by moonlight, but never free from the impressions of that journey.
1	The shadow on his face was darker when he turned his glance away from her; and even then it wandered back again, furtively, as if he were haunted by her bold eyes, and some remembrance they inspired.
1	As I recall our being opposed thus, face to face, I seem again to hear my heart beat fast and high.
1	But when she married again--when she took that most disastrous step of marrying you, in short,’ said my aunt, ‘to be plain--did no one put in a word for the boy at that time?’ ‘My late wife loved her second husband, ma’am,’ said Mr. Murdstone, ‘and trusted implicitly in him.’ ‘Your late wife, sir, was a most unworldly, most unhappy, most unfortunate baby,’ returned my aunt, shaking her head at him.
1	When I was clear of the house, a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind, and my arms were pinioned.
1	I kept my ears open, seeming to have them shut, until I heard that he was absent, and I thought that would be the best time for making the attempt.
1	‘Take Christopher by all means.’ ‘I beg your pardon, Sir,’ said Kit, who had listened to this discourse with a lengthening countenance, ‘but if that’s the reason, I’m afraid I should do more harm than good--Miss Nell, Sir, she knows me, and would trust in me, I am sure; but old master--I don’t know why, gentlemen; nobody does--would not bear me in his sight after he had been ill, and Miss Nell herself told me that I must not go near him or let him see me any more.
1	Who was this, do you think?’ ‘Why do you ask me?’ repeated Harriet.
1	“How much?” “Only two sets of them.” “Give me the worst first.” “There they are, Sydney.
1	He had scarcely left the room, and allowed the ticking to become audible again, when a quick hand turned a latchkey in the house-door, opened it, and shut it.
1	What if I were to turn too?
1	‘Little Kate Nickleby’ were the words that caught his ear.
1	‘If you please,’ said she.
1	He had laid out the few feet of ground, behind, with exquisite neatness, and had made a little bed in the centre, that looked, by-the-bye, like a grave.
1	Mrs. Rouncewell might have been sufficiently assured by hearing the rain, but that she is rather deaf, which nothing will induce her to believe.
1	‘Dear me!’ said Mr Sampson, ‘you too!
1	All this time, the ringing at the bell was constantly renewed, and those without were beating at the door.
1	‘You are better?’ said the child, stopping to speak with him.
1	Miss Trotwood, David, pray come and see the Doctor.’ I was conscious of Mr. Dick’s standing in the shadow of the room, shutting up his knife, when we accompanied her to the Study; and of my aunt’s rubbing her nose violently, by the way, as a mild vent for her intolerance of our military friend; but who got first into the Study, or how Mrs. Markleham settled herself in a moment in her easy-chair, or how my aunt and I came to be left together near the door (unless her eyes were quicker than mine, and she held me back), I have forgotten, if I ever knew.
1	‘She is a very charming girl, but she has a great deal of feeling.
1	English grammar, composition, geography, and the use of the dumb-bells, by Miss Melissa Wackles; writing, arithmetic, dancing, music, and general fascination, by Miss Sophia Wackles; the art of needle-work, marking, and samplery, by Miss Jane Wackles; corporal punishment, fasting, and other tortures and terrors, by Mrs Wackles.
1	You have stood of your own strength ever since.
1	Few children were to be seen, and no dogs.
1	"You girls are more trouble than you're worth, by half."
1	Upon my word and honour I seem to be fated, and destined, and ordained, to live in the midst of things that I am never to hear the last of.
1	‘Not that my life has been lonely, for I could have sometimes wished it lonelier, instead of having Ma going on like the Tragic Muse with a face-ache in majestic corners, and Lavvy being spiteful--though of course I am very fond of them both.
1	‘Hush!’ ‘You nasty, idle, vicious, good-for-nothing brute,’ cried the woman, stamping on the ground, ‘why don’t you turn the mangle?’ ‘So I am, my life and soul!’ replied the man’s voice.
1	If I had taken a hackney-chariot and gone by the streets, I should have missed my aim; going as I did, I caught the coach just as it came out of the yard.
1	'That's for your people,' said the guard.
1	‘Dear me!’ said Mr. Omer.
1	What has brought you here?
1	I was in this state when I first shrunk from the light as it twinkled on me once more, and knew with a boundless joy for which no words are rapturous enough that I should see again.
1	There was nobody at the chambers but Young Blight.
1	It turned him paler; but he repeated that he would cling to the hope he had derived from Mr. Grewgious; and that if no trace of his dear boy were found, leading to the dreadful inference that he had been made away with, he would cherish unto the last stretch of possibility the idea, that he might have absconded of his own wild will.
1	‘You just come away,’ said Mr. Weller.
1	You will please to answer no, it is not enough.’ ‘A moment!’ cried Carker, interposing, ‘permit me!
1	Consequently you're very far from wanting to give trouble.
1	I thought of him very much after I went to bed, and raised myself, I recollect, to look at him where he lay in the moonlight, with his handsome face turned up, and his head reclining easily on his arm.
1	It was at the time when my troubles were at their highest, and when I was most incensed against my lover for his ingratitude in caring as little as he did for the innumerable distresses and mortifications I underwent on his account, that your dear friend, Mr Gowan, appeared at the house.
1	Nathaniel Pipkin could hear him growling away like an old mastiff with a sore throat; and whenever the unfortunate apprentice with the thin legs came into the room, so surely did old Lobbs commence swearing at him in a most Saracenic and ferocious manner, though apparently with no other end or object than that of easing his bosom by the discharge of a few superfluous oaths.
1	A destiny, little fellow!’ As he thus apostrophised the infant he raised one of his hands to his lips, and kissed it; then, seeming to fear that the action involved some compromise of his dignity, went, awkwardly enough, away.
1	Mr. Dick is wild with joy, and my aunt remits me a guinea by the next post.
1	‘What Princess was that, Maggy?’ ‘Lor!
1	"Now, do you suppose he really has got hold of any other papers of importance, as he has boasted to you, since you have been such allies?"
1	‘It hasn’t anything to do with you.’ ‘Has it anything to do with--is it anything you heard through chinks or keyholes--and that you were not intended to hear?’ asked Dick, in a breathless state.
1	Mrs. Jellyby, sitting in quite a nest of waste paper, drank coffee all the evening and dictated at intervals to her eldest daughter.
1	Pausing from his work, he leant on his spade, and put his hand to his dull ear.
1	When she began to walk and talk, he became fond of her; bought a little arm-chair and stood it by the high fender of the lodge fire-place; liked to have her company when he was on the lock; and used to bribe her with cheap toys to come and talk to him.
1	‘Be mine, be mine!’ cried the old gentleman.
1	I am ashamed to say that I cannot at this moment recall where we met, but I am so glad of this opportunity, I am sure!’ Then pouncing upon Twemlow, who holds back with all his feeble might, he is haling him off to present him, as Veneering, to Mrs Podsnap, when the arrival of more guests unravels the mistake.
1	Which is the man?” “Here is the man,” said Joe.
1	‘I called to ask this morning.’ ‘Thank you very much!’ the pleasant voice of Florence would reply.
1	Every patient in this asylum sits down to dinner every day with a knife and fork; and in the midst of them sits the gentleman, whose manner of dealing with his charges, I have just described.
1	The day changes as it wears itself away and becomes dark and drizzly.
1	The air was ‘Away with melancholy’--a composition, which, when it is played very slowly on the flute, in bed, with the further disadvantage of being performed by a gentleman but imperfectly acquainted with the instrument, who repeats one note a great many times before he can find the next, has not a lively effect.
1	Y.--but really this was too bad!
1	Let me see them again, and beg them, on my knees, to show the same mercy and goodness to you; and let us both leave this dreadful place, and far apart lead better lives, and forget how we have lived, except in prayers, and never see each other more.
1	Then the Major called at Mr Dombey’s house in town; and came down again, in the same coach as Mr Dombey.
1	Towards the twilight I went out by myself, musing on what I ought to do, and whether I was justified in withholding from Agnes, any longer, what Uriah Heep had told me in London; for that began to trouble me again, very much.
1	And now, sir, I may admit, freely admit, that my friend is sometimes of a sarcastic temper.’ ‘The lady is your friend’s wife, sir?’ ‘The lady is my friend’s wife, sir.’ ‘She is very handsome.’ ‘Sir, she is peerless.
1	‘Thank you,’ he returned, with fervour.
1	A fair profit is, of course, allowable.'
1	Traddles, with a perceptible lengthening of his face, explained that he had not been able to approach this subject; that it had shared the fate of Mr. Micawber’s liabilities, in not being comprehended in the terms he had made; that we were no longer of any authority with Uriah Heep; and that if he could do us, or any of us, any injury or annoyance, no doubt he would.
1	He is, I say again without disguise, a low mercenary wretch.
1	At least, Mr John Rokesmith seemed perfectly satisfied when he descried them on board.
1	It had been hard--how hard may none but Florence ever know!--to have the natural affection of a true and earnest nature turned to agony; and slight, or stern repulse, substituted for the tenderest protection and the dearest care.
1	‘I have saved him,’ she thought.
1	According to your own account I’m not worth much,’ Wegg reasons persuasively.
1	Probably, it took about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely; and that may have been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in various stages of decay.
1	‘That he may be ready--in case of anything turning up.’ ‘And do you go too, ma’am?’ The events of the day, in combination with the twins, if not with the flip, had made Mrs. Micawber hysterical, and she shed tears as she replied: ‘I never will desert Mr. Micawber.
1	‘You will not be long dressing, Mrs Dombey, I presume?’ said Mr Dombey.
1	The scamp has been obliged to fly, as I learn, for some knavery, and has found his way abroad.
1	The son inheriting, was so merciful as to forgive me both, and place me here.’ He made a little gesture as though he kissed the hem of an imaginary garment worn by the noble youth before him.
1	Sometimes, the table consisted of Twemlow and half a dozen leaves; sometimes, of Twemlow and a dozen leaves; sometimes, Twemlow was pulled out to his utmost extent of twenty leaves.
1	He stepped into the sober, silent, air-tight house--one might have fancied it to have been stifled by Mutes in the Eastern manner--and the door, closing again, seemed to shut out sound and motion.
1	I am not certain whether I found out then, or afterwards, that, without being actively concerned in any business, he had some share in, or some annual charge upon the profits of, a wine-merchant’s house in London, with which his family had been connected from his great-grandfather’s time, and in which his sister had a similar interest; but I may mention it in this place, whether or no.
1	‘That’s the witness-box, I suppose?’ said Mr. Pickwick, pointing to a kind of pulpit, with a brass rail, on his left hand.
1	So surely as I looked towards her, did I see that eager visage, with its gaunt black eyes and searching brow, intent on mine; or passing suddenly from mine to Steerforth’s; or comprehending both of us at once.
1	Con-fined, as the lady said.’ ‘A prisoner!’ exclaimed Mr. Winkle, with unaccountable vehemence.
1	"Only a matter of form, miss," returned the young gentleman.
1	'Meat, ma'am, meat,' replied Bumble, with stern emphasis.
1	Fitz Jarndyce on my left!"
1	Taking the bread under his arm, the young gentlman turned into a small public-house, and led the way to a tap-room in the rear of the premises.
1	Upon it, one of the two men lolled, half sitting and half lying, with his knees drawn up, and his feet and shoulders planted against the opposite sides of the aperture.
1	On this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded a pint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat, for my greater comfort, while Mrs. Joe held my head under her arm, as a boot would be held in a bootjack.
1	If this young lord does dog your footsteps, and whisper his drivelling inanities in your ears, what of it?
1	"Yet, you silly little thing!
1	He left here,’ said Traddles, ‘with his mother, who had been clamouring, and beseeching, and disclosing, the whole time.
1	If anyone else had been in my place during the last few years, by this time he would have had Mr. Wickfield (oh, what a worthy man he is, Master Copperfield, too!)
1	There was neither knocker nor bell-handle at the open door where Oliver and his master stopped; so, groping his way cautiously through the dark passage, and bidding Oliver keep close to him and not be afraid the undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs.
1	If you seriously want to follow up the niece, tell the uncle that you must know where she lives and how she lives, and with whom, or you are no longer a customer of his.
1	I feared you were going, with malice aforethought, as the dreadful lawyers say--those horrid prosers!--to condemn me to utter solitude.’ ‘Why do me so great an injustice, my dear madam?’ said Mr Dombey.
1	‘Good morning, Sir,’ said Miss Tox; very coldly.
1	“He first laughed at my words, and then frowned at them.
1	No matter how incidentally or naturally I endeavoured to form my little wife’s mind, I could not help seeing that she always had an instinctive perception of what I was about, and became a prey to the keenest apprehensions.
1	I pity you, and I despise you!"
1	The mournfulness of the place and time, and the great terror of this illusion, though it was but momentary, caused me to feel an indescribable awe as I came out between the open wooden gates where I had once wrung my hair after Estella had wrung my heart.
1	Mr. George is mightily curious in respect of the room.
1	Every house without a signal will be fired upon by the British troops.
1	And could I help it if with all this, and the coming to the little school, and the unexpected sight of the poor children outside waving their hats and bonnets to me, and of a grey-haired gentleman and lady whose daughter I had helped to teach and at whose house I had visited (who were said to be the proudest people in all that country), caring for nothing but calling out, "Good-bye, Esther.
1	The seconds retired, the gentleman on the camp-stool did the same, and the belligerents approached each other.
1	In face she bore a striking resemblance to her brother, Sampson--so exact, indeed, was the likeness between them, that had it consorted with Miss Brass’s maiden modesty and gentle womanhood to have assumed her brother’s clothes in a frolic and sat down beside him, it would have been difficult for the oldest friend of the family to determine which was Sampson and which Sally, especially as the lady carried upon her upper lip certain reddish demonstrations, which, if the imagination had been assisted by her attire, might have been mistaken for a beard.
1	Wouldn’t you go a day’s journey, if you were in my place?’ His face was thoughtful, and he sat considering a little before he answered, in a low voice, ‘Well!
1	You know M. R. F., but not as well as I do.
1	He took her hair into his hand again, and looked closely at it.
1	Let them rest though; they’re better gone.’ ‘Much better, dear,’ replied the child.
1	come, that’s too absurd.’ Notwithstanding the absurdity of the proposal, however, the clerk allowed himself to be gently drawn beyond the hearing of Mr. Pickwick; and after a short conversation conducted in whispers, walked softly down a little dark passage, and disappeared into the legal luminary’s sanctum, whence he shortly returned on tiptoe, and informed Mr. Perker and Mr. Pickwick that the Serjeant had been prevailed upon, in violation of all established rules and customs, to admit them at once.
1	It is not, I assure you.’ Comforted by this intelligence, the patient applied himself to his food with a keen appetite, though evidently not with a greater zest in the eating than his nurse appeared to have in seeing him eat.
1	But it can’t be helped now; it’s too late to help it now.
1	For to think that he should have come into the property wrongful, however innocent, and--more than that--might have gone on keeping it to his dying day, turned him whiter than chalk.’ ‘And you too,’ said Mr Boffin.
1	‘It’s the talk of all the neighbours, and there are some even that know of their having been seen on board ship, and can tell you the name of the place they’ve gone to, which is more than I can, my dear, for it’s a very hard one.’ ‘I don’t believe it,’ said Kit.
1	‘I do as I am bidden by my principal.
1	I fear not, my dear Sir; they are too clever for that, I doubt.
1	I stopped, and he came up breathless.
1	How much have I to be thankful for, in that!
1	As he stood there, waiting his arrival, the knocker caught his eye.
1	‘Morleena, child--give me my hat.’ ‘Oh, you’re not going, Mr. Lillyvick, sir,’ interposed Miss Petowker, with her most bewitching smile.
1	The dying ashes have no light to spare, and his endeavours are vain.
1	‘That trying climate!--like living, they tell me, on a sand-heap, underneath a burning-glass!
1	On his head, he wore a broad-brimmed sugar-loaf hat, garnished with a single feather.
1	‘He has only just come home.
1	Why did you who read this, commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own last year, last month, last week?
1	It was his way in business, often.
1	"When I returned," he told me, "when I came back, no richer than when I went away, and found you newly risen from a sick bed, yet so inspired by sweet consideration for others and so free from a selfish thought--" "Oh, Mr. Woodcourt, forbear, forbear!"
1	Honest Captain Cuttle, as the weeks flew over him in his fortified retreat, by no means abated any of his prudent provisions against surprise, because of the non-appearance of the enemy.
1	Is there anything?’ ‘Nothing,’ she replied.
1	‘He’s not much used to ladies’ society, and it makes him bashful.
1	He is presently reassured on these subjects by the unchallengeable reality of Mrs. Snagsby, sitting up with her head in a perfect beehive of curl-papers and night-cap, who has dispatched Guster to the police-station with official intelligence of her husband's being made away with, and who within the last two hours has passed through every stage of swooning with the greatest decorum.
1	“I want,” she said, “to pursue that subject you mentioned to me when you were last here, and to show you that I am not all stone.
1	(Brimstone apparently suggested by his eye lighting on Mrs. Smallweed in her slumber.)
1	"Why, good gracious, gentlemen," says Mr. Snagsby, somewhat promptly backed away, "I was at this door last night betwixt ten and eleven o'clock in conversation with the young man who lodges here."
1	My poor, affectionate, failing Frederick!
1	He is very regular in his walks, is my son.
1	He planted a board, which he had carried up with him for the purpose, so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty to open it from the inside; and creeping over the tiles, looked over the low parapet.
1	You're my son,--more to me nor any son.
1	I didn't say much to you, commander, then, for I was took by surprise that a person so strong and healthy and bold as you was should stop to speak to such a limping bag of bones as I was.
1	Six nights passed--six long weary nights--and on each, Fagin came home with a disappointed face, and briefly intimated that it was not yet time.
1	I am quite aware, Miss Dombey, of my own deficiencies--they’re not of the least consequence, thank you--but I am entirely to be relied upon, I do assure you, Miss Dombey.’ With that Mr Toots came out of the room, again accompanied by the Captain, who, standing at a little distance, holding his hat under his arm and arranging his scattered locks with his hook, had been a not uninterested witness of what passed.
1	‘Lord bless my soul, Eugene!’ cried Lightwood, laughing again, ‘what a mad fellow you are!
1	Swiftly now, indeed, the time flew by until it was the evening before the day appointed for the marriage.
1	As we did not land at Boston, in consequence of some detention at the wharf, until after dark, I received my first impressions of the city in walking down to the Custom-house on the morning after our arrival, which was Sunday.
1	‘How weak am I,’ said Arthur Clennam, when he was gone, ‘that I could shed tears at this reception!
1	There was another thing the woman did.
1	You are a man of business, too.” “And as such,” quoth Mr. Lorry, whom the counsel learned in the law had now shouldered back into the group, just as he had previously shouldered him out of it--“as such I will appeal to Doctor Manette, to break up this conference and order us all to our homes.
1	Most people are when they’ve little to do and less to get.
1	said the young man, eagerly.
1	The great trees, which had looked shrunken and bare in the earlier months, had now burst into strong life and health; and stretching forth their green arms over the thirsty ground, converted open and naked spots into choice nooks, where was a deep and pleasant shade from which to look upon the wide prospect, steeped in sunshine, which lay stretched beyond.
1	It may turn even means as unexpected and unpromising as these, to account.
1	‘What do you mean to do?
1	It was nothing to her that it kept her in a tributary position, and showed her in attendance on the flaming car in which Miss Fanny sat on an elevated seat, exacting homage; she sought no better place.
1	The ironmaster, repressing his amused smile, assents.
1	Jasper and Durdles would have turned this wall in another instant; but, stopping so short, stand behind it.
1	She was alone all day, for, after an early breakfast her husband repaired every morning to the City, and did not return until their late dinner hour.
1	‘What’s the matter, Pa?’ ‘--of a splendid female,’ he resumed more slowly, ‘putting up with such accommodation as the present!--Is that a new dress you have on, my dear?’ ‘No, Pa, an old one.
1	These were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat, and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy looks.
1	The house is full of boarders, both married and single, many of whom sleep upon the premises, and contract by the week for their board and lodging: the charge for which diminishes as they go nearer the sky to roost.
1	“What was he like?” “Monseigneur, he was whiter than the miller.
1	I am perfectly honest and outspoken.
1	Please not yet a while!
1	‘Would you believe it!’ he said.
1	You _mutht_ have uth, Thquire.
1	In writing by post to Magwitch--in New South Wales--or in communicating with him through Provis, have the goodness to mention that the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to you, together with the balance; for there is still a balance remaining.
1	Mrs Miff remembers, like wise, as if it had happened yesterday, the first wife’s funeral, and then the christening, and then the other funeral; and Mrs Miff says, by-the-by she’ll soap-and-water that ‘ere tablet presently, against the company arrive.
1	and Oh, John agean,’ replied the Yorkshireman.
1	It belonged to a red-haired person--a youth of fifteen, as I take it now, but looking much older--whose hair was cropped as close as the closest stubble; who had hardly any eyebrows, and no eyelashes, and eyes of a red-brown, so unsheltered and unshaded, that I remember wondering how he went to sleep.
1	He told the worthy Mrs Chivery, after turning these things over in his mind--he did that, indeed, while she was yet speaking--that he might be relied upon to do his utmost at all times to promote the happiness of Miss Dorrit, and to further the wishes of her heart if it were in his power to do so, and if he could discover what they were.
1	The only wonder is, that people ain’t killed oftener by them Mails.’ ‘This person is not killed, I hope?’ ‘I don’t know!’ said the man, ‘it an’t for the want of a will in them Mails, if he an’t.’ The speaker having folded his arms, and set in comfortably to address his depreciation of them Mails to any of the bystanders who would listen, several voices, out of pure sympathy with the sufferer, confirmed him; one voice saying to Clennam, ‘They’re a public nuisance, them Mails, sir;’ another, ‘_I_ see one on ‘em pull up within half a inch of a boy, last night;’ another, ‘_I_ see one on ‘em go over a cat, sir--and it might have been your own mother;’ and all representing, by implication, that if he happened to possess any public influence, he could not use it better than against them Mails.
1	At present, you may buy your food, and nothing more.” There were in the cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress.
1	What connexion can there have been between many people in the innumerable histories of this world who from opposite sides of great gulfs have, nevertheless, been very curiously brought together!
1	A small, dim, crooked shop, kept in a tortuous, up-hill thoroughfare, by a small, dim, crooked man.
1	Because he’s got it here.’ The lecturer held up the tightly clenched right hand.
1	I did something--bowed, I suppose--and was all attention, when the other sister struck in.
1	If at the expiration of that time, when she has so far profited by her advantages as that you may be upon a fair equality, you are both in the same mind, I will do my part to make you happy.'
1	They had no depth or change; they glittered, and they opened and shut.
1	‘I have spoken of him as still living,’ she added, ‘but he may have been put out of the way for anything I know.
1	Upon a shelf in an open cupboard were a plate or two, a cup or two, and so forth, but all dry and empty.
1	‘Grazing,’ said Squeers, raising his voice, under the impression that as Ralph failed to comprehend him, he must be deaf.
1	‘Ma,’ said Bella, angrily, ‘you force me to say that I am truly sorry I did come home, and that I never will come home again, except when poor dear Pa is here.
1	What if he went abroad, and his mother or Kate were to die the while?
1	“Well!” she cried, picking up the pocket-handkerchief, “if that don't make seven times!
1	By eight we all sat down in one of its Hotels, to eat and drink together for the last time.
1	Such frigid and constrained, yet prompt and pointed acquiescence with the wishes he imposed upon her, and on no one else, was sufficiently remarkable to penetrate through all the mysteries of picquet, and impress itself on Mr Carker’s keen attention.
1	How could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind?
1	This quarter passed, they came upon the haunts of commerce and great traffic, where many people were resorting, and business was already rife.
1	I ask you--for information--what does that mean?
1	Mr. Snodgrass, as usual, took a great mass of notes, which would no doubt have afforded most useful and valuable information, had not the burning eloquence of the words or the feverish influence of the wine made that gentleman’s hand so extremely unsteady, as to render his writing nearly unintelligible, and his style wholly so.
1	‘With me, sir?’ retorted Sir Mulberry Hawk, eyeing him in disdainful surprise.
1	Mr. Skimpin bowed, to intimate that he was.
1	‘But,’ resumes Neville, ‘I am accountable for mentioning it to you.
1	‘Where is she!’ cried this lady.
1	‘By Bacchus!’ he said at last, as if he were forced to the admission, ‘I have sometimes had a thought of going to Paris, and perhaps to England.’ ‘Cavalletto.
1	‘A long time,’ said I.
1	Everybody uses the comb and brush, except myself.
1	“You are,” said Fogg; “get out, sir; get out of this office, Sir, and come back, Sir, when you know how to behave yourself.” Well, Ramsey tried to speak, but Fogg wouldn’t let him, so he put the money in his pocket, and sneaked out.
1	Better employed than to attend to it,’ said Mr Boffin.
1	In the hurry of preparation: which Walter purposely enhanced as much as possible: the old man lost what little self-possession he ever had; and so the time of departure drew on rapidly.
1	‘Alfred, my dear, Mr Fledgeby very justly says, apropos of the last scene, that true constancy would not require any such stimulant as the stage deems necessary.’ To which Mr Lammle would reply, ‘Ay, Sophronia, my love, but as Georgiana has observed to me, the lady had no sufficient reason to know the state of the gentleman’s affections.’ To which Mrs Lammle would rejoin, ‘Very true, Alfred; but Mr Fledgeby points out,’ this.
1	This would justify the hypothesis that the watch was taken from him not long after he left Mr. Jasper’s house at midnight, in company with the last person seen with him, and that it had been thrown away after being retained some hours.
1	So the dream increased in rapture when Mr Dorrit came out of the bank alone, and people looked at _him_ in default of Mr Merdle, and when, with the ears of his mind, he heard the frequent exclamation as he rolled glibly along, ‘A wonderful man to be Mr Merdle’s friend!’ At dinner that day, although the occasion was not foreseen and provided for, a brilliant company of such as are not made of the dust of the earth, but of some superior article for the present unknown, shed their lustrous benediction upon Mr Dorrit’s daughter’s marriage.
1	Almost as soon as it shone upon the oyster-shell frame of my mirror I was out of bed, and out with little Em’ly, picking up stones upon the beach.
1	"I believe so, your ladyship."
1	I hold this slow and daily tampering with the mysteries of the brain, to be immeasurably worse than any torture of the body: and because its ghastly signs and tokens are not so palpable to the eye and sense of touch as scars upon the flesh; because its wounds are not upon the surface, and it extorts few cries that human ears can hear; therefore I the more denounce it, as a secret punishment which slumbering humanity is not roused up to stay.
1	Does that look ill?’ ‘No, I hope it doesn’t,’ pouted Bella, stopping herself in something between a humoured laugh and a humoured sob.
1	If it only made yourself ridiculous, Ma’am,’ said the Major, rolling his head at the unconscious Miss Tox, while his starting eyes appeared to make a leap towards her, ‘you might do that to your heart’s content, Ma’am, without any objection, I assure you, on the part of Bagstock.’ Here the Major laughed frightfully up in the tips of his ears and in the veins of his head.
1	I was born with a caul, which was advertised for sale, in the newspapers, at the low price of fifteen guineas.
1	I never think of you in any other light.’ Agnes answered with her pleasant laugh, that one good Angel (meaning Dora) was enough; and went on to remind me that the Doctor had been used to occupy himself in his study, early in the morning, and in the evening--and that probably my leisure would suit his requirements very well.
1	I showed her to a nicety where I had seen her walking on the casks, that first old day, and she said, with a cold and careless look in that direction, “Did I?” I reminded her where she had come out of the house and given me my meat and drink, and she said, “I don't remember.” “Not remember that you made me cry?” said I.
1	I’ll prove you!’ Making this, by his display of teeth and by the action of his head, as much a threat as a promise, he turned from Rob’s eyes, which were nailed upon him as if he had won the boy by a charm, body and soul, and rode away.
1	The raggedest nightcap, awry on the wretchedest head, had this crooked significance in it: “I know how hard it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to support life in myself; but do you know how easy it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to destroy life in you?” Every lean bare arm, that had been without work before, had this work always ready for it now, that it could strike.
1	How came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor Manette's consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the Doctor's bedroom door in the early morning?
1	Oliver roused himself, and made his best obeisance.
1	It may be expected that on the eve of a migration which will consign us to a perfectly new existence,’ Mr. Micawber spoke as if they were going five hundred thousand miles, ‘I should offer a few valedictory remarks to two such friends as I see before me.
1	He went in and went out in an unaccountable way, like a man without an object.
1	‘Thank you, ‘Tilda, dear,’ retorted Miss Squeers, majestically.
1	"I leave you to judge now!
1	'Don't speak to me; it's not safe.
1	The drafts of Mr Dorrit almost constituted a run on the Torlonia Bank.
1	For he looked at me for an answer.
1	This behaviour was not lost upon Mr. Pickwick.
1	If you want a subject, look at Pork!” “True, sir.
1	I thought they were with me.
1	Pet scarcely had come out, when Tattycoram came out.
1	Oh dem!’ ‘What DO you want, man?’ demanded Ralph, sternly.
1	‘I adore her memory on the assumption.
1	I wanted somebody to talk to, then.
1	‘Never--perform--business!’ ‘Very well, sir,’ said Squeers, darting a withering look at the culprit.
1	Barbara had no objection to this arrangement, and Kit, tracking out the idea which had come upon him so suddenly overnight, began to think that surely Barbara was fond of him, and surely he was fond of Barbara.
1	The heat is greater; my Lady screens her face.
1	‘Dan’l,’ said Mrs. Gummidge, suddenly deserting her basket, and clinging to his arm ‘my dear Dan’l, the parting words I speak in this house is, I mustn’t be left behind.
1	"In fact, that is our family department," said Mr. Skimpole, "in this hurly-burly of life.
1	‘It will afford me the greatest pleasure to know you, sir,’ replied Mr. Winkle.
1	There should be, so far, a division, and a silence between us two, like the grave itself.’ She sat for some time silent; Florence scarcely venturing to breathe meanwhile, as dim and imperfect shadows of the truth, and all its daily consequences, chased each other through her terrified, yet incredulous imagination.
1	He wondered within himself whether this man had been to get his dinner, what he had had, and where he had had it; and pursued this train of careless thought until some new object caught his eye and roused another.
1	Pell must look into this, Sammy.
1	[General Chairman--Member Pickwick Club], entitled “Speculations on the Source of the Hampstead Ponds, with some Observations on the Theory of Tittlebats;” and that this Association does hereby return its warmest thanks to the said Samuel Pickwick, Esq., G.C.M.P.C., for the same.
1	What do you look at me for?’ Mr. Micawber promptly resumed his letter, glad to revert to a performance with which he was so highly satisfied.
1	The Unlimited had laid in everything omitted from the very little bag (that is to say, everything she could possibly need), and Rosa tripped down the great many stairs again, to thank her guardian for his thoughtful and affectionate care of her.
1	‘Indeed, indeed he does!’ cried Nell, ‘as dearly as I love him.
1	The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night for three heavy hours; for three heavy hours, the horses in the stables rattled at their racks, the dogs barked, and the owl made a noise with very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to the owl by men-poets.
1	‘--will tell you, and confirm by her experience,’ pursued Mrs Chick, ‘we are called upon on all occasions to make an effort It is required of us.
1	Bar, who had a bit of one eye and a bit of his double eye-glass for every one who came in at the door, no matter with whom he was conversing or what he was talking about, got among them all by some skilful means, without being seen to get at them, and touched each individual gentleman of the jury on his own individual favourite spot.
1	We shall be married from the Crummleses’ lodgings, and shall be delighted to see you--either before church or at breakfast-time, which you like.
1	In the gale of last night the life-boat had been crushed by one blow of the sea like a walnut-shell; and there it hung dangling in the air: a mere faggot of crazy boards.
1	He is a broad-faced, bull-necked, young butcher, with rough red cheeks, an ill-conditioned mind, and an injurious tongue.
1	‘None of your nonsense with me,’ said Mr Flintwinch.
1	‘He sleeps,’ murmured the spinster aunt.
1	Yet, I go there a mortal sight of times in the course of the year, taking one day with another."
1	I dwelt upon the fact that Sophy--who I do assure you, Copperfield, is the dearest girl!--’ ‘I am certain she is!’ said I.
1	His avaricious manner of collecting all the eatables about him, and devouring some with his eyes while devouring others with his jaws, was the same manner.
1	‘Not goodest good, because you hesitate about it.
1	Among civilians I am what they call in Scotland a ne'er-do-weel.
1	I was so occupied with Peepy that I lost the letter in detail, though I derived such a general impression from it of the momentous importance of Africa, and the utter insignificance of all other places and things, that I felt quite ashamed to have thought so little about it.
1	Keep ye or do ye or you keep always at it.
1	Slavery is not a whit the more endurable because some hearts are to be found which can partially resist its hardening influences; nor can the indignant tide of honest wrath stand still, because in its onward course it overwhelms a few who are comparatively innocent, among a host of guilty.
1	‘--If anything could make me happier in being allowed to see and speak to you, would it not be the discovery that I had any means on earth of doing you a moment’s service!
1	‘What is the matter here?’ said Ralph, pressing forward.
1	They were in what is called a good position, and visited, and were visited by, numbers of people.
1	“She was up and down with Gruffandgrim all the evening.
1	I felt that in traversing the Prairies, I could never abandon myself to the scene, forgetful of all else; as I should do instinctively, were the heather underneath my feet, or an iron-bound coast beyond; but should often glance towards the distant and frequently-receding line of the horizon, and wish it gained and passed.
1	‘Ay, ay,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	"I can't help my looks," says Mrs. Snagsby, "and if I could I wouldn't."
1	There must be some mistake between us.
1	‘Dang my bootuns if she bean’t asleep agean!’ ‘She’s been asleep all night, and was, all yesterday, except for a minute or two now and then,’ replied John Browdie’s choice, ‘and I was very sorry when she woke, for she has been SO cross!’ The subject of these remarks was a slumbering figure, so muffled in shawl and cloak, that it would have been matter of impossibility to guess at its sex but for a brown beaver bonnet and green veil which ornamented the head, and which, having been crushed and flattened, for two hundred and fifty miles, in that particular angle of the vehicle from which the lady’s snores now proceeded, presented an appearance sufficiently ludicrous to have moved less risible muscles than those of John Browdie’s ruddy face.
1	That I could come near you, and not feel what blood was running in your veins, by the tingling of my own!’ said Alice, with a menacing gesture.
1	He tried a glass of grog; but melancholy truth was at the bottom of that well, and he couldn’t finish it.
1	‘Why of Miss Wade, Pet?’ asked her father.
1	I can’t think who ’tis, I can’t think how or why it may be done, but I mistrust that some one has put Stephen out of the way.
1	To-morrow morning, Mother and Tattycoram will go down to Twickenham, where Mrs Tickit, sitting attended by Dr Buchan in the parlour-window, will think them a couple of ghosts; and I shall go abroad again for Doyce.
1	‘Be as soft as a mouse, or the Cat’ll hear us.’ I understood this to mean Miss Murdstone, and was sensible of the urgency of the case; her room being close by.
1	"What shall I do, what shall I do!
1	Mr Pancks, who was always in a hurry, and who referred at intervals to a little dirty notebook which he kept beside him (perhaps containing the names of the defaulters he meant to look up by way of dessert), took in his victuals much as if he were coaling; with a good deal of noise, a good deal of dropping about, and a puff and a snort occasionally, as if he were nearly ready to steam away.
1	The travellers’ room at the White Horse Cellar is of course uncomfortable; it would be no travellers’ room if it were not.
1	The only perjury is Snawley’s, and I fancy he is pretty well used to it.
1	‘A very fine evening, Mr Headstone,’ said Miss Peecher.
1	‘I suppose you won’t run away meanwhile, eh?
1	When morning came, Mrs. Maylie's predictions were but too well verified.
1	I thought she would have spoken to me privately if she had dared.
1	He was not able to work, but one day there was a grave to be made, and he came to overlook the man who dug it.
1	The Governor was still alive on the morning of the     7th; but no hopes for his recovery by his friends, and but slight     hopes from his physicians.
1	Kit and his mother, laughing together in a pretty loud key, woke the baby, who, finding that there was something very jovial and agreeable in progress, was no sooner in its mother’s arms than it began to kick and laugh, most vigorously.
1	It began then to be perceived that Flintwinch had not been there at the time of the fall; and it began then to be perceived that he had been rather busy elsewhere, converting securities into as much money as could be got for them on the shortest notice, and turning to his own exclusive account his authority to act for the Firm.
1	What is any visit made for?” “There is some wisits p'r'aps,” said Joe, “as for ever remains open to the question, Pip.
1	You may judge with what devotion he who lost that mother almost in the winning, clung to this girl, her breathing image.
1	But Withers, meeting him on the stairs, stood amazed at the beauty of his teeth, and at his brilliant smile; and as he rode away upon his white-legged horse, the people took him for a dentist, such was the dazzling show he made.
1	"Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch?"
1	‘I never dreamt such a real cough as that before.
1	He wouldn’t, wouldn’t he?’ said Dick.
1	There was spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was drawn in the space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur Gabelle's door.
1	I am glad to recollect that when the carrier’s cart was at the gate, and my mother stood there kissing me, a grateful fondness for her and for the old place I had never turned my back upon before, made me cry.
1	"I should like a little variety," said Richard; "I mean a good range of experience."
1	'It was only my caution, nothing more.
1	‘No,’ said Ralph, looking vacantly at him.
1	I--Were you going there now?” asked Mr. Lorry.
1	‘Ah!’ said the friend, ‘then he means something, depend on it.’ Miss Squeers, having slight misgivings on the subject, was by no means ill pleased to be confirmed by a competent authority; and discovering, on further conversation and comparison of notes, a great many points of resemblance between the behaviour of Nicholas, and that of the corn-factor, grew so exceedingly confidential, that she intrusted her friend with a vast number of things Nicholas had NOT said, which were all so very complimentary as to be quite conclusive.
1	"You must be here very seldom, sir," said I.
1	I said it lightly, because I felt her trembling.
1	They made a bet of a new hat before they had known each other half an hour, who should brew the best quart of punch and drink it the quickest.
1	I say that I love her, and despise and hate him!’  This with a face so flushed, and a gesture so violent, that his sister crossed to his side, and caught his arm, remonstrating, ‘Neville, Neville!’ Thus recalled to himself, he quickly became sensible of having lost the guard he had set upon his passionate tendency, and covered his face with his hand, as one repentant and wretched.
1	In that formation process of hers, she dipped the smallest of brushes into the largest of pots, and varnished the surface of every object that came under consideration.
1	I could hardly help meeting certain people walking together here, and that could do no good, and is certainly not the way to forget.
1	Estella, pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me, and then going on, I fancied that I read in the action of her fingers, as plainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet, that she perceived I had discovered my real benefactor.
1	And in his last look as we drove away, I saw that he was very sorry for me.
1	Think, now, before answering.’ ‘In Church Street, Smith Square, by Mill Bank, ma’am.’ ‘In Church Street, Smith Square, by Mill Bank,’ repeated Miss Peecher, as if possessed beforehand of the book in which it was written.
1	‘What’s the matter?’ screamed the ladies.
1	Whatever the motive, you want the best?’ My aunt nodded assent.
1	what would the Porkenhams say!
1	He is perfectly quiet and comfortable now.
1	“Well!” said Wemmick, “that's over!
1	There he had an opportunity of refreshing himself with both the bottles at once, looking out at a low blinding wall three feet off, and speculating on the number of Barnacle families within the bills of mortality who lived in such hutches of their own free flunkey choice.
1	(But he shook his head aside at us, evidently sensible of the tendency of the late occurrences to recall the memory of the old one.)
1	Tumbled together on the table are some pieces of iron, purposely broken to be tested at various periods of their service, in various capacities.
1	Still, she is more than contented and does all she has to do with all her heart.
1	But Physician was a composed man, who performed neither on his own trumpet, nor on the trumpets of other people.
1	Mrs. Nickleby,’ said the girl, throwing open the door, ‘here’s Mr Nickleby.’ A lady in deep mourning rose as Mr. Ralph Nickleby entered, but appeared incapable of advancing to meet him, and leant upon the arm of a slight but very beautiful girl of about seventeen, who had been sitting by her.
1	‘You have not thought about it!’ sneered the invalid.
1	It was very odd to see what old letters Charley's young hand had made, they so wrinkled, and shrivelled, and tottering, it so plump and round.
1	Do you recollect that a thought of this change seemed to come into our minds at the same time that evening, when we were talking together?’ ‘No!’ he answered, in a wondering tone.
1	‘May I come in?’ said Miss Sally, peeping.
1	mingled with the ringing of an alarm-bell, the fall of heavy bodies, and the crackling of flames as they twined round some new obstacle, and shot aloft as though refreshed by food.
1	I had him into my room.
1	‘Who is that?’ said the Doctor.
1	I felt as if it came close and near to me.
1	The corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the preparations having been very simple and few, the Doctor, Mr. Lorry, and Miss Pross, were left quite alone.
1	At length Mr. Snittle Timberry rose in the most approved attitude, with one hand in the breast of his waistcoat and the other on the nearest snuff-box, and having been received with great enthusiasm, proposed, with abundance of quotations, his friend Mr. Vincent Crummles: ending a pretty long speech by extending his right hand on one side and his left on the other, and severally calling upon Mr. and Mrs. Crummles to grasp the same.
1	That is the fault of my position--not of myself, Mr. Johnson.
1	There’s more than one sweet creetur in the world!’ ‘Not to me, Captain Gills,’ replied Mr Toots gravely.
1	They asked me what my story was, and I told them.
1	'Ware Compeyson, Magwitch, and the gallows!” He flared the candle at me again, smoking my face and hair, and for an instant blinding me, and turned his powerful back as he replaced the light on the table.
1	‘Ask him to step here.’ ‘Yes, sir.’ Exit Jackson.
1	Was I ever once dishonest when I was poor and hungry, and is it likely I would begin now!
1	She lost her colour, and the old and intent expression was a constant, not an occasional, thing; otherwise, she remained very pretty and comely.
1	You won't want to spend it.
1	The idea did not originate in my own discernment, I am bound to confess, but in a speech of Rosa Dartle’s.
1	‘Tell me what you mean.
1	It was on the occasion of one of those general assemblies which are held on certain nights, between the hours of nine and twelve o’clock, and are called, rather oddly, Levees.
1	It is impossible for me to say what terrific meaning was hidden in the words of this brown forester, but I know that the other passengers looked on in a sort of admiring horror, and that presently the boat was put back to the wharf, and as many of the Pioneers as could be coaxed or bullied into going away, were got rid of.
1	There’s beds here, sir,’ said Sam, addressing his master, ‘everything clean and comfortable.
1	This office she (always doing her household spiriting with unwillingness) performed in a startling series of whisks and bumps; laying the table-cloth as if she were raising the wind, putting down the glasses and salt-cellars as if she were knocking at the door, and clashing the knives and forks in a skirmishing manner suggestive of hand-to-hand conflict.
1	If I live, I saw my husband in a carriage in the street to-night!’ ‘Strumpet, it’s false!’ cried Carker.
1	The schools were newly built, and there were so many like them all over the country, that one might have thought the whole were but one restless edifice with the locomotive gift of Aladdin’s palace.
1	"We will stand by him, as he himself stood by the two poor creatures who are gone."
1	And yet I am very much of the opinion, my dears, that he has not chosen his profession advisedly."
1	It’s a quaint place, and they are quaint company, and it’s quite a new sensation to mix with them.’ ‘How fortunate we are, too,’ I returned, ‘to have arrived to witness their happiness in that intended marriage!
1	As I says a while ago,’ pursued Riderhood, changing his hoarse tone and leering round upon the class again, ‘though not a learned character my own self, I do admire learning in others, to be sure!
1	This person has taken out MY certificate.
1	Let us walk through country places, and sleep in fields and under trees, and never think of money again, or anything that can make you sad, but rest at nights, and have the sun and wind upon our faces in the day, and thank God together!
1	‘Old lady,’ said Mr Boffin, anticipating his wife, ‘you hold your tongue.
1	But it’s natural and rational that you should like it.
1	‘However, time’s up for to-night,’ said Mr Boffin, waving his hand after a silence.
1	He affected a stiff white cravat, after the example of his principal, and was always closely buttoned up and tightly dressed.
1	All I thay ith, the Thquire hath thtood by Thethilia, and I’ll thtand by the Thquire.
1	The adventures of the previous night were still under discussion; for Mr. Giles was expatiating upon his presence of mind, when the doctor entered; Mr. Brittles, with a mug of ale in his hand, was corroborating everything, before his superior said it.
1	Mistress Affery looked on at Little Dorrit taking off her homely bonnet in the hall, and at Mr Flintwinch scraping his jaws and contemplating her in silence, as expecting some wonderful consequence to ensue which would frighten her out of her five wits or blow them all three to pieces.
1	But we must be careful--for our cousin's sake, Rick, for our cousin's sake--that we make no more such mistakes.
1	The receding footsteps of the speaker were heard; and, in another minute, the form of Mr. John Dawkins, otherwise the Artful Dodger, appeared.
1	Mr. Bayham Badger himself was a pink, fresh-faced, crisp-looking gentleman with a weak voice, white teeth, light hair, and surprised eyes, some years younger, I should say, than Mrs. Bayham Badger.
1	‘I am sure I am not like myself when I am away,’ said I.
1	What could I ever do but thank him!
1	‘Now here’s an aggravating animal!’ ‘Well, what harm do they do?’ retorted Sally.
1	When he came back, he ascended the old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus into the Doctor's rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking.
1	Can you, of all the people who love her, bear to see her so?” He bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his face.
1	Sometimes we pass a field where the strong bristling stalks of Indian corn look like a crop of walking-sticks, and sometimes an enclosure where the green wheat is springing up among a labyrinth of stumps; the primitive worm-fence is universal, and an ugly thing it is; but the farms are neatly kept, and, save for these differences, one might be travelling just now in Kent.
1	‘Then, what the devil did you run sharp instruments into Mr. Pickwick’s legs for?’ inquired Wardle angrily.
1	‘Some say he frightened you, but THAT’S a lie, I know.
1	‘I’ll tell him so.’ It was no very easy matter to mistake Newman Noggs, after having once seen him, and as Kate, attracted by the singularity of his manner (in which on this occasion, however, there was something respectful and even delicate, notwithstanding the abruptness of his speech), looked at him more closely, she recollected having caught a passing glimpse of that strange figure before.
1	‘Where is Mr. Pott?’ said Mrs. Leo Hunter, as she placed the aforesaid lions around her.
1	‘We go upon the practical mode of teaching, Nickleby; the regular education system.
1	‘Who else is a-goin’, lovey?’ said Mrs. Cluppins, in an insinuating manner.
1	He seemed touched, as he replied emphatically-- ‘I knows I has.’ ‘Then what can you want to do now?’ said the old lady, gaining courage.
1	‘Goodwin,’ said Mrs. Pott, in a soft voice.
1	A son will sometimes make it known to his father that he has fallen in love, say, with a young woman in the factory.
1	‘It’s a most extraordinary world,’ observed my aunt, rubbing her nose; ‘how that woman ever got into it with that name, is unaccountable to me.
1	To these he responded with the greatest liberality, and with no lack of formality; always first writing to appoint a time at which the applicant might wait upon him in his room, and then receiving him in the midst of a vast accumulation of documents, and accompanying his donation (for he said in every such case, ‘it is a donation, not a loan’) with a great deal of good counsel: to the effect that he, the expiring Father of the Marshalsea, hoped to be long remembered, as an example that a man might preserve his own and the general respect even there.
1	They reached the spot where the bereaved husband stood: and stopped.
1	Because they state the fact.
1	Mrs Merdle was at home, the best of the jewels were hung out to be seen, Society got what it came for, Mr Merdle drank twopennyworth of tea in a corner and got more than he wanted.
1	I require no reference from you, and perhaps, therefore, you will require none from me.
1	‘This is twopenn’orth of milk, is it, waiter?’ said Mr. Squeers, looking down into a large blue mug, and slanting it gently, so as to get an accurate view of the quantity of liquid contained in it.
1	exclaims Mademoiselle Hortense, panting tigress-like.
1	Perhaps these were reasons for the old gentleman's giving his assent; but, whether they were or no, he told Oliver he might go, and placed him under the joint guardianship of Charley Bates, and his friend the Dodger.
1	What now?’ Kate raised her eyes, which were filled with tears; and with an effort to master her emotion strove to speak, but in vain.
1	I must not only regard myself as being in a very ridiculous position, but as being vanquished at all points.
1	Hope is a buoy, for which you overhaul your Little Warbler, sentimental diwision, but Lord, my lad, like any other buoy, it only floats; it can’t be steered nowhere.
1	Now, it is a mere anomaly and incongruity here, out of date and out of purpose.
1	Ralph smiled, but made no reply.
1	So we stumbled along, quite satisfied.
1	The whole were in good marching order; and a dreadful smartness that pervaded the party would have sufficiently announced, if the intrepid countenances of the ladies had been wanting, that it was a procession of sacrifice, and that the victim was Bunsby.
1	‘She told me that she made a last request to me, and left me a last charge.’ ‘And it was--’ ‘That only I would occupy this vacant place.’ And Agnes laid her head upon my breast, and wept; and I wept with her, though we were so happy.
1	Oliver got up; walked across the room; and stooped for an instant to raise the pitcher.
1	‘I mean this here, Sammy,’ replied the old gentleman, ‘that wot they drink, don’t seem no nourishment to ‘em; it all turns to warm water, and comes a-pourin’ out o’ their eyes.
1	Nevertheless it was a relief to him when the bather after a plunge and a few strokes came out.
1	As I grew up, he occupied the same place still.
1	George, I couldn't have believed you would have done it!
1	‘I don’t know where,’ said Miss Wren, staring about her.
1	In its own despite, in a constant conflict with itself and them, it had done so.
1	I have put by a little, ma’am, already.
1	The weathercocks on spires and housetops were mysterious with hints of stormy wind, and pointed, like so many ghostly fingers, out to dangerous seas, where fragments of great wrecks were drifting, perhaps, and helpless men were rocked upon them into a sleep as deep as the unfathomable waters.
1	It’s a grand thing to be mad!
1	‘You know what the population of London is, I suppose,’ said Mr Podsnap.
1	'What's set you a snivelling now?'

1	Genteel blinds and makeshifts were more or less observable as soon as their doors were opened; screens not half high enough, which made dining-rooms out of arched passages, and warded off obscure corners where footboys slept at nights with their heads among the knives and forks; curtains which called upon you to believe that they didn’t hide anything; panes of glass which requested you not to see them; many objects of various forms, feigning to have no connection with their guilty secret, a bed; disguised traps in walls, which were clearly coal-cellars; affectations of no thoroughfares, which were evidently doors to little kitchens.

1	It was one of the brimstone-and-treacle mornings, and Mrs. Squeers had entered school according to custom with the large bowl and spoon, followed by Miss Squeers and the amiable Wackford: who, during his father’s absence, had taken upon him such minor branches of the executive as kicking the pupils with his nailed boots, pulling the hair of some of the smaller boys, pinching the others in aggravating places, and rendering himself, in various similar ways, a great comfort and happiness to his mother.
1	Brother Ned, will you ring the bell?’ ‘Charles, my dear fellow!
1	Do you start for Paris from here?” “From here, at eight.” “I will come back, to see you off.” Very ill at ease with himself, and with Stryver and most other men, Darnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the Temple, opened the letter, and read it.
1	She greeted Agnes heartily, nevertheless; and we were soon in the lighted parlour downstairs, at dinner.
1	With every kindly sympathy and affection blasted in its birth, with every young and healthy feeling flogged and starved down, with every revengeful passion that can fester in swollen hearts, eating its evil way to their core in silence, what an incipient Hell was breeding here!

1	He had, therefore, no self-disrespect to avenge; no long-tightened springs to release with a quick recoil.

1	The cup is bitter to the brim.
1	There were a few customers, drinking or not drinking, standing or seated, sprinkled about.

1	I lived in a state of chronic uneasiness respecting my behavior to Joe.
1	To such as these, it has happened in their dying hours afar off, that they have imagined their chamber-floor to be strewn with the autumnal leaves fallen from the elm-trees in the Close: so have the rustling sounds and fresh scents of their earliest impressions revived when the circle of their lives was very nearly traced, and the beginning and the end were drawing close together.

1	'I'd scorn to be anything else.'

1	Waking, I never lost that fear.
1	"Don't go on in that way, Mr. Gridley.
1	What’s the time?’ ‘Half-past eight,’ replied his friend.
1	On being brought to the scaffold and asked if he was sorry for what he had done, he replied yes, he was sorry for having let ‘em off so easy, and hoped all Christian husbands would pardon him the offence.
1	It had happened some three or four years then, he said, and you brought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost, who would have been about your age.” “Herbert,” said I, after a short silence, in a hurried way, “can you see me best by the light of the window, or the light of the fire?” “By the firelight,” answered Herbert, coming close again.

1	But the most vexatious and aggeravating part of the whole affair is,’ said Squeers, dropping his voice, and drawing his chair still closer to Ralph, ‘that some questions have been asked about him at last--not of me, but, in a roundabout kind of way, of people in our village.
1	‘Might you happen to know the name of your neighbour in the top set on the other side of the party-wall?’ coming very close to Mr. Tartar, to lose nothing of his face, in his shortness of sight.

1	I pointed out to your sister the plain state of the case; the impossibility of the Society in which we moved recognising the Society in which she moved--though charming, I have no doubt; the immense disadvantage at which she would consequently place the family she had so high an opinion of, upon which we should find ourselves compelled to look down with contempt, and from which (socially speaking) we should feel obliged to recoil with abhorrence.
1	And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you, and for giving me your advice; you know the young lady better than I do; you were right, it never would have done.” Mr. Lorry was so taken aback, that he looked quite stupidly at Mr. Stryver shouldering him towards the door, with an appearance of showering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his erring head.

1	By degrees these raptures subsided, and Mrs. Nickleby went on to entertain her guests with a lament over her fallen fortunes, and a picturesque account of her old house in the country: comprising a full description of the different apartments, not forgetting the little store-room, and a lively recollection of how many steps you went down to get into the garden, and which way you turned when you came out at the parlour door, and what capital fixtures there were in the kitchen.

1	Her disordered appearance, and a wholesale perfume of Geneva which pervaded the apartment, afforded strong confirmatory evidence of the justice of the Jew's supposition; and when, after indulging in the temporary display of violence above described, she subsided, first into dullness, and afterwards into a compound of feelings: under the influence of which she shed tears one minute, and in the next gave utterance to various exclamations of 'Never say die!'
1	‘You have been to school?’ ‘Yes, sir,’ I answered; ‘for a short time.’ ‘Do you recollect the date,’ said Mr. Dick, looking earnestly at me, and taking up his pen to note it down, ‘when King Charles the First had his head cut off?’ I said I believed it happened in the year sixteen hundred and forty-nine.

1	Being requested to explain himself, he stated that there was some of ‘em wot you couldn’t kiver with a sixpence.

1	The girl raged and battled with all the force of her youth and fulness of life, until by little and little her passionate exclamations trailed off into broken murmurs as if she were in pain.
1	‘But it was one of my dreams, that you told her, when you quarrelled with her one winter evening at dusk--there she sits and you looking at her--that she oughtn’t to have let Arthur when he come home, suspect his father only; that she had always had the strength and the power; and that she ought to have stood up more to Arthur, for his father.

1	They went on in their own wild way for a little while--I never stopped them; I enjoyed it too much myself--and then we gradually fell to considering how young they were, and how there must be a lapse of several years before this early love could come to anything, and how it could come to happiness only if it were real and lasting and inspired them with a steady resolution to do their duty to each other, with constancy, fortitude, and perseverance, each always for the other's sake.

1	A sensitive, ardent, conscientious, and imaginative man, Mr Flintwinch, must be that, or nothing!’ There was an inkling of suspicion in Mr Flintwinch’s face that he might be nothing, as he swaggered out of his chair (it was characteristic of this man, as it is of all men similarly marked, that whatever he did, he overdid, though it were sometimes by only a hairsbreadth), and approached to take his leave of Mrs Clennam.
1	I will do it by very gentle degrees.
1	My poor papa and Eddy’s father made their agreement together, as very dear and firm and fast friends, in order that we, too, might be very dear and firm and fast friends after them?’ ‘Just so.’ ‘For the lasting good of both of us, and the lasting happiness of both of us?’ ‘Just so.’ ‘That we might be to one another even much more than they had been to one another?’ ‘Just so.’ ‘It was not bound upon Eddy, and it was not bound upon me, by any forfeit, in case—’ ‘Don’t be agitated, my dear.
1	I should like him to hear a short bit of dialogue between you and me, instead of taking the substance of it—for I know precious well, beforehand, what it will be; nobody knows better than I do, take notice!—instead of receiving it on trust from my mouth.’ Stephen bent his head to the gentleman from London, and showed a rather more troubled mind than usual.
1	"The Founder of the Feast indeed!"

1	What do you think of her?” “I don't like to say,” I stammered.
1	"I tell you what," says Mr. George.
1	He might yet give up what his creditors had spared him (that they had not spared him more, was his own act), and only sever the tie between him and the ruined house, by severing that other link-- It was then that his footfall was audible in the late housekeeper’s room, as he walked to and fro; but not audible in its true meaning, or it would have had an appalling sound.

1	Sometimes--towards the end of a long stage--Kit could not help wishing it were a little warmer: but when they stopped to change horses, and he had had a good run, and what with that, and the bustle of paying the old postilion, and rousing the new one, and running to and fro again until the horses were put to, he was so warm that the blood tingled and smarted in his fingers’ ends--then, he felt as if to have it one degree less cold would be to lose half the delight and glory of the journey: and up he jumped again, right cheerily, singing to the merry music of the wheels as they rolled away, and, leaving the townspeople in their warm beds, pursued their course along the lonely road.
1	Why should you leave all the gains that are to be got to my proprietor and the like of him?

1	Aware of a working-jeweller population taking sanctuary about the church in Clerkenwell, Mr Wegg is conscious of an interest in, and a respect for, the neighbourhood.

1	Oh, my bones and back!
1	The more spirit there is in it, the better for mankind and the worse for those mercenary task-masters and low tricksters who delight in putting that illustrious art at a disadvantage in the world.
1	“And you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch, and that there was a scuffle between them, and that one of them had been severely handled and much mauled about the face by the other?” “I see it all before me.” “And that the soldiers lighted torches, and put the two in the centre, and that we went on to see the last of them, over the black marshes, with the torchlight shining on their faces,--I am particular about that,--with the torchlight shining on their faces, when there was an outer ring of dark night all about us?” “Yes,” said I.
1	Now, I am going to examine you out of my own head.
1	Captain Cuttle, in a fit of delirium, attempted to wipe his head with the blackened toast upon his hook: and finding it an uncongenial substance for the purpose, put it into the crown of his glazed hat, put the glazed hat on with some difficulty, essayed to sing a verse of Lovely Peg, broke down at the first word, and retired into the shop, whence he presently came back express, with a face all flushed and besmeared, and the starch completely taken out of his shirt-collar, to say these words: ‘Wal’r, my lad, here is a little bit of property as I should wish to make over, jintly!’ The Captain hastily produced the big watch, the teaspoons, the sugar-tongs, and the canister, and laying them on the table, swept them with his great hand into Walter’s hat; but in handing that singular strong box to Walter, he was so overcome again, that he was fain to make another retreat into the shop, and absent himself for a longer space of time than on his first retirement.
1	Say everything as is kind and forgiving on your part?
1	Fanny cautioned me about this, and she objected, and I object.” I don’t mean to say that any objection from you, Amy, is likely to be of the smallest effect, or that I think you likely to make it with any degree of firmness.
1	I don’t care for old Bounderby,’ said he, ‘if you mean that.
1	‘Why, how are we to do without?’ urged her father, not speaking above his breath.
1	His attire was not, as he had himself hinted, remarkable for the  nicest arrangement, but was in a state of disorder which strongly induced the idea that he had gone to bed in it.
1	Long in the aggregate, though short as they went by.
1	"She had been a lady of a handsome figure and a noble carriage.
1	It would appear that the system of Lady Cankaby--excuse me: I should say of Mrs Dombey: I confuse the names of cases--’ ‘So very numerous,’ murmured the family practitioner--‘can’t be expected I’m sure--quite wonderful if otherwise--Doctor Parker Peps’s West-End practice--’ ‘Thank you,’ said the Doctor, ‘quite so.
1	I found them to be the perfect isolation of prisoners--so that no one man in confinement there, knew anything about another; and the reduction of prisoners to a wholesome state of mind, leading to sincere contrition and repentance.
1	The few words that I have to add to what I have written are soon penned; then I and the unknown friend to whom I write will part for ever.
1	‘But my mind runs so much upon this matter,’ he said, ‘that I lose myself.’ ‘Hah!
1	“Gracious me, Flopson!” said Mrs. Pocket, looking off her book for a moment, “everybody's tumbling!” “Gracious you, indeed, Mum!” returned Flopson, very red in the face; “what have you got there?” “I got here, Flopson?” asked Mrs. Pocket.
1	It has an irresistible attraction for him.
1	He was in great spirits all the way; and when we parted, and I looked after him going so gallantly and airily homeward, I thought of his saying, ‘Ride on over all obstacles, and win the race!’ and wished, for the first time, that he had some worthy race to run.
1	With so much of itself abandoned to darkness and vacancy; with so little change under the summer shining or the wintry lowering; so sombre and motionless always--no flag flying now by day, no rows of lights sparkling by night; with no family to come and go, no visitors to be the souls of pale cold shapes of rooms, no stir of life about it--passion and pride, even to the stranger's eye, have died away from the place in Lincolnshire and yielded it to dull repose.
1	In what way?’ asked Mrs Lammle.
1	'If that _had_ been the case, Harry,' said Mrs. Maylie, 'I fear your happiness would have been effectually blighted, and that your arrival here, a day sooner or a day later, would have been of very, very little import.'
1	‘I can’t help that, Sir,’ replied Mr. Justice Stareleigh.
1	‘Do you think the sisters who loved her so well, would have grieved the less if her life had been one of gloom and sadness?
1	And this was usually said in the unanimously-carried resolution under hand and seal, to the effect: ‘That this assembled Body of Professing Philanthropists views, with indignant scorn and contempt, not unmixed with utter detestation and loathing abhorrence’—in short, the baseness of all those who do not belong to it, and pledges itself to make as many obnoxious statements as possible about them, without being at all particular as to facts.
1	So he got up directly, and found Briggs with hardly any eyes, for nightmare and grief had made his face puffy, putting his boots on: while Tozer stood shivering and rubbing his shoulders in a very bad humour.
1	Upon it, in lieu of the dogged, black-visaged ruffian they had expected to behold, there lay a mere child:  worn with pain and exhaustion, and sunk into a deep sleep.
1	“To have Provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to Mrs. Whimple,”  said Herbert, “for of course people in general won't stand that noise.
1	‘And a low thief,’ added the gentleman in the green-foil smalls.
1	"And when it was done, Esther," said my darling, "I was always thinking how to tell you and what to do for the best.
1	She took an early opportunity of promoting the circulation in the tip of her nose by secretly chafing it with her pocket handkerchief, lest, by its very low temperature, it should disagreeably astonish the baby when she came to kiss it.
1	I have covered my head with the clothes often, not to see it, for it frightened me: a young child with no one near at night: and I used to wonder what was on the other side.
1	‘Yes,’ said I, ‘I am going over to Canterbury.
1	What he says, I quite concur in.
1	The court is, by solemn settlement of law, our grim old guardian, and we are to suppose that what it gives us (when it gives us anything) is our right.
1	But they wouldn't leave me alone.
1	Have you any idea yet, of Estella's views on the adoration question?” I shook my head gloomily.
1	When the silent tomb shall yawn, Captain Gills, I shall be ready for burial; not before.
1	‘And now,’ said Mr. Lillyvick, when a heart-rending scene had ensued and the children were cleared away again, ‘give me some supper.
1	Chancing to raise her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her, she playfully put back her hair, which was simply braided on her forehead; and threw into her beaming look, such an expression of affection and artless loveliness, that blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon her.
1	That was _my_ last Christmas Eve.’ ‘What do you mean?’ is the very abrupt, and, one might say, fierce retort.
1	‘My dear, another glass?’ Mrs. Micawber said it must be very little; but we couldn’t allow that, so it was a glassful.
1	As her hands, parting on her sunburnt forehead, swept across her face, and threw aside the hindrances that encroached upon it, there was a reckless and regardless beauty in it: a dauntless and depraved indifference to more than weather: a carelessness of what was cast upon her bare head from Heaven or earth: that, coupled with her misery and loneliness, touched the heart of her fellow-woman.
1	Now, I recommend you not so much to mind talking just now, as doing.
1	“See, there is my husband!” she cried, pointing him out.
1	Mr. Quinion then formally engaged me to be as useful as I could in the warehouse of Murdstone and Grinby, at a salary, I think, of six shillings a week.
1	Dora lies smiling on us, and is beautiful, and utters no hasty or complaining word.
1	Pray excuse the introduction of such mean topics."
1	Mr Brass remained airing himself at the fire, and resumed his vocal exercise, and his seraphic smile, simultaneously.
1	Was there ever such a fate!” “My poor dear Handel,” Herbert repeated.
1	"Then to ensure your night's rest, my love," he returned gaily, "I won't wait until to-morrow to tell you.
1	Now, if the skeleton up-stairs had taken that opportunity, for instance, of calling out ‘Here I am, suffocating in the closet!’ ‘I give you my honour, my dear Sophronia--’ ‘And I know what that is, love,’ said she.
1	And I had a commission to broach one of them as soon as I should begin to talk.
1	We should have said “Pray do not invite us, at any time”; and all possibility of misunderstanding would have been avoided.’ When Miss Clarissa had shaken her head, Miss Lavinia resumed: again referring to my letter through her eye-glass.
1	Mr Wegg, I’m not only first in the trade, but I’m THE trade.
1	"This, you must know, is the growlery.
1	There is a quiet decision in his reply which admits of no remonstrance.
1	They have fallen in pretty thick, sir; as thick as we could have expected.’ He remarked upon the circumstance as if it were matter of congratulation: rubbing his hands briskly, and rolling his head a little.
1	Ben Allen coughed hopelessly, and directed a searching look between the two top bars of the stove.
1	In the meantime, if Mr Swiveller will take my seat, and try his hand at a fair copy of this ejectment, as I shall be out pretty well all the morning--’ ‘Walk with me,’ said Quilp.
1	As a mere flask of the golden water in the tale became a full fountain when it was poured out, so Mr Meagles seemed to feel that this small spice of Barnacle imparted to his table the flavour of the whole family-tree.
1	The landlady, however, who possessed more readiness and activity than any of them, and who had withal a quicker perception of the merits of the case, soon came running in, with a little hot brandy and water, followed by her servant-girl, carrying vinegar, hartshorn, smelling-salts, and such other restoratives; which, being duly administered, recovered the child so far as to enable her to thank them in a faint voice, and to extend her hand to the poor schoolmaster, who stood, with an anxious face, hard by.
1	Creeping where no life is seen, A rare old plant is the Ivy green.
1	Beckoning to stray people to come into pews, has given Mrs Miff an air of mystery; and there is reservation in the eye of Mrs Miff, as always knowing of a softer seat, but having her suspicions of the fee.
1	And the day may discern, even with its dim London eye, that the court has been up all night.
1	Her cousin being, as it appears, in good work, and well to do, thanked me in a very manly sort of manner for this (conducting himself altogether, I must say, in a way that gives me a high opinion of him), and went and took as comfortable a little house as you or I could wish to clap eyes on.
1	Many added that he looked sublime and prophetic.
1	growled Scrooge, as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas.
1	'Now, man, what have you got to say?'
1	In all their journeying, they had never longed so ardently, they had never so pined and wearied, for the freedom of pure air and open country, as now.
1	But he was asleep, and quietly too, though he had a pistol lying on the pillow.
1	The house fronts looked black enough, and the windows blacker, contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs, and with the dirtier snow upon the ground; which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and waggons; furrows that crossed and re-crossed each other hundreds of times where the great streets branched off; and made intricate channels, hard to trace in the thick yellow mud and icy water.
1	Alas how calm they lay there; how little breath there was to stir them!
1	The inner gate was locked, and the lodge closed.
1	There are questions and answers, exchanges of joy or sorrow, there are kissings and partings, just as between little children with all their senses.” ‘During this year, and six months after she had left home, her mother came to visit her, and the scene of their meeting was an interesting one.
1	It would cheer him up more than anything if I could make him a little waxy with me.
1	I’m very happy.’ And then his lordship turned to another superlative gentleman, something older, something stouter, something redder in the face, and something longer upon town, and said in a loud whisper that the girl was ‘deyvlish pitty.’ ‘Introduce me, Nickleby,’ said this second gentleman, who was lounging with his back to the fire, and both elbows on the chimneypiece.
1	Come, in due time, organist and bellows-boy, peeping down from the red curtains in the loft, fearlessly flapping dust from books up at that remote elevation, and whisking it from stops and pedals.
1	I had endeavoured to adapt Dora to myself, and found it impracticable.
1	I am sure I can never feel thankful enough for the generosity with which he has protected me, so much younger and lower in the school than himself.’ I was running on, very fast indeed, when my eyes rested on little Em’ly’s face, which was bent forward over the table, listening with the deepest attention, her breath held, her blue eyes sparkling like jewels, and the colour mantling in her cheeks.
1	Tellson's shall not be imposed upon.” “I hope, sir,” pleaded the abashed Mr. Cruncher, “that a gentleman like yourself wot I've had the honour of odd jobbing till I'm grey at it, would think twice about harming of me, even if it wos so--I don't say it is, but even if it wos.
1	He was a good power-loom weaver, and a man of perfect integrity.
1	But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson's.
1	In a few moments I stood before her.
1	Tope has made too much of it, I suspect.
1	This she placed before the small servant, ordering her to sit down before it, and then, taking up a great carving-knife, made a mighty show of sharpening it upon the carving-fork.
1	‘You know you can’t do without me!’ ‘Yes, I can,’ said Dora.
1	He should be attended to, and looked after.’ ‘A companion?
1	‘But, my dear Sir, though estranged (by the force of circumstances over which I have had no control) from the personal society of the friend and companion of my youth, I have not been unmindful of his soaring flight.
1	You know Saint Albans, sir?
1	'This is all, is it?'
1	I know she was; for in the bright moonlight nights, when I start up from my sleep, and all is quiet about me, I see, standing still and motionless in one corner of this cell, a slight and wasted figure with long black hair, which, streaming down her back, stirs with no earthly wind, and eyes that fix their gaze on me, and never wink or close.
1	When Tim Linkinwater gave me to understand the other day that he was coming to take a share in the business here, he said he had been superintending it in Germany for four years, and that during the last six months he had been engaged in establishing an agency in the north of England.
1	Hold still, Sir; wot’s the use o’ runnin’ arter a man as has made his lucky, and got to t’other end of the Borough by this time?’ Mr. Pickwick’s mind, like those of all truly great men, was open to conviction.
1	That’s easy to see.’ It would have been so cruel if he had meant it, that Clennam firmly resolved to believe he did not mean it.
1	I only put it to you."
1	With the next morning, there came a rumour, that two men and a boy were in the cage at Kingston, who had been apprehended over night under suspicious circumstances; and to Kingston Messrs. Blathers and Duff journeyed accordingly.
1	Robbed with a false key.’ ‘Of much?’ Mr. Bounderby, in his desire to make the most of it, really seemed mortified by being obliged to reply, ‘Why, no; not of very much.
1	He reddened deeply, as if his natural generosity felt a pang of reproach.
1	Mr. Bumble turned, and encountered the face of his interesting consort, who, imperfectly comprehending the few words she had overheard of his complaint, had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture.
1	You can’t forget that I didn’t submit.
1	‘Impossible--can’t be--notice at the church--leave the licence to-day-- ceremony come off to-morrow.’ I am so terrified, lest my brother should discover us!’ said Rachael.
1	Therefore, my friends, I wish for peace, upon you and upon yours."
1	If there’s anything to add up, besides, I don’t know when I shall make it out; and my bad boy will look so miserable all the time.
1	‘There is nothing the matter?’ inquired Florence.
1	There is no such thing any more.’ ‘Then, are you already in another House, John?’ ‘Yes, my darling.
1	‘Well?’ said the surly man, touching his hat to the old lady.
1	And to tell you all the truth while I am about it,’ said Mr Flintwinch, crossing his arms, and becoming the express image of irascible doggedness, ‘I have been rasped--rasped these forty years--by your taking such high ground even with me, who knows better; the effect of it being coolly to put me on low ground.
1	When that won’t do, they ha’ gowd an’ other cash, an’ they can say “This for yo’ an’ that for me,” an’ they can go their separate ways.
1	That he had dipped his hands in blood, to mark himself a miserable fool and tool.
1	Compeyson is the man who professed to be Miss Havisham's lover.” I shut the book and nodded slightly to Herbert, and put the book by; but we neither of us said anything, and both looked at Provis as he stood smoking by the fire.
1	He had been still writing in his hiding-place, and still dwelling on his grievances, hour after hour.
1	‘Then, after my bill was run up, we picked out five little boys (sons of small tradesmen, as was sure pay) that had never had the scarlet fever, and we sent one to a cottage where they’d got it, and he took it, and then we put the four others to sleep with him, and THEY took it, and then the doctor came and attended ‘em once all round, and we divided my total among ‘em, and added it on to their little bills, and the parents paid it.
1	‘Yes, for a licence.’ ‘We’re in time,’ exclaimed Wardle.
1	'This child,' said Mr. Brownlow, drawing Oliver to him, and laying his hand upon his head, 'is your half-brother; the illegitimate son of your father, my dear friend Edwin Leeford, by poor young Agnes Fleming, who died in giving him birth.'
1	You may be very proud, Sir, to have the friendship of Mr Quilp.’ Dick murmured something about never wanting a friend or a bottle to give him, and also gasped forth his favourite allusion to the wing of friendship and its never moulting a feather; but his faculties appeared to be absorbed in the contemplation of Miss Sally Brass, at whom he stared with blank and rueful looks, which delighted the watchful dwarf beyond measure.
1	‘Quite well, my love,’ replied Squeers.
1	And these here would be mine, if it wos so, entreatin' of you fur to bear in mind that wot I said just now, I up and said in the good cause when I might have kep' it back.” “That at least is true,” said Mr. Lorry.
1	I proceed to other passages of my narrative.
1	He was usually addressed as Captain, this visitor; and had been a pilot, or a skipper, or a privateersman, or all three perhaps; and was a very salt-looking man indeed.
1	They took another quart apiece to drink each other’s health in, and were staunch friends ever afterwards.
1	“Deep,” said Wemmick, “as Australia.” Pointing with his pen at the office floor, to express that Australia was understood, for the purposes of the figure, to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the globe.
1	Occupied in these reflections, as he was making his way along one of the great public thoroughfares of London, he chanced to raise his eyes to a blue board, whereon was inscribed, in characters of gold, ‘General Agency Office; for places and situations of all kinds inquire within.’ It was a shop-front, fitted up with a gauze blind and an inner door; and in the window hung a long and tempting array of written placards, announcing vacant places of every grade, from a secretary’s to a foot-boy’s.
1	‘Now those that choose, can go about their business,’ says Mrs Pipchin, ‘and those that choose can stay here on board wages for a week or so, and make themselves useful.
1	The overcharged and heavy-laden breast must some times have that vent, or the poor wounded solitary heart within it would have fluttered like a bird with broken wings, and sunk down in the dust.
1	I wish that we should know and trust each other, Florence.’ ‘You are very kind to me,’ said Florence, ‘dear Mama.
1	‘Oh, dame!’ said the schoolmaster, drawing near her chair, ‘is it so bad as this?’ ‘He’s going fast,’ cried the old woman; ‘my grandson’s dying.
1	She petted them, as I may say, and made the most of them.
1	"Mat," said Mr. George, "you have heard pretty well all I have been saying to this lady and these two gentlemen.
1	Sparks that have been struck out during our intercourse have shown me this.’ ‘Well!
1	‘I was to pull through it, I suppose, Mrs. Gradgrind.
1	Mrs Merdle concurred with all her heart--or with all her art, which was exactly the same thing--and herself despatched a preparatory letter by the next post to the eighth wonder of the world.
1	The fact was, that Mr. Giles had not, at first, been able to bring his mind to the avowal, that he had only shot a boy.
1	‘Never you mind,’ retorted that gentleman, tapping his nose derisively.
1	When the Doctor and I were engaged, he now fell into the custom of walking up and down with Mrs. Strong, and helping her to trim her favourite flowers, or weed the beds.
1	"Are the Dedlocks down here, Lawrence?"
1	I’ll beg it of her with kisses,’ said Arthur Gride.
1	They were both silent for a time; she weeping.
1	How could I ever be worthy of those tears?
1	To hear Mr. Boythorn presently expressing the most implacable and passionate sentiments, with this fragile mite of a creature quietly perched on his forehead, was to have a good illustration of his character, I thought.
1	‘Why, I know that knife!’ said Riderhood.
1	I have a great many defects, I know, and it’s very good of you, Edward, with your strength of mind, to endeavour to correct them for me.
1	It so shakes me, if I may make the confession, in my allegiance, that on the intimation of the least desire to that effect from you, I would suppress them.’ Edith raised her head quickly, and starting back, bent her dark glance upon him.
1	“Were you known in London, once?” “Not over and above, dear boy.
1	As she uttered these words, and indicated, with her hand, the direction in which she wished them to proceed, the countryman looked round, and roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for, passed on.
1	We want to move Johnny to a place where there are none but children; a place set up on purpose for sick children; where the good doctors and nurses pass their lives with children, talk to none but children, touch none but children, comfort and cure none but children.’ ‘Is there really such a place?’ asked the old woman, with a gaze of wonder.
1	“Barter not the light and air of heaven, and the freshness of earth and all the beautiful things which breathe upon it, for the cold cloister and the cell.
1	‘You thought her looking very beautiful tonight, Master Copperfield?’ ‘I thought her looking as she always does: superior, in all respects, to everyone around her,’ I returned.
1	Have I had nothing more important to remember, in the great service you rendered me that day?” “As to the great service,” said Carton, “I am bound to avow to you, when you speak of it in that way, that it was mere professional claptrap, I don't know that I cared what became of you, when I rendered it.--Mind!
1	‘Come, Maggy,’ said Little Dorrit cheerily, ‘we shall do very well; we know the way by this time, Maggy?’ ‘Yes, yes, little mother; we know the way,’ chuckled Maggy.
1	‘No,’ returned Mr Dombey, looking round over his shoulder; ‘you can come and go here, Florence, as you please.
1	Therefore when Mrs. Bagnet at last appears, rosy from the invigorating pail, and sits down to her work, Mr. Bagnet growls, "Old girl!"
1	'Oh no, they ain't,' said the officer.
1	‘Of great talent,’ repeated Mrs. Micawber.
1	There started up, from the gate, or from the rushes, or from the ooze (which was quite in his stagnant way), Old Orlick.
1	I shall pull through, my dear!"
1	Monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his chocolate, caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown open, and issued forth.
1	Walk in, sir, and make yourself at home.’ Mr. Pickwick complied with the invitation, and sat himself down; when Mr. Weller, who stationed himself at the back of the chair, whispered that the sitting was merely another term for undergoing an inspection by the different turnkeys, in order that they might know prisoners from visitors.
1	Either of these gentlemen wish to go through the court?
1	Lowering of the family in intention!’ ‘Father!’ cried Little Dorrit, pale and trembling.
1	'Certainly, my dear, certainly,' rejoined Mr. Bumble, making a quicker motion towards the door.
1	I returned to the inn yard, and, impressed by my remembrance of the face, looked awfully around for it.
1	It is enough to mention that both Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby are very willing to oblige me and that Snagsby has, in busy times, a good deal of copying work to give out.
1	That’s not dutiful, Mr Arthur.
1	Is this the missis?’ inquired Scaley.
1	'Let me see; he'll be back in twenty minutes, at the longest,' said Mr. Brownlow, pulling out his watch, and placing it on the table.
1	A girl who is old enough to be engaged, is quite old enough to object to be stared at as if she was a Clock.’ ‘Audacious one!’ said Mrs Wilfer.
1	offences to expiate and peace to make, does not justify the desire to forget.
1	But sit where you are, if you please, in case I want you.’ His wife returned no other reply than the necessary ‘Yes, Quilp,’ and the small lord of the creation took his first cigar and mixed his first glass of grog.
1	As to myself I ain’t yet as Fash’nable as I may come to be.
1	I heard so much of Twenty Seven, of his pious admonitions to everybody around him, and of the beautiful letters he constantly wrote to his mother (whom he seemed to consider in a very bad way), that I became quite impatient to see him.
1	By the bye!’ said Mr Toots, as the discovery flashed upon him, ‘you, you know!’ The Captain glanced at the newspaper in Mr Toots’s hand, and breathed short and hurriedly.
1	The breast of his coat was ornamented with an outside pocket from which there peeped forth the cleanest end of a very large and very ill-favoured handkerchief; his dirty wristbands were pulled on as far as possible and ostentatiously folded back over his cuffs; he displayed no gloves, and carried a yellow cane having at the top a bone hand with the semblance of a ring on its little finger and a black ball in its grasp.
1	The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about, until they rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady, who were seated in a corner.
1	‘She needs rest,’ said the old man, patting her cheek; ‘too pale--too pale.
1	And now you can go, you know; and I hope,’ addressing the daughter, ‘that you’ll show more gratitude, and natural what’s-its-name, and all the rest of it--but I never remember names--for there never was a better mother than the good old creature’s been to you.
1	‘We have had a mort of talk, sir,’ said Mr. Peggotty to me, when we had all three walked a little while in silence, ‘of what we ought and doen’t ought to do.
1	Through this little gate, she passed out of childhood into the care-laden world.
1	If he is not--'  Here the irascible old gentleman gave a great knock on the ground with his stick; which was always understood, by his friends, to imply the customary offer, whenever it was not expressed in words.
1	‘After being so good too, and coming along so well!
1	If he is not to be trusted by himself, it follows, I suppose, that I should go with him?’ ‘It--seems so, love,’ said Little Dorrit.
1	At this juncture, Mrs Skewton speaks to Mr Dombey: more distinctly and emphatically than her custom is, and moving at the same time, close to Edith.
1	‘Repeat your words louder, sir.
1	The Barnacle family had for some time helped to administer the Circumlocution Office.
1	Do you really and truly say so?’ ‘Why, of course I do.
1	But seclusion and contemplation are my what-his-name--’ ‘If you mean Paradise, Mama, you had better say so, to render yourself intelligible,’ said the younger lady.
1	Then how can I possibly give you the answer that I have not discovered?
1	I must confess to feeling rather glad that he is not Mr. Honeythunder himself.
1	But he held the old man firmly, and watched his agonies with greedy eyes; and when his lifeless head fell forward on his bosom, he rolled the corpse from him with his feet.
1	The son had no watch.
1	There is something like a distant ray of light in thy muttered reason for this: "He wos wery good to me, he wos!"
1	I must admit that I could not regard myself in an agreeable light.
1	No wonder that I shook my head!
1	An indubitable token of life!
1	Whereas, it must be evident to yourself, as it is to me, that you have been this evening very different from what you were before.
1	This gave him a little comfort.
1	Worn out with her own emotions, and yielding to the silence of the room, her hand slowly slackened and failed in its fanning movement, and her head dropped down on the pillow at her father’s side.
1	She entreated that there might be no more searching; but it was still sought for, in a desultory way, until she was quite well, and the company took their departure.
1	Assured that it was Kit, though he saw little more than his nose, Mr Quilp hailed him by his name; whereupon Kit came in and demanded what he wanted.
1	'No,' replied the doctor; 'of course not!
1	Whoof!’ In the hour of his triumph, his moustache went up and his nose came down, as he ogled a great beam over his head with particular satisfaction.
1	“Miss Manette, if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that you give the evidence which it is your duty to give--which you must give--and which you cannot escape from giving--with great unwillingness, he is the only person present in that condition.
1	The poor dear gentleman was very solitary and very sad, Mrs. Tope said, but she had no doubt he would ‘speak for her.’  Perhaps Mr. Datchery had heard something of what had occurred there last winter?
1	“It is best,” he said, finally resolved, “that these people should know there is such a man as I here.” And he turned his face towards Saint Antoine.
1	Lady Dedlock again sat looking at the rain.
1	What do you mean by the proposal you made just now?’ ‘What do I mean, Bounderby?’ ‘By your visiting proposition,’ said Bounderby, with an inflexible jerk of the hayfield.
1	‘Watchman,’ shouted Dowler furiously, ‘stop him--hold him--keep him tight--shut him in, till I come down.
1	Have you known my mother long?’ ‘I think two years, sir,--The bell has stopped.’ ‘How did you know her first?
1	‘What’s the matter?’ ‘The law don’t agree with me,’ returned Dick.
1	Because I saw it would be of no use,’ replied Mr. Robert Sawyer.
1	‘Times when I can’t, I turn weak and confused.’ ‘But you must not begin to fail, Rachael, for you may be wanted at any time to stand by Stephen.
1	There was no bright face of ‘Wal’r’ in the house;--here the Captain transferred his sleeve for a moment from the Midshipman’s uniform to his own cheek;--the familiar wig and buttons of Sol Gills were a vision of the past; Richard Whittington was knocked on the head; and every plan and project in connexion with the Midshipman, lay drifting, without mast or rudder, on the waste of waters.
1	If I had wronged you in thought, or word, or deed, it would have been most cruel to me, and the memory of one you must have loved in some old time; but--’ ‘Only listen to me for a moment,’ interrupted Ralph, seriously alarmed by the violence of her emotions.
1	A merry Christmas to everybody!
1	He was going to dig, with whatsoever object, for he tucked up his cuffs and spat on his hands, and then went at it like an old digger as he was.
1	‘Gentlemen,’ said Brass, drawing off his glove, and crawling in spirit upon the ground before them, ‘I will justify the tenderness with which I know I shall be treated; and as, without tenderness, I should, now that this discovery has been made, stand in the worst position of the three, you may depend upon it I will make a clean breast.
1	So to London we will go.
1	The young gentleman was her distant cousin, she told me, and his name Richard Carstone.
1	I thought I had killed her, this time.
1	Sir Leicester looks astounded and inquires, "Is the man in custody?"
1	Examined with attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the line of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much too horizontal and thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a handsome face, and a remarkable one.
1	Mr Dombey had come to breakfast with the Major, previous to their setting forth on their trip; and the ill-starved Native had already undergone a world of misery arising out of the muffins, while, in connexion with the general question of boiled eggs, life was a burden to him.
1	Where I took her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from its stabs, and where I have lavished years of tenderness upon her!” “At least I was no party to the compact,” said Estella, “for if I could walk and speak, when it was made, it was as much as I could do.
1	Here are footsteps too.—O Rachael!’ She ran back, and caught her round the neck.
1	Yes, you deserve 'em from me.
1	Regard it as a matter of business--business that must be done.
1	‘I shall remember it.’ Mr Quilp seemed rather puzzled by the strange, even spiritless way in which all this was said; but as the old man nodded his head and repeated ‘on Friday morning.
1	Now you know;’ here his countenance expressed marvellous acuteness; ‘I can see as far into a grindstone as another man; farther than a good many, perhaps, because I had my nose well kept to it when I was young.
1	‘I can’t help it, blue he is, and while I was a Christian, although humble, I would have natural-coloured friends, or none.’ It appeared from what she added and had gleaned downstairs, that Mrs Chick had proposed the Major for Mr Dombey’s companion, and that Mr Dombey, after some hesitation, had invited him.
1	"Where is your son George, Mrs.
1	Run and tell him that; d’ye hear?
1	‘Fred,’ said Mr Swiveller, ‘remember the once popular melody of Begone dull care; fan the sinking flame of hilarity with the wing of friendship; and pass the rosy wine.’ Mr Richard Swiveller’s apartments were in the neighbourhood of Drury Lane, and in addition to this convenience of situation had the advantage of being over a tobacconist’s shop, so that he was enabled to procure a refreshing sneeze at any time by merely stepping out upon the staircase, and was saved the trouble and expense of maintaining a snuff-box.
1	‘No Fizkin!’ roared the crowd.
1	Presumptuous as it is to aspire to such a level; still, if the bird of night may--but I’ll not trouble Mr Dombey with the sentiment.
1	"Now, George," says Mr. Bucket, keeping his forefinger in an impressive state of action, "bear in mind what I've said to you.
1	Mr. Copperfield, ain’t I volatile?’ Her tone and look implied something that was not agreeable to me in connexion with the subject.
1	'Not long gone seven,' said the girl.
1	She was much given to the carrying about of small bags with snaps to them, that went off like little pistols when they were shut up; and when full-dressed, she wore round her neck the barrenest of lockets, representing a fishy old eye, with no approach to speculation in it.
1	I will not suffer this tone of levity.’ ‘My goodness me!
1	‘Will any coach—’ ‘I don’t mean that he thould go in the comic livery,’ said Sleary.
1	Hope for HIM, an old rip!
1	Pickwick does take an interest in it.’ ‘It’s well for him if he can,’ said Mrs. Pott emphatically; ‘I am wearied out of my life with your politics, and quarrels with the _Independent_, and nonsense.
1	I want to say it earnestly, and with as plain a meaning as it is possible to express.
1	Now, I am not a poetical man myself, except in a vocal way when it goes round a company, but I'm a practical one, and that's my experience.
1	My Lady alights so quickly and walks away so quickly that Sir Leicester, for all his scrupulous politeness, is unable to assist her, and is left behind.
1	Scrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice, that it was a pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him where he would.
1	To which Alfred would demur: ‘Undoubtedly, Sophronia, but Georgiana acutely remarks,’ that.
1	‘Theer’s the very locker that you used to sit on, ‘long with Em’ly!’ said Mr. Peggotty, in a whisper.
1	This is a most important matter.
1	Sorry to destroy romance by fixing him with a local habitation, but he comes from the place, the name of which escapes me, but will suggest itself to everybody else here, where they make the wine.’ Eugene suggests ‘Day and Martin’s.’ ‘No, not that place,’ returns the unmoved Mortimer, ‘that’s where they make the Port.
1	And heer’s your old little bedroom, see, Mas’r Davy!
1	I will consider my child!
1	Anyone would surprise me very much, Lucretia, and would greatly alter my opinion of their understanding, if they attempted to contradict or evade what is so perfectly evident.
1	I was looking back round the awning of the cart, and wondered what business it was of his.
1	I wish the people of London, and the people of this country to know, sir, that they may rely upon me--that I will not desert them, that I am resolved to stand by them, Sir, to the last.’ Your conduct is most noble, Sir,’ said Mr. Pickwick; and he grasped the hand of the magnanimous Pott.
1	She would come occasionally, with her usual distraught manner, and sit calmly looking miles beyond her grandchild as if her attention were absorbed by a young Borrioboolan on its native shores.
1	Will you remember that?’ Peggotty, with some uneasy glances at me, curtseyed herself out of the room without replying; seeing, I suppose, that she was expected to go, and had no excuse for remaining.
1	‘We are--not younger,’ said Clennam.
1	‘He’ll say something presently--mind you!--he’ll be sorry to have said afterwards, and you’ll be sorry to have heard!’ ‘I’ll say anything!’ cried Mr. Wickfield, with a desperate air.
1	Of course, he entered at this juncture, into no explanation of his motives, and they walked on very lovingly together.
1	When he speaks, he does so without looking at her, and as if his thoughts were already roaming away by anticipation.
1	But I tell you this:--when that young fellow’s interest is concerned, he holds as tight as a horse-leech.
1	There was something gipsy-like and agreeable in the dinner, after all.
1	I have forgotten to mention--at least I have not mentioned--that Mr. Woodcourt was the same dark young surgeon whom we had met at Mr. Badger's.
1	I was frightened when I went away, and could not think.
1	Mrs Pipchin almost laughs as the fly-van drives off, and she composes her black bombazeen skirts, and settles herself among the cushions of her easy chair.
1	Thank God!’ returned the old man.
1	‘I am much obliged to you, I am sure,’ said Miss Bella, coldly shaking her curls, ‘but I doubt if I have the inclination to go out at all.’ ‘Bella!’ Mrs Wilfer admonished her; ‘Bella, you must conquer this.’ ‘Yes, do what your Ma says, and conquer it, my dear,’ urged Mrs Boffin, ‘because we shall be so glad to have you, and because you are much too pretty to keep yourself shut up.’ With that, the pleasant creature gave her a kiss, and patted her on her dimpled shoulders; Mrs Wilfer sitting stiffly by, like a functionary presiding over an interview previous to an execution.
1	'I speak of fifteen years ago, when you were not more than eleven years old, and your father but one-and-thirty--for he was, I repeat, a boy, when _his_ father ordered him to marry.
1	‘Out of sight, out of mind,’ is well enough as a proverb applicable to cases of friendship, though absence is not always necessary to hollowness of heart, even between friends, and truth and honesty, like precious stones, are perhaps most easily imitated at a distance, when the counterfeits often pass for real.
1	‘I only know her picture, downstairs.
1	Now, is it?’ ‘N-n-no!’ replied Dora, faintly.
1	‘Sat and smoked his pipe, and said the infant negroes were--what did he say the infant negroes were?’ said Mrs. Weller.
1	Little Dorrit rose and left the table.
1	On our way to Portland, we passed a ‘Magistrate’s office,’ which amused me, as looking far more like a dame school than any police establishment: for this awful Institution was nothing but a little lazy, good-for-nothing front parlour, open to the street; wherein two or three figures (I presume the magistrate and his myrmidons) were basking in the sunshine, the very effigies of languor and repose.
1	If I understand any noddle in the world, I understand yours.
1	Says he wants a pound, and knows a dog.
1	The younger brother, uneasy at his protracted absence, was watching at the door for his coming, when he appeared in the pathway with his little guide.
1	Monseigneur gone, and the three strong men absolving themselves from the sin of having drawn his high wages, by being more than ready and willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one and indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, Monseigneur's house had been first sequestrated, and then confiscated.
1	‘“When left alone, she seems very happy if she have her knitting or sewing, and will busy herself for hours; if she have no occupation, she evidently amuses herself by imaginary dialogues, or by recalling past impressions; she counts with her fingers, or spells out names of things which she has recently learned, in the manual alphabet of the deaf mutes.
1	The trooper (if trooper he be or have been) takes her bonnet off, with a light touch for so strong a hand, and pats her on the head.
1	This she did one evening as follows: ‘Master Copperfield,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘I make no stranger of you, and therefore do not hesitate to say that Mr. Micawber’s difficulties are coming to a crisis.’ It made me very miserable to hear it, and I looked at Mrs. Micawber’s red eyes with the utmost sympathy.
1	Mr. Guppy, who has an inquiring mind in matters of evidence and who has been suffering severely from the lassitude of the long vacation, takes that interest in the case that he enters on a regular cross-examination of the witness, which is found so interesting by the ladies that Mrs. Snagsby politely invites him to step upstairs and drink a cup of tea, if he will excuse the disarranged state of the tea-table, consequent on their previous exertions.
1	And the fact is, my dear Mr. Copperfield, that we can not live without something widely different from existing circumstances shortly turning up.
1	‘I am engaged at this moment, Sam.’ ‘Beg your pardon, Sir,’ rejoined Mr. Weller.
1	The spare hand does not tremble as he releases it; nothing worse than a sweet, bright constancy is in the patient face.
1	Pull up here,' cried the doctor.
1	"I hope so," said he.
1	There was an air of reservation in the answer which increased my perplexity, and the answer was, that her maid believed she was only coming back at all for a little while.
1	Nevertheless, Jeremiah scraped out of his cogitating face a lively conviction that Mr Blandois would keep his word on this occasion, and would be seen again.
1	Not Ri----’ Before John Baptist could finish the name, his comrade had got his hand under his chin and fiercely shut up his mouth.
1	here’s this blessed phenomenon at last.
1	I wish to know on--ha--what authority, on whose authority.
1	Mary Anne’s cousin deserted into our coal-hole, and was brought out, to our great amazement, by a piquet of his companions in arms, who took him away handcuffed in a procession that covered our front-garden with ignominy.
1	You look better even now.’ With such encouragements as these, Ralph Nickleby walked to and fro, with his niece leaning on his arm; actually trembling beneath her touch.
1	"Very well, Volumnia," returns Sir Leicester.
1	Play.” I think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader, that she could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the wide world more difficult to be done under the circumstances.
1	Mrs. Snagsby looked rather alarmed, relented a little and faltered, what did Mr. Bucket mean.
1	I have an impression that for a long time, though I dreamed of being elsewhere and in a variety of scenes, it was always blowing in my dream.
1	I knew that I should not be worthier of the love I could not take if I reserved it.
1	You call me a lucky fellow.
1	And who is the dearest friend I have in the world?
1	By whose hand do you think?’ ‘Why do you ask me?’ said Harriet.
1	The old gentleman is helped into the chaise with great obsequiousness by Mr Sampson Brass; and the pony, after shaking his head several times, and standing for three or four minutes with all his four legs planted firmly on the ground, as if he had made up his mind never to stir from that spot, but there to live and die, suddenly darts off, without the smallest notice, at the rate of twelve English miles an hour.
1	Happily, she bethought herself of the consequences of what she did, in time to check herself and go back.
1	Ada tenderly embraced him, and Richard heartily shook hands with him, and then the cousins went out of the room, looking back again directly, though, to say that they would wait for me.
1	‘Deary!’ said the old woman then.
1	Want and sickness are too common in many stations of life to deserve more notice than is usually bestowed on the most ordinary vicissitudes of human nature.
1	“Wolf, I'll tell you something more.
1	‘“During the year she has attained great dexterity in the use of the manual alphabet of the deaf mutes; and she spells out the words and sentences which she knows, so fast and so deftly, that only those accustomed to this language can follow with the eye the rapid motions of her fingers.
1	‘Why did you resist them?
1	They ought to be ashamed of themselves for telling me.’ Clennam crossed to the other side, and hurriedly opened the letters.
1	What I was chained to, and how heavily, became intelligible to me, as I heard his hoarse voice, and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with its iron gray hair at the sides.
1	The rain fell heavily on the roof, and pattered on the ground, and dripped among the evergreens and the leafless branches of the trees.
1	Pip, sir.” “Show us where you live,” said the man.
1	So in familiar conversation, private authorities no less disinterested will remark that they don't know what this age is coming to, that we are plunging down precipices, that now here is something else gone, that these changes are death to people like Vholes--a man of undoubted respectability, with a father in the Vale of Taunton, and three daughters at home.
1	Mr. Mell, we’ll part, if you please.
1	Perhaps you know it's Provis?” “Yes,” said I.
1	‘How can that be hoped for?

1	Ladies and gentlemen, my daughter.
1	His spirits were elastic; his good-humour was restored.
1	How I felt as if its might would push me from my ground in Dora’s thoughts.
1	Though he considered it a point of good breeding in himself, as a general friend of the family, to attend Mr Dombey’s wedding (of which he had heard from Mr Perch), and to show that gentleman a pleasant and approving countenance from the gallery, he had repaired to the church in a hackney cabriolet with both windows up; and might have scrupled even to make that venture, in his dread of Mrs MacStinger, but that the lady’s attendance on the ministry of the Reverend Melchisedech rendered it peculiarly unlikely that she would be found in communion with the Establishment.
1	I don’t know what other girls know.
1	‘The daughter of a gentleman, though--ha--himself at one time comparatively far from affluent--comparatively--and herself reared in--hum--retirement, need not of necessity find this position so very novel.’ ‘True,’ said Mrs General, ‘true.’ ‘Therefore, madam,’ said Mr Dorrit, ‘I took the liberty’ (he laid an emphasis on the phrase and repeated it, as though he stipulated, with urbane firmness, that he must not be contradicted again), ‘I took the liberty of requesting this interview, in order that I might mention the topic to you, and inquire how you would advise me?’ ‘Mr Dorrit,’ returned Mrs General, ‘I have conversed with Amy several times since we have been residing here, on the general subject of the formation of a demeanour.
1	If I'd been your 'prentice, I'd have done it long ago, and--no, I couldn't have sold you afterwards, for you're fit for nothing but keeping as a curiousity of ugliness in a glass bottle, and I suppose they don't blow glass bottles large enough.'
1	Thee wath Tightrope, thee wath, and now thee’th nothing—on accounth of fat.
1	“--And if it does come, while we live to see it triumph--I hope, for her sake, Destiny will keep her husband out of France.” “Her husband's destiny,” said Madame Defarge, with her usual composure, “will take him where he is to go, and will lead him to the end that is to end him.
1	I never had this mysterious impression more strongly in my life, than before he uttered those words.
1	"I am thankful I have lived long enough to be with Sir Leicester in this illness and trouble, for I know I am not too old nor too useless to be a welcomer sight to him than anybody else in my place would be.
1	He likewise entertained his guest over the soup and fish, with the calculation that he (Bounderby) had eaten in his youth at least three horses under the guise of polonies and saveloys.
1	Haunted in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been, if the glass could ever have rendered back its reflections, as the ocean is one day to give up its dead.
1	I’ll go to him myself.’ The poor side of a debtor’s prison is, as its name imports, that in which the most miserable and abject class of debtors are confined.
1	"Now, my friends," proceeds Mr. Chadband, "since I am upon this theme--" Guster presents herself.
1	And there’s another thing to be remembered, Captain.
1	said I in a whisper.
1	Can I have seen him abroad?
1	I was so touched with pity for Richard that I could not reproach him any more, even by a look.
1	We will walk that way, my dears.
1	At that moment, he was interrupted by a loud knocking at the door below.
1	‘But, if the four elder sisters were lovely, how beautiful was the youngest, a fair creature of sixteen!
1	The children, under the guardianship of Jemima, blocked up the window, and dropped out oranges and halfpence all the way along.
1	I know you pretty well, you see.'
1	He is not one of Mrs. Pardiggle's Tockahoopo Indians; he is not one of Mrs. Jellyby's lambs, being wholly unconnected with Borrioboola-Gha; he is not softened by distance and unfamiliarity; he is not a genuine foreign-grown savage; he is the ordinary home-made article.
1	On our arrival in Denmark, we found the king and queen of that country elevated in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table, holding a Court.
1	‘I never had such a turn in all my life!’ ‘Have you been to the Study, then, mama?’ asked Annie.
1	When we were seated in the little ferry-boat, and were crossing the swollen river immediately before both cataracts, I began to feel what it was: but I was in a manner stunned, and unable to comprehend the vastness of the scene.
1	"Dear Sir Leicester, my honoured master," she softly whispers, "I must, for your own good, and my duty, take the freedom of begging and praying that you will not lie here in the lone darkness watching and waiting and dragging through the time.
1	For there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain, a long shout.
1	You can form no idea, sir, of the number of times he kissed quite a scrubby little piece--in comparison--that I cut off for HIM.
1	‘That’s Davy,’ returned Mr. Murdstone.
1	‘Where’s Arabella Allen?’ cried a dozen voices.
1	‘You are right,’ returned Newman.
1	Body number two, said they must take everything on political economy.
1	The cold light of morning had succeeded to night and there was already, in the sky, the red suffusion of the coming sun.
1	Without having undergone any decided second attack of her malady, the old woman seemed to have crawled backward in her recovery from the first.
1	‘Ahem!’ said the stranger, ‘that is my name.’ ‘Mr.
1	I dig the ground, and plant things that are to live and grow.
1	"Yes," said Richard, "well enough.
1	When his tears were dried, and he sobbed in his weakness no longer, and was free from that touch of shame, and had recovered his usual bearing, she prepared the remains of his supper afresh, and, sitting by his side, rejoiced to see him eat and drink.
1	I hope Lady Dedlock will excuse its painful nature."
1	Oliver was afraid to look at either her or the man.
1	Better than some real ones.’ ‘Never fret about them, Stephen,’ she answered quickly, and not without an anxious glance at his face.
1	Indeed, I show the greater confidence of the two, for I will pay in advance whatever you please, and I am going to trust my furniture here.
1	‘Oh do come in and sit down a minute, Susan, please,’ said Polly.
1	He has got that bottle about him.
1	I’ll just take a crust of bread with me, for I’m very hungry--and don’t wake her, Uncle Sol.’ ‘No, no,’ said Solomon.
1	I’ll not disguise from you, Clennam, that those conversations have not been of as bright a kind as I could wish; they have referred to our going away again.
1	I am only one of the travellers from down-stairs.
1	It was just at the time of that discovery in the river.
1	Tell the worthy mother so, without delay, my dear fellow; and that I am ready to begin whenever she pleases.’ Newman hastened, with joyful steps, to inform Mrs. Kenwigs of his friend’s acquiescence, and soon returning, brought back word that they would be happy to see him in the first floor as soon as convenient; that Mrs. Kenwigs had, upon the instant, sent out to secure a second-hand French grammar and dialogues, which had long been fluttering in the sixpenny box at the bookstall round the corner; and that the family, highly excited at the prospect of this addition to their gentility, wished the initiatory lesson to come off immediately.
1	He is quite sure of himself.
1	‘There’s a sheet of letter-paper,’ he returned.
1	The students of the sage’s precepts, left to their own application of his wisdom--upon a principle which was the main leg of the Bunsby tripod, as it is perchance of some other oracular stools--looked upon one another in a little uncertainty; while Rob the Grinder, who had taken the innocent freedom of peering in, and listening, through the skylight in the roof, came softly down from the leads, in a state of very dense confusion.
1	She never turns her head until she comes to the crossing where Jo plies with his broom.
1	Nor was the occasional society of Mr. Pott himself wanting to complete their felicity.

1	‘For Heaven’s sake,’ cried Neville, ‘don’t do that!
1	Since the time of her leaving home, Sissy had lived with the rest of the family on equal terms.
1	The noise and motion in the streets fatigued his brain at first, but he was not surprised, or curious, or pleased, or irritated.
1	Having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning, to increase its effect, Mr. Sikes continued.
1	Some men kneeled down, made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all run out between their fingers.
1	‘Her writing!’ said Mr. Peggotty.
1	Is he very white and spectre-like?
1	If you will undertake to let the young man know that he is free, and to tell him that you were employed to compound for the debt by some one whom you are not at liberty to name, you will not only do me a service, but may do him one, and his sister also.’ ‘The last reason, sir,’ said Plornish, ‘would be quite sufficient.
1	My disposition is very affectionate, and perhaps I might still feel such a wound if such a wound could be received more than once with the quickness of that birthday.
1	Do you know, Miss Summerson, I almost wonder that YOU never turned your thoughts to Africa."
1	These things passed through the mind of Fagin, during the short time he sat alone, in the housebreaker's room; and with them uppermost in his thoughts, he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him, of sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting.
1	‘In with it, Christopher.’ ‘All right, Sir,’ replied Kit.
1	Were I to say “This little fancy business is not mine”;’ with a lithe sweep of his easily-turning hand around him, to comprehend the various objects on the shelves; ‘“it is the little business of a Christian young gentleman who places me, his servant, in trust and charge here, and to whom I am accountable for every single bead,” they would laugh.
1	Kate tried to speak, but her tears prevented her.
1	'Yes, I am,' replied the old gentleman; 'but I am not sure that this boy actually took the handkerchief.
1	Oh, what an evening, when I sat down by my fire to a basin of mutton broth, dimpled all over with fat, and thought I was going the way of my predecessor, and should succeed to his dismal story as well as to his chambers, and had half a mind to rush express to Dover and reveal all!
1	Little Dorrit’s.’ So always as he sat alone in the faded chair, thinking.
1	I suffer for Miss Dombey, Captain Gills.
1	I don't know that it's of any direct use my doing so, but it's all I can do, and I do it thoroughly.
1	Before Mr Swiveller could make any reply, Mr Chuckster took occasion to enter his indignant protest against this form of inquiry; which he held to be of a disrespectful and snobbish tendency, inasmuch as the inquirer, seeing two gentlemen then and there present, should have spoken of the other gentleman; or rather (for it was not impossible that the object of his search might be of inferior quality) should have mentioned his name, leaving it to his hearers to determine his degree as they thought proper.
1	It was a wonderful instance to me of the gap such partings make, that although my association of them with the tumble-down public-house and the wooden stairs dated only from last night, both seemed dreary and deserted, now that they were gone.
1	I study and get up abstruse No Thoroughfares in the course of the day.
1	Oh, where was Julia Mills!
1	I'll tell you what, though; my lodger is so black-humoured and gloomy that I believe he'd as soon make that bargain as any other.
1	Nor do I recollect its subject.
1	only don’t expect me to stand between your mother and you, Arthur.
1	Then it was all delicious ease and rest till they laid me down, and said, all together, “Have patience, and we will come again.”  Whenever they came back, I used to know they were coming before I saw the long bright rows, by hearing them ask, all together a long way off, “Who is this in pain!
1	Pa, dear, make me poor again and take me home!
1	Young Toots who was ready beforehand, and had therefore nothing to do, and had leisure to bestow upon Paul, said, with heavy good nature: ‘Sit down, Dombey.’ ‘Thank you, Sir,’ said Paul.
1	There was, and is when I write, at the end of that low-lying street, a dilapidated little wooden building, probably an obsolete old ferry-house.
1	A commission of haberdashers could alone have reported what the rest of her poor dress was made of, but it had a strong general resemblance to seaweed, with here and there a gigantic tea-leaf.
1	Sam had dutifully seen his father to the Belle Sauvage, when, on returning, he encountered the fat boy in the court, who had been charged with the delivery of a note from Emily Wardle.
1	Did he see himself, a white-haired decrepit man, bending his hitherto inflexible theories to appointed circumstances; making his facts and figures subservient to Faith, Hope, and Charity; and no longer trying to grind that Heavenly trio in his dusty little mills?

1	Where’s that rough total, Mr Rugg?
1	"There's a little cracked old woman," he began, "that--" I put up my finger, for Miss Flite was close by me, having kept beside me all the time and having called the attention of several of her legal acquaintance to me (as I had overheard to my confusion) by whispering in their ears, "Hush!
1	After some words apart between the last comer and Fagin, they drew their chairs towards the fire; and the Jew, telling Oliver to come and sit by him, led the conversation to the topics most calculated to interest his hearers.
1	Many pleasant pictures of the life that I would lead there, and of the change for the better that would come over my character when I had a guiding spirit at my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom I had proved, beguiled my way.
1	My own child, that no uncles can deprive me of; my own hated, despised, deserted, cut-off little child.’ And, here, the emotions of Mrs. Kenwigs became so violent, that Mr. Kenwigs was fain to administer hartshorn internally, and vinegar externally, and to destroy a staylace, four petticoat strings, and several small buttons.
1	“Well!” she went on; “you have a promising career before you.
1	I should think your wages would average from five to seven shillings a week; but I can’t give you any certain information on that point, until I see what you can do.’ Kate bowed her head again.
1	I will, though I have no whiskers,’ here he rubbed the places where they were due, ‘and no manners, and no conversation!’ Having thus relieved his noble mind, he collected the legs of the Turkish trousers, straightened himself on his knees, and called out to Riah in the next room, ‘Halloa, you sir!’ At sight of the old man re-entering with a gentleness monstrously in contrast with the character he had given him, Mr Fledgeby was so tickled again, that he exclaimed, laughing, ‘Good!
1	We have reason to know by this time that    there is no good in it and no hope, that there is nothing    to be got from it but sorrow.
1	Go on, Wal’r.’ ‘And therefore, Sir,’ said Walter, venturing to meet Mr Dombey’s eye, and proceeding with better courage in the very desperation of the case, now that there was no avoiding it, ‘therefore I have come, with him, Sir, to say that my poor old Uncle is in very great affliction and distress.
1	"Can't be a lawyer, then," says Mr. George, folding his arms with an air of confirmed resolution.
1	They appeared to me to be quite beyond his comprehension, for when Caddy took me into the dining-room by mistake and we came upon Mr. Jellyby in his spectacles, forlornly fenced into a corner by the great dining-table and the two gentlemen, he seemed to have given up the whole thing and to be speechless and insensible.
1	‘It is natural that you should.’ He was disgracefully thrown out, for a gentleman who had seen so much of the world, and thought, ‘Now, how am I to take this?’ ‘You are going to devote yourself, as I gather from what Mr. Bounderby has said, to the service of your country.
1	‘If it hadn’t been for me, I don’t know what would have become of him.’ What strange creatures we are!
1	Now move on here, come!"
1	Then it flashes upon him.
1	He re-entered the shed, and shrunk down once more.
1	I turned him hastily on some pretence, and held him in conversation until it was gone.
1	‘Patience,’ she croaked, laying her hand, like a claw, upon his arm.
1	With far less force of purpose in his composition than the childish beauty, crowned by acclamation fairy queen of Miss Twinkleton’s establishment, he had a conscience, and Mr. Grewgious had pricked it.
1	Now, we look cheerful.’ Mr Inspector, in a dark-blue buttoned-up frock coat and pantaloons, presented a serviceable, half-pay, Royal Arms kind of appearance, as he applied his pocket handkerchief to his nose and bowed to the lady.
1	‘Charity, to be sure,’ returned Squeers, rubbing his knees, ‘and when he begins to be useful in a certain sort of way, this young scoundrel of a Nickleby comes and carries him off.
1	The dog sat at the bedside:  now eyeing his master with a wistful look, and now pricking his ears, and uttering a low growl as some noise in the street, or in the lower part of the house, attracted his attention.
1	Hearing from that individual, to his great concern, of the impending calamity, Captain Cuttle, in his delicacy, sheered off again confounded; merely handing in the nosegay as a small mark of his solicitude, and leaving his respectful compliments for the family in general, which he accompanied with an expression of his hope that they would lay their heads well to the wind under existing circumstances, and a friendly intimation that he would ‘look up again’ to-morrow.
1	‘Indeed I am not going to be, my darling!’ I assured her.
1	I’m none the worse for that, am I?’ ‘Not a bit,’ replied Mr. Mivins.
1	Nothing of this appeared, however.
1	“The child also,” observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoyment of his words, “has golden hair and blue eyes.
1	And Mr. Snagsby again relates his experience, again suppressing the half-crown fact.
1	“'How has this been done, monsieur?'
1	‘The last soft light of the setting sun had fallen on the earth, casting a rich glow on the yellow corn sheaves, and lengthening the shadows of the orchard trees, as he stood before the old house--the home of his infancy--to which his heart had yearned with an intensity of affection not to be described, through long and weary years of captivity and sorrow.
1	I arrived at the office so soon, after all, that I had half an hour’s loitering about the Commons, before old Tiffey, who was always first, appeared with his key.
1	Tell me.’ ‘It’s quite accidental,’ replied Mr. Winkle, greatly perplexed by the curious and unexpected nature of the interview.
1	As he spoke, he seated himself at the other end of the table, and, throwing off his cloak and cap, disclosed his features.
1	It was clothed in one simple green robe, or mantle, bordered with white fur.
1	They crossed the Strand, and passed through Covent Garden (under the windows of his old lodging where dear Little Dorrit had come that night), and slanted away north-east, until they passed the great building whence Tattycoram derived her name, and turned into the Gray’s Inn Road.
1	‘I see too well now, that they would indeed part us if they found us out, and shut him up from the light of the sun and sky.
1	I owe that to you.
1	Nor were these the only tokens of dispersal.
1	And I am bound to bear in mind that I took Wegg on, at a time when I had no thought of being fashionable or of leaving the Bower.
1	He would sit, for hours together, with Nell’s small hand in his, playing with the fingers and stopping sometimes to smooth her hair or kiss her brow; and, when he saw that tears were glistening in her eyes, would look, amazed, about him for the cause, and forget his wonder even while he looked.
1	_My_ child died, before his father’s eyes, a far more agonising and painful death than that young slanderer of his sister’s worth is meeting while I speak.
1	You must consider yourself in custody, George."
1	Suppose some of the boys had seen me coming through Canterbury, wayworn and ragged, and should find me out?
1	It matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks I lost myself among, what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces, what ooze and slime and other dregs of tide, what yards of ship-builders and ship-breakers, what rusty anchors blindly biting into the ground, though for years off duty, what mountainous country of accumulated casks and timber, how many rope-walks that were not the Old Green Copper.
1	A certain leanness falls upon houses not sufficiently imbued with life (as if they were nourished upon it), which was very noticeable here.
1	But I may ask you two questions, may I?'
1	Mrs Wickam had been drafted home to the house in town, and Miss Nipper, now a smart young woman, had come down.
1	Sir Leicester is fidgety down at Chesney Wold, with no better company than the gout; he complains to Mrs. Rouncewell that the rain makes such a monotonous pattering on the terrace that he can't read the paper even by the fireside in his own snug dressing-room.
1	"You two were so close about him that I thought you would like me to be the same," returns that old bird with a secretly glistening eye.
1	"He's in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress.
1	Comes Mr. Tope with his large keys, and yawningly unlocks and sets open.
1	We are through the village, up the hill, and down the hill, and on the low watery grounds.
1	I believe that I began to know that there was something about my aunt, notwithstanding her many eccentricities and odd humours, to be honoured and trusted in.
1	“I am not crying,” said Miss Pross; “_you_ are.” “I, my Pross?” (By this time, Mr. Lorry dared to be pleasant with her, on occasion.)
1	And either in this glimpse of the great pleasure of his life or in gratitude and love for Charley, who was all in all to him, he laid his face among the scanty folds of her frock and passed from laughing into crying.
1	‘To think,’ said Squeers, ‘that you and me should be turning out of a street, and come upon him at the very nick; and that I should have him tight, at only one cast of the umbrella, as if I had hooked him with a grappling-iron!
1	‘How are, you, my lad?’ replied the Captain.
1	Even cousins may be sorry to part; and in truth I am very, very sorry, Richard, though I know it's for your welfare.
1	And who but one--and that one he who, but for those who crowded round him then, had never met a look of kindness, or known a word of pity--could tell what agony of mind, what blighted thoughts, what unavailing sorrow, were involved in that sad parting?
1	‘One must eat,’ he muttered to himself, ‘but by Heaven I must eat at the cost of some other man to-morrow!’ As he sat pondering, and mechanically weighing his money in his palm, the deep breathing of the traveller in the other bed fell so regularly upon his hearing that it attracted his eyes in that direction.
1	Dick was pondering what these words might mean, and still more what the presence of Mr Brass might mean, when Mrs Quilp came hurrying down stairs, declaring that the rooms above were empty.
1	'I think I do,' said the gentleman, breaking silence.
1	Struggles, Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Jingle, were, each in his turn, the subject of unqualified eulogium; and each in due course returned thanks for the honour.
1	What business was it of old Tozer’s more than anybody else’s?
1	As he looked at Carton with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton--his hand again in his breast--looked steadily at him.
1	Hold your noise, sir, in a gentleman’s office, or I’ll run away from my family and never come back any more; and then what would become of all them precious and forlorn lads as would be let loose on the world, without their best friend at their elbers?’ ‘Were you obliged to have medical attendance?’ inquired Ralph.
1	So much the better for you.
1	You shall go.’ ‘I!’ returned the other.
1	‘How!’ exclaimed Mrs Wilfer, with sublime severity.
1	Few ways of life were hidden from Physician, and he was oftener in its darkest places than even Bishop.
1	As he was half amused and half curious and all in doubt how to get rid of the old lady without offence, she continued to lead us away, and he and Ada continued to follow, our strange conductress informing us all the time, with much smiling condescension, that she lived close by.
1	Both were bleeding and panting and execrating and struggling; but of course I knew them both directly.
1	‘What do you wish?’ ‘Piano?’ hesitated Mr Dombey.
1	‘I can see your features, godmother, behind the beard.’ ‘Does the fancy go to my changing other objects too, Jenny?’ ‘Ah!
1	‘There’s nothing more than usual the matter; is there, Uncle?’ said Walter, leaning his elbows on the tea tray, and bending over, to speak the more confidentially and kindly.
1	‘Wy don’t you?’ said Sam, urging his question strenuously.
1	His face was as fiery as ever; his eyes were as small, and rather deeper set.
1	He makes it too secure, as it happens.
1	She's a Tartar.” “Miss Havisham?” “I don't say no to that, but I meant Estella.
1	Durdles is a stonemason; chiefly in the gravestone, tomb, and monument way, and wholly of their colour from head to foot.
1	What’s your message, Nelly?’ The child handed him a letter.
1	You can contemplate your beauty at another time."
1	Where are the graces of my soul?
1	what are you up to, my dear?’ said Mr Codlin, raising his head, and yawning.
1	In pursuance of this resolution, he now drew a little table to his bedside, and arranging the light and a small oblong music-book to the best advantage, took his flute from its box, and began to play most mournfully.
1	Even when he was satisfied that he could not be there, he sat patiently on a broken stair and waited; arguing, that he had gone out upon some slight errand, and must soon return.
1	“If the widow had any taste, she might surely pick up some better fellow than that.” Here Tom’s eye wandered from the glass on the chimney-piece to the glass on the table; and as he felt himself becoming gradually sentimental, he emptied the fourth tumbler of punch and ordered a fifth.
1	We must hold up our heads and fight low, as my brother Solomon used to say.
1	From these she obtained a lamp, and a direction to the lady’s room.
1	Richard Swiveller comes hastily up, elbows the bystanders out of the way, takes her (after some trouble) in one arm after the manner of theatrical ravishers, and, nodding to Kit, and commanding Barbara’s mother to follow, for he has a coach waiting, bears her swiftly off.
1	Her eyes were so red with waking and crying, that the Tragic Muse might have winked with greater consistency.
1	“Nothing but beggar my neighbor, miss.” “Beggar him,” said Miss Havisham to Estella.
1	As Sir Leicester basks in his library and dozes over his newspaper, is there no influence in the house to startle him, not to say to make the very trees at Chesney Wold fling up their knotted arms, the very portraits frown, the very armour stir?
1	Micawber,’ said I, ‘what is the matter?
1	‘Be sure you’re right, Slackbridge!’ ‘Put him up!’  ‘Let’s hear him!’  Such things were said on many sides.
1	‘Head, potry--chapter, literary friends--name, Snowgrass; ver good.
1	‘Wish you luck, Sir,’ said Sam, touching his hat.
1	Let me go back.’ ‘I swear to you, Lizzie, you shall go directly.
1	‘If I can redeem it, or hope to do so, you know I will.’ ‘I am sure you will,’ was the reply.
1	You are the quickest messenger I know, and will get to Temple Bar long before I can.” Jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle, and he knuckled it in acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling.
1	Then it turned the handle, and went in.
1	It had its poor people too.
1	‘I suppose the Yorkshire folks are rather rough and uncultivated; that’s all.’ ‘But this person,’ urged Kate.
1	I know that I was filled with pleasure by all this; but, at first, with an indescribably sensitive pleasure, that a very little would have changed to pain.
1	It might have been Mr. Pickwick’s very unexpected gallantry, or it might have been the complicated manner in which he had got himself out of bed, and fallen all in a mass upon the hornpipe man, that touched his adversaries.
1	As I often remark to the young ladies, “Well I must say, and I do not care who knows it, of all the ready humour--hem--I ever heard anywhere”--and I have heard a good deal; for when my dear brother was alive (I kept house for him, Miss Nickleby), we had to supper once a week two or three young men, highly celebrated in those days for their humour, Madame Mantalini--“Of all the ready humour,” I say to the young ladies, “I ever heard, Madame Mantalini’s is the most remarkable--hem.
1	Lady Skettles presently discovered that she was dying with anxiety to have that gratification; and though Florence was at first very much frightened at being asked to sing before so many people, and begged earnestly to be excused, yet, on Paul calling her to him, and saying, ‘Do, Floy!
1	‘No,’ replied Mr. Lillyvick, shaking his head nervously: ‘no--of course not.’ ‘But how come you both here, if you’re going to be married, Mr Lillyvick?’ asked Nicholas.
1	‘It was wrong,’ said the old gentleman in a milder tone, ‘very wrong.
1	You are his little pet, you are his favourite; he’ll do anything for you.
1	"I hear a voice," says Chadband; "is it a still small voice, my friends?
1	For old Mr. Turveydrop's deportment is very beautiful, you know, Esther," said Caddy, "and his feelings are extremely sensitive."
1	Estella smiled with perfect composure, and said she had no doubt of my having been quite right, and of her having been very disagreeable.
1	‘Accommodation, eh?’ said that gentleman, consulting a large book.
1	You must comply with it--take off those boots you wear, and draw on these of mine.” There was a chair against the wall of the cell, behind the prisoner.
1	On a wintry afternoon at twilight, Mrs Flintwinch, having been heavy all day, dreamed this dream: She thought she was in the kitchen getting the kettle ready for tea, and was warming herself with her feet upon the fender and the skirt of her gown tucked up, before the collapsed fire in the middle of the grate, bordered on either hand by a deep cold black ravine.
1	As if the aspiring city had become puffed up in the very ground on which it stood, the ground had so risen about Bleeding Heart Yard that you got into it down a flight of steps which formed no part of the original approach, and got out of it by a low gateway into a maze of shabby streets, which went about and about, tortuously ascending to the level again.
1	You get among them Tombs afore it’s well light on a winter morning, and keep on, as the Catechism says, a-walking in the same all the days of your life, and _you’ll_ know what Durdles means.’ ‘It is a bitter cold place,’ Mr. Jasper assents, with an antipathetic shiver.
1	Louder, Vengeance, much louder, and still she will scarcely hear thee.
1	That I penetrated his secret when Dame Durden was blind to it is no wonder, for I knew the good that could never change in her better far than she did.
1	The round-game table, on the other hand, was so boisterously merry as materially to interrupt the contemplations of Mr. Miller, who, not being quite so much absorbed as he ought to have been, contrived to commit various high crimes and misdemeanours, which excited the wrath of the fat gentleman to a very great extent, and called forth the good-humour of the old lady in a proportionate degree.
1	In short, Mrs Pipchin, that is the object of my visit.
1	‘Now, please take me home, Eddy, and let me be by myself.’ ‘Don’t look round, Rosa,’ he cautioned her, as he drew her arm through his, and led her away.
1	‘Winkle--Tupman--I beg your pardon for the observations I made just now.
1	From which,” said Wemmick, “conjectures had been raised and theories formed.
1	Never, never, never, marry a little man!” Papa also would remark to me (he possessed extraordinary humour), “that a family of whales must not ally themselves with sprats.” His company was eagerly sought, as may be supposed, by the wits of the day, and our house was their continual resort.
1	Another minute, and it was suffused with a crimson flush:  and a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye.
1	I bred her and educated her, to be loved.
1	The brothers conferred apart for a short time: their manner showing that they were agitated.
1	The old man’s eye was keen with the twinklings of avarice and cunning; the young man’s bright with the light of intelligence and spirit.
1	‘Now depitty sawbones, bring out the wollatilly!’ The latter observation was addressed to the boy in gray, who, having handed over the fly to the care of the street-keeper, had come back to see what all the noise was about.
1	But neither mode of relief suggested itself to Prince Bladud; so he solicited a private audience, and told his father.
1	Respecting the other certified copy, your wish shall be complied with.
1	‘Nobody would if they did want to,’ said Mr. Snevellicci.
1	The mature young lady is going to be married (powder and all) to the mature young gentleman, and she is to be married from the Veneering house, and the Veneerings are to give the breakfast.
1	‘I beg and pray that no one will leave the room!
1	I have travelled out of the record, sir, I am aware, in putting the point to you.
1	"But really when the time came, and I knew no other ill of him, I was in doubts.
1	As he held up his hand, however, in token of his wish that they should be silent, they were considerate enough to leave off, as soon as the longest-winded among them were quite out of breath.
1	No sooner had the artist traveller ceased speaking than he himself spoke with great dignity, as having it incumbent on him to take the lead in most places, and having deserted that duty for a little while.
1	‘Hurt his feelings, and lost him his situation.’ ‘His feelings?’ repeated Steerforth disdainfully.
1	The bride, with the four bridesmaids, forming a group previously arranged and rehearsed; the collector, followed by his second, imitating his walk and gestures to the indescribable amusement of some theatrical friends in the gallery; Mr. Crummles, with an infirm and feeble gait; Mrs. Crummles advancing with that stage walk, which consists of a stride and a stop alternately--it was the completest thing ever witnessed.
1	‘There!’ said the dwarf, pulling him in.
1	The air struck chill and comfortless as it breathed upon him.
1	The decline of day here was very gorgeous; tingeing the firmament deeply with red and gold, up to the very keystone of the arch above us.
1	Except in that regard, we are all alike.
1	‘Yes,’ I said, with some importance.
1	Bring him on, Cornelia, bring him on.’ Miss Blimber received her young ward from the Doctor’s hands; and Paul, feeling that the spectacles were surveying him, cast down his eyes.
1	How Bradley Headstone had been racked and riven in his mind since the quiet evening when by the river-side he had risen, as it were, out of the ashes of the Bargeman, none but he could have told.
1	‘Is it possible, Mrs Clennam, that you are so happily recovered as--’ Little Dorrit stopped, for there was neither happiness nor health in the face that turned to her.
1	I sold them very willingly.
1	‘I understand you, Peggotty, perfectly.
1	But the face so altered to his thinking, thrilled while he gazed, as if it were in pain; and before he could reach out both his hands to take it between them, and draw it towards him, the figure turned away quickly from the little bed, and went out at the door.
1	Whom Lady Tippins, standing on a cushion, surveying through the eye-glass, thus checks off.
1	Daring burglaries by armed men, and highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of “the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and then got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the failure of his ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace; that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles's, to search for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way.
1	He'd make his fortun' on the stage that dog would, and rewive the drayma besides.'
1	‘No, Sir,’ said the Major, in a severe tone.
1	Scrooge repeated, as he scrambled out of bed.
1	I wish you good day, and I hope you'll do well."
1	If the child himself could have awakened in the night, and seen, gathered about his cradle-curtains, faint reflections of the dreams that other people had of him, they might have scared him, with good reason.
1	If Miss Nell was to come back, ma’am,’ added Kit, turning suddenly to his mistress, ‘why that would be another thing, and perhaps if she wanted me, I might ask you now and then to let me work for her when all was done at home.
1	I told her--or I tried to tell her--that if it were for me, her child, under any circumstances to take upon me to forgive her, I did it, and had done it, many, many years.
1	‘My daughter, Madam’--began Mr Dombey.
1	And now the void in Florence’s own heart began again, indeed, to make a solitude around her.
1	‘From Mr Garland.’ ‘Oh!’ said Dick, with extreme politeness.
1	‘What a porpoise you do grow!’ ‘Well, I don’t know how it is, my dear,’ he replied, considering about it.
1	In shrewdness of remark, and a certain cast-iron quaintness, the Yankees, or people of New England, unquestionably take the lead; as they do in most other evidences of intelligence.
1	There are chords in the human heart--strange, varying strings--which are only struck by accident; which will remain mute and senseless to appeals the most passionate and earnest, and respond at last to the slightest casual touch.
1	Nell could not help weeping when they were left alone; whereat, and at sight of her pale face and wasted figure, the simple schoolmaster shed a few tears himself, at the same time showing in very energetic language how foolish it was to do so, and how very easily it could be avoided, if one tried.
1	Although it was extremely cold, the snow was but partially frozen, and it churned--with a sound as if it were a beach of small shells--under the hoofs of the horses into mire and water.
1	‘I bless the day!’ said Lizzie.
1	‘Well, I’m wery glad I’ve seen the ‘rig’nal, ‘cos it’s a gratifyin’ sort o’ thing, and eases vun’s mind so much.’ ‘And here’s the shilling,’ said Jackson.
1	I assure you that if you could give me any assistance, you would not be sorry to do so, if you knew how greatly I stand in need of it, and what a load it would relieve me from.’ There was a simplicity in this confidence which occasioned it to find a quick response in the breast of the good-natured Notary, who replied, in the same spirit, that the stranger had not mistaken his desire, and that if he could be of service to him, he would, most readily.
1	They won’t pass that werdick, they won’t pass it, Sammy.’ And Mr. Weller shook his head with legal solemnity.
1	He felt the delicacy of his situation, and modestly replied, ‘No.’ ‘Are you, sir?’ inquired Mr. Snodgrass.
1	"Your granddaughter I have had the honour of seeing before; my service to you, miss."
1	For, going to the door of the Doctor's room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker's bench and tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading at the window.
1	He instantly jumped up, and it was not the same man, but another man!
1	‘The Game Chicken,’ said Mr Toots.
1	“Well, sir,” says old Fogg, looking at him very fierce--you know his way--“well, Sir, have you come to settle?” “Yes, I have, sir,” said Ramsey, putting his hand in his pocket, and bringing out the money, “the debt’s two pound ten, and the costs three pound five, and here it is, Sir;” and he sighed like bricks, as he lugged out the money, done up in a bit of blotting-paper.
1	‘Very well, sir,’ said brother Charles.
1	‘Her mother was, and she was poor.
1	There was one great source of uneasiness in the midst of this good fortune, and that was the having nobody by, to whom she could confide it.
1	There had been a wind all day; and it was rising then, with an extraordinary great sound.
1	You never had a chance before you came here, and see how improved you are!” Biddy looked at me for an instant, and went on with her sewing.
1	He did not travel far that afternoon, for by this time it was nearly dark, and there had been a heavy fall of snow, which not only rendered the way toilsome, but the track uncertain and difficult to find, after daylight, save by experienced wayfarers.
1	My parting love to uncle.
1	‘No,’ said Little Dorrit, with the sunset very bright upon her.
1	Nonsense, sir!--And, my dear Charles,” said Mr. Lorry, glancing at the House again, “you are to remember, that getting things out of Paris at this present time, no matter what things, is next to an impossibility.
1	You know you like this girl."
1	I am sure you have enough to do, if that’s what you want.
1	Then he underwent a relapse, and becoming powerless again, rested his chin upon his hand, and opened his eyes so wide, that it appeared quite out of the question that he could ever close them any more.
1	The Cloisterham gardens blush with ripening fruit.
1	Nearly three hours of silence passed away.
1	I was there; but I couldn’t stop ‘em; so I run off to tell ‘ee.’ ‘I paid his expenses!’ said Mr. Tupman, jumping up frantically.
1	There was a short pause; the brandy-and-water had done its work; the amiable countenance of Mr. Pickwick was fast recovering its customary expression.
1	Who else holds the door sometimes?
1	Caddy keeps her own little carriage now instead of hiring one, and lives full two miles further westward than Newman Street.
1	I am glad that, thinking I deserve to be thanked, you have come to thank me.
1	‘Pickwick,’ said the magistrate, ‘dear me, Mr. Pickwick--pray take a seat--you cannot mean this?
1	‘I don’t know though, that I should much mind HIS knowing my opinion of him; with some other people, indeed, it might be--’ Here Miss Snevellicci stopped, as though waiting to be questioned, but no questioning came, for Nicholas was thinking about more serious matters.
1	Chairs and table, he said, were wearisome objects; they were monotonous ideas, they had no variety of expression, they looked you out of countenance, and you looked them out of countenance.
1	‘No, but do you know that really--seriously now and without any joking--I was given to understand by Fanny herself, that you had made an offer to her, and that you two were going to be engaged quite solemn and regular.’ ‘Was you, ma’am--was you?’ cried a shrill female voice, ‘was you given to understand that I--I--was going to be engaged to an assassinating thief that shed the gore of my pa?
1	‘I am not quite decided,’ returned Mr Dombey.
1	It is of my ward.
1	Then I playfully tried verbal instruction in domestic matters, as we walked about on a Saturday afternoon.
1	When he saw them, and knew them, and even from his vantage-ground of inspection could find no flaw in them, he asked himself, ‘And shall I come to life to dispossess such people as these?’ There was no good to set against the putting of them to that hard proof.
1	‘You are, my love, you know you are; one breath--’ said Mr. W., blowing an imaginary feather away.
1	We were at Newgate in a few minutes, and we passed through the lodge where some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison rules, into the interior of the jail.
1	These were its brief contents:-- “Not wishful to intrude I have departured fur you are well again dear Pip and will do better without JO.
1	Why should I pause to ask how much of my shrinking from Provis might be traced to Estella?
1	She filled his glass, put all the little matters on the table ready to his hand, and then sat beside him while he ate his supper.
1	‘There’s the light of her fire.’ ‘I’ll take a peep through the window,’ said Mortimer.
1	I thought my mother was sorry to see me standing in the room so scared and strange, and that, presently, when I stole to a chair, she followed me with her eyes more sorrowfully still--missing, perhaps, some freedom in my childish tread--but the word was not spoken, and the time for it was gone.
1	‘All I’ve got to say is, that it’s well for you that the diwision of labour has been what it has been.
1	Dead, my lords and gentlemen.
1	There were a hundred thousand shapes and substances of incompleteness, wildly mingled out of their places, upside down, burrowing in the earth, aspiring in the air, mouldering in the water, and unintelligible as any dream.
1	The Great Pump Room is a spacious saloon, ornamented with Corinthian pillars, and a music-gallery, and a Tompion clock, and a statue of Nash, and a golden inscription, to which all the water-drinkers should attend, for it appeals to them in the cause of a deserving charity.
1	I should have been a great deal more miserable than I was, if it hadn’t been for you.’ Goodness gracious, how pretty Barbara was when she coloured--and when she trembled, like a little shrinking bird!
1	Then we sits down, gradually gets cool, and holds a confabulation.
1	Kate coloured deeply, breathed quickly for a few moments, and then walked on with a firmer and more determined step.
1	Mr. Gridley objected to it very strong, and he is a good lodger, though his temper has been hard tried."
1	Down upon the ground, clinging to him, calling to him, folding her hands, praying to him.
1	There must be a splendid operation, though, to-morrow-- magnificent sight if Slasher does it.’ ‘You consider Mr. Slasher a good operator?’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	‘Throw it away,’ he coolly recommends as to the parasol; ‘you have made it useless; you look ridiculous with it.’ Whereupon she calls him in her rage, ‘A deliberate villain,’ and so casts the broken thing from her as that it strikes him in falling.
1	But however that may be, Mr. Winkle is gone.
1	"Why, get along with you," said she to my guardian, "what do you mean?
1	These latter words were addressed to Ada, who was sitting nearest to him.
1	Now, Samivel, my boy, turn the horses’ heads to the George and Wulter!’ Mr. Pickwick was sitting alone, musing over many things, and thinking among other considerations how he could best provide for the young couple whose present unsettled condition was matter of constant regret and anxiety to him, when Mary stepped lightly into the room, and, advancing to the table, said, rather hastily-- ‘Oh, if you please, Sir, Samuel is downstairs, and he says may his father see you?’ ‘Surely,’ replied Mr. Pickwick.
1	"You know I don't intend to be responsible.
1	I noticed that Mr. Pumblechook in his hospitality appeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine, but took the bottle from Mrs. Joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a gush of joviality.
1	‘I have been thinking, Kit,’ said the lawyer, ‘that I could throw some little emoluments in your mother’s way--You have a mother, I think?
1	For anything I knew, his animosity towards the man might otherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own destruction.
1	And what does this allusion to the slow coach mean?
1	‘I was dreaming at a great rate, and am glad to be disturbed from an indigestive after-dinner sleep.
1	I’ll get a chaise at the Lion, and follow ‘em instantly.
1	True, the Powlers and the Scadgerses were accustomed to splendour, ‘but it is my duty to remember,’ Mrs. Sparsit was fond of observing with a lofty grace: particularly when any of the domestics were present, ‘that what I was, I am no longer.
1	The wreck, even to my unpractised eye, was breaking up.
1	Young as he was, however, he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at going away.
1	‘All I will say is, Miss Wade,’ he remarked, ‘that you can have received no provocation to a feeling in which I believe you have no sharer.’ ‘You may ask your dear friend, if you choose,’ she returned, ‘for his opinion upon that subject.’ ‘I am scarcely on those intimate terms with my dear friend,’ said Arthur, in spite of his resolutions, ‘that would render my approaching the subject very probable, Miss Wade.’ ‘I hate him,’ she returned.
1	‘No, R. W. Lavinia has not known the trial that Bella has known.
1	At night, when the workpeople went away, the house was dreary and deserted again; and Florence, listening to their voices echoing through the hall and staircase as they departed, pictured to herself the cheerful homes to which the were returning, and the children who were waiting for them, and was glad to think that they were merry and well pleased to go.
1	"It's me," returns the old man of the house, whose breath is in his ear.
1	When they come to a certain spot before the mausoleum-door, Sir Leicester's accustomed horse stops of his own accord, and Sir Leicester, pulling off his hat, is still for a few moments before they ride away.
1	Maddening church bells of all degrees of dissonance, sharp and flat, cracked and clear, fast and slow, made the brick-and-mortar echoes hideous.
1	At all events his face was tied up in a black silk handkerchief, which, with his hat perched on the top of it, was far from improving his appearance.
1	‘Uriah!’ said I, as civilly as I could, after a silence.
1	‘Curious,’ said Mr. Pickwick, smacking his lips, ‘I hardly know, now.
1	'Well, you needn't be so cross,' said his companion.
1	Young women old in the vices of the commonest and worst life, were expected to profess themselves enthralled by the good child’s book, the Adventures of Little Margery, who resided in the village cottage by the mill; severely reproved and morally squashed the miller, when she was five and he was fifty; divided her porridge with singing birds; denied herself a new nankeen bonnet, on the ground that the turnips did not wear nankeen bonnets, neither did the sheep who ate them; who plaited straw and delivered the dreariest orations to all comers, at all sorts of unseasonable times.
1	Mr. Skimpole gently reasoned with him as he made a little drawing of his head on the fly-leaf of a book.
1	He told me, as he went out of the house, that the God of day had now gone down upon him--and I really thought his heart was broken and mine too.
1	My dear young men, be easy with me, if you please.
1	I don’t mean to say that I deserve to be the pride and delight of his life--you believe me, I know--but I am.
1	I must look in at Tellson's; so I will go there at once and come back presently.
1	I went into the out-house to look about me; and the very same lobsters, crabs, and crawfish possessed by the same desire to pinch the world in general, appeared to be in the same state of conglomeration in the same old corner.
1	It is a broadsword to an oyster-knife.
1	‘What, old Nobs!’ ejaculated the son.
1	I was so far from being warned off from Peggotty’s society, that, provided I was not in Mr. Murdstone’s, I was never sought out or inquired for.
1	"Quite so," says Mr. Tulkinghorn with a calm nod.
1	‘I knew you was a-going to say so.
1	No fiend in human form!’ ‘No, sir, certainly,’ Young John added with simplicity, ‘I should be very sorry if there was.’ ‘The sentiment,’ said Mr Rugg, ‘is what I should have expected from your known principles.
1	It’s a part of my character.
1	“Miss Manette--” “Is well,” said the Doctor, as he stopped short, “and your return will delight us all.
1	He invariably heard of Minnie from them, as telling them in her letters how happy she was, and how she loved her husband; but inseparable from that subject, he invariably saw the old cloud on Mr Meagles’s face.
1	“What is to be told to Ladybird?
1	It’s not much to bear.
1	Certainly not, my dear Miss Summerson, most assuredly not.
1	"Not much of a one, sir.
1	‘I must go,’ she said at last, rising as she spoke.
1	I meant to have given you five shillings this morning for a Christmas box, Sam.
1	‘Yes, sir,’ rejoined Mr. Weller.
1	The owners of such places as Chesney Wold," said Mr. Skimpole with his usual happy and easy air, "are public benefactors.
1	Have you had many brothers, Spirit?"
1	Mr Merdle ordered his carriage to be ready early in the morning that he might wait upon Mr Dorrit immediately after breakfast.
1	‘Think better of him than to suppose it.
1	I am VERY much obliged to Trimmers.’ Saying which, Mr. Cheeryble rubbed his hands with infinite delight, and Mr. Trimmers happening to pass the door that instant, on his way out, shot out after him and caught him by the hand.
1	That concerned myself; this concerns us all.’ ‘Us all!
1	Kit, however, fortunately for himself, was not learned enough or contemplative enough to be troubled with presages of evil afar off, and, having no mental spectacles to assist his vision in this respect, saw nothing but the dull house, which jarred uncomfortably upon his previous thoughts.
1	‘Very great indeed,’ said Mr Dombey.
1	Much better to think of dead than alive, Jenny!
1	It was a hot, wild night, and they were all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the lightning from the same place.
1	I tell you,’ returned Mr. Folair, waving his hand in deprecation of any further wrath; ‘I wasn’t in earnest.
1	‘Shakespeare dramatised stories which had previously appeared in print, it is true,’ observed Nicholas.
1	It’s Captain Boldwig’s land; but there’ll be nobody to interrupt us, and there’s a fine bit of turf there.’ ‘Very well,’ said old Wardle.
1	Mr. Fang sat behind a bar, at the upper end; and on one side the door was a sort of wooden pen in which poor little Oliver was already deposited; trembling very much at the awfulness of the scene.
1	You keep half an eye on the newspapers, and I shouldn't wonder if you was to read something about it before long, if you look sharp.
1	But if he had cut the end of his nose off, he would have put a piece of sticking-plaister over it, and been quite satisfied.
1	Little Mr. Chillip the Doctor, to whose good offices I was indebted in the very first chapter of this history, sat reading a newspaper in the shadow of an opposite corner.
1	From information I received (from a clerk in the same house) I took George into custody as having been seen hanging about there on the night, and at very nigh the time of the murder, also as having been overheard in high words with the deceased on former occasions--even threatening him, as the witness made out.
1	As I told him yes, he laid it on the table, and resting his head upon his hand, began.
1	Then why stop short, and not otherwise acknowledge it?’ ‘Is there no difference,’ asked Helena, with a little faltering in her manner; ‘between submission to a generous spirit, and submission to a base or trivial one?’ Before the worthy Minor Canon was quite ready with his argument in reference to this nice distinction, Neville struck in: ‘Help me to clear myself with Mr. Crisparkle, Helena.
1	‘Jupe sent his daughter out on an errand not an hour ago, and then was seen to slip out himself, with his hat over his eyes, and a bundle tied up in a handkerchief under his arm.
1	The servant-maids felt her inferiority, for they were better treated; free to come and go, and regarded in their stations with much more respect.
1	I’m sure I was not thinking of any reward, Sir.’ ‘You are a boy,’ said Mr Dombey, suddenly and almost fiercely; ‘and what you think of, or affect to think of, is of little consequence.
1	Florence shook her head, and sighed.
1	Miss Havisham?” “Which I say, sir,” replied Joe, with an air of legal formality, as if he were making his will, “Miss A., or otherways Havisham.
1	The thunder, which seemed in fact much nearer, and to shiver and break almost over their heads, having subsided, Monks, raising his face from the table, bent forward to listen to what the woman should say.
1	It was no other than Tommy Traddles who gave me this piece of intelligence.
1	"Not personally, Esther," said Miss Donny; "merely through his solicitors, Messrs. Kenge and Carboy, of London.
1	He was too weak; he was too good; he was a dem’d fine fellow, but he loved too strong; he could not bear her to be cross, and call him wicked names.
1	Shall we speak of the inspiration of a poet or a priest, and not of the heart impelled by love and self-devotion to the lowliest work in the lowliest way of life!
1	A few lawyers' clerks and others who know this suitor by sight linger on the chance of his furnishing some fun and enlivening the dismal weather a little.
1	He couldn't say how long he might be, having a case on.
1	“You left Paris yesterday, sir?” he said to Monseigneur, as he took his seat at table.
1	By your leave!’ said Riderhood, knuckling his forehead, with a chuckle and a leer.
1	His gorgeousness was not unmixed with dirt; and both in complexion and consistency he had suffered from the closeness of his pantry.
1	Shall I tell you what I think?
1	This announcement is received with acclamation; and Mrs Perch, projecting her soul into futurity, says, ‘girls,’ in Cook’s ear, in a solemn whisper.
1	Having by this time cried as much as I possibly could, I began to think it was of no use crying any more, especially as neither Roderick Random, nor that Captain in the Royal British Navy, had ever cried, that I could remember, in trying situations.
1	It ain’t because I’m a servant and you’re a master, that you’re to go and libel me.
1	‘It’s not for want of looking after jobs, I am sure,’ said Mrs Plornish, lifting up her eyebrows, and searching for a solution of the problem between the bars of the grate; ‘nor yet for want of working at them when they are to be got.
1	Neither of the three served or saved me.
1	The marine-store merchant holds the light, and the law-stationer conducts the search.
1	Then he stops, and with more of those inarticulate sounds, lifts up his eyes and seems to stare at something.
1	Advancing more and more into the shadow of this mournful place, its dark depressing influence stole upon their spirits, and filled them with a dismal gloom.
1	I’d die degraded, as I had lived.
1	‘That’s very true.’ ‘Instead of which,’ pursued Mr Vuffin, ‘if you was to advertise Shakspeare played entirely by wooden legs, it’s my belief you wouldn’t draw a sixpence.’ ‘I don’t suppose you would,’ said Short.
1	He appeared to have passed his life in always getting up into mountains and fighting somebody; and a bard whose name sounded like Crumlinwallinwer had sung his praises in a piece which was called, as nearly as I could catch it, Mewlinnwillinwodd.
1	"Now lookee here, George," said the man, turning quickly round upon him and tapping him on the breast with a large forefinger.
1	I spoke unkindly to him, and he cannot bear it from me.
1	The light porter placed the tea-tray on it, knuckling his forehead as a form of homage.
1	And I an't had much of the sov'ring neither," says Jo, with dirty tears, "fur I had to pay five bob, down in Tom-all-Alone's, afore they'd square it fur to give me change, and then a young man he thieved another five while I was asleep and another boy he thieved ninepence and the landlord he stood drains round with a lot more on it."
1	Is mine less hard to bear or is it harder to bear, when my whole living was in it and has been thus shamefully sucked away?"
1	A man may call his house an island if he likes; there’s no act of Parliament against that, I believe?’ ‘I believe not, sir,’ rejoined Nicholas.
1	Occasionally they came upon a cluster of poor cottages, some with a chair or low board put across the open door to keep the scrambling children from the road, others shut up close while all the family were working in the fields.
1	You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!” The Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the ground.
1	‘I am thinking how to do so,’ said brother Charles; sadly, as it seemed to his young friend, and with an expression allied to pain.
1	"But, my dear," she said, gaily, reaching another hand to put it upon mine.
1	He was so full of feeling too and had such a delicate sentiment for what was beautiful or tender that he could have won a heart by that alone.
1	Of her soon cheering up again, and our signing the register all round.
1	It was strange enough, in the silence of midnight, and the dead stillness that seemed to be created by the sudden and unexpected stoppage of the engine which had been clanking and blasting in our ears incessantly for so many days, to watch the look of blank astonishment expressed in every face: beginning with the officers, tracing it through all the passengers, and descending to the very stokers and furnacemen, who emerged from below, one by one, and clustered together in a smoky group about the hatchway of the engine-room, comparing notes in whispers.
1	Ay, stop him for God's sake, were it only in mercy!
1	We began to talk about my aunt’s losses, and I told them what I had tried to do that morning.
1	His intention was rapidly communicated.
1	He has never uttered her name, since.
1	‘Let’s get back to the dodgerest of the dodgers,’ said he.
1	‘“Pounds, shillings, and pence,” is my next note.
1	And he wears it, too, round his neck, I can tell you!
1	He looked out of the window--it was very dark.
1	‘Keep close to me all day.
1	The younger partner had, by this time, brought the business into sound trim; and the elder, left free to follow his own ingenious devices, had done much to enhance the character of the factory.
1	It shall make me better."
1	She, who so gloried in my fame, and so looked forward to its augmentation, well knew that I would labour on.
1	‘You ain’t poor, you know, Charley, as you pretend.
1	'That boy will be hung,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.
1	I had no gentler feeling towards anyone than towards the pretty creature who had been my playmate, and whom I have always been persuaded, and shall always be persuaded, to my dying day, I then devotedly loved.
1	Now, are you right there?"
1	The next stage of the proceedings was Mr Dombey’s sending his compliments to Mrs Dombey, with a correct statement of the time; and the next, the East India Director’s falling prostrate, in a conversational point of view, and as Mr Dombey was not the man to pick him up, staring at the fire until rescue appeared in the shape of Mrs Skewton; whom the director, as a pleasant start in life for the evening, mistook for Mrs Dombey, and greeted with enthusiasm.
1	Not too partial, Alfred,’ urged the lady, tenderly moved; ‘never say that.’ ‘My child, your favourable opinion, then, of your husband--you don’t object to that phrase, darling?’ ‘How can I, Alfred?’ ‘Your favourable opinion then, my Precious, does less than justice to Mr Boffin, and more than justice to me.’ ‘To the first charge, Alfred, I plead guilty.
1	The little room in which they had so often sat long after it was dark, figuring such happy futures; Kate’s cheerful voice and merry laugh; how, if she were from home, they used to sit and watch for her return scarcely breaking silence but to say how dull it seemed without her; the glee with which poor Smike would start from the darkened corner where he used to sit, and hurry to admit her, and the tears they often saw upon his face, half wondering to see them too, and he so pleased and happy; every little incident, and even slight words and looks of those old days little heeded then, but well remembered when busy cares and trials were quite forgotten, came fresh and thick before him many and many a time, and, rustling above the dusty growth of years, came back green boughs of yesterday.
1	From out the most spare and hungry room in all this spare and hungry house there came, one morning, the tremulous tones of old Gride’s voice, as it feebly chirruped forth the fag end of some forgotten song, of which the burden ran:      Ta--ran--tan--too,      Throw the old shoe,      And may the wedding be lucky!
1	‘If you could make the Marchioness yonder, a Marchioness, in real, sober earnest,’ returned Dick, ‘I’d thank you to get it done off-hand.
1	My Lady reclines in her chair composedly, though with a trifle less of graceful ease than usual perhaps, and never falters in her steady gaze.
1	‘I mean I’ll tell you nothing.’ Mr Lammle sparkled at him, but frowned at him too.
1	She was right touching his destination.
1	What are you hooroaring at?
1	I am tempted now to go away.
1	‘Thank you, I would rather not,’ replied that gentleman.
1	I was going to remonstrate.
1	At first, Fanny took this ill, too; protesting to her looking-glass, that of all the trying sisters a girl could have, she did think the most trying sister was a flat sister.
1	The earth shook when he walked--he was so very stout.
1	‘I’ll step out by and by, Mary.
1	“But when it is ready, it takes place, and grinds to pieces everything before it.
1	"Volumnia," remonstrates Sir Leicester with his utmost severity.
1	Indeed, it was not difficult to see, that the majority of the company preyed upon the unfortunate young lord, who, weak and silly as he was, appeared by far the least vicious of the party.
1	‘Here I am.’ ‘Here you are, sir,’ assented Mr Venus.
1	‘One of them, I know, or you wouldn’t talk about them.’ ‘He suspects even me!’ cried old Arthur, holding up his hands.
1	The Night Shadows A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other.
1	I thought how the same feeling had come back when I saw a face looking at me, and a hand waving to me from a stage-coach window; and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like lightning, when I had passed in a carriage--not alone--through a sudden glare of light in a dark street.
1	“I am saying nothing.” “Well, then; don't meditate nothing.
1	I don’t say it to flatter you, gentlemen, but there are not five other men in the world, that I’d have come out of that court for, to-day.’ ‘So busy, eh?’ said Sam.
1	For they are the public chroniclers of such inquiries by the line; and he is not superior to the universal human infirmity, but hopes to read in print what "Mooney, the active and intelligent beadle of the district," said and did and even aspires to see the name of Mooney as familiarly and patronizingly mentioned as the name of the hangman is, according to the latest examples.
1	Certain guttural sounds, too, which from time to time ascended through the floor of the caravan, and a rustling of straw in the same direction, apprised her that the driver was couched upon the ground beneath, and gave her an additional feeling of security.
1	At eight o’clock or so, the gong sounded again for prayers in the dining-room, where the butler afterwards presided over a side-table, on which bread and cheese and beer were spread for such young gentlemen as desired to partake of those refreshments.
1	"Then we may dismiss him for the present.
1	The time and place awoke reflection, and she thought with a quiet hope--less hope, perhaps, than resignation--on the past, and present, and what was yet before her.
1	The old clergyman was present.
1	At least you shall not be wronged.
1	Sometimes she would hear a newspaper read out, and would learn how the Registrar General cast up the units that had within the last week died of want and of exposure to the weather: for which that Recording Angel seemed to have a regular fixed place in his sum, as if they were its halfpence.
1	He must be very bad there, poor gentleman!’ Miss Tox’s sympathy is such that she can scarcely speak.
1	Another surgeon then coming in, the two exchanged a whisper, and the second took the hand.
1	In fact, a man on horseback galloped down, before the passengers were well collected together; and a careful investigation being instituted, it appeared that the lady inside had broken her lamp, and the gentleman his head; that the two front outsides had escaped with black eyes; the box with a bloody nose; the coachman with a contusion on the temple; Mr. Squeers with a portmanteau bruise on his back; and the remaining passengers without any injury at all--thanks to the softness of the snow-drift in which they had been overturned.
1	It was with some faint reference in his own mind to this disorder, though he would by no means admit it, even to himself, that Nicholas had already carried his faithful companion to a physician of great repute.
1	Receive me as your domestic, and I will serve you well.
1	Some extraordinary and wonderful phenomenon of nature, which no philosopher had ever seen before; something which it had been reserved for him alone to discover, and which he should immortalise his name by chronicling for the benefit of posterity.
1	So glad you came that day!
1	‘The smallest encouragement thankfully received.
1	Whisper.’ Mr Wegg whispered, ‘Boffin’s Bower.’ ‘Eddard!
1	‘Do you propose calling witnesses?’ ‘No.’ The smile on the Serjeant’s countenance became more defined; he rocked his leg with increased violence; and, throwing himself back in his easy- chair, coughed dubiously.
1	When I can’t meet his daughter, I go where I am likely to meet him.
1	I looked at those hands, I looked at those eyes, I looked at that flowing hair; and I compared them with other hands, other eyes, other hair, that I knew of, and with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband and a stormy life.
1	"--That the friend with whom he had formerly been staying there was Mr.
1	On this man, with his moustache going up and his nose coming down in that most evil of smiles, and with his surface eyes looking as if they belonged to his dyed hair, and had had their natural power of reflecting light stopped by some similar process, Nature, always true, and never working in vain, had set the mark, Beware!
1	I don’t know,’ said the jolly old gentleman; ‘all very natural, I dare say--nothing unusual.
1	I determined to ask Joe why he had ever taught me to call those picture-cards Jacks, which ought to be called knaves.
1	I told him all about it and how her first entreaties had referred to his forgiveness.
1	An undeniable boy for a pupil-teacher; an undeniable boy to do credit to the master who should bring him on.
1	‘What!’ cried the old woman, her nodding head bridling with a ghastly vanity.
1	I SAID hope, I think!
1	My anything; pet--secretary--messenger--I don't know what."
1	On the contrary, I saw him next moment, once more holding out both his hands to me.
1	Again he paused near the sisters’ house, and again he entered by the postern.
1	‘That is to say, is it, Pussy, that we are both resigned?’ She nods her head again, and after a short silence, quaintly bursts out with: ‘You know we must be married, and married from here, Eddy, or the poor girls will be so dreadfully disappointed!’ For the moment there is more of compassion, both for her and for himself, in her affianced husband’s face, than there is of love.
1	The captain being gone, we compose ourselves to read, if the place be light enough; and if not, we doze and talk alternately.
1	‘Not in intention--no no,’ said he.
1	Gentlemen, we will resume our studies on the twenty-fifth of next month, under the auspices of Mr Feeder, B.A.’ At this (which Doctor Blimber had previously called upon all the parents, and urbanely explained), the young gentlemen cheered; and Mr Tozer, on behalf of the rest, instantly presented the Doctor with a silver inkstand, in a speech containing very little of the mother-tongue, but fifteen quotations from the Latin, and seven from the Greek, which moved the younger of the young gentlemen to discontent and envy: they remarking, ‘Oh, ah.
1	I have never been in this house before; and, to speak my mind, sir, I don’t feel at home or easy in it, and have no wish ever to be here again.
1	This done, they withdrew; shortly afterwards, Tim Linkinwater’s sister withdrew; in reasonable time after that, the sitting was broken up for tea and coffee, and a round game of cards.
1	Mr. Skimpole, lying on the sofa in his room, playing the flute a little, was enchanted to see me.
1	The men were very ill-looking.
1	‘Edmund,’ returned his wife, ‘if you have nothing more becoming to do than to attempt to insult the woman who has honoured you with her hand, when she finds herself in adversity, I think _you_ had better go to bed!’ Mr Sparkler was much afflicted by the charge, and offered a most tender and earnest apology.
1	A man is perpetually eating.’ Being a little embarrassed at first, and feeling much too young to preside, I made Steerforth take the head of the table when dinner was announced, and seated myself opposite to him.
1	I says to myself, 'If I ain't a gentleman, nor yet ain't got no learning, I'm the owner of such.
1	The amiable old gentleman, it seemed, had intended to leave the whole to the Royal Humane Society, and had indeed executed a will to that effect; but the Institution, having been unfortunate enough, a few months before, to save the life of a poor relation to whom he paid a weekly allowance of three shillings and sixpence, he had, in a fit of very natural exasperation, revoked the bequest in a codicil, and left it all to Mr. Godfrey Nickleby; with a special mention of his indignation, not only against the society for saving the poor relation’s life, but against the poor relation also, for allowing himself to be saved.
1	Am I to call in any assistance, or is the trick done?"
1	He had seen it, with the expression of last night, timidly pleading to him.
1	It’s quite private.’ ‘Uncle Sol!’ faltered Walter.
1	But what was that--that old gray head that rose above the water’s surface, and with looks of agony, and screams for aid, buffeted with the waves!
1	And he and Rokesmith stood together, looking down with compassion on him.
1	‘There is the inexpiable offence against my adoration of you.
1	He thrust his head out of the coach window at intervals, and bawled out to know why they didn’t go faster.
1	Because that Philanthropist had expressly declared: ‘I owe it to my fellow-creatures that he should be, in the words of BENTHAM, where he is the cause of the greatest danger to the smallest number.’ These dropping shots from the blunderbusses of blunderheadedness might not have hit him in a vital place.
1	He knocked softly, with his hook, at Florence’s door, twice or thrice; but, receiving no answer, ventured first to peep in, and then to enter: emboldened to take the latter step, perhaps, by the familiar recognition of Diogenes, who, stretched upon the ground by the side of her couch, wagged his tail, and winked his eyes at the Captain, without being at the trouble of getting up.
1	I hope she is in no affliction?
1	My Lady, do you object to the twilight?"
1	“Father,” said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to keep at arm's length and to have the stool well between them: “what's a Resurrection-Man?” Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, “How should I know?” “I thought you knowed everything, father,” said the artless boy.
1	Thus it had come to pass, that Tellson's was the triumphant perfection of inconvenience.
1	Defarge had but sprung over a railing and a table, and folded the miserable wretch in a deadly embrace--Madame Defarge had but followed and turned her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied--The Vengeance and Jacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men at the windows had not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey from their high perches--when the cry seemed to go up, all over the city, “Bring him out!
1	His mouth was such a post-office of a mouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling.
1	I should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now.
1	There’s nothing I should like better, but I must remain with these two fellows.
1	‘Three ten and one ten is five.
1	You're in the habit of shaking hands?” I was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the London fashion, but said yes.
1	‘There was, further, Miss Elizabeth, Master George, Aunt Jane, and Uncle Parker.
1	‘Come nearer here, my dear Miss!
1	I observed Miss Spenlow and David Copperfield, when they first met; and the impression made upon me then was not agreeable.
1	All this time, the two boys followed him closely about: getting out of his sight, so nimbly, every time he turned round, that it was impossible to follow their motions.
1	‘And having such a knowledge of our own umbleness, we must really take care that we’re not pushed to the wall by them as isn’t umble.
1	Last night, on being childishly solicited for twopence, to buy ‘lemon-stunners’--a local sweetmeat--he presented an oyster-knife at the twins!
1	This is the way in which Our John has come to find no pleasure but in taking cold among the linen, and in showing in that yard, as in that yard I have myself shown you, a broken-down ruin that goes home to his mother’s heart!’ Here the good woman pointed to the little window, whence her son might be seen sitting disconsolate in the tuneless groves; and again shook her head and wiped her eyes, and besought him, for the united sakes of both the young people, to exercise his influence towards the bright reversal of these dismal events.
1	I am aware of that; and that’s the reason why I insist upon it, that there shan’t be a word about it in his Memorial.’ ‘Is it a Memorial about his own history that he is writing, aunt?’ ‘Yes, child,’ said my aunt, rubbing her nose again.
1	Shut your eyes, sir, and let me take hold of your chin.
1	‘He is a very nice gentleman, Sir,’ said Kit, ‘and that’s all I know about him.’ Mr Chuckster waxed wroth at this answer, and without applying the remark to any particular case, mentioned, as a general truth, that it was expedient to break the heads of Snobs, and to tweak their noses.
1	The Phantom glided on into a street.
1	‘Can you come this evening?’ ‘I’ll get into the clothes this minute, if they’re here,’ said Sam, with great alacrity.
1	But, he had to be washed and tended, and remedies were applied, and though those offices were far, far more skilfully and lightly done than ever anything had been done for him in his little life, so rough and short, they would have hurt and tired him but for an amazing circumstance which laid hold of his attention.
1	‘Day arter to-morrow, governor.’ ‘Not sooner?’ ‘Not a inch sooner, governor.’ On both sides, importance seemed attached to this question of relief.
1	He led them into a stone kitchen, fitted with coppers for dressing the prison food, and pointed to a door.
1	‘That this Association cordially recognises the principle of every member of the Corresponding Society defraying his own travelling expenses; and that it sees no objection whatever to the members of the said society pursuing their inquiries for any length of time they please, upon the same terms.
1	He was Helena’s unfortunate brother, to her, and nothing more.
1	Then he asked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums, and how we had gone together to have me bound apprentice, and, in effect, how he had ever been my favorite fancy and my chosen friend?
1	Might I ask you why he made it?’ Rachael burst into tears.
1	This led on to many interchanges of endearment and enjoyment on all sides, in the midst of which the Inexhaustible being observed staring, in a most imbecile manner, on Mrs Boffin’s breast, was pronounced to be supernaturally intelligent as to the whole transaction, and was made to declare to the ladies and gemplemorums, with a wave of the speckled fist (with difficulty detached from an exceedingly short waist), ‘I have already informed my venerable Ma that I know all about it!’ Then, said John Harmon, would Mrs John Harmon come and see her house?
1	Dombey, may the present moment be the least unhappy of our lives.
1	"Here's something to eat, poor boy," says Guster.
1	She falls from the lowermost stair, and is swallowed up in the gulf.
1	He does not turn back, but puts up his horse (and is much disposed to groom him too) at a public-house where some of Rouncewell's hands are dining, as the ostler tells him.
1	One might infer from Judy's appearance that her business rather lay with the thorns than the flowers, but she has in her time been apprenticed to the art and mystery of artificial flower-making.
1	The disregarded parrot only was in action.
1	‘Here is Mr Clennam,’ said Miss Wade; ‘not come for you; he has given you up,--I suppose you have, by this time?’ ‘Having no authority, or influence--yes,’ assented Clennam.
1	I hope it’s not anything of a very disagreeable nature, though?’ ‘If I thought it so, I should choose some better time for communicating it,’ replied the Notary.
1	‘You run about the brink, and run across it, in this uncertain light, on a few inches width of rotten wood,’ said he.
1	We dined soon after I awoke, off a roast fowl and a pudding; I sitting at table, not unlike a trussed bird myself, and moving my arms with considerable difficulty.
1	Wery well, I’m agreeable: I can’t say no fairer than that, can I, sir?’ (Mr. Pickwick smiled.)
1	After overhearing this dialogue, I should assuredly have got down and been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway, but for feeling certain that the man had no suspicion of my identity.
1	I am now in a condition to show, by--HEEP’S--false books, and--HEEP’S--real memoranda, beginning with the partially destroyed pocket-book (which I was unable to comprehend, at the time of its accidental discovery by Mrs. Micawber, on our taking possession of our present abode, in the locker or bin devoted to the reception of the ashes calcined on our domestic hearth), that the weaknesses, the faults, the very virtues, the parental affections, and the sense of honour, of the unhappy Mr. W. have been for years acted on by, and warped to the base purposes of--HEEP.
1	'I am,' repeated the Dodger.
1	The people immediately behind Madame Defarge, explaining the cause of her satisfaction to those behind them, and those again explaining to others, and those to others, the neighbouring streets resounded with the clapping of hands.
1	Mr. Jasper, still walking in the centre, hand to shoulder on either side, beautifully turns the Refrain of a drinking song, and they all go up to his rooms.
1	There was a small stove at that corner of the room which was nearest to the master’s desk, and by it Nicholas sat down, so depressed and self-degraded by the consciousness of his position, that if death could have come upon him at that time, he would have been almost happy to meet it.
1	I am sure you will deserve to be happy, and you will be, John.’ As she held out her hand to him with these words, the heart that was under the waistcoat of sprigs--mere slop-work, if the truth must be known--swelled to the size of the heart of a gentleman; and the poor common little fellow, having no room to hold it, burst into tears.
1	That's the difference between the property and the owner, don't you see?” I invited Wemmick to come upstairs, and refresh himself with a glass of grog before walking to Walworth.
1	‘Surely that must content you!
1	We do our best to polish--polish--polish!"
1	At that point the object of his affections shut him up like a box with a spring lid, and sent him away.
1	I should say he knew nothing about her and had never seen her, so HE can give me no information.
1	‘So like as to be almost a caricature?--Mr Twemlow, it is impossible to tell you what the struggle in my mind has been, before I could bring myself to speak to you as I do now.
1	She does her best to destroy my fortunes and her own, and she won’t reproach me!
1	Rattle me out of bed early, set me going, give me as short a time as you like to bolt my meals in, and keep me at it.
1	"I came to take these babies down to my room for an hour," he said, going to them again, "and let them play about.
1	How do you do, Sir?’ This salutation was addressed to Mr Chuckster, who, with his hat extremely on one side, and his hair a long way beyond it, came swaggering up the walk.
1	And here’s thanking of ‘em for all their goodness as is so constancy a diffusing of itself over everywhere, and wishing they may live long and die happy!’ When the foregoing speech was over--and it might have been much more elegant and much less to the purpose--the whole body of subordinates under command of the apoplectic butler gave three soft cheers; which, to that gentleman’s great indignation, were not very regular, inasmuch as the women persisted in giving an immense number of little shrill hurrahs among themselves, in utter disregard of the time.
1	Two gaolers, who had been standing there, went out, and the prisoner was brought in, and put to the bar.
1	How often have I inquired for you, and been told that I should hear before long!’ ‘I know, I know!’ returned Newman.
1	"I inquired because, coming from Lincolnshire, I of course have not yet been in town, and I thought some letters might have been sent down here.
1	There had been times when, if he had been a sultan, and his grand vizier had said one morning, "What does the Commander of the Faithful require at the hands of his slave?"
1	You do look uncommon well, to be sure.’ Mr. Pickwick acknowledged the compliment, and cordially shook hands with the stout gentleman in the top-boots.
1	Here and there an old tub was put to catch the droppings of rain-water from a roof, or they were banked up with mud into a little pond like a large dirt-pie.
1	The door was open, and the hall was blocked up by a grand piano, a harp, and several other musical instruments in cases, all in progress of removal, and all looking rakish in the daylight.
1	‘That’s it.’ ‘What’s it?’ said Nicholas.
1	He had left her, when only eighteen; robbed her of jewels and money; gambled, squandered, forged, and fled to London:  where for two years he had associated with the lowest outcasts.
1	Then he opened the paper, and folded it so as to get the police reports outwards; and this being a vexatious and difficult thing to do, when there is any wind stirring, he took another draught of the beer when he had accomplished it.
1	‘Shall we join company in the avenue of trees which leads from Petersham to Ham House, and settle the exact spot when we arrive there?’ said Mr Westwood.
1	We took our leave early, and left together.
1	asked the doctor, following the young lady to the sideboard.
1	Mr. Crackit, apparently somewhat ashamed at being found relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and mental endowments, yawned, and inquiring after Sikes, took up his hat to go.
1	He wandered over them again.
1	As we turned to ascend the last flight of stairs between us and the roof, we caught a full view of this figure pausing for a moment, at a door.
1	Glad to see you, Sir.’ ‘Thank’ee.’ Mr. Winkle emptied his glass, and placed the bottle on the coach-box, by his side.
1	Here's her allowance of bread, and here's her slice of cheese, and here's her rum,--which I drink.
1	Eh?’ said Pancks as he smoked.
1	‘So all I’ve come about, is jest this here,’ said Sam, disregarding the interruption; ‘first, to give my governor’s notice--there it is.
1	I will address your mother, sir, who knows the world.’ ‘Ah!
1	It was not long before his body was recognised by a stranger, who chanced to visit that hospital in Paris where the drowned are laid out to be owned; despite the bruises and disfigurements which were said to have been occasioned by some previous scuffle.
1	Mr. Bucket asks, conveying the expression of an artist into the turn of his eye and head.
1	She saw she had no father upon earth, and ran out, orphaned, from his house.
1	“Of Richmond, gentlemen,” said Drummle, putting me out of the question, “and a peerless beauty.” Much he knew about peerless beauties, a mean, miserable idiot!
1	They were ruined, when they were required to send labouring children to school; they were ruined when inspectors were appointed to look into their works; they were ruined, when such inspectors considered it doubtful whether they were quite justified in chopping people up with their machinery; they were utterly undone, when it was hinted that perhaps they need not always make quite so much smoke.
1	And very well indeed you are looking, Mrs.
1	So, to keep up their good-humour, they stopped at the first roadside tavern they came to, and ordered a glass of brandy-and-water all round, with a magnum of extra strength for Mr. Samuel Weller.
1	‘If Joe Bagstock were a younger man, there’s not a woman in the world whom he’d prefer for Mrs Bagstock to that woman.
1	‘Please!’ ‘He’s enough to break his mother’s heart, is this boy,’ said Miss Wren, half appealing to Eugene.
1	‘And your vocation, Gowan, may really demand this suit and service.
1	“I have not heard the particulars of my sister's death, Biddy.” “They are very slight, poor thing.
1	Let me make you a cup of tea,’ said Mrs Plornish, ‘if you’d condescend to take such a thing in the cottage; and many thanks to you, too, I am sure, for bearing us in mind so kindly.’ Mr Plornish deeming it incumbent on him, as host, to add his personal acknowledgments, tendered them in the form which always expressed his highest ideal of a combination of ceremony with sincerity.
1	‘Then let me tell him once for all, through you, that I will come into and go out of this place as often as I like, so long as he keeps Nell here; and that if he wants to be quit of me, he must first be quit of her.
1	My name is Toots,--Mister Toots.’ The Captain remembered to have seen this young gentleman at the wedding, and made him a bow.
1	Walter, too, poor wandering shipwrecked boy, oh, where is he?
1	I was very hot indeed upon Old Orlick's daring to admire her; as hot as if it were an outrage on myself.
1	“Very well; then you may go.
1	Thou knowest who said, “Let him who is without sin among you cast the first stone at her!”  There have been plenty to do that.
1	Bless you, my dear Sir, such a thing was never heard of, without a consultation fee being previously paid, and a consultation fixed.
1	But since you have been lying here--not near dead--nothing like it--numbers of children and young people, blooming women, strong men, and what not, have been cut down and carried; and still here are you, you see, not much changed after all.
1	Mr. Weller, by his master’s permission, retired to spend the evening in his own way; and was shortly afterwards elected, by the unanimous voice of the assembled company, into the taproom chair, in which honourable post he acquitted himself so much to the satisfaction of the gentlemen-frequenters, that their roars of laughter and approbation penetrated to Mr. Pickwick’s bedroom, and shortened the term of his natural rest by at least three hours.
1	It is not necessarily a lengthened preparation, being limited to the setting forth of very simple breakfast requisites for two and the broiling of a rasher of bacon at the fire in the rusty grate; but as Phil has to sidle round a considerable part of the gallery for every object he wants, and never brings two objects at once, it takes time under the circumstances.
1	‘My secret was out; and my only struggle now was for liberty and freedom.
1	Mr Doyce, still looking at the flame of his candle, slowly resumed: ‘The truth is, he has twice taken his daughter abroad in the hope of separating her from Mr Gowan.
1	Meanwhile terms were ratified and agreed upon between Mrs Chick and Richards, with the assistance of Miss Tox; and Richards being with much ceremony invested with the Dombey baby, as if it were an Order, resigned her own, with many tears and kisses, to Jemima.
1	As the real state of the case dawned upon Mr. Winkle’s mind, he looked very terrible, and said he was perfectly satisfied; but at the same time, said so with an air that left Mr. Dowler no alternative but to infer that if he had not been, something most horrible and destructive must inevitably have occurred.
1	“It is the law.” “It's hard in the law to spile a man, I think.
1	No odious brutes must proach me till I’ve shaken off this numbness;’ and in a grisly resumption of her coquettish ways, she made a dab at the Major with her fan, but overset Mr Dombey’s breakfast cup instead, which was in quite a different direction.
1	I can see too well that I am not high in the old lady’s opinion, and it is easy to understand what an irksome clog I must be upon the hospitalities of her orderly house—especially at this time of year—when I must be kept asunder from this person, and there is such a reason for my not being brought into contact with that person, and an unfavourable reputation has preceded me with such another person; and so on.
1	‘Lodgings; up near Mr Dombey’s,’ returned Rob.
1	A broad ray of light fell into the garret, and showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap, pausing in his labour.
1	‘Is there ony genelmen there as can len’ a hond here?
1	Much comforted by this assurance, Brittles opened the door to its full width, and confronted a portly man in a great-coat; who walked in, without saying anything more, and wiped his shoes on the mat, as coolly as if he lived there.
1	It is a thriving place, pleasantly situated--streams and streets, town and country, mill and moor--and seems to present an opening for such a man.
1	She therefore took her grandfather aside, and telling him that she had still enough left to defray the cost of their lodging, proposed that they should stay there for the night.
1	I have no doubt the mother is a most genteel and elegant creature, and I have no right whatever to dispute the policy of her living with them: which is Paul’s affair, not mine--and as to Paul’s choice, herself, I have only seen her picture yet, but that is beautiful indeed.
1	The door opened, and a group of little children bounded out, shouting and romping.
1	They were two men who were seated in easy attitudes upon the grass, and so busily engaged as to be at first unconscious of intruders.
1	Then I don’t know what it is, I am sure.’ ‘What should you say to a young lady from London?’ inquired Mr. Crummles.
1	Whenever the sound reached his ears, he would immediately lay down his pen and fall to rubbing his hands and exhibiting the greatest glee.
1	The cherub not presuming to address so tremendous an object, transacted her supper through the agency of a third person, as ‘Mutton to your Ma, Bella, my dear’; and ‘Lavvy, I dare say your Ma would take some lettuce if you were to put it on her plate.’ Mrs Wilfer’s manner of receiving those viands was marked by petrified absence of mind; in which state, likewise, she partook of them, occasionally laying down her knife and fork, as saying within her own spirit, ‘What is this I am doing?’ and glaring at one or other of the party, as if in indignant search of information.
1	If he had been simply loving, he would have done Little Dorrit more good; but she accepted him as he was--when had she not accepted him as he was!--and made the most and best of him.
1	'Upon his throat:  so high that you can see a part of it below his neckerchief when he turns his face:  there is--' 'A broad red mark, like a burn or scald?'
1	On the other hand, Trabb's boy might worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things; or, reckless and desperate wretch as I knew he could be, might hoot him in the High Street.
1	You are familiar to me in these strange circumstances, very familiar."
1	Put on these clothes of mine.
1	There were three or four of us, counting me.
1	It bore the words in the Doctor's writing:     “Charles is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet.
1	"I can guarantee that there is no secrecy in it.
1	‘One night, after a day’s sport in which he had outdone Nimrod or Gillingwater, and slaughtered “another fine bear,” and brought him home in triumph, the Baron Von Koeldwethout sat moodily at the head of his table, eyeing the smoky roof of the hall with a discontented aspect.
1	She lay bereft of animation for hours; and when life, look, and speech returned, her senses had deserted her, and she raved wildly and furiously.
1	His eminently practical friend, on seeing him, stopped also, and gave Louisa a reproachful look that plainly said, ‘Behold your Bounderby!’ ‘Well!’ blustered Mr. Bounderby, ‘what’s the matter?
1	‘Lift him up,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	"But he might, you know.
1	Here he remained, with his head bowed upon his breast for some time, and then suddenly raising it, said, ‘Once, and once for all, have you brought me any money?’ ‘No!’ returned Quilp.
1	You may or you may not be aware (for perhaps you have not been much in the audience), that Jupe has missed his tip very often, lately.’ ‘Has—what has he missed?’ asked Mr. Gradgrind, glancing at the potent Bounderby for assistance.
1	"She died a woman," said the Ghost, "and had, as I think, children."
1	I know his ways, and the likely nooks he favours.
1	It fell to Clennam now, to be not quite certain how to answer.
1	Of my friend Heep,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘who is a man of remarkable shrewdness, I desire to speak with all possible respect.
1	But she neither asked me where I had been, nor why I had kept her waiting; and there was a bright flush upon her face, as though something had happened to delight her.
1	He held a pair of bellows upon his knee, with which he had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it into more cheerful action; but he had fallen into deep thought; and with his arms folded on them, and his chin resting on his thumbs, fixed his eyes, abstractedly, on the rusty bars.
1	From the dim doorway of Cosy, within which Bella and her husband stood, they could see a comfortable little party of three persons sitting at supper in the bar, and could hear everything that was said.
1	On the morrow, in the dusk of evening, Mr. Weevle modestly appears at Krook's, by no means incommoded with luggage, and establishes himself in his new lodging, where the two eyes in the shutters stare at him in his sleep, as if they were full of wonder.
1	Miss Berry naturally asked why not?
1	Mistress Affery went down to let him in, and he said on entering, ‘Affery, I am glad it’s you.
1	You say the suit is changing me; John Jarndyce says it changes, has changed, and will change everybody who has any share in it.
1	I am very glad to be so.
1	Sir, that class of practitioners would be swept from the face of the earth.
1	Of my father.” Rendered in a manner desperate, by her state and by the beckoning of their conductor, he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his shoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into the room.
1	Good night, Marchioness!’ On awaking in the morning, Richard Swiveller became conscious, by slow degrees, of whispering voices in his room.
1	‘I so hate him for saying it!’ ‘For saying what, my dear?’ laughed Mrs Lammle.
1	--‘But I object to it, and that’s enough.
1	‘The gentleman took my card.
1	Will you please come to the understanding that there shall be another interview on the subject?’ ‘With Charley, Mr Headstone?’ ‘With--well,’ he answered, breaking off, ‘yes!
1	Then he slowly released his left hand from its pocket, and made that bush of his whiskers, still contemplating him in silence.
1	But Mr. Weller’s anger quickly gave way to curiosity when the procession turned down the identical courtyard in which he had met with the runaway Job Trotter; and curiosity was exchanged for a feeling of the most gleeful astonishment, when the all-important Mr. Grummer, commanding the sedan-bearers to halt, advanced with dignified and portentous steps to the very green gate from which Job Trotter had emerged, and gave a mighty pull at the bell-handle which hung at the side thereof.
1	Having given in a hearty shake, he retired, growling, under a form; just escaping the pewter measure which Mr. Sikes levelled at his head.
1	Young men passed above his head, and rose and rose; but he was always at the bottom.
1	This old lady had a grandson who was a sailor, and I wrote a letter to him for her and drew at the top of it the chimney-corner in which she had brought him up and where his old stool yet occupied its old place.
1	That may be eccentricity, or he may be proud of his legs.
1	The venerable baron caught his child to his arms, and shed a wink of joy.
1	'I don't know what that means,' replied Oliver.
1	Very little life was to be seen on either bank, windows and doors were shut, and the staring black and white letters upon wharves and warehouses ‘looked,’ said Eugene to Mortimer, ‘like inscriptions over the graves of dead businesses.’ As they glided slowly on, keeping under the shore and sneaking in and out among the shipping by back-alleys of water, in a pilfering way that seemed to be their boatman’s normal manner of progression, all the objects among which they crept were so huge in contrast with their wretched boat, as to threaten to crush it.
1	He had changed, himself, since then.
1	But my poor young cousins!"
1	But they were scarcely less beautiful in their slow decline, than they had been in their prime; for nature gives to every time and season some beauties of its own; and from morning to night, as from the cradle to the grave, is but a succession of changes so gentle and easy, that we can scarcely mark their progress.
1	To consider, wrong as he was, that he could care so much for her, and that she had the power to move him so!
1	‘At last I got tired of rendering myself unpleasant and making everybody miserable; so I hired a carriage at Muggleton, and, putting my own horses in it, came up to town, under pretence of bringing Emily to see Arabella.’ ‘Miss Wardle is with you, then?’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	Do you know whether they've sold the prize Turkey that was hanging up there?--Not the little prize Turkey: the big one?"
1	So long as this ’ouse is known indefinite as Billickin’s, and so long as it is a doubt with the riff-raff where Billickin may be hidin’, near the street-door or down the airy, and what his weight and size, so long I feel safe.
1	There were no shortcomings anywhere, in anything but money.
1	‘Good!’ said Mr Meagles, cheerily.
1	For instance, it's your object to take care of number one--meaning yourself.'
1	‘Because I have no other resting-place,’ was the reply.
1	But who else was there?” “Who else?” “It is the strangest thing,” said Mr. Wopsle, drifting into his lost look again; “and yet I could swear to him.” Becoming alarmed, I entreated Mr. Wopsle to explain his meaning.
1	'It is useless,' said the gentleman, with a sigh.
1	Our little room was like a ship's cabin, and that delighted Charley very much.
1	The peaceful serenity of the hour and place, having no reproaches or evil intentions within her breast to contend against, sank healingly into its depths.
1	asked Fagin, hesitating as though he feared to vex the other man by being too sanguine.
1	To show no sympathy with so much endeavour, and so much disappointment, would have been to fail in what Clennam regarded as among the implied obligations of his partnership.
1	Mr. Winkle had not yet sufficiently recovered the recollection of his evidence at the trial, to make any observation on any subject, so Mr. Pickwick paused in vain.
1	Nothing to change the brooding mind, or raise it up.
1	“Well,” retorted Drummle; “he'll be paid.” “I don't mean to imply that he won't,” said I, “but it might make you hold your tongue about us and our money, I should think.” “You should think!” retorted Drummle.
1	Florence hardly dared to raise her eyes, lest they should reveal the traces of tears; far less dared to speak; and Edith never uttered one word, unless in answer to a question.
1	He was stopped by his mouth being full of blood, and Allan had brought him home.
1	Though he is not acquainted with the name, I can help you to it.
1	She knew (she said) how such a nature as mine would turn affliction to good.
1	The old man, never bidden to sit down, stood with an earnest hand laid on the back of the young man’s easy chair.
1	In this state of mind, Captain Cuttle having the Grinder before the court, and no one else, found it a great relief to decide, generally, that he was an object of suspicion: which the Captain so clearly expressed in his visage, that Rob remonstrated.
1	Added to that, he had a blockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness, which sometimes did him good service,--almost taking the place of concentration and determined purpose.
1	He has shown nothing but his shell.
1	I then caused him to make the letters _bread_, and in an instant Laura went and brought him a piece: he smelled at it; put it to his lips; cocked up his head with a most knowing look; seemed to reflect a moment; and then laughed outright, as much as to say, “Aha!
1	What shall I do!’ The fountains of her heart were opened; the child, overpowered by the weight of her sorrows and anxieties, by the first confidence she had ever shown, and the sympathy with which her little tale had been received, hid her face in the arms of her helpless friend, and burst into a passion of tears.
1	We had not driven very far from our lodgings when we stopped in a by-street at a public-looking place lighted up with gas.
1	‘Light-headed, aunt!’ I could only repeat this daring speculation with the same kind of feeling with which I had repeated the preceding question.
1	'Not now,' said the Jew, turning softly away.
1	You’re very welcome I’m sure.--Mr Richard, sir--’ Dick, who had by this time reached the door, turned round.
1	On coming back with the wine in his hand, he found that she had placed her father in his easy chair, and had loosened his shirt and neckcloth.
1	“When did you come to town, Mr. Gargery?” “Were it yesterday afternoon?” said Joe, after coughing behind his hand, as if he had had time to catch the whooping-cough since he came.
1	But what I thay, Thquire, ith, that good tempered or bad tempered, I never did a horthe a injury yet, no more than thwearing at him went, and that I don’t expect I thall begin otherwithe at my time of life, with a rider.
1	‘Sit close to the fire, father, dear, while I cook your breakfast.
1	Whatever occurs to harass her, usually settles in her legs; but on this occasion it mounted to the chest, and then to the head, and, in short, pervaded the whole system in a most alarming manner.
1	Richard shook him by both hands with an intuitive mixture of respect and frankness, and only saying (though with an earnestness that rather alarmed me, I was so afraid of Mr. Jarndyce's suddenly disappearing), "You are very kind, sir!
1	I could see nothing of the room except the shining of the fire in the window-glass, but I stiffened in all my joints with the consciousness that I was under close inspection.
1	But matters were no sooner in this state, than he devoted all his spare time (and got up earlier to make it more) to these perambulations.
1	The beauty of this noble stream at almost any point, but especially in the commencement of this journey when it winds its way among the thousand Islands, can hardly be imagined.
1	"Because really and truly, George, what I said and meant to say was that I trusted Lignum to you and was sure you'd bring him through it.
1	‘I am not afraid to have it in my sleep, but I am so sad--so very, very sad.’ The old man blessed him, the child in tears replied Good night, and Kit was again alone.
1	Mr. Bucket softly opens the door of communication between that room and the next and looks in.
1	The old sexton soon got better, and was about again.
1	It was not difficult for me, on Peggotty’s solicitation, to resolve to stay where I was, until after the remains of the poor carrier should have made their last journey to Blunderstone.
1	‘Well!’ he said, looking to his bag, ‘having seen you tonight, Mas’r Davy (and that doos me good!
1	Little Alick in a frock has already made arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at Kew.
1	The doctor then communicated, in reply to multifarious questions from his young friend, a precise account of his patient's situation; which was quite as consolatory and full of promise, as Oliver's statement had encouraged him to hope; and to the whole of which, Mr. Giles, who affected to be busy about the luggage, listened with greedy ears.
1	‘Don’t take on, old lady.’ ‘But I can’t bear to see you so, my dear.’ ‘Nonsense!
1	That he had his reasons for this, he knew full well.
1	The institution never flagged for want of a story, I am certain; and the wine lasted out almost as well as the matter.
1	There were the seats where the poor old people sat, worn spare, and yellow like themselves; the rugged font where children had their names, the homely altar where they knelt in after life, the plain black tressels that bore their weight on their last visit to the cool old shady church.
1	You know, my dear Sir, if you _will _take the management of your affairs into your own hands after entrusting them to your solicitor, you must also take the consequences.’ Here Mr. Perker drew himself up with conscious dignity, and brushed some stray grains of snuff from his shirt frill.
1	When Rachael, assenting to this, was gone, Mr. Gradgrind lifted up his head, and said to his daughter: ‘Louisa, my dear, I have never, that I know of, seen this man.
1	And to sleep long and sound,” he answered; “for I've been sea-tossed and sea-washed, months and months.” “My friend and companion,” said I, rising from the sofa, “is absent; you must have his room.” “He won't come back to-morrow; will he?” “No,” said I, answering almost mechanically, in spite of my utmost efforts; “not to-morrow.” “Because, look'ee here, dear boy,” he said, dropping his voice, and laying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner, “caution is necessary.” “How do you mean?
1	You ask her to kneel at this bedside and be married to you, that your reparation may be complete.
1	And in a fourth, and a fifth, and a sixth, and a seventh, the noise, and the beer, and the tobacco smoke, and the cards, all came over again in greater force than before.
1	You forget however, that to put the case to Mr. Crisparkle as his own, is to suppose to have done what I did.’ ‘I ask his pardon,’ said Helena.
1	Seven stage-coaches are preparing to carry us on.
1	If he’s forgotten ‘em, they’ll soon remind him.
1	‘My child is welcome, though unlooked for,’ said she, at the time presenting her cheek as if it were a cool slate for visitors to enrol themselves upon.
1	extraordinary indeed,’ rejoined Mr. Crummles, taking a complacent pinch of snuff, and shaking his head gravely.
1	No man ever really loved a woman, lost her, and knew her with a blameless though an unchanged mind, when she was a wife and a mother, but her children had a strange sympathy with him--an instinctive delicacy of pity for him.
1	For upwards of three years she reclined in a wheeled chair, looking attentively at those about her and appearing to understand what they said; but the rigid silence she had so long held was evermore enforced upon her, and except that she could move her eyes and faintly express a negative and affirmative with her head, she lived and died a statue.
1	There is nothing of chance or doubt in the course before my son.
1	No, no, no,’ said Peggotty, shaking her head, and folding her arms; ‘not she, my dear.
1	‘Bless my heart, Kate!’ so the good lady argued; ‘if the Mr. Cheerybles don’t want this young lady to be married, why don’t they file a bill against the Lord Chancellor, make her a Chancery ward, and shut her up in the Fleet prison for safety?--I have read of such things in the newspapers a hundred times.
1	We shall meet no more.
1	Would you have robbed me—for no one’s enrichment—only for the greater desolation of this world—of the immaterial part of my life, the spring and summer of my belief, my refuge from what is sordid and bad in the real things around me, my school in which I should have learned to be more humble and more trusting with them, and to hope in my little sphere to make them better?’ ‘O no, no.
1	Now Guster, our young woman, is timid and has fits, and she, taking fright at the foreigner's looks--which are fierce--and at a grinding manner that she has of speaking--which is calculated to alarm a weak mind--gave way to it, instead of bearing up against it, and tumbled down the kitchen stairs out of one into another, such fits as I do sometimes think are never gone into, or come out of, in any house but ours.
1	I am not a child, and I am not Amy, and I must speak.’ ‘Fanny,’ gasped Mr Dorrit, after a majestic silence, ‘if I request you to remain here, while I formally announce to Mrs General, as an exemplary lady, who is--hum--a trusted member of this family, the--ha--the change that is contemplated among us; if I--ha--not only request it, but--hum--insist upon it--’ ‘Oh, papa,’ Fanny broke in with pointed significance, ‘if you make so much of it as that, I have in duty nothing to do but comply.
1	Fatigue stole over her at last; her grasp relaxed, tightened, relaxed again, and they slept side by side.
1	What have you got to say?
1	‘It was so great a change: so great a loss, I felt it, at first,’ said Annie, still preserving the same look and tone, ‘that I was agitated and distressed.
1	‘Wo-o!’ cried Mr. Pickwick, as the tall quadruped evinced a decided inclination to back into the coffee-room window.
1	And you recollect Kidderminthter, that wath thought to be rather thweet upon yourthelf?
1	Some of the Reverend Frank Milvey’s brethren had found themselves exceedingly uncomfortable in their minds, because they were required to bury the dead too hopefully.
1	He inquired, as he pointed to Monks, 'Do you know that person?'
1	‘It’s the right sort of a house for such a thorough-built boatman.’ ‘So ‘tis, sir, so ‘tis, sir,’ said Ham, grinning.
1	‘Just about there.’ ‘Does anybody open them, and shut them?
1	Her mother and Mr. Pluck accompanied them, but the worthy lady, pluming herself upon her discretion, took particular care not so much as to look at her daughter during the whole evening, and to seem wholly absorbed in the jokes and conversation of Mr. Pluck, who, having been appointed sentry over Mrs Nickleby for that especial purpose, neglected, on his side, no possible opportunity of engrossing her attention.
1	It’s not for me, with my family, to refuse, no more than it is to ask.’ ‘And would you, Ma’am,’ said the Captain, taking down the tin canister in which he kept his cash, from the top shelf of the cupboard, ‘be so good as offer eighteen-pence a-piece to the little family all round?
1	‘Well then, what’s the matter, Uncle Sol?’ said Walter, coaxingly.
1	‘Ladies and gentlemen,’ said Mr. Pickwick, suddenly rising.
1	Familiar sounds and cries came by degrees into the street below; the servants in the house were roused and busy; faces looked in at the door, and voices asked his attendants softly how he was.
1	“'Consequence, my father didn't make objections to my going to work; so I went to work at my present calling, which were his too, if he would have followed it, and I worked tolerable hard, I assure you, Pip.
1	For the rest, Lincolnshire life to Volumnia is a vast blank of overgrown house looking out upon trees, sighing, wringing their hands, bowing their heads, and casting their tears upon the window-panes in monotonous depressions.
1	“Compeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides.
1	Spare me the little carriage for to-day, and for to-morrow (if I don’t succeed to-day), and I’ll lie in wait for him.’ It was barely settled when a manly form was seen to pass the windows and heard to knock and ring.
1	In this order they reached the magistrate’s house; the chairmen trotting, the prisoners following, Mr. Pickwick oratorising, and the crowd shouting.
1	From this society, little Mr. Perker detached himself, on his clerk being announced in a whisper; and repairing to the dining-room, there found Mr. Lowten and Job Trotter looking very dim and shadowy by the light of a kitchen candle, which the gentleman who condescended to appear in plush shorts and cottons for a quarterly stipend, had, with a becoming contempt for the clerk and all things appertaining to ‘the office,’ placed upon the table.
1	Of course Veneering knows that if Podsnap chose to go there, he would be there, in a space of time that might be stated by the light and thoughtless as a jiffy.
1	Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, I should have lost the weapon.
1	That pale interval over, the picture began to enlarge and fill up so fast that at every new peep I could have found enough to look at for an hour.
1	"Your remembrance does me more honour than I had supposed it would, Lady Dedlock," he returned.
1	Step by step, onward and downward, towards some end, yet so gradually, that she believed herself to remain motionless.
1	Next door at the back.’ ‘O,’ returned Neville.
1	Assuredly he did look then, though he looked his politest, as if any real philanthropist could have desired no better employment than to lash a great stone to his neck, and drop him into the water flowing beyond the dark arched gateway in which he stood.
1	If you shouldn’t find her out, you’ll pay expenses at the Saracen, and something for loss of time?’ ‘Well,’ said Ralph, testily; ‘yes!
1	The hand soon stopped in the midst of them; the light that had always been feeble and dim behind the weak transparency, went out; and even Mrs. Gradgrind, emerged from the shadow in which man walketh and disquieteth himself in vain, took upon her the dread solemnity of the sages and patriarchs.
1	What _is_ a fellow to do for money, and where _am_ I to look for it, if not to my sister?’ He was almost crying, and scattered the buds about by dozens.
1	it were well to die, indeed, at such a time!
1	As he did so, Mr. Dowler very hastily drew back.
1	replied the young lady:  drawing her chair up to the table, and putting her elbows upon it.
1	The stranger in the land who looks into ten thousand faces for some answering look and never finds it, is in cheering society as compared with him who passes ten averted faces daily, that were once the countenances of friends.
1	And what are the young couple saying as they leave the church, and go out at the gate?
1	‘And then there’s that woman with the Pagan name,’ said my aunt, ‘that Peggotty, she goes and gets married next.
1	And this brings me to a point on which I have, ever since I landed in the United States last November, observed a strict silence, though sometimes tempted to break it, but in reference to which I will, with your good leave, take you into my confidence now.
1	Joe gave me some more gravy.
1	Not that she had much to do, to do that,’ cried Tattycoram, in a closing great burst of distress, ‘for I was as bad as bad could be.
1	Our guest was in such spirits on the way home that I could do nothing but listen to him and wonder at him; nor was I alone in this, for Ada yielded to the same fascination.
1	Don’t look round--’ Florence had hardly power to repeat, ‘Why not?’ ‘Because there’s nothing there, my deary,’ said the Captain.
1	Take your time, and weigh it well.’ ‘There is but one question, my dear ma’am, I could wish to ask,’ said Mrs. Micawber.
1	"Why, you see, my dears," said Mrs. Badger, "--you'll excuse me calling you my dears?"
1	Away in the moonlight lie the woodland fields at rest, and the wide house is as quiet as the narrow one.
1	"Why then, don't stand staring as if you was afraid, woman; who's the wiser?
1	We all do it in one way or another.
1	It is called The Thorn of Anxiety.
1	Monks drew his breath yet more freely, and looked round with a smile of triumph.
1	I had no consolation in seeing how different she was from this detestable Rufus with the mulberry-coloured great-coat, for I felt that in the very difference between them, in the self-denial of her pure soul and the sordid baseness of his, the greatest danger lay.
1	Don’t let me detain you, sir; I stand in need of no assistance, I thank you.
1	He despatched Sloppy to bring the carriage to the door; caused the child to be carefully wrapped up; bade old Betty get her bonnet on; collected the toys, enabling the little fellow to comprehend that his treasures were to be transported with him; and had all things prepared so easily that they were ready for the carriage as soon as it appeared, and in a minute afterwards were on their way.
1	The day was calm, however, and brightened towards noon.
1	Satisfied that he was right in his original conjecture, he applied himself to calming the fears of Smike, which, after some time, he partially succeeded in doing, though not in removing the impression upon his mind; for he still declared, again and again, in the most solemn and fervid manner, that he had positively seen what he had described, and that nothing could ever remove his conviction of its reality.
1	The mystery of her visits to the brothers Cheeryble remained wholly unexplained, for Newman had not alluded to them, either in his preliminary conversations with the servant or his subsequent interview with the mistress, merely remarking that he had been instructed to watch the girl home and plead his young friend’s cause, and not saying how far he had followed her, or from what point.
1	‘So much humour,’ said Sam.
1	And Mr. Pickwick and Sam entered accordingly.
1	I have already some acquaintance with the law--as a defendant on civil process--and I shall immediately apply myself to the Commentaries of one of the most eminent and remarkable of our English jurists.
1	‘No, I wasn’t, sir!’ cried Bitzer.
1	But that’s just the way!
1	Sarah Pocket came to the gate, and positively reeled back when she saw me so changed; her walnut-shell countenance likewise turned from brown to green and yellow.
1	‘A good man,’ said the grandfather, looking after him; ‘a kind man.
1	I only ask to be free.
1	‘No, my lady lass,’ returned the Captain.
1	‘Good-bye!’ said Walter, giving both his hands.
1	After a time he rose and rang the bell.
1	‘There were five of us,’ returned his partner.
1	He then went on to tell her where Mr Dombey was lying, and to request that a carriage might be placed at his disposal to bring him home.
1	Presently I saw his blue lips again, breathing on the tinder, and then a flare of light flashed up, and showed me Orlick.
1	"He is called, I believe--an--ironmaster."
1	Off he starts once more, with Chickweed half-way down the street ahead of him; and after twice as long a run as the yesterday's one, the man's lost again!
1	Country!’ (Bow was quite a rustic place to Tim.)
1	With a clink for the stout,--Old Clem!” I thought he had been drinking, but he was not drunk.
1	No one seemed surprised to see him, or interested in seeing him, or glad to see him, or sorry to see him, or spoke a word, except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs, “Give way, you!” which was the signal for the dip of the oars.
1	Theer’s mighty countries, fur from heer.
1	Once cast away as idle breath, no wealth or power can bring them back.
1	Cruncher.” “Let him come out too,” said Solomon.
1	‘You are very good, sir.
1	But they were overcome by unutterable amazement when Mr Pancks, going close up to the most venerable of men and halting in front of the bottle-green waistcoat, made a trigger of his right thumb and forefinger, applied the same to the brim of the broad-brimmed hat, and, with singular smartness and precision, shot it off the polished head as if it had been a large marble.
1	Jo, apparently possessed by an impression that the reverend gentleman wants to cut his hair, shields his head with both arms and is got into the required position with great difficulty and every possible manifestation of reluctance.
1	What would he have done here, without his mother!” ‘“You shall not die, Mary, you shall not die;” said the husband, starting up.
1	Nicholas told them all, and never was there a story which awakened so many emotions in the breasts of two eager listeners.
1	Mr. Lowten had still to be ferreted out from the back parlour of the Magpie and Stump; and Job had scarcely accomplished this object, and communicated Sam Weller’s message, when the clock struck ten.
1	The words were read above the ashes of Betty Higden, in a corner of a churchyard near the river; in a churchyard so obscure that there was nothing in it but grass-mounds, not so much as one single tombstone.
1	‘It embittered the life of your poor mother.
1	About a quarter of a mile off, in a quiet, substantial-looking street, stood an old red brick house with three steps before the door, and a brass plate upon it, bearing, in fat Roman capitals, the words, ‘Mr.
1	when she had me for her theme.
1	I assure you I attach not the least importance to any opinions.
1	‘However, you needn’t be at the trouble of repeating it, for it ain’t worth hearing, and won’t go down with ME.
1	And even now that Commodious is strangled, I don’t see a way to our bettering ourselves.’ Mr Boffin added as he turned his pensive steps towards the Bower and shook his head, ‘I didn’t think this morning there was half so many Scarers in Print.
1	Nobody having the hardihood to object to his doing so, he does it, and the party retire as they came up.
1	Woodcuts of a runaway negro with manacled hands, crouching beneath a bluff pursuer in top boots, who, having caught him, grasps him by the throat, agreeably diversify the pleasant text.
1	"He IS the most wonderful creature!
1	You conspirators, and hiders, and runners-away, should know better than that.
1	I am quite bewildered by all this.
1	The little boys’ legs being too short to admit of their feet resting upon anything as they sat, and the little boys’ bodies being consequently in imminent hazard of being jerked off the coach, Nicholas had enough to do over the stones to hold them on.
1	Em’ly’s alive!’ He put his hand down firmly on the table, and set his sunburnt face into a resolute expression.
1	Never did it make the smallest approach to one’s experience of the proceedings of any sort of vehicle that goes on wheels.
1	I said to Charley this would be one of the great Indiaman's boats now, and we stopped to look.
1	don’t stare at me, Sir,’ said Mr. Magnus; ‘I recollect your words last night, Sir.
1	Yet he's like you, there's no denying.
1	Mr Dombey, who had never found her, kissed her once upon the forehead, and cautioned her not to run away again, or wander anywhere with treacherous attendants.
1	Last night, I went home.
1	"I saw one of Mr. Tulkinghorn's long effusions, I think?"
1	Stand of your own strength now.
1	A. Pardiggle, F.R.S., one pound.
1	Cut some bread and butter, John; that’s a love.
1	Her carriage towards Bella was as a carriage towards a young lady of good position, whom she had met in society a few years ago.
1	It was the Chief Butler.
1	‘Yes, yes, he has, Uncle,’ said the boy, reddening and laughing.
1	When you are ready, I am--need I say with a Hey Ho Chivey, and likewise with a Hark Forward, Hark Forward, Tantivy?’ ‘Will nothing make you serious?’ said Mortimer, laughing through his gravity.
1	He had supported me, as at first, all this time, and his tenderness was so precious to me that I leaned my head upon his shoulder and loved him as if he had been my father.
1	Those were the words I said.
1	‘And having liked no one else with whom we have ever been brought into contact, we had made up our minds not to like you.’ ‘Really?’ said Mr. Crisparkle again.
1	Richard said that he would work his fingers to the bone for Ada, and Ada said that she would work her fingers to the bone for Richard, and they called me all sorts of endearing and sensible names, and we sat there, advising and talking, half the night.
1	I know a delightful washerwoman outside, that comes for my things twice a week; and, by Jove!--how devilish lucky!--this is the day she calls.
1	He took an extraordinary interest in her fortunes when he first happened to encounter her; and we gather from the inquiries we have made of him, that it was she in whose behalf he made that turmoil which led to your first acquaintance.’ Nicholas stammered out that he had before suspected the possibility of such a thing; and in explanation of its having occurred to him, described when and where he had seen the young lady himself.
1	Now, I have only one thing more to say, you hammer-headed woman, and that is, that I haven’t altogether made up my mind whether I might, or might not, have ever given you any trouble about the codicil.
1	When he has walked out, Mr. Guppy, in a great perspiration, nerves himself to the hasty completion of the taking down of the Galaxy Gallery, concluding with Lady Dedlock.
1	Pickwick’s servant!’ said Mrs. Bardell, turning pale.
1	‘Object of my scorn and hatred!’ said Mr. Lenville, ‘I hold ye in contempt.’ Nicholas laughed in very unexpected enjoyment of this performance; and the ladies, by way of encouragement, laughed louder than before; whereat Mr. Lenville assumed his bitterest smile, and expressed his opinion that they were ‘minions’.
1	‘Leave go, I tell you!’ thundered his master.
1	We had started from Yarmouth at three o’clock in the afternoon, and we were due in London about eight next morning.
1	‘Two or three year older than Em’ly, but was at the school with her.’ ‘I never heard her name,’ said I.
1	Mrs MacStinger!’ Captain Cuttle, whose eyes were now as wide open as they would be, and the knobs upon whose face were perfectly luminous, gave a long shrill whistle of a most melancholy sound, and stood gazing at everybody in a state of speechlessness.
1	Even this resource shortly failed him; his irregularities were too great to admit of his earning the wretched pittance he might thus have procured, and he was actually reduced to a state bordering on starvation, only procuring a trifle occasionally by borrowing it of some old companion, or by obtaining an appearance at one or other of the commonest of the minor theatres; and when he did earn anything it was spent in the old way.
1	‘Now, dear Pa,’ said Bella, taking him by both ears as if he were a pitcher, and conveying his face to her rosy lips, ‘we are in for it!’ Miss Lavvy came out to open the gate, waited on by that attentive cavalier and friend of the family, Mr George Sampson.
1	Mr Wegg, as an artful man who is sure of his supper by-and-bye, presses muffin on his host to soothe him into a compliant state of mind, or, as one might say, to grease his works.
1	Do you go with me to the Bank?” “I'll hear what you have got to say.
1	‘You’ll have no conception of the value of your prize until you draw close to it.
1	But this being a round game, and one not necessarily limited to three or four players, was open to John Browdie too, who, bursting into the little crowd--to the great terror of his wife--and falling about in all directions, now to the right, now to the left, now forwards, now backwards, and accidentally driving his elbow through the hat of the tallest helper, who had been particularly active, speedily caused the odds to wear a very different appearance; while more than one stout fellow limped away to a respectful distance, anathematising with tears in his eyes the heavy tread and ponderous feet of the burly Yorkshireman.
1	‘Will you do as I do, Biler, my boy?’ inquired his father, returning to his tea with new strength.
1	It is morning; and Dora, made so trim by my aunt’s hands, shows me how her pretty hair will curl upon the pillow yet, an how long and bright it is, and how she likes to have it loosely gathered in that net she wears.
1	This became the purpose of her life.
1	Sometimes she recited a few verses from Crumlinwallinwer and the Mewlinnwillinwodd (if those are the right names, which I dare say they are not), and would become quite fiery with the sentiments they expressed.
1	‘I heard of the outrage,’ said Bradley, trying to constrain his working mouth, ‘but I had not heard the end of it.’ ‘Where were you,’ said the boy, advancing a step as he lowered his voice, ‘when it was done?
1	I am very glad to do so.” “Glad to part again, Estella?
1	‘Only us two,’ said the man.
1	Her keen eyes had espied Mr Fledgeby before Mr Fledgeby had espied her, and he was paralysed in his purpose of shutting her out, not so much by her approaching the door, as by her favouring him with a shower of nods, the instant he saw her.
1	Harassed by these thoughts, he now began to wish the marriage over, Gowan and his young wife gone, and himself left to fulfil his promise, and discharge the generous function he had accepted.
1	Be this as it may, however, it was his ninth birthday; and he was keeping it in the coal-cellar with a select party of two other young gentleman, who, after participating with him in a sound thrashing, had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be hungry, when Mrs. Mann, the good lady of the house, was unexpectedly startled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble, the beadle, striving to undo the wicket of the garden-gate.
1	Gold, for the instant, lost its lustre in his eyes, for there were countless treasures of the heart which it could never purchase.
1	I’ll give you a clue to my trade, in a game of forfeits.
1	You and your father and who else there may be of you?’ asked Mrs Clennam, speaking deliberately, and meditatively turning the watch over and over.
1	‘Clarence is a great ass, but he is one of the dearest and best fellows that ever lived!’ It appeared, before the breakfast was over, that everybody whom this Gowan knew was either more or less of an ass, or more or less of a knave; but was, notwithstanding, the most lovable, the most engaging, the simplest, truest, kindest, dearest, best fellow that ever lived.
1	Call it madness, and I tell you I can't help it now, and can't be sane.
1	But Ma talks!’ That was plainly to be seen, for Ma was talking then at her usual canter, with arched head and mane, opened eyes and nostrils.
1	Fledgeby taking no notice, the door was at length softly opened, and the dried face of a mild little elderly gentleman looked in.
1	"And you can refuse, you mean, eh?
1	He hasn't come home since the morning, so he may go without 'em.
1	He soon came round again, however; and finding that Oliver's replies to his questions, were still as straightforward and consistent, and still delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth, as they had ever been, he made up his mind to attach full credence to them, from that time forth.
1	I can understand what you tell me, so very much better than what I read in law-writings.
1	As long as her poor dear pretty was above the ground, she said, she would never desert her.
1	‘He’s as like her, Dick,’ said my aunt, emphatically, ‘he’s as like her, as she was that afternoon before she began to fret--bless my heart, he’s as like her, as he can look at me out of his two eyes!’ ‘Is he indeed?’ said Mr. Dick.
1	As the countenance of the stout lady began to clear up, she ventured to inquire how far it was.
1	"A very eminent solicitor is in attendance, gentlemen," says the coroner, "who, I am informed, was accidentally present when discovery of the death was made, but he could only repeat the evidence you have already heard from the surgeon, the landlord, the lodger, and the law-stationer, and it is not necessary to trouble him.
1	‘Nicholas, my dear, how very absurd you are,’ returned his mother; ‘of course I mean that his glazed hat looks like a gentleman’s servant, and not the wart upon his nose; though even that is not so ridiculous as it may seem to you, for we had a footboy once, who had not only a wart, but a wen also, and a very large wen too, and he demanded to have his wages raised in consequence, because he found it came very expensive.
1	‘Vith the bills for the lease, and that, there’s eleven hundred and eighty pound here.
1	‘I told you, the last time you were here with a grievance, that you had better turn about and come out of that.
1	'We must be active, Oliver, and not give way to useless grief,' said Mrs. Maylie, laying her finger on her lip, as she looked steadily into his face; 'this letter must be sent, with all possible expedition, to Mr. Losberne.
1	But injustice breeds injustice; the fighting with shadows and being defeated by them necessitates the setting up of substances to combat; from the impalpable suit which no man alive can understand, the time for that being long gone by, it has become a gloomy relief to turn to the palpable figure of the friend who would have saved him from this ruin and make HIM his enemy.
1	"And this is the heart that the same John Jarndyce, who is not otherwise to be mentioned between us, stepped in to estrange from me," said he indignantly.

1	‘Bitzer,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, broken down, and miserably submissive to him, ‘have you a heart?’ ‘The circulation, sir,’ returned Bitzer, smiling at the oddity of the question, ‘couldn’t be carried on without one.
1	That it has been his constant practice to minister to that passion basely, and to flatter it corruptly, is indubitable.
1	I wish to know what you want with me.’ ‘And so you shall.’ Riderhood had looked hard at his hands and his pockets, apparently as a precautionary measure lest he should have any weapon about him.
1	As it was next to impossible for men so much agitated as they were by this time, to sit still and move so slowly, all three got out and plodded on behind the carriage.

1	"Very full--er--excuse me--lady's name, Christian and surname both?"
1	Of course you have heard of it, for no kind of news travels so fast--among one’s friends especially.’ Mindful of the wondering dinner, Twemlow, with a little twinge, admits the imputation.

1	Mr Doyce wished him Good Night in the tone of a man who had heard a mournful, not to say despairing, exclamation, and who sought to infuse some encouragement and hope into the mind of the person by whom it had been uttered.

1	I have impressed upon Amy during many years, that I must have my meals (for instance) punctually.
1	I never heard of any.’ At this point of the dialogue Bella came in with a light step.
1	If I only had him here--’ ‘Oh Quilp!’ said his wife, ‘what’s the matter?
1	Whether it was done in good time, or not, will be seen hereafter.
1	"I am not quite certain," returned Ada with a bashful simplicity that would have won my heart if she had not won it long before, "but I think he's waiting at the door."
1	We cut over the fields at the back, with him between us--straight as the crow flies--through hedge and ditch.
1	She didn't quite rely, however, on their discontent and poverty for the child's unhappiness, but told the history of the sister's shame, with such alterations as suited her; bade them take good heed of the child, for she came of bad blood; and told them she was illegitimate, and sure to go wrong at one time or other.
1	A very good school it is, and handsomely supported by this family."
1	‘And pilfering, mother?’ ‘Sometimes, Ally--in a very small way.
1	Let me thank you for so considerately yielding to my disinclination.
1	I know that she forgives me, and is sorry in her heart.
1	The stimulant is Lammle’s voice.
1	More and more light broke in upon them; distincter and distincter dreams disturbed them; an accumulating crowd of objects and impressions swarmed about his rest; and so he passed from babyhood to childhood, and became a talking, walking, wondering Dombey.

1	As for Sebastian del Piombo there, you would judge for yourself; if it were not his later manner, the question was, Who was it?
1	‘Well, if it ain’t Mr. Jackson, the young man from Dodson and Fogg’s!’ cried Mrs. Bardell.
1	Why didn’t you say, you hard-hearted thing, that you were convinced I was worse than a transported page?

1	On either side of him, there shot up against the dark sky, tall, gaunt, straggling houses, with time-stained fronts, and windows that seemed to have shared the lot of eyes in mortals, and to have grown dim and sunken with age.
1	The morning of the thirteenth of February, which the readers of this authentic narrative know, as well as we do, to have been the day immediately preceding that which was appointed for the trial of Mrs. Bardell’s action, was a busy time for Mr. Samuel Weller, who was perpetually engaged in travelling from the George and Vulture to Mr. Perker’s chambers and back again, from and between the hours of nine o’clock in the morning and two in the afternoon, both inclusive.
1	I must act for myself, therefore.
1	Mr. Lorry returned, and found no tidings of him, and brought none.
1	Let me hear.’ ‘You have anticipated, mother, that I decide for my part, to abandon the business.
1	Who, incautiously saying in his genial manner, ‘Well, Sally, there you are!’ involved himself in a discursive address from Mrs Sprodgkin, revolving around the result that she regarded tea and sugar in the light of myrrh and frankincense, and considered bread and butter identical with locusts and wild honey.
1	It was a toilsome journey up-stairs to his room, and he re-entered its dark solitary precincts in unutterable misery.
1	Her father and their old friend got into it, and he took his seat beside the driver.

1	Still the woman follows, crying, "Stop him, sir, pray stop him!"
1	‘Do you think my dear nieces pretty?’ whispered their affectionate aunt to Mr. Tupman.
1	Why am I ever so to you, when I should think of nothing but how to be grateful, and to make you happy!’ ‘You always make me so,’ said Ham, ‘my dear!
1	Good day, one and all!” “Have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.” Madame complied with a polite air.
1	With no less gallantry, the Major folded both his gloves upon his heart, and bowed low to the other lady.
1	I’ve been otherwise occupied, Wegg.’ ‘Have you indeed, sir?’ returned the literary gentleman, with a threatening sneer.
1	‘I wish,’ thought Ralph, ‘I had never done this.
1	He little knew through what a storm and struggle she had been driven onward to the crowning honour of his hand.
1	I saved him a world o’ trouble this vay, Sir.’ ‘That’s not precisely what I meant, Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick, shaking his head, with a slight smile.
1	Twilight comes on; gas begins to start up in the shops; the lamplighter, with his ladder, runs along the margin of the pavement.
1	Meanwhile, Dodson said, in an affable manner, to Mr. Pickwick-- ‘I don’t think you are looking quite so stout as when I had the pleasure of seeing you last, Mr. Pickwick.’ ‘Possibly not, Sir,’ replied Mr. Pickwick, who had been flashing forth looks of fierce indignation, without producing the smallest effect on either of the sharp practitioners; ‘I believe I am not, Sir.
1	He spoke of a traveller’s house on the Dover Road, where he knew he could find a clean, plain lodging for the night.
1	"Now, mind how you put it, Bucket," cried the old man anxiously with his hand at his ear.
1	Will you rest here a little?” “Yes, I am to rest here a little, and I am to drink some tea, and you are to take care of me the while.” She drew her arm through mine, as if it must be done, and I requested a waiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen such a thing in his life, to show us a private sitting-room.
1	And I did so.’ He went on, from this point, in a still more humble tone, and spoke in a very low voice; pointing to Ralph as he resumed.
1	‘For all time to come?’ asked Florence.
1	That bundle is in your way; let me hold it.’ Durdles has stopped and backed a little (Deputy, attentive to all his movements, immediately skirmishing into the road), and was looking about for some ledge or corner to place his bundle on, when thus relieved of it.

1	He makes so many of these references to the law-stationer in the course of a day or two that Allan, after conferring with Mr. Jarndyce, good-naturedly resolves to call in Cook's Court, the rather, as the cart seems to be breaking down.
1	Where did you see her?
1	The child opened the door (now guarded by a shutter which I had heard the boy put up before he left the house) and with another farewell whose clear and tender note I have recalled a thousand times, held it until we had passed out.
1	This lady, whose name was Camilla, very much reminded me of my sister, with the difference that she was older, and (as I found when I caught sight of her) of a blunter cast of features.
1	The cant of the lying world is, that men like me compass our riches by dissimulation and treachery: by fawning, cringing, and stooping.
1	He then gave him another blow on the head, just to stun him till he came back again.
1	He merely shook him by the hand in answer; he seemed in a manner ashamed and afraid even to do that; and bidding him good-night, and advising him to make haste, turned away.
1	Though he thought them far too slight, he said, for such a service.

1	Even at this moment, while I leave the river behind me, going home, I cannot conceive that it rolls between me and that spot, or that the sea is where it is.
1	Old Wardle led the way to a pretty large sheet of ice; and the fat boy and Mr. Weller, having shovelled and swept away the snow which had fallen on it during the night, Mr. Bob Sawyer adjusted his skates with a dexterity which to Mr. Winkle was perfectly marvellous, and described circles with his left leg, and cut figures of eight, and inscribed upon the ice, without once stopping for breath, a great many other pleasant and astonishing devices, to the excessive satisfaction of Mr. Pickwick, Mr. Tupman, and the ladies; which reached a pitch of positive enthusiasm, when old Wardle and Benjamin Allen, assisted by the aforesaid Bob Sawyer, performed some mystic evolutions, which they called a reel.
1	Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, has had a fit--apoplexy or paralysis--and couldn't be brought to, and precious time has been lost.
1	She had never changed to him--nor had he ever changed to her--and she was lost.

1	Thirdly, they have got up among themselves a periodical called THE LOWELL OFFERING, ‘A repository of original articles, written exclusively by females actively employed in the mills,’—which is duly printed, published, and sold; and whereof I brought away from Lowell four hundred good solid pages, which I have read from beginning to end.

1	Mr. Winkle was always remarkable for extreme humanity.
1	Never to put one hand to anything, on which I could throw my whole self; and never to affect depreciation of my work, whatever it was; I find, now, to have been my golden rules.
1	"So that it is even more mischievous," said my guardian once to me, "to remonstrate with the poor dear fellow than to leave him alone."

1	After looking at him for some moments in silent resignation, Mrs Chick said she trusted he hadn’t said it in aggravation, because that would do very little honour to his heart.
1	How do you know?’ ‘Ecod, sir, he was Pitching into our people the other day in the most tremendous manner.
1	The Brothers are now dead.
1	A very old lady, in a lofty cap and faded silk gown--no less a personage than Mr. Wardle’s mother--occupied the post of honour on the right-hand corner of the chimney-piece; and various certificates of her having been brought up in the way she should go when young, and of her not having departed from it when old, ornamented the walls, in the form of samplers of ancient date, worsted landscapes of equal antiquity, and crimson silk tea-kettle holders of a more modern period.
1	Oh!’ The pleasure of this discovery called up the old doglike smile in full force.
1	‘It was on the night when the Harmon murder was found out, through father, just above bridge.
1	With the exception of two or three inconsiderable clusters of cottages which they passed, without stopping, and one lonely road-side public-house where they had some bread and cheese, this highway had led them to nothing--late in the afternoon--and still lengthened out, far in the distance, the same dull, tedious, winding course, that they had been pursuing all day.
1	It was to throw a covering over her; as if his hands were not enough to hide her, even in the darkness.
1	That's the usual way of doing business.'

1	It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history.
1	I merely come down here under the seal of confidence and mention it in order that everything may be openly carried on and that it may not be said afterwards that everything was not openly carried on.

1	‘Or how,’ he added, looking more attentively at the child, ‘do you come to want a place of rest at this time of night?’ ‘Our misfortunes,’ the grandfather answered, ‘are the cause.’ ‘Do you know,’ said the man, looking still more earnestly at Nell, ‘how wet she is, and that the damp streets are not a place for her?’ ‘I know it well, God help me,’ he replied.

1	'I want you, Bolter,' said Fagin, leaning over the table, 'to do a piece of work for me, my dear, that needs great care and caution.'
1	He wrote a few words in pencil on a card, and having thrust it under the door was going away, when a noise above, as though a window-sash were stealthily raised, caught his ear, and looking up he could just discern the face of Gride himself, cautiously peering over the house parapet from the window of the garret.
1	Apparently with no compunction, and assuredly with no ceremony, Bella tossed her bonnet away, and sat down to make the tea.
1	The blessed darling comes of no family, my dear Handel, and never looked into the red book, and hasn't a notion about her grandpapa.
1	I wonder,’ said Biler, blubbering outright, and smearing his eyes with his coat-cuff, ‘that I haven’t been and drownded myself over and over again.’ All of which, including his expression of surprise at not having achieved this last scarce performance, the boy said, just as if the teeth of Mr Carker drew it out of him, and he had no power of concealing anything with that battery of attraction in full play.
1	Perhaps fire, like the higher animal and vegetable life it helps to sustain, has its greatest tendency towards death, when the night is dying and the day is not yet born.

1	We had an adjourned cause in the Consistory that day--about excommunicating a baker who had been objecting in a vestry to a paving-rate--and as the evidence was just twice the length of Robinson Crusoe, according to a calculation I made, it was rather late in the day before we finished.
1	"You needn't make a merit of that," said she.

1	These opinions being equally incontrovertible with those he had already pronounced, he went on to inform us that Jamaica rum, though unquestionably an agreeable spirit of great richness and flavour, had the drawback of remaining constantly present to the taste next day; and nobody being venturous enough to argue this point either, he increased in confidence and became yet more companionable and communicative.
1	‘That’s a pity,’ said Steerforth.

1	With a great pang mercifully spared me, I could take back to my heart my childish prayer to be all he had so brightly shown himself; and there was nothing to be undone: no chain for me to break or for him to drag; and I could go, please God, my lowly way along the path of duty, and he could go his nobler way upon its broader road; and though we were apart upon the journey, I might aspire to meet him, unselfishly, innocently, better far than he had thought me when I found some favour in his eyes, at the journey's end.

1	‘Twopence-halfpenny,’ says the landlord, ‘is the price of the Genuine Stunning ale.’ ‘Then,’ says I, producing the money, ‘just draw me a glass of the Genuine Stunning, if you please, with a good head to it.’ The landlord looked at me in return over the bar, from head to foot, with a strange smile on his face; and instead of drawing the beer, looked round the screen and said something to his wife.
1	‘Now, Winkle,’ said the old gentleman, ‘follow me softly, and don’t be too late this time.’ ‘Never fear,’ said Mr. Winkle.

1	‘He always falls down when he’s took out o’ the cab,’ continued the driver, ‘but when he’s in it, we bears him up werry tight, and takes him in werry short, so as he can’t werry well fall down; and we’ve got a pair o’ precious large wheels on, so ven he does move, they run after him, and he must go on--he can’t help it.’ Mr. Pickwick entered every word of this statement in his note-book, with the view of communicating it to the club, as a singular instance of the tenacity of life in horses under trying circumstances.
1	Bradley held a sovereign between his fingers.
1	The boughs of the trees were bent and broken, and the grass had grown long and rank.
1	With the supper came one of the young Fathers (there seemed to be no old Fathers) to take the head of the table.
1	Singular!” and then put the handkerchief to its right use with wonderful effect.
1	‘True, to the present time,’ Mr Boffin assented, with his former pensiveness, as he took his seat upon his settle.
1	‘I have seen the parents of some boys,’ continued Squeers, turning over his papers, ‘and they’re so glad to hear how their sons are getting on, that there’s no prospect at all of their going away, which of course is a very pleasant thing to reflect upon, for all parties.’ Two or three hands went to two or three eyes when Squeers said this, but the greater part of the young gentlemen having no particular parents to speak of, were wholly uninterested in the thing one way or other.

1	‘And I have no fire,’ said Clennam.
1	Could I have a morsel of bread and a glass of wine, or--hum--would it cause too much inconvenience?’ ‘Dear father, you shall have supper in a very few minutes.’ ‘Thank you, my love,’ said Mr Dorrit, with a reproachful frost upon him; ‘I--ha--am afraid I am causing inconvenience.

1	For some time, Mr. Bumble drew Oliver along, without notice or remark; for the beadle carried his head very erect, as a beadle always should: and, it being a windy day, little Oliver was completely enshrouded by the skirts of Mr. Bumble's coat as they blew open, and disclosed to great advantage his flapped waistcoat and drab plush knee-breeches.
1	‘Glad to see you, sir.
1	But your temper is hasty and you are not considerate.
1	Neither of them spoke at all, for some short time.
1	‘Is anything the matter?’ said Newman Noggs.

1	The procession consisted of two flys; in the first of which were Miss Bravassa (the fourth bridesmaid), Mrs. Crummles, the collector, and Mr Folair, who had been chosen as his second on the occasion.
1	This time, I made the tour of Little Britain, and turned into Bartholomew Close; and now I became aware that other people were waiting about for Mr. Jaggers, as well as I.
1	'Ay, that he shall,' replied Fagin, 'and we'll have a big-wig, Charley: one that's got the greatest gift of the gab:  to carry on his defence; and he shall make a speech for himself too, if he likes; and we'll read it all in the papers--"Artful Dodger--shrieks of laughter--here the court was convulsed"--eh, Charley, eh?'
1	When she had almost completed the journey, and was passing along the gallery in which her room was, she heard an angry sound of muttering and sobbing.
1	Past twelve o’clock is the dead of night here.’ The knocking was loud and long, but it failed to rouse the drowsy inmates.
1	Really he is.’ Really he was.
1	‘Gone!’ ‘Gone,’ repeated Mr. Snodgrass.
1	She said that she hoped there was a bare possibility that it mightn’t be true; and that as she couldn’t very well come out herself, without surprising Miss Dombey, would I go down to Mr Solomon Gills the Instrument-maker’s in this street, who was the party’s Uncle, and ask whether he believed it was true, or had heard anything else in the City.
1	Of the restoration, as he travelled on towards the seacoast, of the monotony of bells and wheels, and horses’ feet, and no rest.

1	It was a feeble tribute to thee, but it was well meant.
1	There were many little occurrences which suggested to me, with great consolation, how natural it is to gentle hearts to be considerate and delicate towards any inferiority.
1	‘Well, gentlemen,’ said Mr. Pell, ‘all I can say is, that such marks of confidence must be very gratifying to a professional man.
1	And little Jacob, whose disjointed thoughts had by this time resolved themselves into a pretty distinct impression that Kit couldn’t go out for a walk if he wanted, and that there were no birds, lions, tigers or other natural curiosities behind those bars--nothing indeed, but a caged brother--added his tears to theirs with as little noise as possible.
1	But, before I proceed to narrate it, and before I pass on to all the changes it involved, I must give one chapter to Estella.
1	‘No longer were the friar’s eyes directed to the earth; they were cast abroad, and roamed from point to point, as if the gloom and desolation of the scene found a quick response in his own bosom.
1	He seized Mr. Winkle by the arm, and placing himself between that gentleman and Mr. Snodgrass, earnestly besought them to remember that beyond the possibility of being rendered deaf by the noise, there was no immediate danger to be apprehended from the firing.
1	Both combatants fell dead upon the ground; and possibly some rational people may think of them, as of the gloomy madmen on the Monks’ Mound, that they were no great loss to the community.
1	Mr. Jasper is in beautiful voice this day.
1	I pointed to the window of the room where Little Dorrit was born, and where her father lived so long, and asked him what was the name of the lodger who tenanted that apartment at present?

1	They were on the brink of the Lock, about midway between the two sets of gates.
1	Mrs. Bardell got in, Mr. Jackson got in after her, and away they drove.
1	He knowed that finger when he saw Joseph, and he saw it plain.
1	It is like a dream, now, which I cannot quite remember or understand.
1	Upon this, the young lady cast a hurried glance towards the spot whence the dreadful sounds proceeded; and her previous alarm being not at all diminished when she saw a man among the branches, she would most certainly have decamped, and alarmed the house, had not fear fortunately deprived her of the power of moving, and caused her to sink down on a garden seat, which happened by good luck to be near at hand.
1	I’ve heard that it’s very strictly conducted, and there is nothing but learning going on from morning to night.’ ‘And it’s very expensive,’ added Mr Dombey.
1	"As you say, it's not a pleasant subject."
1	Intent upon this innocent amusement, Noah put his feet on the table-cloth; and pulled Oliver's hair; and twitched his ears; and expressed his opinion that he was a 'sneak'; and furthermore announced his intention of coming to see him hanged, whenever that desirable event should take place; and entered upon various topics of petty annoyance, like a malicious and ill-conditioned charity-boy as he was.
1	‘It’s not of the least consequence.’ Both husband and wife glanced at him, very doubtfully.
1	"Mr. Carstone has laid down the principle of watching his own interests," said Mr. Vholes, "and when a client lays down his own principle, and it is not immoral, it devolves upon me to carry it out.

1	I was surprised, when I came within sight of our office-door, to see the ticket-porters standing outside talking together, and some half-dozen stragglers gazing at the windows which were shut up.
1	Kit wondered to see the pony again, so near his own home too, but it never occurred to him for what purpose the pony might have come there, or where the old lady and the old gentleman had gone, until he lifted the latch of the door, and walking in, found them seated in the room in conversation with his mother, at which unexpected sight he pulled off his hat and made his best bow in some confusion.
1	'Why, what the blazes is in the wind now!'
1	Is it so much, that you torment me like an evil spirit?’ ‘I asked you a question.
1	And now,’ continued Mr. Pickwick, looking round on his friends with a good-humoured smile, and a sparkle in the eye which no spectacles could dim or conceal, ‘the only question is, Where shall we go next?’ Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass were too much affected by their friend’s heroism to offer any reply.
1	‘I wish I had the vagabonds here,’ said the captain wrathfully.
1	It is better for us both that this subject should end here.
1	He was as radiant, as if his chair, his asthma, and the failure of his limbs, were the various branches of a great invention for enhancing the luxury of a pipe.

1	But in the poorer habitations Ralph was another man; his boots creaked upon the passage floor as he walked boldly in; his voice was harsh and loud as he demanded the money that was overdue; his threats were coarse and angry.
1	Do you tell me that you don’t hear THAT?’ He started up, and listened again.
1	Thirdly, to say as all his things is to be put together, and give to anybody as we sends for ‘em.
1	At length he stopped, and rang the bell violently.
1	Now COULD it, you know!
1	“Then, Herbert, estimate; estimate it in round numbers, and put it down.” “What a fellow of resource you are!” my friend would reply, with admiration.
1	'And what are _you_, boy?'
1	There was I a dragoon, roving, unsettled, not self-made like him, but self-unmade--all my earlier advantages thrown away, all my little learning unlearnt, nothing picked up but what unfitted me for most things that I could think of.
1	He worked very hard all day, and did not leave his room until the evening, when he went down to the theatre, whither Smike had repaired before him to go on with another gentleman as a general rebellion.
1	‘The usual return!’ ‘Take advice from plain old Joe, and never educate that sort of people, Sir,’ returned the Major.
1	‘This is dreadful.’ ‘Not a bit on it, mum,’ replied Sam.--‘Is it, shepherd?’ Mr. Stiggins raised his hands, and turned up his eyes, until the whites- -or rather the yellows--were alone visible; but made no reply in words.
1	You know he is despised.” “Well?” said she.
1	Would you mind sitting quiet--on the family account--while I reckon 'em up?

1	But he was not persuaded.
1	There may be a world beyond Chesney Wold that I don't understand.
1	‘No, Ma’am, no,’ said Toodle.
1	Without appearing to notice it, in her ardour she still pressed herself upon me, speaking in a rapid subdued voice, though always with a certain grace and propriety.
1	I shall not have to resist your frank approaches, Walter, any more.’ There was a melancholy in his smile as he said it, that showed he had found some company and friendship for his thoughts even in that.
1	Such thoughts as these occurred to Nicholas very strongly, on the morning when he first took possession of the vacant stool, and looked about him, more freely and at ease, than he had before enjoyed an opportunity of doing.
1	I was so bewildered that Miss Donny thought the cold had been too severe for me and lent me her smelling-bottle.
1	With what emotions did he prolong the attentive gaze covertly directed on his unknown daughter?
1	Who is he?’ ‘Child,’ returned my aunt, taking my arm, ‘come in, and don’t speak to me for ten minutes.’ We sat down in her little parlour.
1	"Did he take no legal proceedings?"
1	Patient, and upheld by strong affection to the last, she died a widow of some three weeks’ date, leaving to her father’s care two orphans; one a son of ten or twelve years old; the other a girl--such another infant child--the same in helplessness, in age, in form, in feature--as she had been herself when her young mother died.

1	‘But I am obliged to you at any rate,’ said he, ‘for your politeness.’ ‘Not at all,’ replied this engaging young Barnacle.
1	"What do you think, now," says Mr. Guppy, "about--you don't mind Smallweed?"
1	You may lay dry there half your lifetime; but the time will come, and it is best that you should know it, when a dripping sop would be no name for you.’ Mr. Grewgious looked much disgraced by being prefigured in this pickle.
1	But as he may not know it by its new name of Boffin’s Bower, say, when you inquire of him, it’s Harmon’s; will you?’ ‘Harmoon’s,’ repeated Mr Rokesmith, seeming to have caught the sound imperfectly, ‘Harmarn’s.

1	I’ve asked her about that (but not saying why), and have added of it up.
1	I say she was starved to death.
1	Now, go, my friend!’ The Captain was absolutely rooted to the ground, and speechless-- ‘Go,’ said the good-humoured Manager, gathering up his skirts, and standing astride upon the hearth-rug, ‘like a sensible fellow, and let us have no turning out, or any such violent measures.
1	It may do a thoughtless, careless man, good, to know that.’ Dick thanked him, and said he hoped it would.
1	The ground shook, the house rattled, the fierce impetuous rush was in the air!
1	I'll look him up and go to work for you.” “I thank you ten thousand times.” “On the contrary,” said he, “I thank you, for though we are strictly in our private and personal capacity, still it may be mentioned that there are Newgate cobwebs about, and it brushes them away.” After a little further conversation to the same effect, we returned into the Castle where we found Miss Skiffins preparing tea.
1	I am going to dine,’ said Mr. Maldon, ‘with my cousin Annie.
1	Never mind your having no enjoyment of women's society, nor understanding of it, nor tact for it.

1	Esther's Narrative I lay ill through several weeks, and the usual tenor of my life became like an old remembrance.
1	I dare say we shall be often together, and I should like to banish any needless restraint between us.
1	Here were poor streets where faded gentility essayed with scanty space and shipwrecked means to make its last feeble stand, but tax-gatherer and creditor came there as elsewhere, and the poverty that yet faintly struggled was hardly less squalid and manifest than that which had long ago submitted and given up the game.
1	As to any key to his inner knowledge being to be found in his face, the Marshalsea key was as legible as an index to the individual characters and histories upon which it was turned.
1	"Yes, sir," returned the child, looking up into his face with perfect confidence, "since father died."
1	I had found sublimity and wonder in the dread heights and precipices, in the roaring torrents, and the wastes of ice and snow; but as yet, they had taught me nothing else.
1	Fanny laughed at first; but soon laid her face against her sister’s and cried too--a little.
1	Bless you, sir, the way she tended them two children after the mother died was the talk of the yard!
1	One of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was, for imitations of the questionable public virtues of antiquity, and for sacrifices and self-immolations on the people's altar.
1	For he felt, gentlemen, that for a guard he didn’t know, to call him Jack Martin, was a liberty which the Post Office wouldn’t have sanctioned if they had known it.
1	Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage (which might have been lighter), conducted by four post-horses and two postilions, fagged up a steep hill.
1	"Sir, I have been," with a faint smile.
1	With this tumult in her mind, it is no subject for surprise that Miss Fanny came home one night in a state of agitation from a concert and ball at Mrs Merdle’s house, and on her sister affectionately trying to soothe her, pushed that sister away from the toilette-table at which she sat angrily trying to cry, and declared with a heaving bosom that she detested everybody, and she wished she was dead.
1	You will smile, perhaps, to hear a grey-headed man talk about such things.
1	All the time that Agnes sang and played, the mother sat at the piano.
1	After expressing this opinion, Mr. Claypole looked into the porter-pot with an aspect of deep wisdom; and having well shaken its contents, nodded condescendingly to Charlotte, and took a draught, wherewith he appeared greatly refreshed.
1	Whether it would be more agreeable to Edmund than the army, remained to be seen.
1	Out of so large a number of females, many of whom were only then just verging upon womanhood, it may be reasonably supposed that some were delicate and fragile in appearance: no doubt there were.
1	I was very glad indeed to get upstairs to Agnes, and to talk with her in a corner, and to introduce Traddles to her, who was shy, but agreeable, and the same good-natured creature still.
1	"I have long expected this, as you know.
1	Out again for Civita Vecchia, so away to--hey!
1	But finding that he had run through his property, as it were, in an injudicious manner, by squandering the whole before taking a chair, or before Florence had uttered a word, or before he had well got in at the door, he deemed it advisable to begin again.
1	Nothing, Miss.’ ‘What have they done with my Mama?’ inquired the child, with exactly the same look and manner.
1	Jo suddenly comes out of his resignation and excitedly declares, addressing the woman, that he never known about the young lady, that he never heern about it, that he never went fur to hurt her, that he would sooner have hurt his own self, that he'd sooner have had his unfortnet ed chopped off than ever gone a-nigh her, and that she wos wery good to him, she wos.
1	‘Where is my nephew?’ asked Mr. Jasper, wildly.
1	True to his notion of seeming to do it all without preparation, I heard Wemmick say to himself, as he took something out of his waistcoat-pocket before the service began, “Halloa!
1	In it he sat dozing, while the old woman who arranged his room went through her morning’s work.
1	Yet when the first of the brothers died, the other, much to his surprise, found large sums of money which had been secreted even from him.’ ‘There!’ cried Mr Boffin.
1	‘I beg your pardon,’ said he, starting.
1	Child’s eldest sister bought a necklace--common necklace, made of large black wooden beads.
1	He had that dull-looking, boiled eye which is often to be seen in the heads of people who have applied themselves during many years to a weary and laborious course of study; and which would have been sufficient, without the additional eyeglass which dangled from a broad black riband round his neck, to warn a stranger that he was very near-sighted.
1	"I went to the hall-door and told them it was the wrong day and the wrong hour, but the young man who was driving took off his hat in the wet and begged me to bring this card to you."
1	You remember, Charley?’ ‘I remember,’ said the boy, pressing her to him twice or thrice, ‘that I snuggled under a little shawl, and it was warm there.’ ‘Sometimes it rains, and we creep under a boat or the like of that: sometimes it’s dark, and we get among the gaslights, sitting watching the people as they go along the streets.

1	‘At times I have thought yes; at other times I have thought no.
1	As often as the little bell rang, he started and peeped out secretly, with the end of the little curtain in his hand and the rest before his face; evidently not at all satisfied but that the man he dreaded had tracked him through all his doublings and turnings, with the certainty of a terrible bloodhound.

1	Mr. Lenville was a blooming warrior of most exquisite proportions; Mr. Crummles, his large face shaded by a profusion of black hair, a Highland outlaw of most majestic bearing; one of the old gentlemen a jailer, and the other a venerable patriarch; the comic countryman, a fighting-man of great valour, relieved by a touch of humour; each of the Master Crummleses a prince in his own right; and the low-spirited lover, a desponding captive.
1	‘The subject is at an end for the present,’ said the old gentleman, wiping his face.
1	"There are better subjects than these," said my guardian, "for such a joyful time as the time of our dear girl's recovery.
1	‘You know what it is, Uriah, as well as I do.’ ‘Oh no!
1	‘Oh, do, please, Mr. Pickwick!’ cried all the ladies.
1	‘Mr Boffin, if I confess to you that I fell into a proposal of which you were the subject, and of which you oughtn’t to have been the subject, you will allow me to mention, and will please take into favourable consideration, that I was in a crushed state of mind at the time.’ The Golden Dustman, with his hands folded on the top of his stout stick, with his chin resting upon them, and with something leering and whimsical in his eyes, gave a nod, and said, ‘Quite so, Venus.’ ‘That proposal, sir, was a conspiring breach of your confidence, to such an extent, that I ought at once to have made it known to you.
1	All I say is, just you keep it till I ask you for it again.’ With these words, Mr. Weller placed the pocket-book in Mr. Pickwick’s hands, caught up his hat, and ran out of the room with a celerity scarcely to be expected from so corpulent a subject.
1	They’ve not been sleeping, I know that.
1	The things that you see here, are things to be seen, and not spoken of.'
1	Go on, I beg; make my house yours, and perhaps by the time I return from my walk, you will have finished what you have to say, and will yield me up possession again.’ So saying, he buttoned his coat, and turning into the passage, took down his hat.
1	Last night he was very late, and it was quite light.
1	Bella knew that Lizzie’s father had been falsely accused of the crime which had had so great an influence on her own life and fortunes; and her interest, though it had no secret springs, like that of the Secretary, was equally natural.
1	This, in combination with the lifting of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a line, suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the shop among the customers, for any new customer who had dropped in while he stepped over the way.
1	‘You must be tired, sir,’ said he as he placed a chair near the fire, ‘how can I thank you?’ ‘By taking more care of your grandchild another time, my good friend,’ I replied.
1	"What's time," says Mrs. Snagsby, "to eternity?"
1	And who among the company at Monseigneur's reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled hangman, powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would see the very stars out!
1	For this, I am here alone with you, at the dead of night.
1	One last time let me call you by your own dear name, and touch this gentle hand in token of your sisterly forgetfulness of what I have said.’ She raised her head, and spoke to him with such a solemn sweetness in her eyes; with such a calm, bright, placid smile shining on him through her tears; with such a low, soft tremble in her frame and voice; that the innermost chords of his heart were touched, and his sight was dim as he listened.
1	he repeated, taking a pinch of snuff and gently fluttering his fingers.
1	‘Upon my word!’ cried Mrs. Nicholas Nickleby, ‘it sounds very well.’ Having dispatched the ceremony, with its attendant festivities, to the perfect satisfaction of her own mind, the sanguine mother pictured to her imagination a long train of honours and distinctions which could not fail to accompany Kate in her new and brilliant sphere.
1	But the face was in the main one face, and every head was prematurely white.
1	‘Now, don’t you think, Ma dear,’ said the Minor Canon to his mother one day as she sat at her knitting in his little book-room, ‘that you are rather hard on Mr. Neville?’ ‘No, I do _not_, Sept,’ returned the old lady.
1	‘May I be excused for asking, in the elderly gentleman’s presence, who is this kind protector?’ ‘A trustworthy friend,’ said Lizzie.
1	And now, Johnny was to be inveigled into occupying a temporary position on Mrs Boffin’s lap.
1	"This is a horrible house," says Mr. Guppy, shutting down the window.
1	While the subject of it was breathing injury in a corner, the Chief loftily addressed this gentleman.
1	He drank a quarter of a pint before breakfast, and then walked up a hill; and another quarter of a pint after breakfast, and then walked down a hill; and, after every fresh quarter of a pint, Mr. Pickwick declared, in the most solemn and emphatic terms, that he felt a great deal better; whereat his friends were very much delighted, though they had not been previously aware that there was anything the matter with him.
1	It's of no use my trying to learn anything that it would be useful for Prince's wife to know in OUR house.
1	‘Now, my uncle was always remarkable for great boldness, and great presence of mind.
1	‘It will be better for Mr. Nickleby and for our object that he should remain silent, if he can, till we have said what we have to say.
1	We fok ha’ only one room, and we can’t.
1	Discontented people might talk of corruption in the Commons, closeness in the Commons, and the necessity of reforming the Commons, said Mr. Spenlow solemnly, in conclusion; but when the price of wheat per bushel had been highest, the Commons had been busiest; and a man might lay his hand upon his heart, and say this to the whole world,--‘Touch the Commons, and down comes the country!’ I listened to all this with attention; and though, I must say, I had my doubts whether the country was quite as much obliged to the Commons as Mr. Spenlow made out, I respectfully deferred to his opinion.
1	I think them injudicious, but I am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits.” I was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great liberality with which I was treated, when Mr. Jaggers stopped me.
1	‘Fears are entertained that the wound will be mortal.
1	I and my sister worked at tambour work.
1	In one of the suburbs is a plank road—not footpath—five or six miles long, and a famous road it is too.
1	‘It must be softly done.
1	In short, he was the hero of the feast; and when the table was cleared and something warm introduced, Miss Snevellicci’s papa got up and proposed his health in a speech containing such affecting allusions to his coming departure, that Miss Snevellicci wept, and was compelled to retire into the bedroom.
1	'Was there no one by?'
1	The Captain saw in this a succession of man-traps stretching out infinitely; a series of ages of oppression and coercion, through which the seafaring line was doomed.
1	I accuse no one.’ ‘Tcha!’ ejaculated Mr. Honeythunder with great disgust; for this was by no means the principle on which the Philanthropic Brotherhood usually proceeded.
1	"Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, it's altogether impossible.
1	I have found you at last!"
1	She don’t gain on her Papa in the least.
1	They were as silent, however, as the men.
1	I should have tried to find out what nature and accident really had made me, and to be that, and nothing else.
1	We must learn to bear misfortune, and we must remember that there are many sources of consolation even in death.
1	"Bless you, darling," says Mr. Bucket with the greatest composure, "I'm fully prepared to hear that.
1	‘It’s no purpose of mine that I live by it still.’ ‘There you go, Liz!
1	Because the Circumlocution Office went on mechanically, every day, keeping this wonderful, all-sufficient wheel of statesmanship, How not to do it, in motion.
1	‘--that you had some knowledge of one Blandois, lately killed in London by a violent accident.
1	We passed on in silence and as quickly as we could with such a foot-hold, when some one coming towards us on the narrow pavement, wrapped in a cloak, stopped and stood aside to give me room.
1	The library is deserted, and the fire is sinking low.
1	‘We must return, Neville,’ said Mr. Crisparkle; ‘of course you will be glad to come back to clear yourself?’ ‘Of course, sir.’ ‘Mr.
1	'But I shall be taken in,' he says, 'they won't give me the right change, I shall lose it, it's no use to me.'
1	He is a dissipated, extravagant idler.
1	To which Mrs. Bagnet responds with two pokes.
1	What do you mean by it?
1	Mr. Tupman, when his friends married, and Mr. Pickwick settled, took lodgings at Richmond, where he has ever since resided.
1	Mrs. Bardell’s opinions of the opposite sex, gentlemen, were derived from a long contemplation of the inestimable qualities of her lost husband.
1	It is the lawyer’s term for the restless, whirling mass of cares and anxieties, affections, hopes, and griefs, that make up the living man.
1	This gentleman awakened in Miss Nipper some considerable astonishment; for, having been defeated by the Larkey Boy, his visage was in a state of such great dilapidation, as to be hardly presentable in society with comfort to the beholders.
1	“No,” said I, “I had quite enough of the Finches the last time I was there.” “Was that when we had a difference of opinion?” “Yes,” I replied, very shortly.
1	She never begged nor had a penny of the Union money in all her life.
1	Too much, perhaps, without teaching.
1	Everyone who knows you, consults with you, and is guided by you, Agnes.’ ‘Everyone who knows me, spoils me, I believe,’ she answered, smiling.
1	We had a quiet day on the Sunday, and we rode out into the country, and then walked in the fields.
1	Mr. Snagsby coughs his cough of submission behind his hat.
1	Guilty of a blind and passionate resentment, of which I do not, cannot, will not, even now, repent; but not guilty with that dead man.
1	You have seen what Mr Riah is.
1	‘O you gentlemen, you gentlemen!
1	We offer the best reparation in our power.
1	Isn’t it done every day by all the masters about?
1	As he called Peggotty ‘Lass’, and gave her a hearty smack on the cheek, I had no doubt, from the general propriety of her conduct, that he was her brother; and so he turned out--being presently introduced to me as Mr. Peggotty, the master of the house.
1	On this occasion she was so much disturbed in mind as to find it necessary to open the bedroom door, and make a course for herself, comprising the full extent of the bedrooms from wall to wall; and while Mr. Dick and I sat quietly by the fire, she kept passing in and out, along this measured track, at an unchanging pace, with the regularity of a clock-pendulum.
1	He needn’t wait, Carker.’ ‘You needn’t wait, Gay,’ observed Mr Carker: bare to the gums.
1	Still my advice is so far worth taking, that--in short, that I have never taken it myself, and am the’--here Mr. Micawber, who had been beaming and smiling, all over his head and face, up to the present moment, checked himself and frowned--‘the miserable wretch you behold.’ ‘My dear Micawber!’ urged his wife.
1	The tide, beginning to run down at nine, and being with us until three, we intended still to creep on after it had turned, and row against it until dark.
1	Such a clerk for you, Brass, such a prize, such an ace of trumps.
1	‘What!’ ejaculated Mr. Pickwick, laying his hand upon his note-book.
1	Having rescued the most defenceless of his compatriots from situations of great extremity, he now went his way alone, or as nearly alone as he could be, with a native gentleman in a suit of grease and a cap of the same material, giving chase at a distance of some fifty yards, and continually calling after him, ‘Hi!
1	Stratford--Stratford,’ continued Mrs. Nickleby, considering.
1	He shaded his eyes with his hand; grazed at his opponent, steadfastly, for a few moments; and, then taking the weapon which was tendered to him, bent his eyes upon that, and looked up no more until the word was given, when he instantly fired.
1	His presence is an insult to my sister.
1	But I kept my ground.
1	'So they are,' said the undertaker.
1	My second reason was, that I always hoped there might be some lingering possibility of your brother’s relenting towards you both; and in that case, I felt that where there was the chance of a man of his suspicious, watchful character, discovering that you had been secretly befriended by me, there was the chance of a new and fatal cause of division.
1	'What's the matter here, my dear?'
1	He got from me, through my not knowing where to strike, in the whirling round of the room, and the flashing of flames of fire between us.
1	Unless he dived overboard.’ The informer wiped his brow ruefully as he said it, sitting in his boat and always staring disconsolate.
1	It would not be worth mentioning for its own sake, but I was wakeful and rather low-spirited.
1	‘I only ask of him,’ continued Kate, whose tears fell while she spoke, ‘that he will move so little out of his way, in my behalf, as to enable me by his recommendation--only by his recommendation--to earn, literally, my bread and remain with my mother.
1	‘A conspiracy to defeat the ends of justice, and murder its officers.
1	‘It’s very impolite, I know, but I came to see my poor Sophronia, my only friend.
1	‘Faster, sirrah!’ cried Quilp, looking up at the old gateway, and showing in the moonlight like some monstrous image that had come down from its niche and was casting a backward glance at its old house, ‘faster!’ ‘It’s a dreadful heavy load, Sir,’ the boy pleaded.
1	There happened, by good fortune, to be a lounger really waiting for some one; and he sometimes looked over the railing at the water, and sometimes came to the dark corner and looked up the street, rendering Arthur less conspicuous.
1	When they took a young man into Tellson's London house, they hid him somewhere till he was old.
1	No, Mr. Murdstone, I have not worrited and frightened any sweet creetur to an early grave!’ He eyed her gloomily--remorsefully I thought--for an instant; and said, turning his head towards me, but looking at my feet instead of my face: ‘We are not likely to encounter soon again;--a source of satisfaction to us both, no doubt, for such meetings as this can never be agreeable.
1	"I have had the honour of being employed in high families before, and you have no idea--come, I'll go so far as to say not even YOU have any idea, sir," this to the debilitated cousin, "what games goes on!"
1	‘He says besides,’ she observed, with a slow curling of her lip, ‘that his master, as he hears, is coasting Spain; and this done, is away to gratify his seafaring tastes till he is weary.
1	I see, now, that I might have managed it better.
1	When I had none, I used to look at a venison shop in Fleet Street; or I have strolled, at such a time, as far as Covent Garden Market, and stared at the pineapples.
1	But have you been very dutiful to me?’ ‘I!’ cried the old woman.
1	If my cough takes me, I shall cough out twenty matches afore I gets a light.’ But she finds the candle, and lights it, before the cough comes on.
1	He knows me," said Scrooge, with his hand already on the dining-room lock.
1	‘Mind, I warn you, that I think it will surprise you!’ More attention and concentration came into John Jasper’s eyes as they caught sight of Mr. Grewgious smoothing his head again, and again looking at the fire; but now, with a compressed and determined mouth.
1	Let me see, what was I--oh yes, I know.
1	what rainbow silks and satins!
1	I saw in him when he first came here, almost my other self.’ ‘Your other self!’ repeated the Manager, disdainfully.
1	They found Mr. Pickwick, in company with Jingle, talking very earnestly, and not bestowing a look on the groups who were congregated on the racket-ground; they were very motley groups too, and worth the looking at, if it were only in idle curiosity.
1	‘Settle it between yourselves, settle it between yourselves.’ ‘No, but I must beg you as a favour,’ said Madame Mantalini, ‘to hear me give him notice of what it is my fixed intention to do--my fixed intention, sir,’ repeated Madame Mantalini, darting an angry look at her husband.
1	“Two can go up town.
1	We tapped at the door and went in.
1	Come to our honest friend.’ He led him to the post of watch, and they both dropped down and crept under the lee of the boat; a better shelter than it had seemed before, being directly contrasted with the blowing wind and the bare night.
1	She is a thing of light, and airiness, and joy.
1	Little Dorrit with a cry of pleasure put her arms about her father’s neck, and kissed him again and again.
1	She will be,’ in his fatal freshness he seems to find perpetual verdure and eternal youth in the phrase, ‘she will be so glad of the opportunity, I am sure!’ In the meantime, Mrs Podsnap, unable to originate a mistake on her own account, because Mrs Veneering is the only other lady there, does her best in the way of handsomely supporting her husband’s, by looking towards Mr Twemlow with a plaintive countenance and remarking to Mrs Veneering in a feeling manner, firstly, that she fears he has been rather bilious of late, and, secondly, that the baby is already very like him.
1	‘He got a curiosity to go and taste the beer at a new public-house over the way, and it wos such a wery nice parlour, that he took it into his head to go there every night, which he did for a long time, always comin’ back reg’lar about a quarter of an hour afore the gate shut, which was all wery snug and comfortable.
1	When I first came here, and ever since, I am sure I have tried to be as much your friend, as one of my age could presume to be; but it has been of no use.
1	A little reservation I fear I must confess to.
1	The two gentlemen having, by the greediness with which this little bait was swallowed, tested the extent of Mrs. Wititterly’s appetite for adulation, proceeded to administer that commodity in very large doses, thus affording to Sir Mulberry Hawk an opportunity of pestering Miss Nickleby with questions and remarks, to which she was absolutely obliged to make some reply.
1	Quiet being again restored, a delicious half-hour--so Frank called it, in the course of subsequent conversation with Tim Linkinwater as they were walking home--was spent in conversation, and Tim’s watch at length apprising him that it was high time to depart, the ladies were left alone, though not without many offers on the part of Frank to remain until Nicholas arrived, no matter what hour of the night it might be, if, after the late neighbourly irruption, they entertained the least fear of being left to themselves.
1	And when a man with bulgy legs, and a rough voice, and a heavy basket on his head that crushed his hat into a mere black muffin, came crying flowers down Princess’s Place, making his timid little roots of daisies shudder in the vibration of every yell he gave, as though he had been an ogre, hawking little children, summer recollections were so strong upon Miss Tox, that she shook her head, and murmured she would be comparatively old before she knew it--which seemed likely.
1	You may depend upon it that this means something besides dinner.’ ‘Tea and supper, perhaps,’ suggested Nicholas.
1	He had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that.
1	They enable Allegory, though it has cheeks like peaches, and knees like bunches of blossoms, and rosy swellings for calves to its legs and muscles to its arms, to look tolerably cool to-night.
1	Blandois accepted the commission with his own free elegance of manner, and swore he would discharge it before he was an hour older.
1	I was not mistaken; for the mop came into the schoolroom before long, and turned out Mr. Mell and me, who lived where we could, and got on how we could, for some days, during which we were always in the way of two or three young women, who had rarely shown themselves before, and were so continually in the midst of dust that I sneezed almost as much as if Salem House had been a great snuff-box.
1	‘I have used no such expressions.’ ‘If you refer, then, to the poorness of your blood—’ ‘Brought upon me,’ stipulated the Billickin, expressly, ‘at a boarding-school—’ ‘Then,’ resumed Miss Twinkleton, ‘all I can say is, that I am bound to believe, on your asseveration, that it is very poor indeed.
1	Here is Mr. Micawber, with a variety of qualifications, with great talent--I should say, with genius, but that may be the partiality of a wife--’ Traddles and I both murmured ‘No.’ ‘And here is Mr. Micawber without any suitable position or employment.
1	To these were added such considerations as the constant residence of Mr. Squeers at a long distance from London, which rendered his association with Mrs Sliderskew a mere masquerading frolic, in which nobody was likely to recognise him, either at the time or afterwards; the impossibility of Ralph’s undertaking the task himself, he being already known to her by sight; and various comments on the uncommon tact and experience of Mr Squeers: which would make his overreaching one old woman a mere matter of child’s play and amusement.
1	First, the little Scotch lady before mentioned, on her way to join her husband at New York, who had settled there three years before.
1	They were but an atom, here, in a mountain heap of misery, the very sight of which increased their hopelessness and suffering.
1	We will walk forward at once.’ Having given this direction, and settled with the coachman, Mr. Pickwick and his three friends struck into the footpath across the fields, and walked briskly away, leaving Mr. Weller and the fat boy confronted together for the first time.
1	"My dear son," said Mr. Turveydrop, "and dear daughter, I have done my duty.
1	To my surprise, I heard no more about it for some two or three weeks, though I was sufficiently interested in the result of his endeavours; descrying a strange gleam of good sense--I say nothing of good feeling, for that he always exhibited--in the conclusion to which he had come.
1	I have not the power of counting.
1	As the brother and sister stood side by side, with a gallant bearing which became them well, a close likeness between them was apparent, which many, had they only seen them apart, might have failed to remark.
1	“I am glad you have so much of the Englishman in you, though I wish you had never taken that cold in your voice,” said Miss Pross, approvingly.
1	‘Precisely so,’ assented Mrs. Micawber.
1	Come, Steerforth, let’s explore the polar regions, and have it over.’ She then selected two or three of the little instruments, and a little bottle, and asked (to my surprise) if the table would bear.
1	And, with the blessing of fate and fortune, I’ll go on improving that woman’s acquaintance until I have given her maid, before her eyes, things from my dressmaker’s ten times as handsome and expensive as she once gave me from hers!’ Little Dorrit was silent; sensible that she was not to be heard on any question affecting the family dignity, and unwilling to lose to no purpose her sister’s newly and unexpectedly restored favour.
1	But, he went his way, and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the prison wall.
1	And why shouldn’t he, if he thinks proper!’ I said: ‘Certainly, aunt.’ ‘It’s not a business-like way of speaking,’ said my aunt, ‘nor a worldly way.
1	"Tell me that you are better to-day."
1	So if you will walk round and round here with me, we can lock ourselves in and I can tell you comfortably what I wanted to see your dear good face about."
1	However, I loved her faithfully; and one time I went home with her for the holidays.
1	If I have said too much, or more than I meant, what of it?
1	Wait till you are a woman, and don’t talk about what you don’t understand.
1	‘You take her with you!’ She answered for him, with a burst of tears.
1	I do not deny that he is improvident.
1	It was a pleasant key to touch, for Mr. Peggotty suddenly burst into a roar of laughter, and rubbed his hands up and down his legs, as he had been accustomed to do when he enjoyed himself in the long-shipwrecked boat.
1	Because I’m ruined, my dear!’ If the house, and every one of us, had tumbled out into the river together, I could hardly have received a greater shock.
1	When he withdrew into the room again, he said ‘Poor creatures!’ in a tone of much pity for their miserable condition.
1	I done it for his money.
1	Pray consider everything yours that you find upon the--upon the body.
1	‘Be so kind as to keep the door open a moment, Chivery, that I may see him go along the passage and down the steps.
1	‘That’s enough for me,’ she replied, with great earnestness and interest of manner.
1	So unspoilt, so simple, such a good soul!
1	Would the gentleman give him his card, as he had seen him first?
1	As the schoolmaster, after arranging the two forms in due order, took his seat behind his desk and made other preparations for school, the child was apprehensive that she might be in the way, and offered to withdraw to her little bedroom.
1	'What,' cried the young lady, 'can be the end of this poor creature's life!'
1	‘I’m only too glad not to speak in this house, excepting when and where I’m spoke to, sir; and with regard to being a female, sir, I should wish to know what you considered yourself?’ ‘A miserable wretch,’ exclaimed Mr. Knag, striking his forehead.
1	Some such picture, with no real world in it, bright with the light of our innocence, and vague as the stars afar off, was in my mind all the way.
1	‘Ah, sister, why do you turn away your face?’ Nell could not help following at a little distance.
1	I tried over and over again in my own room at night, but I could not write an answer that at all began like a good answer, so I thought each night I would wait one more day.
1	Then she began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door; and he, nothing loth to go, accompanied her.
1	He now told him to go on again and said to me, after considering within himself for a few moments, that he had made up his mind how to proceed.
1	I was not made the less so by my sense of being daily more and more shut out and alienated from my mother.
1	He walked slowly on; and shunning the roadside like a guilty man, turned into a meadow he well remembered; and covering his face with his hands, threw himself upon the grass.
1	‘You on the top of a pair of steps with the phenomenon in an attitude; “Farewell!” on a transparency behind; and nine people at the wings with a squib in each hand--all the dozen and a half going off at once--it would be very grand--awful from the front, quite awful.’ As Nicholas appeared by no means impressed with the solemnity of the proposed effect, but, on the contrary, received the proposition in a most irreverent manner, and laughed at it very heartily, Mr. Crummles abandoned the project in its birth, and gloomily observed that they must make up the best bill they could with combats and hornpipes, and so stick to the legitimate drama.
1	A man can't starve; at least I can't.
1	‘I lie here, sometimes, thinking I should like to live until I had had a little time to show you how grateful I could be!
1	‘Now, wait a bit, Boffin; there’s something more.
1	The Brigand, heretofore a source of exclusive interest in the streets, became a mere secondary consideration, and to be important only as a part of the show of which she was the chief attraction.
1	Take your hat off.’ With this, Mr. Weller, in the most dexterous manner, knocked Mr. Namby’s hat to the other side of the room, with such violence, that he had very nearly caused him to swallow the gold toothpick into the bargain.
1	‘It may be out of the ordinary course, and yet be business.
1	How the fascinating Tippins gets on when arraying herself for the bewilderment of the senses of men, is known only to the Graces and her maid; but perhaps even that engaging creature, though not reduced to the self-dependence of Twemlow could dispense with a good deal of the trouble attendant on the daily restoration of her charms, seeing that as to her face and neck this adorable divinity is, as it were, a diurnal species of lobster--throwing off a shell every forenoon, and needing to keep in a retired spot until the new crust hardens.
1	Now, Mr. Jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of brambles which were not as high as her face; but which she could not have got through and kept her hands out of; and bits of those brambles were actually found in her skin and put in evidence, as well as the fact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have been broken through, and to have little shreds of her dress and little spots of blood upon them here and there.
1	I wants to go there and be berried.
1	‘Call in all the servants,’ cried old Wardle, interposing to prevent the public rebuke which Mr. Weller would otherwise most indubitably have received from his master.
1	I apprehend the girl’s fortune will be very small; Henry might have done much better; there is scarcely anything to compensate for the connection: still, he acts for himself; and if I find no improvement within a short time, I see no other course than to resign myself and make the best of these people.
1	‘O, I never can forgive the wanton cruelty of Uncle!’ ‘My dear,’ said Mr Dorrit, recovering his tone, though he remained unusually pale, ‘I must request you not to say so.
1	‘Why don’t you go down and knock ‘em every one downstairs?
1	Nevertheless, in the Seraphic creature with the haymaking rake, were clearly to be discerned the rudiments of the Patriarch with the list shoes.
1	“If it warn't for me you'd have been to the churchyard long ago, and stayed there.
1	Alone, in a sequestered place, surrounded by vestiges of old time and decay, it rather has a tendency to call a shudder into being.
1	In consequence of which his buttons became more importunate of public notice than before, with the exception of two or three about the region of the waistband, which modestly withdrew into a creasy retirement.
1	Now I will, now I will.
1	Which so tickled the spectators, that they laughed almost as heartily as Master Bates could have done if he had heard the request.
1	I looks like a sort of compo of every one on ‘em.
1	The way was as free to him as to any man living, but he no sooner raised his head and caught sight of it, all shining in the light, than, with the involuntary instinct of a prisoner, he cast away his spade, scampered off as fast as his legs would carry him, and never once looked back.
1	I repudiate, for the moment, my politeness, and say, Lies, lies, lies.
1	“The citizeness is superb!” croaked the Juryman.
1	If he says yes, and asks you where the ashes are, refer him to Wilkins Micawber, and he will hear of something not at all to his advantage!’ The triumphant flourish with which Mr. Micawber delivered himself of these words, had a powerful effect in alarming the mother; who cried out, in much agitation: ‘Ury, Ury!
1	I think it’s five-and- twenty, but I don’t rightly know vether it ain’t more.’ ‘Well; that’s pretty well,’ said Sam.
1	‘’Cos ugliness and svindlin’ never ought to be formiliar with elegance and wirtew,’ replied Mr. Weller.
1	The clock ticks over the fireplace, the weather-glass hangs in the hall.
1	‘No,’ replied Mr. Crummles, shaking his head, ‘far from it--far from it.’ ‘I pity them,’ observed Mrs. Crummles.
1	Mr. Tulkinghorn, an indistinct form against the dark street now dotted with lamps, looms in my Lady's view, bigger and blacker than before.
1	He was half way through it, when he again stopped with his glass in his hand, hearing the sound of wheels.
1	‘Undraw the curtains, my dear girl,’ said Eugene, after a while, ‘and let us see our wedding-day.’ The sun was rising, and his first rays struck into the room, as she came back, and put her lips to his.
1	Still, it must be remembered that to support an existence there during many years, required a certain combination of qualities--he did not say high qualities, but qualities--moral qualities.
1	How he rather supposed himself to have pursued the idea into its next degree, because there was something uncommon in the quiet little seamstress, which pleased him and provoked his curiosity.
1	I have had occasion to notice many hands; but I never saw stronger in that respect, man's or woman's, than these.” While he said these words in a leisurely, critical style, she continued to look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat.
1	Seeing, as she patted the pillow into its place on the bolster, that he was still looking at her as if waiting for the rest of her reply, she gave it a great poke in the middle, and asked, ‘How could I help myself?’ ‘How could you help yourself from being married!’ ‘O’ course,’ said Mrs Flintwinch.
1	Whenever the coach stops, and you can hear the voices of the inside passengers; or whenever any bystander addresses them, or any one among them; or they address each other; you will hear one phrase repeated over and over and over again to the most extraordinary extent.
1	Was one of those voices Pickwick’s?’ ‘Yes, it were, Sir.’ And Mrs. Cluppins, after distinctly stating that Mr. Pickwick addressed himself to Mrs. Bardell, repeated by slow degrees, and by dint of many questions, the conversation with which our readers are already acquainted.
1	"I have squared it with the lad," says Mr. Bucket, returning, "and it's all right.
1	The tide is low, and seems to have thrown them together high on the bare shore.
1	I want you to marry the widow.” ‘“Me, Sir!” said Tom.
1	The first object with which they had an association, or of which they had a remembrance, was a large black board with a dry Ogre chalking ghastly white figures on it.
1	‘Mrs Dombey becomes a secondary consideration, when we are both in question, I imagine,’ said Mr Dombey.
1	‘Begin by believing that I will try to make you happy, and that I am prepared to love you, Florence.
1	‘It is there with the express intention that everything shall be left alone.
1	His garments and outward appearance.
1	‘I ain’t a person to live with them as has had money left.
1	I shouldn’t be surprised for one.’ ‘You are quite a philosopher, Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	There was a tacit understanding between him and the men into whose hands they originally went--and from whom I have by degrees purchased the whole, for treble and quadruple their nominal value--that these loans should be from time to time renewed, until a given period had elapsed.
1	“I am my own engineer, and my own carpenter, and my own plumber, and my own gardener, and my own Jack of all Trades,” said Wemmick, in acknowledging my compliments.
1	"There is not much to see here," said I.
1	"And Mat blows away at his bassoon, and you're respectable civilians one and all," says Mr. George.
1	There is no confusion or failure in my memory; it can recall, and could detail, every word that was ever spoken between me and those brothers.
1	"That was not my meaning," returns Sir Leicester.
1	Trundle had a couple of pair, and the fat boy announced that there were half a dozen more downstairs; whereat Mr. Winkle expressed exquisite delight, and looked exquisitely uncomfortable.
1	She took it, and I’ll follow it.
1	But though Peggotty’s eye wanders, she is much offended if mine does, and frowns to me, as I stand upon the seat, that I am to look at the clergyman.
1	I’ll go and fetch ‘em.’ After being some time absent, as if in his covetousness he could hardly make up his mind to produce the treasure to his partner, he returned with an old leathern hat-box, into which he had put the other box, for the better preservation of commonplace appearances, and for the disarming of suspicion.
1	May you repent of it, sir, and live to know better!’ She was so very earnest and injured, that Mr. Gradgrind, shocked by the possibility which dawned upon him, said in a gentler tone: ‘Do you deny, then, madam, that you left your son to—to be brought up in the gutter?’ ‘Josiah in the gutter!’ exclaimed Mrs. Pegler.
1	But--’ ‘Eh!’ said Mr Boffin.
1	I never should have been got into my present state if I hadn’t come here.
1	However, she had no right to be offended of course.
1	Now, the fact was, that at that particular moment, John Browdie was sitting on the bed with the reddest face ever seen, cramming the corner of the pillow into his mouth, to prevent his roaring out loud with laughter.
1	Mr Dorrit, dressing-gowned and newspapered, was at his breakfast.
1	I was such a shy little thing that I seldom dared to open my lips, and never dared to open my heart, to anybody else.
1	I should be surprised if he could.
1	Then why go into subjects, old chap, which as betwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary?
1	She watched his face as earnestly as he watched the river.
1	Through the beaming smile with which he regarded me as he reasoned thus, there now broke forth a look of disinterested benevolence quite astonishing.
1	She lay there with one arm creeping round a bar of the iron gate and seeming to embrace it.
1	But I owe it to Mr. Neville, and to Mr. Neville’s sister (and in a much lower degree to myself), to say to you that I _know_ I was in the full possession and understanding of Mr. Neville’s mind and heart at the time of this occurrence; and that, without in the least colouring or concealing what was to be deplored in him and required to be corrected, I feel certain that his tale is true.
1	The atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins.
1	‘You have disregarded all my quiet interference in the miserable lad’s behalf,’ said Nicholas; ‘you have returned no answer to the letter in which I begged forgiveness for him, and offered to be responsible that he would remain quietly here.
1	Then, wot with undertakers, and wot with parish clerks, and wot with sextons, and wot with private watchmen (all awaricious and all in it), a man wouldn't get much by it, even if it wos so.
1	"Then you must bring him some evening which is not a Parent Society night, or a Branch night, or a Ramification night.
1	‘Breakfast, breakfast.’ No second invitation was required.
1	‘Here they are,’ said Mr. Pickwick; and, as he spoke, the forms of Mr. Tupman, Mr. Snodgrass, and Mr. Winkle appeared in the distance.
1	Richard too remained in a thoughtful state; fearing every moment to hear the Marchioness impeached, and unable to resist the conviction that she must be guilty.
1	"I remember the young lady very well.
1	"No, indeed, cousin John," said Ada, "I am sure I could not--I am sure I would not--think any ill of Richard if the whole world did.
1	We were obliged to say that we had not the pleasure of Mr. Gusher's acquaintance.
1	He did not venture, therefore, to advance towards her; but the door by which he had entered was behind him, and he stepped back to lock it.
1	When he had closed the door, he re-opened it, stared in again for a few moments with the same portentous gravity, and nodding his head once, in a slow and ghost-like manner, vanished.
1	Mr. Creakle’s face was fiery, and his eyes were small, and deep in his head; he had thick veins in his forehead, a little nose, and a large chin.
1	The old fireside had smiled upon that same sweet face; it had passed, like a dream, through haunts of misery and care; at the door of the poor schoolmaster on the summer evening, before the furnace fire upon the cold wet night, at the still bedside of the dying boy, there had been the same mild lovely look.
1	But I say; wa’at be a’ this aboot schoolmeasther?’ ‘You know it then?’ said Nicholas.
1	Now, ducky, ducky, ducky, come to Mrs.
1	Forgive me for having ever darkened your dark home--I am a shadow on it, I know well--and let us never speak of this again.’ ‘Mama,’ sobbed Florence, ‘we are not to part?’ ‘We do this that we may not part,’ said Edith.
1	Poor Kate was well-nigh distracted on the receipt of four closely-written and closely-crossed sides of congratulation on the very subject which had prevented her closing her eyes all night, and kept her weeping and watching in her chamber; still worse and more trying was the necessity of rendering herself agreeable to Mrs. Wititterly, who, being in low spirits after the fatigue of the preceding night, of course expected her companion (else wherefore had she board and salary?)
1	And who,’ he added convincingly, ‘must be a low-minded thief, you know, or he never could have conducted himself as he did.’ ‘And see,’ said Miss Fanny, ‘see what is involved in this!
1	Good-night.’ Excusing himself, in these terms, from joining in the festivities, Nicholas took a most winning farewell of Mrs. Kenwigs and the other ladies, and retired, after making a very extraordinary impression upon the company.
1	Good night, and Heaven send our journey may have a prosperous ending!’ Kit was no sluggard next morning, but, springing from his bed some time before day, began to prepare for his welcome expedition.
1	He’d carry me up with him.
1	‘Oh, it’s very hard upon a cove, Captain,’ cried the tender Rob, injured and indignant in a moment, ‘that he can’t give lawful warning, without being frowned at in that way, and called a deserter.
1	Mr. Pickwick’s upright and honourable bearing, coupled with that force and energy of speech which so eminently distinguished him, would have carried conviction to any reasonable mind; but, unfortunately, at that particular moment, the mind of Mr. Peter Magnus was in anything but reasonable order.
1	But, the Reverend Frank, inclining to the belief that they were required to do one or two other things (say out of nine-and-thirty) calculated to trouble their consciences rather more if they would think as much about them, held his peace.
1	That’s the little fellow, Ma’am, that was the innocent cause of so much.’ ‘This here, Ma’am,’ said Toodle, ‘is him with the short legs--and they was,’ said Mr Toodle, with a touch of poetry in his tone, ‘unusual short for leathers--as Mr Dombey made a Grinder on.’ The recollection almost overpowered Miss Tox.
1	You nodded to me, sir?’ ‘Pooh, pooh, nonsense.
1	My Lady's figure begins to be expressive of some attention.
1	‘Not much to boast of.’ ‘In-deed!’ said Wegg: ‘sorry, partner, that you’re not picking up faster, but your soul’s too large for your body, sir; that’s where it is.
1	You are not worth the favour I have shown you.
1	'As He is good and merciful, she will live to bless us all, for years to come.'
1	“Gentlemen--my wife!” The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with three flourishes.
1	‘Glad to know what?’ ‘Anything--so that it was no harm--about Miss Nell.’ ‘Would she?
1	My dear, I shall be happy to take some of this wine with you.
1	O let us be joyful, joyful!
1	Captain Cuttle does a little Business for the Young people    18.
1	‘Have you seen our friend?’ ‘You mean Miss Tox,’ retorted Mr Dombey.
1	Nothing can make us stranger to each other than we are henceforth.’ ‘I shall take my rightful course, Madam,’ said Mr Dombey, ‘undeterred, you may be sure, by any general declamation.’ She turned her back upon him, and, without reply, sat down before her glass.
1	‘I want to know,’ said Arthur Clennam, who had made up his mind to persistence in one short form of words, ‘the precise nature of the claim of the Crown against a prisoner for debt, named Dorrit.’ ‘I say.
1	I fear to approach it.
1	‘Water them now,’ said Mr. Tupman, in accents of persuasion.
1	“There's something worth spending in that there book, dear boy.
1	My guardian stood before me, contemplating the birds, and I had no need to look beyond him.
1	‘Ring the alarm bell, somebody!’ cried a dozen voices.
1	‘If she should make her way to London, which is likely--for where could she lose herself so readily as in this vast city; and what would she wish to do, but lose and hide herself, if she does not go home?--’ ‘And she won’t go home,’ he interposed, shaking his head mournfully.
1	I myself had not been at home many hours, when I received her—here, in this room.
1	Do you hope to move me by your tears?
1	‘Let him deny it,’ said Steerforth.
1	The hungry creature answered with a faint ‘No.’  They were evidently going through an established form.
1	I come here to-night to tell you so much of what I know, and no more.’ Mr Riderhood, with his crooked eye upon his visitor, meditated for some moments, and then refilled his glass, and tipped the contents down his throat in three tips.
1	Faster!” ‘They whirled past the dark trees, as feathers would be swept before a hurricane.
1	The servile rapacity of the French officials is sufficiently contemptible; but there is a surly boorish incivility about our men, alike disgusting to all persons who fall into their hands, and discreditable to the nation that keeps such ill-conditioned curs snarling about its gates.
1	Much good it has ever done you!"
1	It being all spent, he said, rising: “So far, we have spoken before these two, because it was as well that the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me.
1	I have some business there that must be looked to directly," Mrs. Rouncewell answers.
1	“Apparently the Citizen-Doctor is not in his right mind?
1	‘Damme, Sir,’ said the Major, ‘he’s a prince, is my friend Dombey in the City.
1	‘Does Mr. Traddles live here?’ I then inquired.
1	And his watch is a gold repeater, and worth a hundred pound if it's worth a penny.
1	The Fellowships must not have a taint upon it that may give it a bad name.

1	‘Our first and last confidence is at an end.
1	‘When I come to any town,’ he pursued, ‘I found the inn, and waited about the yard till someone turned up (someone mostly did) as know’d English.

1	As to daily news, there is no dearth of that commodity.
1	And now, Nicholas began to see that hope was gone, and that, upon the partner of his poverty, and the sharer of his better fortune, the world was closing fast.
1	The old man had a daughter, and the young men a sister; and all the five were poor.
1	Early in the morning, Little Dorrit, leaving Maggy in high domestic trust, set off for the Patriarchal tent.
1	The sittings, I need hardly add, take place in the day; and the parliamentary forms are modelled on those of the old country.
1	‘My friend, how is it possible for me to tell how long you are to lie here?
1	‘The feeling does you a great deal of honour,’ replied Mr. Pickwick; ‘but it is your duty, nevertheless.’ ‘I know it is my duty, Sir,’ replied Job, with great emotion.
1	‘We could be more natural I suppose if we tried?’ said Mrs Skewton.
1	Rip it open and let’s have some!’ This, and many offers to lend him a knife for the purpose, exasperated him to such a degree, that the whole day was a succession of rushes on his part, and flights on the part of the boys.
1	I try in vain to recall how I felt about it, and what its circumstances were; but it is not momentous in my recollection.
1	Sir Mulberry turned away to speak to one of his own party, and feigned not to hear.
1	Spies are hovering about in every direction.
1	‘The whole world knows that, I presume.
1	They must be informed of this.
1	In another minute we were outside the gate, and it was locked, and Estella was gone.
1	‘Come, mother, you hear what he says,’ she interposed, in her stern voice, and with an impatient action of her head; ‘try him once more, and if you fall out with him again, ruin him, if you like, and have done with him.’ Mrs Brown, moved as it seemed by this very tender exhortation, presently began to howl; and softening by degrees, took the apologetic Grinder to her arms, who embraced her with a face of unutterable woe, and like a victim as he was, resumed his former seat, close by the side of his venerable friend, whom he suffered, not without much constrained sweetness of countenance, combating very expressive physiognomical revelations of an opposite character to draw his arm through hers, and keep it there.
1	The water-jug is plunging and leaping like a lively dolphin; all the smaller articles are afloat, except my shoes, which are stranded on a carpet-bag, high and dry, like a couple of coal-barges.
1	I may have said to one or two friends that she wos a very divine creechure, and had refused one or two offers without any hobvus cause, but--no, no, no, indeed, Tuckle--before strangers, too--it’s not right-- you shouldn’t.
1	He was her guardian henceforth, and the boy's; and he had an old association with the name.
1	I think I see him now!’ said Mrs. Nickleby, wiping her eyes, ‘looking at me while I was talking to him about his affairs, just as if his ideas were in a state of perfect conglomeration!
1	Lastly, came my Lord himself, turning the suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner.
1	Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
1	"You're wanted at the Dedlock Arms."
1	My dear girl had a cottage piano there and quietly sat down to sing some of Richard's favourites, the lamp being first removed into the next room, as he complained of its hurting his eyes.
1	Neither did my aunt; who must have walked, at various times, a hundred miles in her uncertainty.
1	It was nothing that the decree bore date since his return to France.
1	This description must be received with a week-day limitation.
1	The state in which her dresses were, and the extraordinary confusion in which she kept them, added not a little to our difficulty; but at length we devised something not very unlike what a common-place mother might wear on such an occasion.
1	We got into such a chatty state that night, through Ada and my guardian drawing me out to tell them all about Caddy, that I went on prose, prose, prosing for a length of time.
1	Uriah threw the ball to Mrs. Heep, Mrs. Heep caught it and threw it back to Uriah, Uriah kept it up a little while, then sent it back to Mrs. Heep, and so they went on tossing it about until I had no idea who had got it, and was quite bewildered.
1	It is true I have no longer to maintain a dear grandmother who died in her hundred and second year, but enough remains to render it indispensable that the mill should be always going."
1	This occupation was, to take down from the shelves of a worm-eaten wardrobe a quantity of frouzy garments, one by one; to subject each to a careful and minute inspection by holding it up against the light, and after folding it with great exactness, to lay it on one or other of two little heaps beside him.
1	What a man it is!
1	You’ll not forget my directions, Miss Knag?’ Miss Knag of course replied, that to forget anything Madame Mantalini had directed, was a moral impossibility; and that lady, dispensing a general good-morning among her assistants, sailed away.
1	You're a pattern, you know, that's what you are," said Mr. Bucket warmly; "you're a pattern."
1	Always my favourite, and my favourite still, where have you been these cruel years and years?
1	‘Left with the letter;--a boy brought them--quarter of an hour ago, or less.’ Ralph glanced at the direction, opened the letter, and read as follows:-- ‘You are known to me now.
1	Young John was gentle likewise.
1	‘It won’t break my heart,’ laughed Eugene; ‘it won’t stay by me eight-and-forty hours; but I am genuinely disappointed.
1	One man on horseback seemed to be among the crowd; for there was the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven pavement.
1	He bent over the group in a caressing way and clearly was regarded as a friend by the children, though his face retained its stern character and his manner to us was as rude as it could be.
1	It was quite an edifying little picture to be hung on the line in the National Gallery.
1	The various sounds arising from this scene of depravity, and floating away into the still evening air, made the evening, at any point which they just reached fitfully, mellowed by the distance, more still by contrast.
1	If there is a word in the dictionary under any letter from A to Z that I abominate, it is energy.

1	“There's no one nigh,” said he, looking over his shoulder; “is there?” “Why do you, a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night, ask that question?” said I.
1	There was music playing here and there, but it did not enliven the case.
1	Come into the parlour, sir, please.'
1	He said I wasn’t at all what he expected, and so he married his housekeeper.’ ‘And what did you do?’ I asked.
1	'You may stop here, if you think it safe,' returned the person addressed, after some hesitation.

1	‘This man is leaving a letter for Mr Lightwood,’ the watchman explained, showing it in his hand; ‘and I was mentioning that a person had just gone up to Mr Lightwood’s chambers.
1	You doen’t know half the change that’s come, in course of time, upon me, when you think it likely.
1	But I was much afraid, when I observed the good-natured manner in which he went down with the cap in his hand, and gave Mrs. Micawber his arm, that he would be carried into the Money Market neck and heels.
1	He caused his bedstead to be moved out nearer to the window when he heard it was such inclement weather, and his head to be so adjusted that he could see the driving snow and sleet.
1	There was nobody to look at her now, and nobody for her to look at, so she went in at once to search for the treasured shadow.
1	How came you to get into such company as that little witch’s?’ ‘By chance at first, as it seemed, Charley.
1	Still England has been some weeks in the dismal strait of having no pilot (as was well observed by Sir Leicester Dedlock) to weather the storm; and the marvellous part of the matter is that England has not appeared to care very much about it, but has gone on eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage as the old world did in the days before the flood.
1	‘Why what in the deyvle’s name, Hawk, have you and Nickleby been talking about?’ said the young man.
1	Mr. Pickwick felt a great deal too much touched by the warmth of Sam’s attachment, to be able to exhibit any manifestation of anger or displeasure at the precipitate course he had adopted, in voluntarily consigning himself to a debtor’s prison for an indefinite period.
1	“Yes,” said a voice from the darkness beneath.
1	And so, as you have honoured me by anticipating, I examined the document.
1	‘Then knock him downstairs, and tell him not to presume to get up till I come and kick him,’ rejoined Mr. Mivins; with this prompt advice that excellent gentleman again betook himself to slumber.
1	To be out of harm’s way he prudently thinks is something too, and therefore he accepts your brother’s offer.
1	We supposed he had now eased his mind, and told the worst he knew of the cook; but, a day or two afterwards, his conscience sustained a new twinge, and he disclosed how she had a little girl, who, early every morning, took away our bread; and also how he himself had been suborned to maintain the milkman in coals.
1	‘Then, dreams of their young, happy life--happy to him though laden with pain and early care--visited his pillow yet oftener than before; and every night, a boy again, he was at his brother’s side.
1	Never happy otherwise.’ ‘Do you mean the Marseilles people?’ ‘I mean the French people.
1	Why I fail in my ability to finish it, I cannot explain.
1	Open that bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value of it.
1	This, sir, is the building from which I have so often seen those great creatures, Miss Elizabeth, Master George, Aunt Jane, and Uncle Parker’--whose very names were of his own inventing--‘pass and repass!
1	It was, by this time, within an hour of noon, and although a dense vapour still enveloped the city they had left, as if the very breath of its busy people hung over their schemes of gain and profit, and found greater attraction there than in the quiet region above, in the open country it was clear and fair.
1	“Yes, Pip, dear boy, I've made a gentleman on you!
1	But Rob had no occasion to shave, was not brushed, and wore the clothes he had on for a long time past, beyond all possibility of a mistake.
1	‘He’s on his feet.’ ‘You’re sure he is?’ said Quilp.
1	And, even then, she never thought or spoke about him, but with something of her old, clear, merry laugh.
1	‘As quick as possible,’ said I.
1	Em’ly, indeed, said little all the evening; but she looked, and listened, and her face got animated, and she was charming.
1	'What I shall have to say, has already presented itself to your mind; the most cherished hopes of my heart are not unknown to you, though from my lips you have not heard them stated.'
1	He made no reply, but walked on with a lowering face.
1	Am I right, Jacques?” “You are right, Jacques,” was the response of Monsieur Defarge.
1	Within view was the peaceful river and the ferry-boat, to moralise to all the inmates saying: Young or old, passionate or tranquil, chafing or content, you, thus runs the current always.

1	The lamplighter is skipping up and down his ladder on Mr. Tulkinghorn's side of the Fields when that high-priest of noble mysteries arrives at his own dull court-yard.
1	The young gentleman, to my knowledge, is brought to a dead halt."
1	It was not for his dignity to notice it; his contemptuous eyes passed over her, and over all the other rats; and he leaned back in his seat again, and gave the word “Go on!” He was driven on, and other carriages came whirling by in quick succession; the Minister, the State-Projector, the Farmer-General, the Doctor, the Lawyer, the Ecclesiastic, the Grand Opera, the Comedy, the whole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous flow, came whirling by.
1	‘Only it isn’t easy for a person to know where to begin, when a person is in this state of delight and happiness.

1	But she’s an affable lady.’ The visitors glanced at the long boy, who seemed to indicate by a broader stare of his mouth and eyes that in him Sloppy stood confessed.
1	Who is that fellow?’ ‘A friend of our host’s.
1	I'll engage there's no tar in that:” so, the sergeant thanked him and said that as he preferred his drink without tar, he would take wine, if it was equally convenient.
1	I, R. W. Forasmuch, Gruff and Glum, as John and Bella have consented together in holy wedlock, you may (in short) consider it done, and withdraw your two wooden legs from this temple.

1	Before my twenty-second birthday, it was all found out; and then, Walter, from all men’s society, I died.’ Again his last few words hung trembling upon Walter’s lips, but he could neither utter them, nor any of his own.

1	‘As a two-footed creature;--I object on principle, as a two-footed creature, to being constantly referred to insects and four-footed creatures.
1	Crawling forth, from day to day, to some green sunny spot, they have had such memories wakened up within them by the sight of the sky, and hill and plain, and glistening water, that a foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline, and they have sunk into their tombs, as peacefully as the sun whose setting they watched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours before, faded from their dim and feeble sight!
1	His voice is deep and good, his face and figure are good, his manner is a little sombre.
1	‘I found,’ said the single gentleman, ‘you most unaccountably, in possession of everything that had so recently belonged to another man, and that other man, who up to the time of your entering upon his property had been looked upon as affluent, reduced to sudden beggary, and driven from house and home.’ ‘We had warrant for what we did, my good sir,’ rejoined Quilp, ‘we had our warrant.
1	‘Don’t you see I am dressed for the purpose?’ Mr. Pickwick called attention to his speckled silk stockings, and smartly tied pumps.
1	The frequency of the inscriptions, ‘Old Dorrit,’ and ‘Dirty Dick,’ in combination, suggested intentions of personality on the part Of Mr Cripples’s pupils.
1	At the end of the passage, while the bell was still reverberating, I found Sarah Pocket, who appeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason of me.
1	We were in a solitary place, and he put his hands before his eyes and sobbed as he said the words.
1	‘My good Mr. Copperfield!’ said Tiffey, laying his hand upon my arm, and shutting up both his eyes as he shook his head: ‘if you had been in the Commons as long as I have, you would know that there is no subject on which men are so inconsistent, and so little to be trusted.’ ‘Why, bless my soul, he made that very remark!’ I replied persistently.
1	I was rich; and when I married the girl, I saw a smile of triumph play upon the faces of her needy relatives, as they thought of their well-planned scheme, and their fine prize.

1	When the coach was almost ready and Richard ran down to look after his luggage, he spoke to me about him.

1	Even Short seemed to change in this respect, and to mingle with his good-nature something of a desire to keep them in safe custody.
1	cried Noah, with well-affected dismay: and in tones so loud and agitated, that they not only caught the ear of Mr. Bumble himself, who happened to be hard by, but alarmed him so much that he rushed into the yard without his cocked hat,--which is a very curious and remarkable circumstance: as showing that even a beadle, acted upon a sudden and powerful impulse, may be afflicted with a momentary visitation of loss of self-possession, and forgetfulness of personal dignity.

1	Mrs Gowan, I hope I am not over-sensitive.
1	But so long accustomed to suppress emotion and keep down reality, so long schooled for her own purposes in that destructive school which shuts up the natural feelings of the heart like flies in amber and spreads one uniform and dreary gloss over the good and bad, the feeling and the unfeeling, the sensible and the senseless, she had subdued even her wonder until now.
1	On a certain occasion when the Finches were assembled in force, and when good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobody's agreeing with anybody else, the presiding Finch called the Grove to order, forasmuch as Mr. Drummle had not yet toasted a lady; which, according to the solemn constitution of the society, it was the brute's turn to do that day.
1	They are shown into the Doctor’s study, where blind Homer and Minerva give them audience as of yore, to the sober ticking of the great clock in the hall; and where the globes stand still in their accustomed places, as if the world were stationary too, and nothing in it ever perished in obedience to the universal law, that, while it keeps it on the roll, calls everything to earth.
1	And do you know I must say, sir,’ he continued, mildly laying his head on one side, ‘that I DON’T find authority for Mr. and Miss Murdstone in the New Testament?’ ‘I never found it either!’ said I.
1	I believe, brother,’ wringing his hand again, ‘that, after Wal’r, and on a different model, you’re as good a lad as ever stepped.’ ‘Upon my word and honour, Captain Gills,’ returned Mr Toots, giving the Captain’s hand a preliminary slap before shaking it again, ‘it’s delightful to me to possess your good opinion.
1	Will that ever be forgiven, Florence?’ ‘Will it ever be, Mama?
1	All closely imprisoned forces rend and destroy.
1	But, sitting at work, not far from Doctor Strong, was a very pretty young lady--whom he called Annie, and who was his daughter, I supposed--who got me out of my difficulty by kneeling down to put Doctor Strong’s shoes on, and button his gaiters, which she did with great cheerfulness and quickness.
1	I mentioned to Mr. Spenlow in the morning, that I wanted leave of absence for a short time; and as I was not in the receipt of any salary, and consequently was not obnoxious to the implacable Jorkins, there was no difficulty about it.
1	The liberality of Mrs. Sowerberry to Oliver, had consisted of a profuse bestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else would eat; so there was a great deal of meekness and self-devotion in her voluntarily remaining under Mr. Bumble's heavy accusation.
1	He perceived that his master was leading up to the orders he was to take, and he waited to understand them.
1	I am not acquainted with that language myself, but I should judge from her manners and appearance that she was French; anyways, certainly foreign.
1	At last the plump sister, falling into a similar state, cried out: "I have found it out!
1	‘This is the Marshalsea, sir.’ ‘The debtors’ prison?’ ‘Sir,’ said the old man, with the air of deeming it not quite necessary to insist upon that designation, ‘the debtors’ prison.’ He turned himself about, and went on.
1	Mr. Snagsby looks at him.
1	What is it?” “What is it?” repeated Mr. Wopsle, eyeing it, much at a loss.
1	These remarks he offers with his unvarying politeness and deference when he addresses himself to his wife.
1	What I was going to ask you was, have you thought of that Miss Wade?’ ‘I have.
1	But there were circumstances attending my--ha--slight knowledge of Mr Clennam (it was very slight), which,’ here Mr Dorrit became extremely grave and impressive, ‘would render it highly indelicate in Mr Clennam to--ha--to seek to renew communication with me or with any member of my family under existing circumstances.
1	You are like your poor uncle George.
1	"Well, Mr. Jarndyce, sir," Mr. Guppy, after a moment's consideration, began, to the great diversion of his mother, which she displayed by nudging Mr. Jobling with her elbow and winking at me in a most remarkable manner, "I had an idea that I should see Miss Summerson by herself and was not quite prepared for your esteemed presence.
1	He perceived that the man was not a difficulty in his own mind alone, but in Mr Meagles’s too; for such conversation as they had together on the short way to the Park was by no means well sustained, and Mr Meagles’s eye always wandered back to the man, even when he spoke of something very different.
1	When I was first hired out as shepherd t'other side the world, it's my belief I should ha' turned into a molloncolly-mad sheep myself, if I hadn't a had my smoke.” As he said so, he got up from table, and putting his hand into the breast of the pea-coat he wore, brought out a short black pipe, and a handful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called Negro-head.
1	Bell Yard While we were in London Mr. Jarndyce was constantly beset by the crowd of excitable ladies and gentlemen whose proceedings had so much astonished us.
1	At last she said, and in a steady, cheerful voice, that only faltered once: "I have known him walk with--I have known him walk with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed."
1	I am glad of it, for it is out of the ordinary course of things, and--habit again!’ said the gentleman, checking himself impatiently, ‘as if there were no better course than the ordinary course!’ With that he turned to go, and walking, bareheaded, to the outside of the little porch, took leave of her with such a happy mixture of unconstrained respect and unaffected interest, as no breeding could have taught, no truth mistrusted, and nothing but a pure and single heart expressed.
1	And couldn't Uncle Pumblechook, being always considerate and thoughtful for us--though you may not think it, Joseph,” in a tone of the deepest reproach, as if he were the most callous of nephews, “then mention this boy, standing Prancing here”--which I solemnly declare I was not doing--“that I have for ever been a willing slave to?” “Good again!” cried Uncle Pumblechook.
1	Their branches were encumbered with snow, and it silently dropped off in wet heaps while I stood at the window.
1	Wery proud o’ that machine he was, as it was nat’ral he should be, and he’d stand down in the celler a-lookin’ at it wen it was in full play, till he got quite melancholy with joy.
1	‘A glass of water!’ said the passionate Wardle.
1	The very gold and silver fish, set forth among these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and stagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was something going on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and round their little world in slow and passionless excitement.
1	"They are the loveliest I ever saw."
1	Whether you share that knowledge, or do not, my dear--’ ‘I do not,’ she said quietly.
1	You have no idea what a Monster I felt, Copperfield, when I saw the whole family crying and fainting away in every direction!
1	‘Ailing for a deal of time, but no one knew how much,’ said Susan; adding, with excessive sharpness, ‘Oh, them Blimbers!’ ‘Blimbers?’ echoed Walter.
1	Which we’re not a-going to do.’ ‘Mr.
1	It is so quiet, that you can almost hear the ticking of your own watch when you stop to cool in its refreshing atmosphere.
1	Sam refreshed himself with a kiss, and read as follows:-- ‘I am wery sorry to have the pleasure of being a Bear of ill news your Mother in law cort cold consekens of imprudently settin too long on the damp grass in the rain a hearin of a shepherd who warnt able to leave off till late at night owen to his having vound his-self up vith brandy and vater and not being able to stop his-self till he got a little sober which took a many hours to do the doctor says that if she’d svallo’d varm brandy and vater artervards insted of afore she mightn’t have been no vus her veels wos immedetly greased and everythink done to set her agoin as could be inwented your father had hopes as she vould have vorked round as usual but just as she wos a turnen the corner my boy she took the wrong road and vent down hill vith a welocity you never see and notvithstandin that the drag wos put on drectly by the medikel man it wornt of no use at all for she paid the last pike at twenty minutes afore six o’clock yesterday evenin havin done the jouney wery much under the reglar time vich praps was partly owen to her haven taken in wery little luggage by the vay your father says that if you vill come and see me Sammy he vill take it as a wery great favor for I am wery lonely Samivel N.

1	But I am a woman--not a girl, now--and you and I needn’t make a show of our history, like the gentlemen in the Court.
1	What is this dismal-fronted pile of bastard Egyptian, like an enchanter’s palace in a melodrama!—a famous prison, called The Tombs.
1	You speak very earnestly to me.
1	‘Leave him to me.’ Ralph exchanged a familiar look with his old acquaintance; for they had suddenly grown confidential again in this alarming surprise; and took his way home, thoughtfully and slowly.
1	Vict’ry and triumph will never do ’t.
1	Extraordinary how soon the noisome flavour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places that are ill cared for!
1	The phrase may be objected to by cautious minds; but I own to it as mine.
1	She was going to answer, when she was so touched by some little hidden sorrow or sympathy--what could it have been?--that she said, bursting into tears again: ‘O Mr Clennam!
1	If a parent asks a question in the classical, commercial, or mathematical line, says I, gravely, “Why, sir, in the first place, are you a philosopher?”--“No, Mr. Squeers,” he says, “I an’t.” “Then, sir,” says I, “I am sorry for you, for I shan’t be able to explain it.” Naturally, the parent goes away and wishes he was a philosopher, and, equally naturally, thinks I’m one.’ Saying this, and a great deal more, with tipsy profundity and a serio-comic air, and keeping his eye all the time on Mrs. Sliderskew, who was unable to hear one word, Mr. Squeers concluded by helping himself and passing the bottle: to which Peg did becoming reverence.
1	‘Poor dear.’ And with sundry ejaculations of ‘Come now, there’s a dear--drink a little of this--it’ll do you good--don’t give way so--there’s a love,’ etc.
1	These offerings of affection were of a most various and eccentric description.
1	Nobody but myself can tell what the capacity of that woman’s mind is.
1	‘If you want to see the man who would flay you alive--here he is!
1	‘What is yours?’ ‘When I dramatise a book, sir,’ said the literary gentleman, ‘THAT’S fame.
1	--that is to say, regarded in the light of true British Oak, for such you are explain, Mr Venus, the expression “papers”!’ ‘Seeing that the old gentleman was generally cutting off some near relation, or blocking out some natural affection,’ Mr Venus rejoins, ‘he most likely made a good many wills and codicils.’ The palm of Silas Wegg descends with a sounding smack upon the palm of Venus, and Wegg lavishly exclaims, ‘Twin in opinion equally with feeling!
1	Were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me!"
1	No face appeared, however; and being come to the house, and knowing how to open the door, before dark, without knocking, I went in with a quiet, timid step.
1	‘Pray don’t tell me to my face that you love my daughter, Mr. Copperfield!’ ‘Could I defend my conduct if I did not, sir?’ I returned, with all humility.
1	Some of these, congregating about the inn-yard while we changed horses, told us of great sheets of lead having been ripped off a high church-tower, and flung into a by-street, which they then blocked up.
1	When Mrs Flintwinch dreamed, she usually dreamed, unlike the son of her old mistress, with her eyes shut.
1	She was a lively young woman, sir, before marriage, and their gloom and austerity destroyed her.
1	‘They have come into my possession.
1	‘Vell, Sammy,’ said the father.
1	Mortimer Lightwood was not an extraordinarily impressible man, but this face impressed him.
1	What a poltroon, my Flintwinch!
1	Mr Cheggs has a good a right to be jealous as anyone else has, and perhaps he may have a better right soon if he hasn’t already.
1	He was mighty learned about the case, to me; but the upshot of his opinion was, that the carrier was making his last journey rather fast.---Put your hand into the breast pocket of my great-coat on the chair yonder, and I think you’ll find the letter.
1	I can recommend the ale, sir; or perhaps you’d like to taste the porter, sir?
1	‘There’s such a difference between a father and a mother, Sir,’ said Rob, after faltering for a moment.
1	"Did you ever see such a stupor as he falls into, between drink and sleep?"
1	Florence, who had again quickened her pace, as she approached the end of her journey, ran across the road (closely followed by Diogenes, whom the bustle had somewhat confused), ran in, and sank upon the threshold of the well-remembered little parlour.
1	If not, say so, for I wish to make things as pleasant as is consistent with my duty, and I've got another pair in my pocket."
1	The mother and daughter sat for a long time without interchanging a word: almost without motion.
1	Clennam’s eyes no sooner fell upon the subject of his old passion than it shivered and broke to pieces.
1	“I ought to have,” said Herbert, “for I have not much else.
1	There was nothing for it but bed; so I went to bed.
1	‘I tell you what, Captain Cuttle,’ said the Manager, shaking his forefinger at him, and showing him all his teeth, but still amiably smiling, ‘I was much too lenient with you when you came here before.
1	He would have thought of the morning when he first saw him rooting out the stones with his heel, and would have asked himself, ‘Does he jerk me out of the path in the same careless, cruel way?’ He would have thought, had this introduction to his mother been brought about by him because he knew what she would say, and that he could thus place his position before a rival and loftily warn him off, without himself reposing a word of confidence in him?
1	"They have both come back, miss, and have been tramping high and low."
1	In the large inn-yards waiters flitted to and fro and ran against each other, horses clattered on the uneven stones, carriage steps fell rattling down, and sickening smells from many dinners came in a heavy lukewarm breath upon the sense.
1	‘And nice company he is, Miss Floy,’ said Susan Nipper.
1	There were rejoicings at home on other birthdays, as I knew from what I heard the girls relate to one another--there were none on mine.
1	If they can't make me innocent out of the whole truth, they are not likely to do it out of anything less, or anything else.
1	It reached the door at last, and stood upon its feet.
1	Also these Barnacles were dealt, by the heads of the family, like so many cards below the court-cards, to public meetings and dinners; where they bore testimony to all sorts of services on the part of their noble and honourable relatives, and buttered the Barnacles on all sorts of toasts.
1	You know I am very grateful to him; don’t you?
1	With these words he pulled up the smock-frock; and, winding it round his middle, drew a chair to the fire, and placed his feet upon the hob.
1	Has George looked us up.
1	He had a particular pride in the phrase eminently practical, which was considered to have a special application to him.
1	‘That’s in everybody’s mouth.’ ‘The “everybody” of the theatre, I suppose?’ said Nicholas, contemptuously.
1	‘But I think, perhaps, if somebody went down, just to see that he didn’t dip his beak into the jug by accident, or make some confounded mistake in losing the money as he came upstairs, it would be as well.
1	Though little Miss La Creevy’s indignation was not so singularly displayed as Newman’s, it was scarcely inferior in violence and intensity.
1	There--there--at the window--close before him--so close, that he could have almost touched him before he started back:  with his eyes peering into the room, and meeting his:  there stood the Jew!
1	And then, with his nose coming down over his moustache and his moustache going up and under his nose, repaired to his allotted cell.
1	But Mr. Winkle didn’t wait for him.
1	Oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness, and made an ineffectual attempt to stand up, out of respect to his benefactor, which terminated in his sinking back into the chair again; and the fact is, if the truth must be told, that Mr. Brownlow's heart, being large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane disposition, forced a supply of tears into his eyes, by some hydraulic process which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a condition to explain.
1	Two incidents of the little interview were felt by Miss Bella herself, when alone again, to be very curious.
1	That is if somebody must--but upon my word, I’m unwilling that anybody should.
1	I can do very little.
1	‘Mr Headstone,’ returned Lizzie, with a burning face, ‘it is cowardly in you to speak to me in this way.
1	Has it never struck you, Amy, that Pa is monstrously polite to Mrs General.’ Amy, murmuring ‘No,’ looked quite confounded.
1	As the pony had now thrown off all disguise, and without any mincing of the matter or beating about the bush, sturdily refused to be driven by anybody but Kit, it generally happened that whether old Mr Garland came, or Mr Abel, Kit was of the party.
1	I was usually at Hammersmith about half the week, and when I was at Hammersmith I haunted Richmond, whereof separately by and by.
1	Whether it shall be openly declared in the new notices that must now be put about in our names--’ ‘In your name, Mr Boffin; in your name.’ ‘Very well; in my name, which is the same as Mrs Boffin’s, and means both of us, is to be considered in drawing ‘em up.
1	The Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.
1	The tide was running down, but I knew nothing of up or down then.
1	The hackney-coach jolted along Fleet Street, as hackney-coaches usually do.
1	But don't be angry with me, that's a dear lady, because I have been so ill." Angry with her, poor soul!
1	‘After all, I dare say it was my fault,’ said Tim.
1	Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt and poison, the way lay.
1	An epergne or centre-piece of some kind was in the middle of this cloth; it was so heavily overhung with cobwebs that its form was quite undistinguishable; and, as I looked along the yellow expanse out of which I remember its seeming to grow, like a black fungus, I saw speckle-legged spiders with blotchy bodies running home to it, and running out from it, as if some circumstances of the greatest public importance had just transpired in the spider community.
1	"I hardly know what it was like, guv'ner," said Phil, considering.
1	If the sight had been a ghastly one in the dull morning, what was it, now, in all that brilliant light!
1	But I’ll never tell her!
1	Oh, Mrs. Corney, what a prospect this opens!
1	'The great nobs,' replied Harry, 'under which designation, I presume, you include my most stately uncle, have not communicated with me at all, since I have been here; nor, at this time of the year, is it likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate attendance among them.'
1	I don’t know what you are, but you don’t hide, can’t hide, what a dark spirit you have within you.
1	‘I shall be quite safe, quite well taken care of.’ ‘I must accompany you there,’ said Clennam, ‘I cannot let you go alone.’ ‘Yes, pray leave us to go there by ourselves.
1	When your lawyers, your politicians, your intriguers, your men of the Exchange fall ill, and have not scraped money together, _they_ become poor.
1	Mr. Guppy acquiesces, with the reply, "I never should have taken it up, Tony, of my own accord."
1	For when I was a little child,’ in a tone as though it were ages ago, ‘the children that I used to see early in the morning were very different from any others that I ever saw.
1	‘However when Pancks told us I made up my mind that Mr F.’s Aunt and I would come and call because when papa--which was before that--happened to mention her name to me and to say that you were interested in her I said at the moment Good gracious why not have her here then when there’s anything to do instead of putting it out.’ ‘When you say Her,’ observed Clennam, by this time pretty well bewildered, ‘do you mean Mr F.’s--’ ‘My goodness, Arthur--Doyce and Clennam really easier to me with old remembrances--who ever heard of Mr F.’s Aunt doing needlework and going out by the day?’ ‘Going out by the day!
1	‘You may go down, sir,’ said Serjeant Buzfuz, waving his hand impatiently.
1	“Now, that's the way with them here, Mr. Pip,” remarked Wemmick, turning to me with his post-office elongated.
1	"A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I have given you, for many a year!
1	Am I pale, Sir?’ ‘Not very,’ replied Mr. Pickwick.
1	‘Cursed weather.’ ‘And a very long road.’ ‘A cursed road.’ His hoarse voice failed him, and he rested his head upon his hands until a bottle of wine was brought from the counter.
1	His first disappointment, on arriving at the house, was to find the door open, and Mr Flintwinch smoking a pipe on the steps.
1	‘Uncle!’ A fearful cry followed the word.
1	Show her a man in a blue jacket, and, figuratively speaking, she pinned him instantly.
1	He supposes all his dependents to be utterly bereft of individual characters, intentions, or opinions, and is persuaded that he was born to supersede the necessity of their having any.
1	They have brought hither the foreigners who abound in all the streets: not, perhaps, that there are more here, than in other commercial cities; but elsewhere, they have particular haunts, and you must find them out; here, they pervade the town.
1	Master Belling, my dear, always remember that; do you hear?’ ‘Yes, sir,’ repeated Master Belling.
1	Mr. Snagsby, touched by the spectacle before him, immediately lays upon the table half a crown, that magic balsam of his for all kinds of wounds.
1	"He was wery good to me," says the boy, wiping his eyes with his wretched sleeve.
1	‘That’s a laudable proceeding on the part of our aunt, at all events,’ said Steerforth, when I mentioned it; ‘and one deserving of all encouragement.
1	‘Well Lizzie-Mizzie-Wizzie,’ said she, breaking off in her song, ‘what’s the news out of doors?’ ‘What’s the news in doors?’ returned Lizzie, playfully smoothing the bright long fair hair which grew very luxuriant and beautiful on the head of the doll’s dressmaker.
1	He was very obliging, and as he handed me into a fly after superintending the removal of my boxes, I asked him whether there was a great fire anywhere?
1	"But for all that, I say again, he may come, and come, and come, and I won't have anything to say to him.
1	‘Not becoming too old to wear?’ Arthur Gride muttered an imprecation on his housekeeper’s deafness, as he roared in her ear: ‘Not smart enough!
1	I'm sure of it--that's quite sufficient."
1	‘Now then!’ said this man, happening to turn round.
1	This is a private yard,” he pulls out a paper from Boffin’s other blackguard, the one I was passed over for.
1	It was a pleasant thing to see Mr. Pickwick in the centre of the group, now pulled this way, and then that, and first kissed on the chin, and then on the nose, and then on the spectacles, and to hear the peals of laughter which were raised on every side; but it was a still more pleasant thing to see Mr. Pickwick, blinded shortly afterwards with a silk handkerchief, falling up against the wall, and scrambling into corners, and going through all the mysteries of blind-man’s buff, with the utmost relish for the game, until at last he caught one of the poor relations, and then had to evade the blind-man himself, which he did with a nimbleness and agility that elicited the admiration and applause of all beholders.
1	Fanny!’ There was no sound in answer but the loud ticking of Mr Dombey’s watch and Doctor Parker Peps’s watch, which seemed in the silence to be running a race.
1	Mrs. Bardell let lodgings to many conversable single gentlemen, with great profit, but never brought any more actions for breach of promise of marriage.
1	Nicholas, on his part, was no less pleased to encounter his friend, whom he had not seen for some time; so, their greeting was a warm one.
1	‘There, there--good-morning--good-morning--now pray, my dear sirs--Mr. Lowten, the door!’ cried the little man, pushing Dodson & Fogg, nothing loath, out of the office; ‘this way, my dear sirs--now pray don’t prolong this--Dear me--Mr. Lowten--the door, sir--why don’t you attend?’ ‘If there’s law in England, sir,’ said Dodson, looking towards Mr. Pickwick, as he put on his hat, ‘you shall smart for this.’ ‘You are a couple of mean--’ ‘Remember, sir, you pay dearly for this,’ said Fogg.
1	‘Well, he wasn’t there at all,’ said Mr. Dick, ‘until he came up behind her, and whispered.
1	What do you mean?’ ‘Helena, I don’t know.
1	And now the haunch of mutton vapour-bath having received a gamey infusion, and a few last touches of sweets and coffee, was quite ready, and the bathers came; but not before the discreet automaton had got behind the bars of the piano music-desk, and there presented the appearance of a captive languishing in a rose-wood jail.
1	Nothing but that.’ ‘Well, well!
1	I saw in this that I, too, was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity, even while the prize was reserved for me.
1	Remember your own home, in that second marriage; and never do both me and her the injury you have hinted at!’ I comprehended, at once, that my aunt was right; and I comprehended the full extent of her generous feeling towards my dear wife.
1	‘Theer’s one thing furder, Mas’r Davy,’ said he, putting his hand in his breast-pocket, and gravely taking out the little paper bundle I had seen before, which he unrolled on the table.
1	Little Dorrit had not attained her twenty-second birthday without finding a lover.
1	It’s in hand, though; and young Tom, who rather sticks to business at present—something new for him; he hadn’t the schooling _I_ had—is helping.
1	I mean to tell you nothing, Lady Tippins,’ replies Lightwood.
1	The gentleman was still twirling a theme, which seemed to go round and round and round, and in and in and in, and to involve itself like a corkscrew twirled upon a table, without getting any nearer to anything, when Harriet appeared returning.
1	‘Knock again, will you, if you please,’ cried Mrs. Dowler from the chair.
1	The old housekeeper suggests Bucket.
1	But, to see it, he must have overleaped at a bound the artificial barriers he had for many years been erecting, between himself and all those subtle essences of humanity which will elude the utmost cunning of algebra until the last trumpet ever to be sounded shall blow even algebra to wreck.
1	I’m scholar enough!’ He waved the light over the whole, as if to typify the light of his scholarly intelligence, and then put it down on the table and stood behind it looking intently at his visitors.
1	There we found, sitting by a fire, a very old man in a flannel coat: clean, cheerful, comfortable, and well cared for, but intensely deaf.
1	‘There is a grinning skull beneath it, and men like me who look and work below the surface see that, and not its delicate covering.
1	First of all, he took a refreshing draught of the beer, and then he looked up at a window, and bestowed a platonic wink on a young lady who was peeling potatoes thereat.
1	I recommend Mr. Micawber, my dear Mr. Copperfield, to do the same; to regard it as an investment which is sure of return, and to make up his mind to any sacrifice.’ I felt, but I am sure I don’t know why, that this was self-denying and devoted in Mrs. Micawber, and I uttered a murmur to that effect.
1	With a much-perplexed face, Riderhood looked from it to the sleeper, and from the sleeper to it, and finally crept back to his chair, and there, with his hand to his chin, sat long in a brown study, looking at both.
1	I can’t so much as read a book, because, if I had learned, father would have thought I was deserting him, and I should have lost my influence.
1	Turning into a silent little square or court-yard that had a great church tower rising above it, and a packer’s warehouse, and a bottle-maker’s warehouse, for its places of business, Rob the Grinder delivered the white-legged horse to the hostler of a quaint stable at the corner; and inviting Mrs Brown and her daughter to seat themselves upon a stone bench at the gate of that establishment, soon reappeared from a neighbouring public-house with a pewter measure and a glass.
1	Thus accoutred, they got into a hired coach which Ralph had in waiting, and drove to the residence of the fair and most wretched bride.
1	One part of the Secretary’s conduct, underlying all the rest, might have been mistrusted by a man with a better knowledge of men than the Golden Dustman had.
1	She even learned to sew a little, and to knit.’ The reader will scarcely need to be told, however, that the opportunities of communicating with her, were very, very limited; and that the moral effects of her wretched state soon began to appear.
1	‘Don’t YOU see a wasting and a wearing in him, Miss Wickfield?’ inquired Mrs. Heep.
1	Let’s have a look at your garden on the tiles, before I go!’ The old man took a step back, and hesitated.
1	Can you forgive me?’ ‘I can, and Heaven knows I do!
1	‘Pretty well, Towlinson, I thank you,’ says Miss Tox.
1	"Dear guardian," said I, "as I have shut her out so long--though indeed, indeed, she is like the light to me--" "I know it well, Dame Durden, well."
1	Plague pestilence and famine, battle murder and sudden death upon him," says the old man, making a curse out of one of his few remembrances of a prayer and squeezing up his velvet cap between his angry hands, "I have half a million of his signatures, I think!
1	Assisting Oliver to rise, the young gentleman took him to an adjacent chandler's shop, where he purchased a sufficiency of ready-dressed ham and a half-quartern loaf, or, as he himself expressed it, 'a fourpenny bran!'
1	In Mr. Tulkinghorn's Chambers From the verdant undulations and the spreading oaks of the Dedlock property, Mr. Tulkinghorn transfers himself to the stale heat and dust of London.
1	‘That ain’t a state of things to make you low, Mr Venus.’ ‘Mr Wegg, I know it ain’t.
1	‘Why, don’t I know my son, and don’t I know that this is exactly the way to hold him?’ said Mrs Gowan, contemptuously; ‘and do not these Miggles people know it, at least as well as I?
1	It was a dull, close, overcast summer evening.
1	Why show me this, if I am past all hope!"
1	She was extremely gracious to Peggotty, except when I inadvertently called her by that name; and, strange as I knew she felt in London, appeared quite at home.
1	And halting at a few paces from it, as he sees a soldierly looking woman, with her outer skirts tucked up, come forth with a small wooden tub, and in that tub commence a-whisking and a-splashing on the margin of the pavement, Mr. George says to himself, "She's as usual, washing greens.
1	You needn’t return.’ ‘I beg your pardon, Madame Mantalini, what did you say last?’ asked Miss Knag, trembling.
1	Coming out with every word about our having gone to that place, when you saw the net was gathering round me.
1	“Yes, ma'am.” (It made me think of the young man.)
1	‘It would be my duty, if he came in my way, to deliver him up to justice,’ said Ralph, ‘my bounden duty; I should have no other course, as a man of the world and a man of business, to pursue.
1	‘_She_!’ said the old gentleman, with a knowing shake of the head.
1	At breakfast, Mr Frederick Dorrit likewise appeared.
1	Sitting there, with her rich shower of hair falling over the chair-back, they hoped she might attract his notice.
1	On the grass inside, he had fallen on his knees last night, and prayed the two men's mercy.
1	Indeed, the Reverend Frank Milvey was a forbearing man, who noticed many sad warps and blights in the vineyard wherein he worked, and did not profess that they made him savagely wise.
1	‘See how little he heeds it all!’  Jasper proceeds in a bantering vein.
1	He had hardly composed himself into the needful state of abstraction, when he thought he heard his own name proclaimed in some distant passage.
1	It is she who, at the core of all the constrained formalities and conventionalities of his life, has been a stock of living tenderness and love, susceptible as nothing else is of being struck with the agony he feels.
1	It has been, all along, impossible to convince him; impossible to reason with him; sometimes, impossible even to approach him.
1	I deserve it, for I have been in the scheme from the first.
1	‘Lay your head well to the wind, and we’ll fight through it.
1	"What do you call some time, now?"
1	‘A gentleman!’ said the lady, with a terrific scream.
1	"He is celebrated almost everywhere for his deportment."
1	‘So these are some of the stories they invent about us, and bandy from mouth to mouth!’ thought Nicholas.
1	Creeping where grim death has been, A rare old plant is the Ivy green.
1	She went to the bureau, unlocked it, and took from an inner drawer a few folded sheets of paper.
1	It has always been in my observation of human nature, that a man who has any good reason to believe in himself never flourishes himself before the faces of other people in order that they may believe in him.
1	A painter who has gazed too long upon some glaring colour, refreshes his dazzled sight by looking upon a darker and more sombre tint; but everything that met Mr. Nickleby’s gaze wore so black and gloomy a hue, that he would have been beyond description refreshed by the very reverse of the contrast.
1	'Well, I thought you'd have been a little more glad to see me than this,' replied Mr. Chitling, with a melancholy air.
1	The mimic roses on the walls and floors were set round with sharp thorns, that tore her breast; in every scrap of gold so dazzling to the eye, she saw some hateful atom of her purchase-money; the broad high mirrors showed her, at full length, a woman with a noble quality yet dwelling in her nature, who was too false to her better self, and too debased and lost, to save herself.
1	That would have been a weak and ridiculous mistake, but I can respect a mistake, whereas I can’t respect a wilful and deliberate abasing of those who should be nearest and dearest to us.
1	Not so much shocked by the fact as by the fact of the fact being mentioned.
1	So were Mr. Jingle and Miss Wardle, for reasons of sufficient importance in this eventful history to be narrated in another chapter.
1	It was reserved for Miss Twinkleton to tone down the public mind of the Nuns’ House.
1	Your breakfast will be provided for you in a neat, compact, and graceful little sitting-room (appropriate to your figure), and I will come to you at ten o’clock in the morning.
1	‘It is a mere nothing,’ said Nicholas, returning to Mrs. Kenwigs; ‘the little girl, who was watching the child, being tired I suppose, fell asleep, and set her hair on fire.’ ‘Oh you malicious little wretch!’ cried Mrs. Kenwigs, impressively shaking her forefinger at the small unfortunate, who might be thirteen years old, and was looking on with a singed head and a frightened face.
1	When those duties cease to be required and rendered, and the stipend ceases to be paid, there is an end of all relations between us.
1	‘Well, Mary Anne?’ said Miss Peecher.
1	That he had observed, from his station in the rear, that she sat her mule as if she were exhausted.
1	Mrs. Bucket is dependent on their lodger (fortunately an amiable lady in whom she takes an interest) for companionship and conversation.
1	Mrs. Snagsby Sees It All There is disquietude in Cook's Court, Cursitor Street.
1	He walked slowly, and with the measured step and preoccupied air of one who was waiting.
1	says Jo, in the last degree amazed.
1	‘“It is no common business,” said he; “nor have these papers reached my hands without long trouble and great expense.” ‘The attorney cast a still more anxious look at the packet; and his visitor, untying the string that bound it, disclosed a quantity of promissory notes, with copies of deeds, and other documents.
1	I needed no second permission; though I was by this time in such a state of consternation and agitation, that my legs shook under me.
1	‘Captain Gills and Lieutenant Walters have mentioned, Miss Dombey,’ gasped Mr Toots, ‘that I can do you some service.
1	"I believe so, too," said he.
1	Running to the window, he opened it, and put out his head.
1	In the morning, when I came out, the early church-bell was ringing, and he was walking up and down with his mother.
1	On her face, I saw immediately the placid and sweet expression of the lady whose picture had looked at me downstairs.
1	Mr. Pickwick was, as our readers may have gathered from the slight extract we gave from his description of Chatham, an enthusiastic admirer of the army.
1	I knew Mr. Grubble very well by sight, from his often standing at his door.
1	However, it was high time now to be thinking of the play; for which great preparation was required, in the way of shawls and bonnets, not to mention one handkerchief full of oranges and another of apples, which took some time tying up, in consequence of the fruit having a tendency to roll out at the corners.
1	‘Very good,’ said Mr Boffin.
1	I made this little gift for Paul.
1	the cause was in her tottering feet.
1	Oh dear me, how very whimsical!
1	Lay not a hand on her, or on that woman, or on me, or so much a brush their garments as they pass you by!--You let them pass, and he blocks the door again!’ Arthur Gride happened to be in the doorway, but whether intentionally or from confusion was not quite apparent.
1	When Walter returned home on the Sunday evening from his long walk, and its memorable close, he was too much occupied at first by the tidings he had to give them, and by the emotions naturally awakened in his breast by the scene through which he had passed, to observe either that his Uncle was evidently unacquainted with the intelligence the Captain had undertaken to impart, or that the Captain made signals with his hook, warning him to avoid the subject.
1	So decidedly are amiability and mildness their characteristics, that I confess I look upon that youth who distinguished himself by the slaughter of these inoffensive persons, as a false-hearted brigand, who, pretending to philanthropic motives, was secretly influenced only by the wealth stored up within their castles, and the hope of plunder.
1	I reposed complete confidence in no one but Biddy; but I told poor Biddy everything.
1	Once, he went to the window, and stood there with his forehead against the glass.
1	So far as an overpowering heaviness, a prostration of strength, and an utter inability to control our thoughts or power of motion, can be called sleep, this is it; and yet, we have a consciousness of all that is going on about us, and, if we dream at such a time, words which are really spoken, or sounds which really exist at the moment, accommodate themselves with surprising readiness to our visions, until reality and imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost matter of impossibility to separate the two.
1	Mr. Snagsby in his best coat, looking at all the preparations when they are completed and coughing his cough of deference behind his hand, says to Mrs. Snagsby, "At what time did you expect Mr. and Mrs. Chadband, my love?"
1	Is it surprising that I should be displeased?
1	Deliver this letter to the agent when you reach Liverpool, and let me advise you, gentlemen, not to be too knowing in the West Indies.
1	‘I assure you, it’s quite an old story, my unfortunate hair.
1	He’s uncertain in that respect.
1	Therefore you must know that I am engaged.’ Engaged!
1	‘Perfectly horrid!’ exclaimed Mr. Pluck.
1	Another man, evidently very drunk, who had probably been tumbled into bed by his companions, was sitting up between the sheets, warbling as much as he could recollect of a comic song, with the most intensely sentimental feeling and expression; while a third, seated on one of the bedsteads, was applauding both performers with the air of a profound connoisseur, and encouraging them by such ebullitions of feeling as had already roused Mr. Pickwick from his sleep.
1	At every good stroke he expressed his satisfaction and approval of the player in a most condescending and patronising manner, which could not fail to have been highly gratifying to the party concerned; while at every bad attempt at a catch, and every failure to stop the ball, he launched his personal displeasure at the head of the devoted individual in such denunciations as--‘Ah, ah!--stupid’--‘Now, butter-fingers’--‘Muff’--‘Humbug’--and so forth--ejaculations which seemed to establish him in the opinion of all around, as a most excellent and undeniable judge of the whole art and mystery of the noble game of cricket.
1	I was to be absent only one night, and, on my return, the gratification of his impatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to be begun.
1	‘And so you’re thrown upon the world!’ ‘It would appear so, Jenny, and somewhat suddenly.’ ‘Where are you going to seek your fortune?’ asked Miss Wren.
1	You don’t think he grieves for his Mama, sure?’ argued Berry, sitting down on the side of the bed.
1	Therefore he says "you" are beaten, and not "we."
1	‘After which you took to swimming, you know!’ said Mr. Tartar.
1	“Thankee, Sir,” said Joe, stiff from head to foot, “I'll take whichever is most agreeable to yourself.” “What do you say to coffee?” “Thankee, Sir,” returned Joe, evidently dispirited by the proposal, “since you are so kind as make chice of coffee, I will not run contrairy to your own opinions.
1	Do you happen to know any one in this neighbourhood who would receive him for a while on my paying for him beforehand?"
1	‘Pray don’t think of going.’ ‘You are very good!’ replied Kate.
1	I thought I knew the face,’ said Fogg, drawing up a chair, and looking round him with a smile.
1	It was the first time she had ever been even in Cloisterham High Street alone.
1	Nickleby,’ said the old man, after a short silence, ‘you can do no more.
1	This frightened Oliver very much, and made him glad to get out of those villages with all possible expedition.
1	You will surely not desert me so!’ ‘I would say it, if I could; but I have not the courage quite to shut out this dear face, and abandon all hope of its return.
1	‘I understand, Madam,’ said Mr Dombey, with an angry flush of triumph, ‘the spirit of opposition that turned your affections in that channel, but they have been met, Mrs Dombey; they have been met, and turned back!’ ‘The worse for you!’ she answered, with her voice and manner still unchanged.
1	And he was still jogging along Fleet Street in this condition of mind, when he became aware that he was closely tracked and observed by a man of genteel appearance.
1	I set off one morning, accompanied by Charley, for Somers Town.
1	But, justice must take its course against the parties implicated in the plot against this poor, unoffending, injured lad.
1	The violent agitation of the girl, and the apprehension of some discovery which would subject her to ill-usage and violence, seemed to determine the gentleman to leave her, as she requested.
1	He was probably some ten years younger, and was a plump, paunchy, sturdy-looking fellow, with his under-lip a little pursed, from a habit of counting money inwardly as he paid it, but with no decidedly bad expression in his face, which was rather an honest and jolly one than otherwise.
1	I made fur them mountains, Mas’r Davy, day and night.
1	As indeed he might, if he chose, for anything he knew of the matter.
1	‘Don’t be too hard upon me.
1	You have only to choose a trade, Jem, and be it.
1	‘That’s not it?’ said I.
1	He regarded her from a point of view which in its remoteness, tender as it was, he little thought would have been unspeakable agony to her.
1	"Oh, many, many, many years, my dear.
1	Wot has come over you, you jade!
1	I had fallen into my serene state one evening, when we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said door, and fall on the ground.
1	'Peppermint,' exclaimed Mrs. Corney, in a faint voice, smiling gently on the beadle as she spoke.
1	‘They are all surprised, these inconsiderate young people, fairly and full grown, to see any natural feeling in a little thing like me!
1	"Are you arrested for much, sir?"
1	’Tis to be done again at three, and then she may be left till morning.’ ‘But thy rest agen to-morrow’s work, my dear.’ ‘I slept sound last night.
1	We passed the finger-post, and held straight on to the churchyard.
1	But what did he do with you?"
1	That he should have gone and offered himself to a woman who must be--ah, half as old again as I am--and that she should have dared to accept him!
1	You shall judge of its influence on me, John.
1	‘What’s injudicious, hey?’ ‘Nothing Sir--nothing.
1	What do you ask me to do?’ He put his hat under his arm, and feeling in his breast for Emily’s letter, took it out, unfolded it, and gave it to her.
1	Unhappily, declining fast.’ ‘Mr Frederick, sir,’ quoth Mrs General, ‘is habitually absent and drooping, but let us hope it is not so bad as that.’ Mr Dorrit, however, was determined not to let him off.
1	Her figure is elegant and has the effect of being tall.
1	But one morning, when I was--’ ‘Was near a keyhole?’ suggested Mr Swiveller, observing that she faltered.
1	This is nigh to be the proodest day o’ my life, sir.
1	I regard his course as quite plain before him.’ ‘I hoped so.
1	"A pretty character to bear," the trooper growls with a hasty oath as he strides downstairs.
1	Eh?’ I nodded at him, and he nodded back again.
1	‘I am going out,’ she said without looking at it.
1	Heaven suits the back to the burden.
1	But she was always the same to me.
1	I tried them over and over again, and I never knew them wait for me to begin.
1	‘How am I to work if you keep on chattering?’ ‘What an uncertain chap you are!’ returned the lawyer.
1	I felt half frightened at myself when the boy glared on me so.
1	‘We are all pretty gay here, thank Heaven!
1	‘Why, we have only come nineteen miles, and have eighty-seven and a half to go.’ ‘Just the reason why we should take something to enable us to bear up against the fatigue,’ remonstrated Mr. Bob Sawyer.
1	The well-remembered ground was soon traversed, and I came into the quiet streets, where every stone was a boy’s book to me.
1	"He ain't at all like Bluffy, mother!"
1	Midnight comes, and with it the same blank.
1	You will help me to see him if you can?” “Your husband is not my business here,” returned Madame Defarge, looking down at her with perfect composure.
1	I have been afraid of myself.’ ‘You are afraid of nothing else, I think,’ said I.
1	We know now, what a struggle you made of old.
1	You were false to him, daily and hourly.
1	'Is he to be kidnapped to the other ken, Nancy says?'
1	"If I ever blame myself, I still think it's Ma's fault.
1	Seated by the window, busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which formed a portion of the robber's ordinary dress, was a female:  so pale and reduced with watching and privation, that there would have been considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same Nancy who has already figured in this tale, but for the voice in which she replied to Mr. Sikes's question.
1	Next minute, they are at the door.
1	I haven’t told you so much of your fortune yet, Miss Dorrit, as to tell you what’s behind me on that little hand.
1	‘I expect so, but don’t know.
1	When I quit it, I will hide myself from them and you, and, striving to support my mother by hard service, I will live, at least, in peace, and trust in God to help me.’ With these words, she waved her hand, and quitted the room, leaving Ralph Nickleby motionless as a statue.
1	He made a turn or two in the shop, and looked for Hope among the instruments; but they obstinately worked out reckonings for the missing ship, in spite of any opposition he could offer, that ended at the bottom of the lone sea.
1	I’m glad you lost your way.
1	There’s the other shoe off now!
1	Don't yer ask me to do anything till I have done eating.
1	It had been foremost to study that bright revelation and to carry its shining influence through the whole of the official proceedings.
1	Even the box-passenger caught the infection, and growing wonderfully deferential, immediately inquired whether there was not very good society in that neighbourhood, to which the lady replied yes, there was: in a manner which sufficiently implied that she moved at the very tiptop and summit of it all.
1	Without her market-basket, which is a sort of wicker well with two flapping lids, she never stirs abroad.
1	Not to lose a moment of the time.” “Thank'ee dear boy, thank'ee.
1	She started again to find Blandois close to her, handing Fanny into the boat.
1	The Dodger and Master Bates, unwilling to attract public attention by running down the open street, had merely retired into the very first doorway round the corner.
1	My mind is constantly running on him, in his solitude; to put this letter of her writing in his hand at this time, and to enable you to tell her, in the moment of parting, that he has got it, will be a kindness to both of them.
1	Mostly fishing hereabouts!’ The field had been newly mown, and there were yet the marks of the scythe on the yellow-green ground, and the track of wheels where the hay had been carried.
1	‘She threw herself into my arms.’ ‘Very likely, my dear Sir,’ replied Perker; ‘very likely and very natural.
1	Tell her that it was her husband's last arrangement.
1	But the secret soon came out.
1	But the secret of these discussions was of little importance.
1	Scrooge knew he was dead?
1	Never poached upon old Fagin!
1	But I don't know how long the rafters may hold.” When he had once more laughed heartily, he became meek again, and told me that the moment he began to realize Capital, it was his intention to marry this young lady.
1	"So it might, little woman," my guardian assented.
1	But there was no procession that day, and Little Dorrit was rather surprised by Fanny’s being at home at that hour, as she was generally out on horseback then.
1	He could not choose but look, although he looked to his dismay.
1	Somebody’s hair fell down, and nobody but Sophy could put it up.
1	O yes!’ ‘And while you have been thinking of the dinner or the clothes, I may have been thinking, you know, of the family.
1	And the swans upon it," says Phil after further consideration.
1	He always shakes hands with her when he comes down to Chesney Wold and when he goes away; and if he were very ill, or if he were knocked down by accident, or run over, or placed in any situation expressive of a Dedlock at a disadvantage, he would say if he could speak, "Leave me, and send Mrs. Rouncewell here!"
1	He accompanied his conductor into a guard-room, smelling of common wine and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and awake, drunk and sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping and waking, drunkenness and sobriety, were standing and lying about.
1	Where is she?’ With his hand not yet withdrawn from the breast of his garment, Riah started and paused.
1	She kept the bouquet close to her on the cushion, and wouldn’t allow Jip to sit on that side of her at all, for fear he should crush it.
1	He took his little Flintwinch, with fierce playfulness, by the two lapels of his coat, and cried: ‘To the Devil with the Market, to the Devil with the Pigs, and to the Devil with the Pig-Driver!
1	Yes, it is dirty--it's nat'rally dirty, and it's nat'rally onwholesome; and we've had five dirty and onwholesome children, as is all dead infants, and so much the better for them, and for us besides.
1	My experience was very limited; I was not at all prepared for his rousing himself out of this emotion to a new sense of injury.
1	As for society, he was carried every other day into the hall where the boys dined, and there sociably flogged as a public warning and example.
1	But when Jane Murdstone is kind enough to come to my assistance in this endeavour, and to assume, for my sake, a condition something like a housekeeper’s, and when she meets with a base return--’ ‘Oh, pray, pray, Edward,’ cried my mother, ‘don’t accuse me of being ungrateful.
1	I was wondering what the devil you were going to send them to Yorkshire for.
1	"I occasionally meet on my staircase here," drawls Volumnia, whose thoughts perhaps are already hopping up it to bed, after a long evening of very desultory talk, "one of the prettiest girls, I think, that I ever saw in my life."
1	The only point on which he persevered in demanding an explanation, was, the name of Sam’s detaining creditor; but this Mr. Weller as perseveringly withheld.
1	They shook hands earnestly, and my guardian said some words of comfort to him.
1	He could do nothing but whistle, and stare to that extent, that his eyes, compared with what they now became, had been in former times quite cavernous and sunken.
1	Must I take to carving them out of my heart?’ ‘I thought you had so exactly found your niche in life, Jack,’ Edwin Drood returns, astonished, bending forward in his chair to lay a sympathetic hand on Jasper’s knee, and looking at him with an anxious face.
1	The early dinner hour at Joe's, left me abundance of time, without hurrying my talk with Biddy, to walk over to the old spot before dark.
1	This turning of his intelligence and of his whole attempt and design against himself, did even more than his mother’s fixedness and firmness to convince him that his efforts with her were idle.
1	"There are some upon this earth of yours," returned the Spirit, "who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion, pride, ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness in our name, who are as strange to us and all our kith and kin, as if they had never lived.
1	"Don't you think any more," returns Mr. Bucket with admonitory finger, "of throwing yourself out of window.
1	'Pretty well, I think, for a beginner,' remarked Mr. Bolter complacently.
1	‘You are welcome,’ said Mrs. Crummles, turning round to Nicholas when they reached the bow-windowed front room on the first floor.
1	It is she whom he has loved, admired, honoured, and set up for the world to respect.
1	"But I have been a-thinking, being over-tired to-night and not well with the ague, of all the many things that'll come in his way.
1	You haven't marked them well, though, Charley; so the marks shall be picked out with a needle, and we'll teach Oliver how to do it.
1	I started up in bed, and putting out my arms in the dark, said: ‘Is that you, Peggotty?’ There was no immediate answer, but presently I heard my name again, in a tone so very mysterious and awful, that I think I should have gone into a fit, if it had not occurred to me that it must have come through the keyhole.
1	I only asked a question.
1	With these dissensions it is almost superfluous to say that everything in Eatanswill was made a party question.
1	On which interruption Mrs. Chadband glares and Mrs. Snagsby says, "For shame!"
1	'And now about business,' said the beadle, taking out a leathern pocket-book.
1	But in great things, I hope not; I don’t mean to boast, John dear, but I hope not!’ He was even better convinced of the truth of what she said than she was, as he felt her loving arms about him.
1	I don’t owe yer nothing; I never seen yer.’ ‘I tell you you owe me half of this, because I have no sixpence in my pocket.
1	‘And they seem to have taken a deal out of you!’ said Mr Boffin, with commiseration.
1	You have been calling for some more of that port, sir, I guess?’ ‘Ah, Little joker!
1	‘I think, mama,’ said Kate hesitating, and remarking Newman’s averted face, ‘you would hurt his feelings if you offered it.’ Newman Noggs, bowing to the young lady more like a gentleman than the miserable wretch he seemed, placed his hand upon his breast, and, pausing for a moment, with the air of a man who struggles to speak but is uncertain what to say, quitted the room.
1	As they passed behind the church, they heard voices near at hand, and presently came on those who had spoken.
1	When he mentioned him, he spoke of him casually as his old pensioner.
1	Looking with greater attention at these contrivances (wondering to find such literary preparations in such a place), I descried on each shelf a sort of microscopic sheet and blanket; then I began dimly to comprehend that the passengers were the library, and that they were to be arranged, edge-wise, on these shelves, till morning.
1	He boasted that he stood up litigiously for the interests of the college; and he had undefined and undefinable ideas that the marshal intercepted a ‘Fund,’ which ought to come to the collegians.
1	The family began a gay life, went here and there, and turned night into day; but she was timid of joining in their gaieties, and only asked leave to be left alone.
1	‘I’d only jist come out for my ’elth when I see you two a-coming out of the Kin-freederel.
1	Mr. Pickwick nodded in the affirmative.
1	I can’t quite leave it there; I must say just half-a-dozen words more.
1	So all true souls ever are.
1	‘It’s one fellow,’ said Mr Sparkler.
1	‘Why, my love,’ said Mr Toots, ‘it’s from Captain Gills.
1	In short, must leave it alone, like or no like.
1	They drew their chairs closer together, starting at every sound.
1	My life is not so busy as yours, you see, and I have not so many things to think of.
1	He was nothing to me, and I could have had no foresight then, that he ever would be anything to me, but it happened that I had this opportunity of observing him well.
1	returned Mr. Bucket, bending down his ear.
1	More than ever bent on seeing what became of them, and on having some information to give his good friend, Mr Meagles, he went out at the further end of the terrace, looking cautiously about him.
1	Mr Sloppy’s instructions had been to deposit his burden in the road; but, a scavenger’s cart happening to stand unattended at the corner, with its little ladder planted against the wheel, Mr S. found it impossible to resist the temptation of shooting Mr Silas Wegg into the cart’s contents.
1	There are no estates to manage, no rents to return so much per cent upon in bad times (which is an extremely dear way of getting your name into the newspapers), no voters to become parboiled in hot water with, no agents to take the cream off the milk before it comes to table.
1	‘There an’t no room at all, sir,’ bawls a gentleman inside.
1	‘I couldn’t think of allowing it.
1	Prince Turveydrop sometimes played the kit, dancing; sometimes played the piano, standing; sometimes hummed the tune with what little breath he could spare, while he set a pupil right; always conscientiously moved with the least proficient through every step and every part of the figure; and never rested for an instant.
1	You have been in the wars!'
1	I said there was nothing to detain you here, Clennam, half an hour longer.
1	It can’t be from the gov’ner,’ said Sam, looking at the direction.
1	As he pretended not to see me, I pretended not to see him.
1	‘I beg your pardon, sir--but I think there have been trespassers here to-day.’ ‘Ha!’ said the captain, scowling around him.
1	After waiting until late in the afternoon, tortured by various apprehensions and misgivings, and the recollection of the warning which his nephew had given him when they last met: the further confirmation of which now presented itself in one shape of probability, now in another, and haunted him perpetually: he left home, and, scarcely knowing why, save that he was in a suspicious and agitated mood, betook himself to Snawley’s house.
1	She stretched out the arm with which she had shielded herself, and as she went on, pointed at the object of her anger.
1	Sit down, sit down!’ ‘Too late!’ she cried, with eyes that seemed to sparkle fire.
1	Approaching the cell, they find the door opening and a warder in the act of coming out.
1	The feeble winter’s sun--and winter’s suns in the city are very feeble indeed--might have brightened up, as he shone through the dim windows of the large old house, on witnessing the unusual sight which one half-furnished room displayed.
1	As the Pickwickians turned round to take a last glimpse of it, the setting sun cast a rich glow on the faces of their entertainers, and fell upon the form of the fat boy.
1	says Watt, who has been home and come back again, he is such a good grandson.
1	‘But this is the fanciful side of the situation.
1	Noah looked eagerly about him for the Dodger; but although there were several women who would have done very well for that distinguished character's mother or sister, and more than one man who might be supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his father, nobody at all answering the description given him of Mr. Dawkins was to be seen.
1	I had confided it to my aunt, but to no one else.
1	I win, however the game goes.’ Again his moustache went up, and his nose came down.
1	The corner of a small-plaited shirt-frill struggled out, as if insisting to show itself, from between his chin and the top button of his spencer; and the latter garment was not made low enough to conceal a long gold watch-chain, composed of a series of plain rings, which had its beginning at the handle of a gold repeater in Mr. Nickleby’s pocket, and its termination in two little keys: one belonging to the watch itself, and the other to some patent padlock.
1	Mr. Bonney elbowed his way briskly upstairs, receiving in his progress many low bows from the waiters who stood on the landings to show the way; and, followed by Mr. Nickleby, dived into a suite of apartments behind the great public room: in the second of which was a business-looking table, and several business-looking people.
1	‘Tak’ that bit o’ timber to help thee on wi’, mun,’ he added, pressing his stick on Nicholas, and giving his hand another squeeze; ‘keep a good heart, and bless thee.
1	Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due.” “I am obliged to them for their interest in the matter,” he answered, a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor.
1	No one has ever raised that curtain since.
1	There were several small assemblages of the Bleeding Hearts at the popular points of meeting in the Yard that night, among whom it was universally agreed that Mr Pancks was a hard man to have to do with; and that it was much to be regretted, so it was, that a gentleman like Mr Casby should put his rents in his hands, and never know him in his true light.
1	'But do you mean to say, my dear,' remonstrated the Jew, 'that the women can't be got over?'
1	“You will have the caption made to- morrow, of course?” ‘“Yes,” replied Heyling.
1	Sophronia herself supposed she was an orphan; but Mr Swiveller, putting various slight circumstances together, often thought Miss Brass must know better than that; and, having heard from his wife of her strange interview with Quilp, entertained sundry misgivings whether that person, in his lifetime, might not also have been able to solve the riddle, had he chosen.
1	And if they did know Bevis Marks (as he trusted for their own character, they did) did they know the historical and elevating associations connected with that most remarkable spot?
1	He was a mere child in the world, but he didn't cry for the moon.
1	It'll be a good job for him.
1	"You have brought Caddy back, I see," observed Mrs. Jellyby with a glance at her daughter.
1	At length, when the brains of the whole party had been racked for six long days, by unavailing speculation, it was unanimously resolved that Mr. Pickwick should be called upon to explain his conduct, and to state distinctly why he had thus absented himself from the society of his admiring friends.
1	This gave her courage to pass round the screen, and look into his chamber.
1	“What do you want?” I asked, starting; “I don't know you.” “Well, sir,” returned one of them, bending down and touching me on the shoulder, “this is a matter that you'll soon arrange, I dare say, but you're arrested.” “What is the debt?” “Hundred and twenty-three pound, fifteen, six.
1	'This is the boy, your worship,' said Mr. Bumble.
1	But still Mrs. Nickleby, in reply to the significant looks of all about her, shook her head as though to assure them that she saw nothing whatever in all this, unless, indeed, it were a slight degree of eccentricity.
1	‘Oh!’ said Mr. Winkle, rising, ‘some friends of mine--show them in.
1	‘Pray tell me all the worst at once.’ ‘Latterly, he appears to have devoted the greatest pains to making these results so plain and clear, that reference to the private books enables one to grasp them, numerous and varying as they are, with extraordinary ease.
1	When Nicholas began to describe Madeline, he sat with his mouth wide open, nudging Mrs. Browdie from time to time, and exclaiming under his breath that she must be ‘raa’ther a tidy sart,’ and when he heard at last that his young friend had come down purposely to communicate his good fortune, and to convey to him all those assurances of friendship which he could not state with sufficient warmth in writing--that the only object of his journey was to share his happiness with them, and to tell them that when he was married they must come up to see him, and that Madeline insisted on it as well as he--John could hold out no longer, but after looking indignantly at his wife, and demanding to know what she was whimpering for, drew his coat sleeve over his eyes and blubbered outright.
1	‘No.’ ‘Because here he is,’ said Mr. Grewgious, who had asked all these questions, with his preoccupied glance directed out at window.
1	‘Bounderby!’ she cried, in a suppressed voice, starting up from the table.
1	Do you mean because we are one and the same?’ ‘No, my dear child.
1	Jarndyce, you may rely upon him!
1	'Not so heavy as they might be,' said the Jew, after looking at the insides carefully; 'but very neat and nicely made.
1	As they approached the City, the noise and traffic gradually increased; when they threaded the streets between Shoreditch and Smithfield, it had swelled into a roar of sound and bustle.
1	For, then he saw that through his desperate attempt to separate those two for ever, he had been made the means of uniting them.
1	'That is the dabe of this 'ouse,' replied the Jew.
1	Then, the Analytical, perusing a scrap of paper lying on the salver, with the air of a literary Censor, adjusts it, takes his time about going to the table with it, and presents it to Mr Eugene Wrayburn.
1	But in her lonely yearning to the dead whom she had loved, no thought of home--no possibility of going back--no presentation of it as yet existing, or as sheltering her father--once entered her thoughts.
1	‘I have never been here since that night, and never was here before that night, but thus much I recognize.
1	'That's acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley to make 'em come down again,' said Gamfield; 'that's all smoke, and no blaze; vereas smoke ain't o' no use at all in making a boy come down, for it only sinds him to sleep, and that's wot he likes.
1	You know, I dare say, that I have an attachment to my cousin Ada?"
1	‘Oh dear, yes, sir, quite,’ replied Bob.
1	'I hear you,' replied the girl, turning her face aside, and forcing a laugh.
1	The early stars began to shine while we were lingering on, and looking up to them, we thanked our GOD for having guided us to this tranquillity.
1	The novelty of the place, the coming upon it without preparation, the sense of being locked up, the remembrance of that room up-stairs, of the two brothers, and above all of the retiring childish form, and the face in which he now saw years of insufficient food, if not of want, kept him waking and unhappy.
1	little Florence!’ and smooths away the curls that shade her earnest eyes.
1	I bowed my acknowledgements, and said, my aunt had mentioned to me that there was that opening, and that I believed I should like it very much.
1	"Do not be so moved.
1	Here is a fellow, who, infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that ever was known, abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth that ever did murder by wholesale, and you ask me why I am sorry that a man who instructs youth knows him?
1	In a week or two, he referred to this engagement, and said, that if I would do him the favour to come down next Saturday, and stay till Monday, he would be extremely happy.
1	Come, Pip,” said Joe, persuasively, “if there warn't no weal-cutlets, at least there was dogs?” “No, Joe.” “A dog?” said Joe.
1	It was fainter and duller.
1	‘I would not give him up against his will, to be the victim of such brutality as that to which you would consign him,’ replied Nicholas, ‘if he were a dog or a rat.’ ‘Knock that Nickleby down with a candlestick,’ cried Mr. Squeers, through the keyhole, ‘and bring out my hat, somebody, will you, unless he wants to steal it.’ ‘I am very sorry, indeed,’ said Mrs. Nickleby, who, with Mrs. Browdie, had stood crying and biting her fingers in a corner, while Kate (very pale, but perfectly quiet) had kept as near her brother as she could.
1	I'll come back to tea.
1	“Are you amused, Mr. Drummle?” “No,” said he, “not particularly.
1	‘I’ll hold any man fifty pounds,’ said Sir Mulberry, ‘that Miss Nickleby can’t look in my face, and tell me she wasn’t thinking so.’ ‘Done!’ cried the noble gull.
1	‘Go along with you!’ cried Susan, ‘or Ill tear your eyes out.’ ‘Just another!’ said Mr Toots.
1	Thinking this a favourable opportunity for departing before any of the torrent of her wrath discharged itself upon him, Nicholas hurried Kate off, and left the unfortunate subject of this unexpected recognition to explain his conduct as he best could.
1	At this, he thought directly, ‘they are to be married.’ ‘Mr Clennam,’ she said, hesitating more timidly yet, and speaking so low that he bent his head to hear her.
1	If I work for him ever so much, and ever so hard, there's no one to help me; and if he should be turned bad 'spite of all I could do, and the time should come when I should sit by him in his sleep, made hard and changed, an't it likely I should think of him as he lies in my lap now and wish he had died as Jenny's child died!"
1	Like most other public institutions in America, of the same class, it stands a mile or two without the town, in a cheerful healthy spot; and is an airy, spacious, handsome edifice.

1	The bright gaslight over Mr. Bounderby’s steps showed them Mrs. Sparsit in the coach, in an ecstasy of excitement, struggling to open the door; Mrs. Sparsit seeing them at the same moment, called to them to stop.
1	She was too well cared for, too well trained, too well helped on, too much looked after.
1	By all that is base and despicable," cried Mr. Boythorn, "the treatment of surgeons aboard ship is such that I would submit the legs--both legs--of every member of the Admiralty Board to a compound fracture and render it a transportable offence in any qualified practitioner to set them if the system were not wholly changed in eight and forty hours!"
1	The captain of a small steamboat was going to make his first trip for the season that day (the second February trip, I believe, within the memory of man), and only waited for us to go on board.
1	He is pointing at a table with a bottle (nearly full of wine) and a glass upon it and two candles that were blown out suddenly soon after being lighted.
1	Does it seem as long as that to you, Mrs Quilp?’ ‘Yes, I think it seems full three years, Quilp,’ was the unfortunate reply.
1	replied Brittles, starting violently; 'I'm the same as Mr. Giles, sir.'
1	‘In the name of all that’s calculated to drive one crazy, man,’ said the unfortunate single gentleman, ‘have you not, for some reason of your own, taken upon yourself my errand?
1	I suppose it is impossible that he can have written in the ordinary course--by mail packet, or ship letter, you understand--’ ‘Ay, ay, my lad,’ said the Captain approvingly.
1	"No, I don't say that.

1	'He looks as if he was a-going, miss,' bawled Brittles, in the same manner as before.
1	"And he told me," he said, playing little chords where I shall put full stops, "The Coavinses had left.
1	‘No answer,’ said Nicholas, speaking very loud, under the impression that Newman Noggs was deaf.
1	It had a brick floor, and a window of diamond panes, and a flounce hanging below the chimney-piece, and strings nailed from bottom to top outside the window on which scarlet-beans were to grow in the coming season if the Fates were propitious.
1	On the third, being able to sit up in his bedchamber, he despatched his valet with a message to Mr. Wardle and Mr. Trundle, intimating that if they would take their wine there, that evening, they would greatly oblige him.
1	‘Why, I am afraid it wouldn’t,’ replied the agent; ‘if it were done by yourself, my dear Sir, I think it would make you very popular.’ ‘Very well,’ said the Honourable Samuel Slumkey, with a resigned air, ‘then it must be done.
1	For the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic course of treachery and deception.
1	We have but to look at you, and we know.”’ ‘Oh, a good ‘un are you for the post,’ thought Fledgeby, ‘and a good ‘un was I to mark you out for it!
1	The young man, telling him he is fortunate in his choice of a time, for his father is there, leads the way to the office where he is to be found.
1	If it ain’t stark staring impudence, what do you call it?’ ‘Don’t be warm, Noddy,’ Mrs Boffin urged.
1	Above all things, you were to do nothing in private, or on your own account.
1	I was confused, and was going by them, when the gentleman cried: ‘What!
1	It was completely covered with such inscriptions.
1	The perspective was so long and so darkened by leaves, and the shadows of the branches on the ground made it so much more intricate to the eye, that at first I could not discern what figure it was.
1	We have not talked much, but Dora has been perfectly contented and cheerful.
1	He was quite sensible at that time.’ Mrs Clennam shook her head; whether in dismissal of the deceased or opposing herself to her son’s opinion, was not clearly expressed.
1	Dick was about to answer that he felt much better, though still as weak as need be, when his little nurse, pushing the visitors aside and pressing up to his pillow as if in jealousy of their interference, set his breakfast before him, and insisted on his taking it before he underwent the fatigue of speaking or of being spoken to.
1	As he could hear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice (this was while my mind was so busy), he even at last began to doubt whether I was there, when suddenly I cried out loudly, and he answered the cries, and rushed in, closely followed by the other two.
1	‘P’raps he might ha’ throw’d a small light on that ‘ere liver complaint as we wos a-speakin’ on, just now.
1	‘I would if I could,’ said he of the good-tempered face; ‘for I hold that in this, as in all other cases where people who are strangers to each other are thrown unexpectedly together, they should endeavour to render themselves as pleasant, for the joint sake of the little community, as possible.’ ‘I wish the maxim were more generally acted on, in all cases,’ said the grey-headed gentleman.
1	Jo slowly munches as he slowly tells it.
1	said Charlotte, 'what a rum creature you are!
1	Or, perhaps, you are not unprepared for the announcement I have it in charge to make?’ ‘I cannot say that, father, until I hear it.
1	Good- evening, Sir.’ Having concluded this speech, and uttered the last three words in a loud key, he stalked majestically after his friend, closely followed by Doctor Slammer, who said nothing, but contented himself by withering the company with a look.
1	The hours are your own to choose, after you’ve done for the day with your house here.
1	It had been left in his charge in the morning, with a strict injunction that it should not be delivered until night.’ Mr. Pickwick opened the epistle.
1	It was a sorrowful strain of parting, and the fresh young voice was very plaintive and tender.
1	A few words passed between them while they were thus engaged, but as their voices were partially stifled by the cupboard, all that Nicholas could distinguish was, that Mr. Squeers said what Mrs. Squeers had said, was injudicious, and that Mrs. Squeers said what Mr. Squeers said, was ‘stuff.’ A vast deal of searching and rummaging ensued, and it proving fruitless, Smike was called in, and pushed by Mrs. Squeers, and boxed by Mr. Squeers; which course of treatment brightening his intellects, enabled him to suggest that possibly Mrs. Squeers might have the spoon in her pocket, as indeed turned out to be the case.
1	if he came to that, yes, there might be a beautiful ivory case of jewels on her dressing-table; when these pictures were in a moment darkened and blotted out.
1	I’ll turn the general subject over in my mind for a minute or two, and while I’m about it you can empty your bag and get ready for me.’ With another comfortable plunge, Mr Fledgeby fell asleep again.
1	He could not bear it.
1	And to-morrow night, your ladyship, they will come into my possession."
1	With all my whole heart, Esther!"
1	Mr and Mrs Toots withdrew to the Bedford (Mrs Toots had been there before in old times, under her maiden name of Nipper), and there found a letter, which it took Mr Toots such an enormous time to read, that Mrs Toots was frightened.
1	Mr Flintwinch shut him out, and chained him out, without a moment’s loss of time.
1	The three spectators seemed quite stupefied.
1	It appears to be all in the testator's handwriting.
1	When she had thoroughly explained the localities of the place, the best position from which to watch it without exciting observation, and the night and hour on which Monks was most in the habit of frequenting it, she seemed to consider for a few moments, for the purpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly to her recollection.
1	Who has made the least allusion to gold watches?’ ‘You did,’ returned Dora.
1	It made my second year much happier than my first; and, what was better still, made Dora’s life all sunshine.
1	My Lords and Gentlemen and Honourable Boards, it really was as composed as our own faces, and almost as dignified.
1	Her small, slight hand was still upon the letter, when they heard some one in the gallery outside.
1	In a few seconds he came up to breathe; and scarce     had his head reached the surface of the water when it was completely     riddled with the shot of their guns, and he sunk, to rise no more!’                             ‘_Murder in Arkansas_.
1	The refreshment being produced, and very heartily partaken of, Mr Towlinson’s suggestion is, in effect, that Cook is going, and that if we are not true to ourselves, nobody will be true to us.
1	One of the pen-and-ink gentlemen goes over the house as a last attention; sticking up bills in the windows respecting the lease of this desirable family mansion, and shutting the shutters.
1	It did not appear that Mrs Boffin knew of this taste.
1	‘My dear Sir,’ said the little man, in a low tone, taking Mr. Wardle and Mr. Pickwick apart--‘my dear Sir, we’re in a very awkward situation.
1	I do not believe it now.’ ‘That is to say, you once persuaded yourself to believe it, from knowing him to be suspected.
1	Stay--the words are written, and may go, but if they convey any notion that Kit, in the plentiful board and comfortable lodging of his new abode, began to think slightingly of the poor fare and furniture of his old dwelling, they do their office badly and commit injustice.
1	So mean is extremity, that I sometimes sent him to Hyde Park corner to see what o'clock it was.
1	‘Mr Gills!’ said Carker, with a smile, ‘sit down.
1	Yes, to the latest and the last.
1	Here, you Sir, what’s your name, walk in, will you?’ In compliance with this unceremonious invitation, Jingle and Job walked into the room, but, seeing Mr. Pickwick, stopped short in some confusion.
1	Monseigneur, a petition.” With an exclamation of impatience, but with his unchangeable face, Monseigneur looked out.
1	Quickly turning round, I saw that same expression on his face again; and all at once, I don't know how, it flashed upon me as a new and far-off possibility that I understood it.
1	One wretched breathless child, panting with exhaustion; terror in his looks; agony in his eyes; large drops of perspiration streaming down his face; strains every nerve to make head upon his pursuers; and as they follow on his track, and gain upon him every instant, they hail his decreasing strength with joy.
1	The violent rushes abate not, but increase in frequency and fury until at midnight, when the streets are empty, the storm goes thundering along them, rattling at all the latches, and tearing at all the shutters, as if warning the people to get up and fly with it, rather than have the roofs brought down upon their brains.
1	‘Strong phrenological developments of the organ of firmness, in Mr. Murdstone and his sister, sir.’ I replied with such an expressive look, that Mr. Chillip was emboldened by that, and the negus together, to give his head several short shakes, and thoughtfully exclaim, ‘Ah, dear me!
1	If he had been Mr Pipchin, he’d have had some reason to grunt.
1	Presents are made to the Boffin servants, and bland strangers with business-cards meeting said servants in the street, offer hypothetical corruption.
1	Joe--he’s asleep again!--Joe, take that horse from the gentlemen, and lead it into the stable.’ The fat boy sauntered heavily behind them with the animal; and the old gentleman, condoling with his guests in homely phrase on so much of the day’s adventures as they thought proper to communicate, led the way to the kitchen.
1	Sir Leicester Dedlock remains immovable, with the same icy surface upon him, except that he once or twice looks towards Mr. Bucket, as relying on that officer alone of all mankind.
1	It was an amateur-sculler, well up to his work though taking it easily, in so light a boat that the Rogue remarked: ‘A little less on you, and you’d a’most ha’ been a Wagerbut’; then went to work at his windlass handles and sluices, to let the sculler in.
1	More spiritual and affectionate friendships appeared to exist among them, than would be found among other young persons suffering under no deprivation; but this I expected and was prepared to find.
1	‘Oh, so peaceful and so thankful!
1	Thirty or forty years ago, before losses and chancery suits came upon it, it was a thriving place; but now it is a desolate island indeed.
1	‘Should you like to go to school at Canterbury?’ said my aunt.
1	Favour me with your attention, half a minute.’ He took a bunch of keys from his pocket, singled out by the candle-light the key he wanted, and then, with a candle in his hand, went to a bureau or escritoire, unlocked it, touched the spring of a little secret drawer, and took from it an ordinary ring-case made for a single ring.
1	Through this person you strike at me, Podsnap the Great.
1	But the greatest wonder that I heard of Mr. Creakle was, there being one boy in the school on whom he never ventured to lay a hand, and that boy being J. Steerforth.
1	Is that the way you do your duty?’ ‘Beyond an impression that he is to sit upon my knee and be seconded at some point of the solemnities, like a principal at a prizefight, I assure you I have no notion what my duty is,’ returns Mortimer.
1	The jolly old grandfather says to the wild young grandson, “I have brought you up and educated you, Fred; I have put you in the way of getting on in life; you have bolted a little out of course, as young fellows often do; and you shall never have another chance, nor the ghost of half a one.”  The wild young grandson makes answer to this and says, “You’re as rich as rich can be; you have been at no uncommon expense on my account, you’re saving up piles of money for my little sister that lives with you in a secret, stealthy, hugger-muggering kind of way and with no manner of enjoyment--why can’t you stand a trifle for your grown-up relation?” The jolly old grandfather unto this, retorts, not only that he declines to fork out with that cheerful readiness which is always so agreeable and pleasant in a gentleman of his time of life, but that he will bow up, and call names, and make reflections whenever they meet.
1	And now the moon rises to separate them, and to glimmer here and there in horizontal lines behind their stems, and to make the avenue a pavement of light among high cathedral arches fantastically broken.
1	He is going to be left alone, and if he will allow me--not to take Walter’s place, for that I couldn’t do, but to be his true friend and help him if I ever can while Walter is away, I shall be very much obliged to him indeed.
1	I beg, therefore, to be understood as foregoing the bird’s-nest.
1	But it must be remembered that New York, as a great emporium of commerce, and as a place of general resort, not only from all parts of the States, but from most parts of the world, has always a large pauper population to provide for; and labours, therefore, under peculiar difficulties in this respect.
1	Miss Dombey, in her guileless innocent heart, regards me as her adopted brother; but what would the guile and guilt of my heart be, if I pretended to believe that I had any right to approach her, familiarly, in that character--if I pretended to forget that I am bound, in honour, not to do it?’ ‘Wal’r, my lad,’ hinted the Captain, with some revival of his discomfiture, ‘ain’t there no other character as--’ ‘Oh!’ returned Walter, ‘would you have me die in her esteem--in such esteem as hers--and put a veil between myself and her angel’s face for ever, by taking advantage of her being here for refuge, so trusting and so unprotected, to endeavour to exalt myself into her lover?
1	'Say I've gone to sleep--they'll believe you.
1	This is not the time at which I am to enter on the state of my mind beneath its load of sorrow.
1	The shining bald head, which looked so very large because it shone so much; and the long grey hair at its sides and back, like floss silk or spun glass, which looked so very benevolent because it was never cut; were not, of course, to be seen in the boy as in the old man.
1	All the rest of that day, and from morning to night afterwards, she sat at that desk, scratching composedly with a hard pen, speaking in the same imperturbable whisper to everybody; never relaxing a muscle of her face, or softening a tone of her voice, or appearing with an atom of her dress astray.
1	It will be sufficient to say that the lesson was given--that evening passed and night came on--that the old man again grew restless and impatient--that he quitted the house secretly at the same hour as before--and that the child was once more left alone within its gloomy walls.
1	‘I fear,’ said Nicholas, shaking his head, and making an attempt to smile, ‘that your better-half would be more struck with him now than ever.’ ‘What mean you?’ rejoined Mrs. Crummles, in her most popular manner.
1	The History of a Self-Tormentor      22.  Who Passes by this Road so late?
1	It galled Ralph to the heart’s core, and he hated Nicholas from that hour.
1	‘You must walk the rest, sir; it’s not many yards.’ He spoke in the singular number, to the express exclusion of Eugene.
1	I rather think that neither the blow, nor the allusion, would have escaped me, but for the assurance I had had from Agnes that night.
1	she cried as he fell heavily and calmly back from before her.
1	said Master Bates, highly amused by this declaration.
1	There was a fitness in that.
1	I shall now beg to propose Mr Solomon Gills with three times three and one cheer more.
1	It showed how long Paul’s childish life had been to him, and how his hopes were set upon a later stage of his existence.
1	‘Now I look at you again, I see that the gentleman at Canterbury hadn’t the same eyes as you--you’ll think me very foolish for taking notice of such things, won’t you?’ ‘Not at all,’ said Nicholas.
1	He knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger.
1	'My hopes, my wishes, prospects, feeling:  every thought in life except my love for you:  have undergone a change.
1	With all these personal advantages (to which may be added a strong savour of tobacco-smoke, and a prevailing greasiness of appearance) Mr Swiveller leant back in his chair with his eyes fixed on the ceiling, and occasionally pitching his voice to the needful key, obliged the company with a few bars of an intensely dismal air, and then, in the middle of a note, relapsed into his former silence.
1	No, you only showed it.
1	With this irrepressible ebullition of mirth, Master Bates laid himself flat on the floor: and kicked convulsively for five minutes, in an ectasy of facetious joy.
1	When in the distrust engendered by his wretched childhood and the action for evil--never yet for good within his knowledge then--of his father and his father’s wealth on all within their influence, he conceived the idea of his first deception, it was meant to be harmless, it was to last but a few hours or days, it was to involve in it only the girl so capriciously forced upon him and upon whom he was so capriciously forced, and it was honestly meant well towards her.
1	I knew I was as innocent of my birth as a queen of hers and that before my Heavenly Father I should not be punished for birth nor a queen rewarded for it.
1	‘If your more important avocations should admit of your ever tracing these imperfect characters thus far--which may be, or may not be, as circumstances arise--you will naturally inquire by what object am I influenced, then, in inditing the present missive?
1	‘To be sure,’ said Nicholas.
1	"I am glad I said he was an honourable man, out of all this wretched affair.
1	The inequality of Birth was nothing to it.
1	‘Important witnesses; saw you in a delicate situation.’ ‘But she fainted of her own accord,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	Every man holds a discovery on the same terms.’ ‘That is to say,’ said Arthur, with a growing admiration of his quiet companion, ‘you are not finally discouraged even now?’ ‘I have no right to be, if I am,’ returned the other.
1	I washed my hands and face, to do the greater honour to his gentility, and we walked to our house, as I suppose I must now call it, together; Mr. Micawber impressing the name of streets, and the shapes of corner houses upon me, as we went along, that I might find my way back, easily, in the morning.
1	The other--that was he who took the money--had rather a careful and cautious look, which was perhaps inseparable from his occupation also.
1	All at once, in this serenity, great Nature spoke to me; and soothed me to lay down my weary head upon the grass, and weep as I had not wept yet, since Dora died!
1	When I supposed that his intended wife was here, and his marriage close at hand, how could I entertain the possibility of his voluntarily leaving this place, in a manner that would be so unaccountable, capricious, and cruel?
1	She came aside and whispered to me, while tears of honest love and admiration stood in her bright eyes, "He's a dear good fellow, miss; but he can't write yet--he's going to learn of me--and I wouldn't shame him for the world!"
1	For tea there was plenty of milk and water, and bread and butter, with a little black tea-pot for Mrs Pipchin and Berry, and buttered toast unlimited for Mrs Pipchin, which was brought in, hot and hot, like the chops.
1	You observe, Mr. Harthouse, that my wife is my junior.
1	Mentioning that, I may tell you, between ourselves, that I am sometimes tempted to do for him myself.’ Arthur started and said, ‘Dear me, Pancks, don’t say that!’ ‘Understand me,’ said Pancks, extending five cropped coaly finger-nails on Arthur’s arm; ‘I don’t mean, cut his throat.
1	Mrs. Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the two young Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook hands.
1	If you would have me ask his pardon, I will do it, Mama.
1	It won’t do no good, this won’t.’ ‘Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick reproachfully.
1	“And arter all, my Lord,” says he, “it’s a amiable weakness.” So I says respectin’ widders, Sammy, and so you’ll say, ven you gets as old as me.’ ‘I ought to ha’ know’d better, I know,’ said Sam.
1	‘Not often out at this time, miss,’ replied the man in a tone which rendered “Miss,” something more offensive than “My dear.” ‘Can I see her?’ asked Kate.
1	‘I might feel it was a great blow,’ said Miss Snevellicci, ‘to break up old associations and what-do-you-callems of that kind, but I would submit, my dear, I would indeed.’ ‘So would I,’ said Miss Ledrook; ‘I would rather court the yoke than shun it.
1	said Mr. Brownlow; 'there is something to go back.'
1	Are you pretty well?’ To which that vocalist returned, ‘I thank you, honoured sir, I am all the better for seeing your honour.’ As they went along the yard, the Father of the Marshalsea presented him to a Collegian of recent date.
1	He don't want to keep it.
1	You can marry her, arter you and me have come to a settlement.
1	‘I’m rather confined for room here, but you must put up with all that, when you come to see a young bachelor.
1	‘And what do you think of Me?’ The honesty of Mr Sloppy being severely taxed by the question, he twisted a button, grinned, and faltered.
1	Edith, in compassion, bends over her and speaks to her.
1	I feel the difficulty and delicacy of the matter so much that I would rather avoid speaking to you at your own home.
1	But Mr Dombey stopped him short.
1	“Yah!” said Wemmick, touching me on the breast with his forefinger; “you're a deep one, Mr. Pip!
1	‘Ahem,’ coughs Mrs Miff whose cough is drier than the hay in any hassock in her charge, ‘you’ll come to us one of these mornings, my dears, unless I’m much mistaken!’ They are looking at a tablet on the wall, erected to the memory of someone dead.
1	A footstep on the stairs, and now the door was slowly opening.
1	I did as he required, but I was left there a long time, praying for my unhappy mother.
1	Not only that evening, but for several succeeding evenings, Clennam was quite charmed by this investigation.
1	‘That was the way, was it?’ said Mr. Gregsbury.
1	And indeed all these gentlemen were so very persevering and energetic in this latter particular, and bestowed their favours so abundantly upon the carpet, that I take it for granted the Presidential housemaids have high wages, or, to speak more genteelly, an ample amount of ‘compensation:’ which is the American word for salary, in the case of all public servants.
1	‘Let it be near at hand, that’s all.’ ‘Close here, sir, if you please to walk this way.’ ‘Would the gentleman like this room?’ said a voice, as a little out-of-the-way door at the foot of the well staircase flew briskly open and a head popped out.
1	"You're particular, for a shade."
1	Now, what more?’ ‘This more.
1	Dean’t make that noise, wooman.’ As the man spoke, he proceeded to wrench open the uppermost door of the coach, while Nicholas, seizing the horn, awoke the echoes far and wide with one of the most extraordinary performances on that instrument ever heard by mortal ears.
1	‘She’s a-goin’ off,’ soliloquised Sam in great perplexity.
1	‘I never saw such a face, Uncle Sol.
1	The trooper retires to a distant part of the room and resumes his curious inspection of the boxes, strong and otherwise.
1	He is taken off, humbly protesting his innocence.
1	‘My dear Nickleby,’ said the gentleman, taking off a white hat which was so full of papers that it would scarcely stick upon his head, ‘there’s not a moment to lose; I have a cab at the door.
1	This custodian of George's Gallery in George's absence concludes his proceedings, when he has locked the great doors and turned out all the lights but one, which he leaves to glimmer, by dragging out from a wooden cabin in a corner two mattresses and bedding.
1	You could go on Poll Parroting enough with her, when I warn’t come in: Poll Parrot a little with her on this pint.
1	There is another pump room, into which infirm ladies and gentlemen are wheeled, in such an astonishing variety of chairs and chaises, that any adventurous individual who goes in with the regular number of toes, is in imminent danger of coming out without them; and there is a third, into which the quiet people go, for it is less noisy than either.
1	Of course it’s a great advantage to him, in all his little fashionable descriptions, to have the benefit of my--hem--of my experience, because, of course, few authors who write about such things can have such opportunities of knowing them as I have.
1	And with Mrs Boffin was a young lady (Miss Bella Wilfer by name) who was better worth staring at, it occurred to Sloppy, than the best of wall-papering.
1	In the meantime, Bunsby, still hugging Miss Nipper (for his friend, the Captain, had not exaggerated the softness of his heart), uniformly preserved his gravity of deportment, and showed no other consciousness of her or anything.
1	Permit Mrs. Leo Hunter, Sir, to have the gratification of seeing you at the Den.’ ‘With great pleasure,’ replied Mr. Pickwick.
1	For what are you, my young friend?
1	I am fond of hard work, and am true to my word."
1	It’s not a foolish fancy.
1	If I sit here thinking of him," snarls the old man, holding up his impotent ten fingers, "I want to strangle him now."
1	Ale.’ ‘But there is wine here, aunt.
1	‘Well,’ returned Mr. Dick, scratching his ear with his pen, and looking dubiously at me.
1	‘As you are in no hurry, then,’ said Steerforth, ‘come home with me to Highgate, and stay a day or two.
1	Mr. Neville, I believe you tell your sister everything that passes between us?’ ‘Everything, sir.’ ‘Consequently,’ said Mr. Crisparkle, ‘your sister is aware that I have repeatedly urged you to make some kind of apology for that unfortunate occurrence which befell on the night of your arrival here.’  In saying it he looked to her, and not to him; therefore it was she, and not he, who replied: ‘Yes.’ ‘I call it unfortunate, Miss Helena,’ resumed Mr. Crisparkle, ‘forasmuch as it certainly has engendered a prejudice against Neville.
1	It was not until he had seen him for some time that he began to identify him; but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me, and known him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time.
1	‘To the Devil with your witnesses!
1	With infinite pains and cunning, he double locks and bars forty-nine of them, and cannot see the fiftieth standing wide open.
1	‘Nor to ruin a great many people whom I know.
1	Mr. Sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes; and it was arranged that Oliver should go to him that evening 'upon liking'--a phrase which means, in the case of a parish apprentice, that if the master find, upon a short trial, that he can get enough work out of a boy without putting too much food into him, he shall have him for a term of years, to do what he likes with.
1	However, it was agreed between them that he should see the original when he next appeared.
1	Stand before me!’ roared Mr. Winkle.
1	I receive a bill--say from Jones.
1	‘Not now, Lizzie, dear,’ said Jenny; ‘let us have a talk by the fire.’ With those words, she in her turn loosened her friend’s dark hair, and it dropped of its own weight over her bosom, in two rich masses.
1	Then she is enraged again, and makes some mention of swindlers.
1	I wish you many happy returns of the day.
1	You are absolutely tropical.’ ‘By George, Ma’am,’ said the Major, ‘the time has been when Joseph Bagstock has been grilled and blistered by the Sun; then time was, when he was forced, Ma’am, into such full blow, by high hothouse heat in the West Indies, that he was known as the Flower.
1	I should not have a secret from you.
1	Our next point was Cincinnati: and as this was a steamboat journey, and western steamboats usually blow up one or two a week in the season, it was advisable to collect opinions in reference to the comparative safety of the vessels bound that way, then lying in the river.
1	Some thought the comic singer decidedly low, and others hoped he would have more to do than he usually had.
1	‘There is a rather difficult country about Bethnal Green,’ said Eugene, ‘and we have not taken in that direction lately.
1	Brown paper parcel here, that’s all--other luggage gone by water--packing-cases, nailed up--big as houses--heavy, heavy, damned heavy,’ replied the stranger, as he forced into his pocket as much as he could of the brown paper parcel, which presented most suspicious indications of containing one shirt and a handkerchief.
1	And a wise man he must have been to think so!
1	Hope that we shall meet again, on this side of the grave.
1	‘Say I am sorry to trouble him at so late an hour; but I am anxious to see him to- night, and have only just arrived.’ The girl looked timidly at Mr. Bob Sawyer, who was expressing his admiration of her personal charms by a variety of wonderful grimaces; and casting an eye at the hats and greatcoats which hung in the passage, called another girl to mind the door while she went upstairs.
1	Hooroar for another turn!’ Another tossing of arms, another nod, and another shrill chorus: ‘Bradley Headstone!’ ‘I’ve got it now!’ said Riderhood, after attentively listening, and internally repeating: ‘Bradley.
1	He coughed; she looked up and smiled.
1	What is the matter?’ ‘Wait a bit, and I’ll tell you.
1	He accepted no information or explanation at second hand, but made himself the master of everything confided to him.
1	I am sure you know me better than to do so.
1	Whereas, the Sparkler question was on the different footing that any one could see what was going on there, and Little Dorrit saw it and pondered on it with many doubts and wonderings.
1	Half a dozen young rooks in violent conversation, flew out to ask what the matter was.
1	Oliver started too, though from a very different cause; for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being taken back.
1	He drew the hand Miss Flite held through her arm and brought her something nearer to him.
1	A sharp rain, too, was beating against the window-panes; and the sky looked black and cloudy.
1	Amazing creatures they were in Louisa’s eyes, so white and pink of complexion, so scant of dress, and so demonstrative of leg; but it was very agreeable to see them crowding about Sissy, and very natural in Sissy to be unable to refrain from tears.
1	said Sikes; backing the inquiry with a very common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features: which, if it were heard above, only once out of every fifty thousand times that it is uttered below, would render blindness as common a disorder as measles: 'what do you mean by it?
1	Lovers had loved before, and lovers would love again; but no lover had loved, might, could, would, or should ever love, as I loved Dora.
1	Not English.’ An approving murmur arose from the heads of tribes; as saying, ‘There you have him!
1	All this was pleasant, but this was as nothing compared with the shouting of the populace when the carriage drew up, behind Mr. Pott’s chariot, which chariot itself drew up at Mr. Pott’s door, which door itself opened, and displayed the great Pott accoutred as a Russian officer of justice, with a tremendous knout in his hand--tastefully typical of the stern and mighty power of the Eatanswill _Gazette_, and the fearful lashings it bestowed on public offenders.
1	‘I have thowt of it oftentimes, but I can’t awize myself of it, no matters.’ I recalled to his remembrance the morning after her departure, when we were all three on the beach.
1	‘He’s uncommon pale,’ replied his father, ‘’cept about the nose, which is redder than ever.
1	Disdaining to reply, she stretched her arm out, pointing to the chair.
1	Paul couldn’t understand what that had to do with it, nor why the two young women looked on so seriously, nor why Florence turned away her face for a moment, and then turned it back, lighted up again with smiles.
1	Would you be so good as to--as to speak up, Mr.
1	Then, she withdrew her hand, and kissed his lips once more, and went away.
1	In short, we want to cheer your daughter, and to give her the opportunity of sharing such pleasures as we are a going to take ourselves.
1	It was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the back, with a despotic monster of a four-post bedstead in it, straddling over the whole place, putting one of his arbitrary legs into the fireplace and another into the doorway, and squeezing the wretched little washing-stand in quite a Divinely Righteous manner.
1	If he has any decided impression in reference to it, I should say it was that it is a tiresome pursuit.
1	"By my soul," exclaimed Mr. Boythorn, suddenly firing another volley, "that fellow is, and his father was, and his grandfather was, the most stiff-necked, arrogant imbecile, pig-headed numskull, ever, by some inexplicable mistake of Nature, born in any station of life but a walking-stick's!
1	'And now you do see me,' said Monks, rising boldly, 'what then?
1	‘The first letter of the name of the deceased,’ replied Pell.
1	I said, “My daughter, there are times of moral danger when the hardest virtuous resolution to form is flight, and when the most heroic bravery is flight.” She answered, she had had this in her thoughts; but whither to fly without help she knew not, and there were none to help her.
1	"Come," he says; "I am ready."
1	I recall him bending his aching head, supported on his bony hand, over the book on his desk, and wretchedly endeavouring to get on with his tiresome work, amidst an uproar that might have made the Speaker of the House of Commons giddy.
1	‘Traddles is quite a good fellow.’ ‘It’s a curious coincidence,’ said I.
1	Mr. Jorkins.’ ‘And the premium, sir,’ I returned, ‘is a thousand pounds?’ ‘And the premium, Stamp included, is a thousand pounds,’ said Mr. Spenlow.
1	Bar was lost in astonishment and concern.
1	I shall know what to do next; never fear.'
1	His head was awry, and he had a one-sided, crab-like way with him, as if his foundations had yielded at about the same time as those of the house, and he ought to have been propped up in a similar manner.
1	I would sooner have strangled him than had no return.
1	But I had as sound a sleep in that lodging as in the most superior accommodation the Boar could have given me, and the quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom.
1	While the dogs are yet barking and howling--there is one dog howling like a demon--the church-clocks, as if they were startled too, begin to strike.
1	But I tell you what.
1	For example, then, said the little woman, what species of gift did Monsieur desire?
1	Mr. Bumble made no reply; but in a slow and dignified manner, put his arm round the matron's waist.
1	And in this position the old man, happening in course of time to look that way, at length chanced to see him: to his unbounded astonishment.
1	You are an older hand at this than I thought you, Tupman; you have been out before.’ It was in vain for Mr. Tupman to protest, with a smile of self-denial, that he never had.
1	She may be right, she may be wrong; but, right or wrong, this is not my course with MY young family.
1	So, both sets of gates were, for the moment, closed.
1	‘In only five hours and a half,’ said Little Dorrit, ‘we shall be able to go home.’ To speak of home, and to go and look at it, it being so near, was a natural sequence.
1	Mr. Bagnet is an ex-artilleryman, tall and upright, with shaggy eyebrows and whiskers like the fibres of a coco-nut, not a hair upon his head, and a torrid complexion.
1	Deep ditch, single drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke.
1	One excellent quality of Mr. Pickwick’s character was beautifully displayed at this moment, under the most trying circumstances.
1	For, the poor little harmless gentleman once had his fancy, like the rest of us, and she didn’t answer (as she often does not), and he thinks the adorable bridesmaid is like the fancy as she was then (which she is not at all), and that if the fancy had not married some one else for money, but had married him for love, he and she would have been happy (which they wouldn’t have been), and that she has a tenderness for him still (whereas her toughness is a proverb).
1	I’ll catch you up in a mile.’ In a word, his real time of relief being that evening at sunset, his mate came lounging in, within a quarter of an hour.
1	“Was there any large school near?” I asked him, in reference to the letter.
1	Arthur, still having his purpose, still remained.
1	And Jenny wants you to know that she wouldn't have made away with it herself for a heap of money but that the lady took it and left some money instead.
1	Even so soon as next week.’ ‘How do you know I shall?’ ‘I don’t quite know how, Charley, but I do.’ In spite of her unchanged manner of speaking, and her unchanged appearance of composure, she scarcely trusted herself to look at him, but kept her eyes employed on the cutting and buttering of his bread, and on the mixing of his tea, and other such little preparations.
1	"Mr. Jarndyce," he said, looking off it, "you have perused this?"
1	That ought to bring three very decent houses.’ ‘Then I am to make three last appearances, am I?’ inquired Nicholas, smiling.
1	Yet, in all the hurry of my thoughts, wild running with the thundering sea,--the storm, and my uneasiness regarding Ham were always in the fore-ground.
1	The monotonous ringing of the bells and tramping of the horses; the monotony of his anxiety, and useless rage; the monotonous wheel of fear, regret, and passion, he kept turning round and round; made the journey like a vision, in which nothing was quite real but his own torment.
1	I can’t manage a discussion.
1	"Fitz-Jarndyce, my dear"--she had bestowed that name on Caddy, it appeared, and always called her by it--"a double welcome!"
1	'Not I,' said Monks, turning away his eyes and beating his foot upon the ground, as a man who is determined to deny everything.
1	I only tried to frighten you.
1	Sissy, though well acquainted with his Royal line, had no personal knowledge of the present Emperor, and his reign was peaceful.
1	Take all the praise, take all the blame; take all the success, take all the failure; in short, take me.” “O, look at her, look at her!” cried Miss Havisham, bitterly; “Look at her so hard and thankless, on the hearth where she was reared!
1	Is out of employ now; and never touches a drop of foreign wine by any chance (tremendous plaudits).
1	We had stopped, and the waggon had stopped too.
1	To Mr Venus’s museum Mr Wegg repaired when at length the Mounds were down and gone.
1	‘I am not to suppose,’ said Ralph, ‘that you are dolt enough to forgive or forget, very readily, the violence that was committed upon you, or the exposure which accompanied it?’ ‘Devil a bit,’ replied Squeers, tartly.
1	No; for such a tone--call it familiarity, levity, equality, or what you will--would imply those social interchanges which do not exist.
1	I could see none, I could hear none.
1	Not that her face was very youthful, for in truth there was more consideration and care in it than naturally belonged to her utmost years; but she was so little and light, so noiseless and shy, and appeared so conscious of being out of place among the three hard elders, that she had all the manner and much of the appearance of a subdued child.
1	However, he was obliged to try some other mode of getting popular, and this one occurred to him.
1	She was a little dilapidated--like a house--with having been so long to let; yet had, as I have said, an appearance of good looks.
1	By dint of this ingenious scheme, his gloves were got on to perfection.
1	But the ashes of the father do not mingle with theirs; nor, from that night forward, did the attorney ever gain the remotest clue to the subsequent history of his queer client.’ As the old man concluded his tale, he advanced to a peg in one corner, and taking down his hat and coat, put them on with great deliberation; and, without saying another word, walked slowly away.
1	If anybody was to be begged off from impending punishment, Paul was always the delegate.
1	Keep your weather eye awake and don’t make any more acquaintances, however handsome.
1	Untenable, unreasonable, inconclusive, and preposterous!’ Mr. Grewgious said all this, as if he were reading it aloud; or, still more, as if he were repeating a lesson.
1	“Come, come!” said he, in a whimpering miserable way; “let me get to work.
1	I starts light with Rob only; I comes to a branch; I takes on what I finds there; and a whole train of ideas gets coupled on to him, afore I knows where I am, or where they comes from.
1	Sir Mulberry drank to recompense himself for his recent abstinence; the young lord, to drown his indignation; and the remainder of the party, because the wine was of the best and they had nothing to pay.
1	The spectators saw in the two figures, a young lady of little more than twenty, and a gentleman who was evidently her father; a man of a very remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair, and a certain indescribable intensity of face: not of an active kind, but pondering and self-communing.
1	Only once during dinner was there any conversation that included the young gentlemen.
1	And I know you are generous!’ He said, ‘I hope I am not ungenerous to you, Rosa.’  He called her Pussy no more.
1	Additional sum as per bond, five hundred pound.
1	They walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every gate, and post, and tree; until a little market-town appeared in the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river.
1	‘How dare you say you are not drunk, Sir, when I say you are?
1	You must not refuse, sir.'
1	So, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, passed; and on Friday morning I went to Mr. Pumblechook's, to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to Miss Havisham.
1	I’ll only say that you have no profession to make to me or mine, and no forgiveness to entreat; and that all in the world that I ask you to do, is, to count five-and-twenty, Tattycoram.’ She looked at him for an instant, and then said frowningly, ‘I won’t.
1	When all was ready, this man, still taking his last hurried charges from his comrades and the surgeon after the windlass had begun to lower him, disappeared into the pit.
1	Here's a shilling for you.
1	'I have seen you before, I think?'
1	‘Wery good thing is weal pie, when you know the lady as made it, and is quite sure it ain’t kittens; and arter all though, where’s the odds, when they’re so like weal that the wery piemen themselves don’t know the difference?’ ‘Don’t they, Sam?’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	From the centre of the ceiling of this kitchen, old Wardle had just suspended, with his own hands, a huge branch of mistletoe, and this same branch of mistletoe instantaneously gave rise to a scene of general and most delightful struggling and confusion; in the midst of which, Mr. Pickwick, with a gallantry that would have done honour to a descendant of Lady Tollimglower herself, took the old lady by the hand, led her beneath the mystic branch, and saluted her in all courtesy and decorum.
1	‘Now, here’s the cab, and here’s the boxes, get along with you, do!’ said Mrs Pipchin, presenting herself at the same moment.
1	All this was done in a perfect manner, and he never raised his eyes from what he was about.
1	From that time, with occasional wild charges, like a wounded monster dying, it drops and sinks; and at full daylight it is dead.
1	Sophronia will never forget that at Veneering’s she first saw him.
1	'Lock the door on the outside,' said Mr. Brownlow to the attendants, 'and come when I ring.'
1	Or, she may have had assistance from the boatmen, and the boatmen’s wives and children.
1	It would break my heart to believe that you thought of me in any way that would make me stranger to you than I was when you were so good to me.
1	After a time he followed us to the further end of the gallery, and Richard and I were going quietly away when Mr. George came after us.
1	‘To hang himself!’ repeated Mr. Lillyvick.
1	‘Precious warm walking, isn’t it?’ said Lowten, drawing a Bramah key from his pocket, with a small plug therein, to keep the dust out.
1	Will somebody hand me anything hard and bruising to pelt at her?
1	By this time, certain vans had arrived for the conveyance of the goods, and divers strong men in caps were balancing chests of drawers and other trifles of that nature upon their heads, and performing muscular feats which heightened their complexions considerably.
1	Mrs Boffin, lost in her own fluttered inability to make this out, looked at Mr Boffin.
1	A master-mind.” “What's that?” I asked, in some hope of bringing him to a stand.
1	Whether it is a wine-stain, fruit-stain, beer-stain, water-stain, paint-stain, pitch-stain, mud-stain, or blood-stain--' The man got no further, for Sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew the table, and tearing the hat from him, burst out of the house.
1	‘Really,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘the period has arrived when Thomas ought to go to Bounderby.’ Time, sticking to him, passed him on into Bounderby’s Bank, made him an inmate of Bounderby’s house, necessitated the purchase of his first razor, and exercised him diligently in his calculations relative to number one.
1	He was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air, each one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares long, long, forgotten!
1	Caddy then went on to reason, how could he be expected to be a scholar when he had passed his whole life in the dancing-school and had done nothing but teach and fag, fag and teach, morning, noon, and night!
1	Give this glass to me.
1	‘And as Wal’r’s going on this little voyage is, as I may say, in his day’s work, and a part of his general expectations here,’ said the Captain.
1	But I forgot--it’s a fancy-dress _dejeune_.’ ‘Dear me,’ said Mr. Pickwick, glancing at his own figure--‘I can’t possibly--’ ‘Can’t, sir; can’t!’ exclaimed Mr. Leo Hunter.
1	Yonder, where that phaeton with the well-clipped pair of grays has stopped—standing at their heads now—is a Yorkshire groom, who has not been very long in these parts, and looks sorrowfully round for a companion pair of top-boots, which he may traverse the city half a year without meeting.
1	‘With regard to the trifle of salary that is due,’ said Mr. Wititterly, ‘I will’--here he was interrupted by a violent fit of coughing--‘I will--owe it to Miss Nickleby.’ Mr. Wititterly, it should be observed, was accustomed to owe small accounts, and to leave them owing.
1	Our friend Feenix--if I may presume to--’ ‘Honoured, I am sure,’ says Cousin Feenix.
1	No!” “Nor giv' no one the office to follow you?” “No!” “Well,” said he, “I believe you.
1	I'd walk round and round the place till I dropped, if the snow was on the ground, and I hadn't a shawl to cover me.'
1	D’ye make me out pretty clear, brother?’ ‘Well, you’ll excuse me, Captain Gills,’ replied Mr Toots, ‘if I don’t quite follow you sometimes.
1	I am not, I know!’ Peggotty had hastened to the chair before the fire.
1	On the suspicions thus urged and supported, Neville was detained, and re-detained, and the search was pressed on every hand, and Jasper laboured night and day.
1	‘Really I was quite dismayed and shocked last night.
1	Nothing could have been more in accordance with Sam Weller’s feelings than the projected exposure of the real propensities and qualities of the red-nosed man; and it being very near the appointed hour of meeting, the father and son took their way at once to Brick Lane, Sam not forgetting to drop his letter into a general post-office as they walked along.
1	and how happily too; like all the other days in that most happy time!
1	That’s the creed here!’ ‘I don’t know,’ said his brother, whose roused feelings had soon yielded to surprise, ‘who may have abused your ear with such representations; or why you have chosen to try me, rather than another.
1	The post had come in heavy that morning, and Mr Carker the Manager had a good deal to do.
1	“Have you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me,” I inquired, “since he undertook that trust?” “Never set eyes upon him.
1	Lord Frederick Verisopht remained in the next box to be talked to by Mrs Wititterly, and Mr. Pyke was in attendance to throw in a word or two when necessary.
1	Mr Gills the Ship’s Instrument-maker, Sir, has looked in, about a little matter of payment, he says: but I mentioned to him, Sir, that you was engaged several deep; several deep.’ Mr Perch coughed once behind his hand, and waited for further orders.
1	It’s nonsense.’ With a slight inclination of his head, and a look of some surprise, the Secretary seemed to assent by forming the syllables of the word ‘nonsense’ on his lips.
1	That’s rather unlucky, too, for such an immaculate chap.
1	‘I have no such thoughts, indeed.’ ‘I would rather see her dancing on the green at nights,’ said the old gentleman, laying his hand upon her head, and smiling sadly, ‘than have her sitting in the shadow of our mouldering arches.
1	It was extremely difficult, I heard, to make out what he owed, or what he had paid, or of what he died possessed.
1	That, the plan of action was that they should lie by with patience; that, they should allow the Mounds to be gradually levelled and cleared away, while retaining to themselves their present opportunity of watching the process--which would be, he conceived, to put the trouble and cost of daily digging and delving upon somebody else, while they might nightly turn such complete disturbance of the dust to the account of their own private investigations--and that, when the Mounds were gone, and they had worked those chances for their own joint benefit solely, they should then, and not before, explode on the minion and worm.
1	‘Tip, dear,’ said Little Dorrit, mildly, shocked by this, ‘don’t you see--’ ‘Yes, I see, Amy.
1	‘All down Newgate Street, all down Cheapside, all up Lombard Street, down Gracechurch Street, and along Thames Street, as far as Spigwiffin’s Wharf.
1	I--I know a story, Heart’s Delight,’ stammered the Captain, ‘o’ this natur, as was told to me once; and being on this here tack, and you and me sitting alone by the fire, maybe you’d like to hear me tell it.
1	But for this it would have been difficult to detach its figure from the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was surrounded.
1	I foresaw your visit this afternoon.’ ‘Don’t!’ said Mr Inspector.
1	‘What is it?’ ‘What is it?’ repeated Mrs Merdle.
1	‘Not half what Miss Sally is, he isn’t,’ replied the small servant, shaking her head.
1	Ada very much admired some artificial flowers under a glass.
1	Few coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be suspected, and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps, and put on heavy shoes, and trudged.
1	The natural lightness and delicacy of touch which had become very refined by practice in her miniature work, no doubt was involved in this; but her perception was at least as fine.
1	‘Ye wean’t get bread and butther ev’ry neight, I expect, mun,’ said Mr Browdie, after he had sat staring at Nicholas a long time over the empty plate.
1	Fagin, do look at him!
1	As the last stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob Marley, and lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and hooded, coming, like a mist along the ground, towards him.
1	And not good, is it?’ Aghast at the light manner of her throwing her head back to look at it critically, Twemlow still dimly perceives the expediency of throwing his own head back, and does so.
1	Oh, take me somewhere!”  Much alarmed.
1	Arrived at the hotel; I saw no more of the place that night; being very tired, and glad to get to bed.
1	"Good Spirit," he pursued, as down upon the ground he fell before it: "Your nature intercedes for me, and pities me.
1	The old man of the house, pushing it open before him, appeared there with his fur cap in his hand and his cat at his heels.
1	Did you hear him say, you cur, that he was going to have the Mounds cleared off, when no doubt the whole place will be rummaged?
1	‘Unless,’ interposed the man with the camp-stool, ‘unless Mr. Winkle feels himself aggrieved by the challenge; in which case, I submit, he has a right to satisfaction.’ Mr. Winkle, with great self-denial, expressed himself quite satisfied already.
1	To question him in detail, and endeavour to reconcile his answers; to closet him with accountants and sharp practitioners, learned in the wiles of insolvency and bankruptcy; was only to put the case out at compound interest and incomprehensibility.
1	Had he any prescience of the day, five years to come, when Josiah Bounderby of Coketown was to die of a fit in the Coketown street, and this same precious will was to begin its long career of quibble, plunder, false pretences, vile example, little service and much law?
1	‘This evening.’ ‘I shall not give them any notice that we are here, you know,’ said I, delighted.
1	‘I know it,’ rejoined Nicholas.
1	He looked up, for an instant at a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract a word from him.
1	‘And what should you say,’ said the Captain--‘not committing yourself--about his time of sheering off?
1	Our people grumbled at this, as people do in such cases; but suffered the boat to be towed off with the whole freight aboard nevertheless; and away we went down the canal.
1	You must go to bed another time, my love.
1	Phil, by the by, said as much in a tone of surprise as he scrambled out of bed.
1	Never have I from the first, and never shall I to the last, regard your part in my life, but as something sacred, never to be lightly thought of, never to be esteemed enough, never, until death, to be forgotten.
1	‘The willin!’ ‘And leave off his evil ways, and set up in the chandlery line arterwards,’ said the housemaid.
1	The time drawing on rapidly for the sailing of the emigrant-ship, my good old nurse (almost broken-hearted for me, when we first met) came up to London.
1	In one part of the window was a picture of a red paper mill at which a cart was unloading a quantity of sacks of old rags.
1	"I have said, my child, that what I do, I do for your sake, not my own.
1	Indeed, some ladies had gone so far as to assert, that the dark gentleman was actually a portrait of the spirted young proprietor; and the great similarity between their head-dresses--both wore very glossy hair, with a narrow walk straight down the middle, and a profusion of flat circular curls on both sides--encouraged the idea.
1	She seemed to respect him and even to wish to conciliate him.
1	And, doubtless, such book-keeping (like certain autobiographies which have enlightened the world) cannot fail to prove serviceable, in the one respect of sparing the recording Angel some time and labour.
1	‘Your praise, sir, is commendation, indeed.’ ‘Well,’ said Squeers, ‘what’s to be done?
1	I turned round to do so, and had taken up the candle in my hand, when it was extinguished by some violent shock; and the next thing I comprehended was, that I had been caught in a strong running noose, thrown over my head from behind.
1	This, however, was a mere question of length and wearisomeness.
1	I wonder they don’t knock out their brains against--against mantelpieces,’ said my aunt; an idea which was probably suggested to her by her contemplation of mine.
1	I owe the opinion not only to Mr. C.'s connexions, against whom I should naturally wish to protect myself, but also to my own reputation--dear to myself as a professional man aiming to keep respectable; dear to my three girls at home, for whom I am striving to realize some little independence; dear, I will even say, to my aged father, whom it is my privilege to support."
1	‘There they are, like the four-and-twenty fiddlers--all of a row.
1	He     laughed when I cautioned him, and said he was as good a man as     Neville Landless any day.
1	She veils and dresses quickly, leaves all her jewels and her money, listens, goes downstairs at a moment when the hall is empty, opens and shuts the great door, flutters away in the shrill frosty wind.
1	‘You were obliged to tell him!
1	In addition to these establishments, there are in New York, excellent hospitals and schools, literary institutions and libraries; an admirable fire department (as indeed it should be, having constant practice), and charities of every sort and kind.
1	‘The--?’ My mother had been thinking of something else.
1	"You hear what she says.
1	‘I am glad to see them.
1	‘Like Jack that night!’ As he looks down at her, she looks up at him, and whimpers: ‘My lungs is weakly; my lungs is dreffle bad.
1	Don’t go out, you’ll fall dead in the street.
1	Do you know much of him?’ ‘I never saw the man in my life.’ ‘I doubt if you ever _will_ see him now.
1	Mr. Chadband, pausing with the resignation of a man accustomed to be persecuted and languidly folding up his chin into his fat smile, says, "Let us hear the maiden!
1	Her father, a gentleman in misfortune--a gentleman of a fine spirit and courtly manners, who always bore with him--he deeply honoured.
1	"I do not accuse him."
1	From that time the protection that her wondering eyes had expressed towards him, became embodied in action, and the Child of the Marshalsea took upon herself a new relation towards the Father.
1	Richard was extremely agitated and was so weak and low, though his illness was still of the mind, that my dear girl indeed had sore occasion to be supported.
1	I always had, when I was a medical man.
1	‘How dare you tease a poor lone woman like her, making her miserable and melancholy as if she hadn’t got enough to make her so, without you.
1	I'll follow the other, by G----" "The other?"
1	Homeless and fatherless, she forgave him everything; hardly thought that she had need to forgive him, or that she did; but she fled from the idea of him as she had fled from the reality, and he was utterly gone and lost.
1	Mr. Bucket looks very grave.
1	Therefore I set off to Caddy, with my guardian's consent, post-haste; and she and Prince made so much of me that there never was anything like it.
1	And blast you all!”  he wound up, looking round the room and snapping his fingers once with a loud snap, “blast you every one, from the judge in his wig, to the colonist a stirring up the dust, I'll show a better gentleman than the whole kit on you put together!” “Stop!” said I, almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike, “I want to speak to you.
1	And I anything that YOU told me.’ How delightful those interchanges, and the looks accompanying them!
1	Besides,’ said Dora, putting back her hair, and looking wonderingly at my aunt and me, ‘why shouldn’t you both go?
1	At this, the charity-boy looked monstrous fierce; and said that Oliver would want one before long, if he cut jokes with his superiors in that way.
1	“Babies are to be nut-crackered dead, for people's poor grandpapa's positions!” Then he let himself down again, and became silent.
1	And your sister, Amy, and your brother.
1	Between Mr. Pocket and Herbert I got on fast; and, with one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start I wanted, and clear obstructions out of my road, I must have been as great a dolt as Drummle if I had done less.
1	What boastful father in the fulness of his heart ever related such wonders of his infant prodigy, as Kit never wearied of telling Barbara in the evening time, concerning little Jacob?
1	Lor, why not Rumty?’ To inflict a heavy disappointment on this sweet nature, which had been, through all her caprices, the object of her recognition, love, and admiration from infancy, Bella felt to be the hardest task of her hard day.
1	We were shown into an immense apartment, lighted by two dim candles, called the drawing-room: from which there was a descent by a flight of steps, to another vast desert, called the dining-room: our bed-chambers were among certain long rows of little white-washed cells, which opened from either side of a dreary passage; and were so like rooms in a prison that I half expected to be locked up when I went to bed, and listened involuntarily for the turning of the key on the outside.
1	Mr. Jarndyce, this is a wine that was imported by the captain, we will not say how many years ago.
1	Upon its coming in, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, "I know him; Marley's Ghost!"
1	‘Ashamed of themselves!’ said Mrs. Raddle.
1	Now, it fell out that Mr. Crisparkle, going away from this conference still very uneasy in his mind, and very much troubled on behalf of the young man whom he held as a kind of prisoner in his own house, took a memorable night walk.
1	The auspicious event is always commemorated according to certain forms settled and prescribed by Mr. Bagnet some years since.
1	She was very pretty: exceedingly pretty.
1	‘Come here, Florence,’ said her father, coldly.
1	But no dog appeared, and at length he resumed his journey.
1	At this point Joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost pains to open his mouth very wide, and to put it into the form of a word that looked to me like “sulks.” Therefore, I naturally pointed to Mrs. Joe, and put my mouth into the form of saying, “her?” But Joe wouldn't hear of that, at all, and again opened his mouth very wide, and shook the form of a most emphatic word out of it.
1	Within three hours the oakum-headed apparition once more dived into the Leaving Shop, and that night Rogue Riderhood’s recantation lay in the post office, addressed under cover to Lizzie Hexam at her right address.
1	‘Hallo!’ We looked back, and he was standing at the door of a little lodge, where he lived, with a pair of boots in his hand.
1	And now that you have honoured me with your confidence and spoken to me first, I say again, we have everything on our side.’ And Bradley thought again, ‘Except your sister, perhaps.’ A grey dusty withered evening in London city has not a hopeful aspect.
1	‘I had my thowts o’ coming to make inquiration for you, sir, tonight,’ he said, ‘but knowing as your aunt was living along wi’ you--fur I’ve been down yonder--Yarmouth way--I was afeerd it was too late.
1	‘Oh, the man--the man--behind the door!’ screamed Miss Smithers.
1	Edwin tells the tempter that he wears no jewellery but his watch and chain, which were his father’s; and his shirt-pin.
1	‘Carker plays at all games, I believe,’ said Mr Dombey, laying himself on a sofa like a man of wood, without a hinge or a joint in him; ‘and plays them well.’ In sooth, he played the two in question, to such perfection, that the Major was astonished, and asked him, at random, if he played chess.
1	‘Don’t you think me a queer little comicality?’ In shaking her head at him after asking the question, she shook her hair down.
1	The boat went on, under the arching trees, and over their tranquil shadows in the water.
1	Mr. Ralph Nickleby sat in his private office one morning, ready dressed to walk abroad.
1	To reason with her upon this hideous union, to point out to her all the horrors to which she is hastening; rashly, it may be, and without due reflection.
1	She was very much attached to me--very much--highly connected, too.
1	He was then the most impetuous boy in the world, and he is now the most impetuous man.
1	Not to mention all the people alive who have made inventions that won’t act, and all the jobbers who job in all the jobberies jobbed; though these may be regarded as the Alligators of the Dismal Swamp, and are always lying by to drag the Golden Dustman under.
1	‘Whew!’ whistled Fledgeby, as he took it in his hand.
1	Mr. Jaggers had looked on at this, as one who recognized in Joe the village idiot, and in me his keeper.
1	Almost as good a one as you thought me for you.
1	Unable to exclude these things from his remembrance, or to keep his mind free from such imperfect shapes of the meaning with which they were fraught, as were able to make themselves visible to him through the mist of his pride, his previous feeling of indifference towards little Florence changed into an uneasiness of an extraordinary kind.
1	‘Quite forgot--no directions to postillion--give ‘em at once--back in a minute.’ ‘The servant, or Mr. Hunter will do it in a moment, Mr. Fitz-Marshall,’ said Mrs. Leo Hunter.
1	What can I do?’ cried Harriet.
1	'What have you got, Dodger?'
1	You know he is always good-humoured and tractable.
1	I was to think of it, and could speak to her by the church.
1	‘Do you remember that I tried to tell you, when I came home, what a debt of gratitude I owed you, dearest Agnes, and how fervently I felt towards you?’ ‘I remember it,’ she said, gently, ‘very well.’ ‘You have a secret,’ said I.
1	‘She is quite exhausted,’ said the schoolmaster, glancing upward into his face.
1	I don’t know what I thought, or what I dreaded.
1	His business is the Law?” I nodded harder.
1	Stand upon your head agin, and I’ll cut one of your feet off.’ The boy made no answer, but directly Quilp had shut himself in, stood on his head before the door, then walked on his hands to the back and stood on his head there, and then to the opposite side and repeated the performance.
1	Sir Leicester, in the library, has fallen asleep for the good of the country over the report of a Parliamentary committee.
1	He had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my weakness that I wanted to know something about his strength.
1	Although I looked about me confusedly and hurriedly as we crossed the street, I thought I knew the place.
1	The bumpers filled, Mr Blandois, with a roystering gaiety, clinked the top of his glass against the bottom of Mr Flintwinch’s, and the bottom of his glass against the top of Mr Flintwinch’s, and drank to the intimate acquaintance he foresaw.
1	exclaimed the old man in a tone of thoughtful amazement and with a wider stare than before.
1	‘Stupid!’ said Mrs. Squeers angrily.
1	Venerable parent dies.’ Same Buffer, emboldened by success, says: ‘When?’ ‘The other day.
1	And it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe.
1	The dread of being hunted in a strange remote place, where the laws might not protect him--the novelty of the feeling that it was strange and remote, originating in his being left alone so suddenly amid the ruins of his plans--his greater dread of seeking refuge now, in Italy or in Sicily, where men might be hired to assassinate him, he thought, at any dark street corner--the waywardness of guilt and fear--perhaps some sympathy of action with the turning back of all his schemes--impelled him to turn back too, and go to England.
1	That’s all I know.’ ‘Good-night, Miss!’ said Lizzie Hexam, sorrowfully.
1	Here is the door as you see.
1	Krook almost smacks his lips with the unction of a horrible interest.
1	If I had never come into the property, I shouldn’t have minded.
1	I forget how my uncle used to call it."
1	Mr. Winkle was then examined by Mr. Skimpin, who, being a promising young man of two or three-and-forty, was of course anxious to confuse a witness who was notoriously predisposed in favour of the other side, as much as he could.
1	Therefore I was driven at last to asking Richard if he would mind convincing me that it really was all over there, as he had said, and that it was not his mere impression.
1	With that they parted; Mr Swiveller to make the best of his way home and sleep himself sober; and Quilp to cogitate upon the discovery he had made, and exult in the prospect of the rich field of enjoyment and reprisal it opened to him.
1	he cried in a shrill tone.
1	Never were such jolly, roystering, rollicking, merry-making blades, as the jovial crew of Grogzwig.
1	After the morning’s rehearsal they went to work again, nor did they stop, except for a hasty dinner, until it was time to repair to the theatre at night.
1	‘I began, by means of his assistance, to copy law writings.
1	‘“Wouldn’t she?” said the old gentleman firmly.
1	His face, his voice, his manner, all showed that too plainly.
1	'To the kind gentleman, and the dear old nurse, who took so much care of me before,' rejoined Oliver.
1	I have seen you, and you have seen him, and I must make that do.’  Saying this, she looked at Stephen as if to fix his features in her mind, and her eye was not so bright as it had been.
1	She became utterly and completely miserable.
1	I wish you good-day, Master Copperfield, and leave my umble respects for Miss Betsey Trotwood.’ With those words, he retired, kissing his great hand, and leering at us like a mask.
1	I shall be within the mark any way.
1	When I sought them out (as I did; there was no tampering with me), I told them I wanted help to find you out, to trace you down, to go through with what I had begun, to help the right; and that when I had done it, I’d burst into your room and tell you all, face to face, man to man, and like a man.
1	cried Sikes, struggling to disengage himself from the girl's grasp.
1	‘I am very glad to know they do!’ ‘Aye,’ returned the old man, ‘but stay.
1	Between ourselves.” “Is there?” asked madame, vacantly.
1	cried the lady, 'I have been so dreadfully put out!'
1	The fire was in a rusty brazier, not fitted to the hearth; and a common lamp, shaped like a hyacinth-root, smoked and flared in the neck of a stone bottle on the table.
1	‘Timberry won’t be long,’ said Mr. Crummles.
1	Come, Captain, let me know what my crime is, will you?’ The stricken Grinder wept, and put his coat-cuff in his eye.
1	‘Here’s a state of things!’ cried Mr Swiveller, raising his eyes to the ceiling.
1	Early in the evening he embraced her, and her scarcely less dear namesake, pretending that he would return by-and-bye (an imaginary engagement took him out, and he had secreted a valise of clothes ready), and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy streets, with a heavier heart.
1	This was enough to irritate a gentleman with Mr. Pickwick’s sense of propriety, but it was not the whole extent of the aggravation, for a stage-coach full, inside and out, was meeting them at the moment, and the astonishment of the passengers was very palpably evinced.
1	But the agony of mind, the remorse, and shame I felt when I became conscious next day!
1	If you was to take to something, sir,’ said Mrs. Crupp, ‘if you was to take to skittles, now, which is healthy, you might find it divert your mind, and do you good.’ With these words, Mrs. Crupp, affecting to be very careful of the brandy--which was all gone--thanked me with a majestic curtsey, and retired.
1	You have got good measure, Miss What-is-it.’ ‘Try Jenny,’ suggested that young lady with great calmness.
1	His constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities.
1	I knew that she could not live long; but the thought that before her death she might give birth to some ill-fated being, destined to hand down madness to its offspring, determined me.
1	The little people could do nothing without dear Newman Noggs.
1	‘Well, it an’t a very rowdy life, and _that’s_ a fact!’ Again he clinks his metal castanet, and leads us leisurely away.
1	The young lady uttered a cry of surprise, and for a few moments they were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe.
1	Go along with you!’ ‘If you find people in my service who are not to be controlled, Mrs Pipchin,’ said Mr Dombey, turning back towards the fire, ‘you know what to do with them, I presume.
1	'I haven't so much as would--' 'I don't know how much you've got, and I dare say you hardly know yourself, as it would take a pretty long time to count it,' said Sikes; 'but I must have some to-night; and that's flat.'
1	‘Quite right to remind me, Mr. Noggs.
1	It looks very like rappee, sir.’ Here, a sharp peal at the bell reduced the powdered-headed footman to the ignominious necessity of putting the fox’s head in his pocket, and hastening with a humble countenance to Mr. Bantam’s ‘study.’ By the bye, who ever knew a man who never read or wrote either, who hadn’t got some small back parlour which he _would _call a study!
1	‘Here you are again,’ repeated Mr Wegg, musing.
1	I want my bond, you see.
1	It was not so easily got ready as some people may imagine.
1	‘But it will be light at five,’ said Mr Inspector, ‘and then WE shall be seen.’ ‘Look here,’ said Riderhood, ‘what do you say to this?
1	Will you give me the opportunity of saying a few words to you when you come up stairs?’ ‘Assuredly.
1	Can I speak to you?’ Mr Boffin proposed that Mrs Lammle should drive on to his house, a few hundred yards further.
1	Let him put away his whim now, and he is welcome back.
1	And then I thought of Estella, and of our parting, and went home very sadly.
1	Let me wet your lips again.
1	"There never was," said my guardian, musing as he smiled upon me, "such a Dame Durden for making money last."
1	"I am afraid you are tired.
1	Since it must be seen, I will have it seen by the light I stood in.
1	By and by, there were peasants going to their daily labour, or to market, or lounging at the doors of poor cottages, gazing idly at him as he passed.
1	‘Why,’ said Mr. Roker, ‘it’s as plain as Salisbury.
1	And yet his wife trembled, and a vague but heavy fear was upon her.
1	I thought it a little too much that he should complain of being cut short in his flower after all, as if he had not been running to seed, leaf after leaf, ever since his course began.
1	He has a clog of     iron on his right foot which will weigh four or five pounds.’     ‘Detained at the police jail, the negro wench, Myra.
1	‘I never bet half a dozen!’ said the other gentleman.
1	It would be hard, indeed, to part you now.
1	She had been rung down into the glass room as usual, and had walked about and about it a long time, with the baby in her arms, when, to her great surprise and dismay, Mr Dombey--whom she had seen at first leaning on his elbow at the table, and afterwards walking up and down the middle room, drawing, each time, a little nearer, she thought, to the open folding doors--came out, suddenly, and stopped before her.
1	Don’t judge him, sir, as you would judge others outside the gates.
1	He saw that she was desperate, and that her unquenchable hatred of him would stop at nothing.
1	Another moment, and the close darkness of the shut-up house (forgotten to be opened, though it was long since day) yielded to the unexpected glare and freedom of the morning; and Florence, with her head bent down to hide her agony of tears, was in the streets.
1	I am glad to hear you do.
1	Florence and he were very different now, he said, and very happy.
1	All that I know about Miss Havisham, you know.” “And all that I know,” I retorted, “you know.” “I fully believe it.
1	“Three Rums!” cried the stranger, calling to the landlord.
1	‘Said the Dog was the perfect picture of the old aunt from whom he had expectations.
1	I suppose it was true.
1	And you, sweet Kit, honest Kit, virtuous, innocent Kit, look to yourself.
1	By perpetuating the consequences of his ignorant and blind obstinacy.
1	Mother and I know, solely from being practical, that there are times when that girl’s whole nature seems to roughen itself against seeing us so bound up in Pet.
1	There has been no new discovery, of money, or of any other property; but--” He felt his wrist held closer, and he stopped.
1	This was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he could see, but it produced an immediate effect.
1	In an instant she was gone, and he had shut the door.
1	‘I wish I could hope that it would do your father good,’ said Mrs. Weller.
1	They took the path indicated by the sexton, and soon arrived before the parsonage wall.
1	Very near the bottom now.
1	Harmon’s is all you’ve got to say to HIM.
1	"See how the soot's falling.
1	I am sure, at least, I couldn’t feel like one.’ ‘Ay, but that is not enough, and is not what I mean.
1	His son, a boy, hearing a     report, ran into the room, and found the Governor sitting in his     chair, with his jaw fallen down, and his head leaning back; on     discovering the injury done to his father, he gave the alarm.
1	Here is the boat.’ The boat was filled with the cocked hats to which Mr Meagles entertained a national objection; and the wearers of those cocked hats landed and came up the steps, and all the impounded travellers congregated together.
1	I have had no counsellor, no adviser, no one to protect me.
1	A hospital for imbeciles!’ He smoked his cigarette out, with his ugly smile so fixed upon his face that he looked as though he were smoking with his drooping beak of a nose, rather than with his mouth; like a fancy in a weird picture.
1	I have not spent any of it.
1	‘To think that I could be offended!’ ‘No, no, I didn’t really think so,’ returned Dora; ‘but I am a little tired, and it made me silly for a moment--I am always a silly little thing, you know, but it made me more silly--to talk about Jip.
1	‘Only father has brought old Bounderby home, and I want you to come into the drawing-room.
1	Whatever happens, that must always be a comfort to me!’ Mrs Chick made this impressive observation in the drawing-room, after having descended thither from the inspection of the mantua-makers upstairs, who were busy on the family mourning.
1	But he is not to be spoken of if you please.
1	I know it was that night.’ ‘Well, if you know it was that night, you know, Misses Brown,’ replied Rob, ‘it’s no use putting pinchers into a cove to make him say so.
1	When I awoke next morning, I was resolute to declare my passion to Dora, and know my fate.
1	Drawers, desks, pockets, all things belonging to him, Mr. Bucket examines.
1	It was at once opened by a woman, who dropped a curtsey of recognition, and Heyling, whispering the officer to remain below, crept gently upstairs, and, opening the door of the front room, entered at once.
1	I have sat alone and unnoticed, half an evening, while he conversed with his young cousin, my pupil.
1	Next evening, down come Sir Leicester and my Lady with their largest retinue, and down come the cousins and others from all the points of the compass.
1	He had scarcely turned his head about again, and it was still bent down, listening to the girl, when the stoppage ceased, and the obstructed stream of people flowed on.
1	I leave them to you, at your desire.
1	I knew its tender nature very well.
1	A man of your mark!’ ‘It’s not so much saying it that I object to,’ returned Mr Venus, ‘as doing it.
1	Our friend Mr. Skimpole--don't be alarmed!--is arrested for debt."
1	Between him and me, secret articles were signed of which Herbert was the subject, and I paid him half of my five hundred pounds down, and engaged for sundry other payments: some, to fall due at certain dates out of my income: some, contingent on my coming into my property.
1	I am dismissed!’ She looked as little shocked and as hopeful as she could, but it was distressing news, for many reasons.
1	A less stanch spirit might have been subdued by such adverse influences; but the loan for her little outfit was in no part repaid, and it had gone worse with her than she had foreseen, and she was put upon proving her case and maintaining her independence.
1	Not only would the echoes die away, as though the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close at hand.
1	Well, well, well!’ He went up to the door, which had a projecting canopy in carved work of festooned jack-towels and children’s heads with water on the brain, designed after a once-popular monumental pattern, and knocked.
1	Confess instantly!’ ‘John,’ said Mr Boffin, one broad piece of sunshine from head to foot, ‘I wish you’d help me out of this.’ ‘You can’t be heard by counsel, sir,’ returned Bella.
1	At all events, I will not answer any more; I have that in my power.’ She is so conscious of his looking at her with a gloating admiration of the touch of anger on her, and the fire and animation it brings with it, that even as her spirit rises, it falls again, and she struggles with a sense of shame, affront, and fear, much as she did that night at the piano.
1	So saying, he unlocks his door, gropes his way into his murky rooms, lights his candles, and looks about him.
1	Even then he staggered round and round, weakly staring about him, until Mr Venus with a hard brush brushed his senses into him and the dust out of him.
1	“Is he dead?” I asked, after a silence.
1	It was a public holiday, and Fledgeby did not recover his spirits or his usual temperature of nose until the afternoon.
1	Nor were there wanting objects in the crowd itself to give new point and purpose to the shifting scene.
1	None of them have come down in the world as we have.
1	I said it (people often do so, in such cases) like a rather reluctant concession to truth and justice;--as if I wanted to deny it!
1	I'll tell you something more, wolf.
1	So in her bosom even now; the strongest qualities she possessed, long turned upon themselves, became a heap of obduracy, that rose against a friend.
1	What a famous clock, hereafter, if it said to-night of all the nights that it has counted off, to this old man of all the young and old men who have ever stood before it, "Don't go home!"
1	Never, never, before Heaven, have I thought of you but as the single, bright, pure, blessed recollection of my boyhood and my youth.
1	‘It’s quite impossible that they can mind it much.’ ‘Ah, that’s just the wery thing, Sir,’ rejoined Sam, ‘they don’t mind it; it’s a reg’lar holiday to them--all porter and skittles.
1	Therefore Mrs Skewton asked no questions, and showed no curiosity.
1	"He is called among the neighbours the Lord Chancellor.
1	Some had desired to rest beneath the very ground they had trodden in their daily walks; some, where the setting sun might shine upon their beds; some, where its light would fall upon them when it rose.
1	Do you deserve your blessings?
1	‘Wery likely,’ replied Sam briefly.
1	Copperfield,’ said my mother, answering with some difficulty, ‘was so considerate and good as to secure the reversion of a part of it to me.’ ‘How much?’ asked Miss Betsey.
1	Now, you may go.’ Newman readily availed himself of the permission, and, shutting himself up in his little office, remained there, in very serious cogitation, all day.
1	‘You are to be in all things regulated and governed,’ said the gentleman, ‘by fact.
1	‘Is my employer, or master, or whatever the proper name may be,’ replied Nicholas quickly; ‘and I was an ass to take his coarseness ill.
1	Once in the street, moved by some secret impulse, he laughed, and held his sides, and laughed again, and tried to peer through the dusty area railings as if to catch another glimpse of the child, until he was quite tired out.
1	But water [‘specially when ‘tis salt) comes nat’ral to me; and friends is dear, and I am heer.
1	I may be wrong, but I have formed that opinion.’ Both Traddles and I applauded it highly.
1	Her face was hidden from his view, but Ralph could see that she was weeping.
1	Volumnia gives Mr. Bucket to understand, in reply, that her sensitive mind is fully made up never to get the better of it as long as she lives, that her nerves are unstrung for ever, and that she has not the least expectation of ever smiling again.
1	‘Stop a minit,’ said Sam, ‘you’re all vite behind.’ ‘That’s right, Sammy, rub it off,’ said Mr. Weller, as his son dusted him.
1	I was articled to Spenlow and Jorkins.
1	"Do it yourself," returned the friend rather tartly.
1	And when Eugene had observed its position with reference to the other boats, and had made sure that he could not miss it, he turned his eyes upon the building where, as he had been told, the lonely girl with the dark hair sat by the fire.
1	Wish you good-night, Mrs. Bardell.
1	‘Oh, wouldn’t he, Mrs Richards!’ retorted Nipper, ‘he’d like it very much, I think when he was asked.’ ‘You wouldn’t ask him, I suppose, at all?’ said Polly.
1	There were occasions when in looking at him she was involuntarily moved to shake her head, as who would say, ‘Alas, poor Yorick!’  After allowing herself to be betrayed into these evidences of emotion, she would force a lambent brightness, and would be fitfully cheerful, and would say, ‘You have still good spirits, sir, I am thankful to find;’ and would appear to hail it as a blessed dispensation that Mr. Bounderby bore up as he did.
1	My stall and I are for ever parted.
1	“Is my benefactor to be made known to me to-day?” “No.
1	You will like to make some change, perhaps?
1	bless you, sir,’ said Mrs Chivery, with a sort of triumphant shiver, ‘she never could have seen him on a Sunday without knowing he was that.
1	There ain’t so much in that, you’ll say.
1	Little Em’ly had stopped and looked up at the sky in her enumeration of these articles, as if they were a glorious vision.
1	A somewhat difficult feat, achieved with great dexterity, and with a prodigious splash.
1	You know her.’ ‘I remember,’ said his companion carelessly.
1	But, for example, the sprightly little woman was very sure of it, she said.
1	my dear!’ said Ralph; ‘we were at that moment talking about you.’ ‘Indeed!’ replied Kate, shrinking, though she scarce knew why, from her uncle’s cold glistening eye.
1	"Little woman," said he, "You have been crying."
1	Behave yourself to visitors, my lady!
1	I was not sure you had a workman of your own here, my dear friend, or we needn't have employed this person."
1	But I bethought myself that I was in a boat, after all; and that a man like Mr. Peggotty was not a bad person to have on board if anything did happen.
1	The trooper then takes from his breast-pocket a folded paper, which he lays with an unwilling hand at the lawyer's elbow.
1	This has been a bad business, and may be worse, if we delay a moment.
1	It has more galleries, colonnades, piazzas, and passages than I can remember, or the reader would believe.
1	"And something else supports me, Esther."
1	All the possessions and revenues of the settlement are thrown into a common stock, which is managed by the elders.
1	But you’ll never go on with it,’ said number four.
1	Setting aside the streets, the shops, the houses, waggons, factories, public buildings, and population, perhaps it may be.
1	It was the first of their proceedings which had no heartiness.
1	‘There he sits, Mr. Bray,’ said Ralph, as the invalid, not yet recovered from his surprise, reclined in his chair, looking alternately at him and Arthur Gride.
1	At the stairs where we had taken him abroad, and ever since, I had looked warily for any token of our being suspected.
1	His knowledge is not at fault in the present instance.
1	I’m generally to be found here, gentlemen, but if I’m not here, or over the way, that’s my address.
1	‘Not at all,’ said Pancks.
1	We can do so, undismayed.
1	He winked--winked openly and undisguisedly; winked with his right eye--upon Henrietta Lillyvick!
1	Her first proceeding there was to unlock a tall press, bring out several bottles, and pour some of the contents of each into my mouth.
1	What else have I been doing all to-night.’ ‘Attend, I tell you,’ (in a raised voice) ‘to what I am going to say.
1	'What if he turns against the others?'
1	The sickly rays of the suspended lantern falling directly upon them, aggravated the paleness and anxiety of their countenances: which, encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness, looked ghastly in the extreme.
1	And then I know what would happen.
1	In short, the banquet was such a failure that I should have been quite unhappy--about the failure, I mean, for I was always unhappy about Dora--if I had not been relieved by the great good humour of my company, and by a bright suggestion from Mr. Micawber.
1	'I wonder whether THEY can hear it,' said Nancy.
1	At an early hour they all meet together for these festive purposes; at eight o’clock refreshments are served; and at nine they separate.
1	Shall I tell you about the second time I saw her?
1	We shall soon improve our youthful humours.’ God help me, I might have been improved for my whole life, I might have been made another creature perhaps, for life, by a kind word at that season.
1	I see her face now, better than I did then, I dare say, with its indelible look of regret and wonder turned upon me.
1	In a small room in the vicinity of the stableyard, betimes in the morning, which was ushered in by Mr. Pickwick’s adventure with the middle--aged lady in the yellow curl-papers, sat Mr. Weller, senior, preparing himself for his journey to London.
1	He looked up from his breakfast as Mr. Pickwick entered, with a fierce and peremptory air, which was very dignified; and, having scrutinised that gentleman and his companions to his entire satisfaction, hummed a tune, in a manner which seemed to say that he rather suspected somebody wanted to take advantage of him, but it wouldn’t do.
1	‘I believe that he loves me, fully as much as I love him.’ ‘Oh, what happiness!’ exclaimed Miss Podsnap.
1	With no consciousness of having moved, she gained the door.
1	The friendship between himself and me increased continually, and it was maintained on this odd footing: that, while Mr. Dick came professedly to look after me as my guardian, he always consulted me in any little matter of doubt that arose, and invariably guided himself by my advice; not only having a high respect for my native sagacity, but considering that I inherited a good deal from my aunt.
1	It had taken a deal of extra wet-towelling to pull him through the night; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded the towelling; and he was in a very damaged condition, as he now pulled his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at intervals for the last six hours.
1	Mr Wrayburn, I have had a bitter trial to-night, and I hope you will not think me ungrateful, or mysterious, or changeable.
1	After which, we went shivering, at that uncomfortable hour, to our respective beds, through various close passages; which smelt as if they had been steeped, for ages, in a solution of soup and stables.
1	The relations between them did not look wilful, or capricious, or a failure, in such a light; they became elevated into something more self-denying, honourable, affectionate, and true.
1	He was a grotesque, fantastic figure, and the few bystanders laughed.
1	As to our lodging, it's not by any means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn, and my father hasn't anything to give me, and I shouldn't be willing to take it, if he had.
1	Jump up to your seat directly.’ ‘I am wery much afeered,’ muttered Sam to himself, as he turned away, ‘that somethin’ queer’s come over the governor, or he’d never ha’ stood this so quiet.
1	He saw the devoted little creature with her worn shoes, in her common dress, in her jail-home; a slender child in body, a strong heroine in soul; and the light of her domestic story made all else dark to him.
1	He said not a word, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the depths of her reticule through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine.
1	We must have that bottle.’ ‘Why, you wouldn’t take it by force?’ said Venus, restraining him.
1	He rubbed it into my mouth and up my nose and down my throat--Ow!
1	There were the hedgerows where the brother and sister had so often gathered wild flowers together, and the green fields and shady paths where they had so often strayed.
1	Keep your eye upon my Uncle, will you, Mr Brogley, and make him as comfortable as you can while I am gone?
1	I wish to make you happy.
1	They came out with me directly to look at the boy.
1	He felt forced, sometimes, to try to stop it--to stem it with his childish hands--or choke its way with sand--and when he saw it coming on, resistless, he cried out!
1	Why disguise the phrase?’ ‘Ma,’ said Bella, with one beat of her foot, ‘you are enough to drive a saint mad, and so is Lavvy.’ ‘Unfortunate Lavvy!’ cried Mrs Wilfer, in a tone of commiseration.
1	It was the sole resource; for he told me that the case must be over in five minutes when the witness was there, and that no power on earth could prevent its going against us.
1	Most of the theatres keep an author on purpose.’ ‘Indeed!’ cried Nicholas.
1	‘There, my dear!’ said Mr Boffin when they came in to supper.
1	Fingers and toes.’ ‘He pays well, I hope?’ said Steerforth.
1	There is no one here to see.
1	‘Sir.’ ‘We’ll avoid these precious morsels of morality if you please, and talk of business.’ ‘With all my heart, sir,’ rejoined Squeers, ‘and first let me say--’ ‘First let ME say, if you please.--Noggs!’ Newman presented himself when the summons had been twice or thrice repeated, and asked if his master called.
1	‘You would like to be a lady?’ I said.
1	The Captain made a gulp as if to get down something that was sticking in his throat, and nervously proceeded: ‘That there unfort’nate ship met with such foul weather, out at sea, as don’t blow once in twenty year, my darling.
1	"Small left us at a week's notice.
1	It’s a dreadful thing to gape, but I must do something.
1	From the accumulated sadness into which I fell, I had at length no hope of ever issuing again.
1	‘Flintwinch,’ returned Mrs Clennam, in her usual strong low voice, ‘there is a demon of anger in you.
1	‘I have surely slept very long,’ returned Florence.
1	Interlopers Now do those two gentlemen not very neat about the cuffs and buttons who attended the last coroner's inquest at the Sol's Arms reappear in the precincts with surprising swiftness (being, in fact, breathlessly fetched by the active and intelligent beadle), and institute perquisitions through the court, and dive into the Sol's parlour, and write with ravenous little pens on tissue-paper.
1	It is a way he has sometimes.
1	She then walked me on very fast.
1	The spinster aunt trembled, till some pebbles which had accidentally found their way into the large watering-pot shook like an infant’s rattle.
1	A Mr. and Mrs. Gulpidge were of the party, who had something to do at second-hand (at least, Mr. Gulpidge had) with the law business of the Bank; and what with the Bank, and what with the Treasury, we were as exclusive as the Court Circular.
1	Our old selves would be fit for nothing here but to be robbed and imposed upon.
1	It was easy for me to find out, and I did soon find out, that Drummle had begun to follow her closely, and that she allowed him to do it.
1	You found him secret?’ returns Wegg, with a greedy relish.
1	I thought the simple confidence reposed in us by Mr. Peggotty and by himself, was, in itself, affecting.
1	‘You see those two old houses,’ he said at last.
1	Devoid of parents, devoid of relations, devoid of flocks and herds, devoid of gold and silver and of precious stones.
1	Anything.’ ‘I don’t like it,’ pettishly returned Venus as before.
1	But before he had said a dozen words, Mrs. Nickleby, with many sly winks and nods, observed, that she was sure Mr. Smike must be quite tired out, and that she positively must insist on his not sitting up a minute longer.
1	A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was no impeachment of his high breeding; it was not from within; it was occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control--the setting sun.
1	I shall go down into Suffolk afterwards.’ ‘Shooting, sir?’ said the coachman.
1	Depressed and slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or inflicting.
1	Among the number was one stout, red-faced, elderly man, in particular, seated in an opposite box, who attracted Mr. Pickwick’s attention.
1	Here was a collector of water-rates, without his book, without his pen and ink, without his double knock, without his intimidation, kissing--actually kissing--an agreeable female, and leaving taxes, summonses, notices that he had called, or announcements that he would never call again, for two quarters’ due, wholly out of the question.
1	As he walked up and down, affably accommodating his step to the shuffle of his brother, not proud in his superiority, but considerate of that poor creature, bearing with him, and breathing toleration of his infirmities in every little puff of smoke that issued from his lips and aspired to get over the spiked wall, he was a sight to wonder at.
1	But I remarked two things: first, that though Annie soon recovered her composure, and was quite herself, there was a blank between her and Mr. Wickfield which separated them wholly from each other; secondly, that Mr. Wickfield seemed to dislike the intimacy between her and Agnes, and to watch it with uneasiness.
1	But, so much more powerful were the frailties of Sloppy’s form than the strongest resources of tailoring science, that he now stood before the Council, a perfect Argus in the way of buttons: shining and winking and gleaming and twinkling out of a hundred of those eyes of bright metal, at the dazzled spectators.
1	Extensive was the artillery, heavy and light, which Mrs. Nickleby brought into play for the furtherance of these great schemes; various and opposite the means which she employed to bring about the end she had in view.
1	‘Plenty of everything.’ ‘Lor!’ chuckled Maggy, giving her knees a hug.
1	They brought some beer and spirits into the boat with them, and what with drinking freely before, and again now, were soon in a fair way of being quarrelsome and intoxicated.
1	Do you attach no value to their good opinion?
1	‘Well, Fanny,’ said the miller’s daughter, ‘you see I have come to see you, although we HAD some words last night.’ ‘I pity your bad passions, ‘Tilda,’ replied Miss Squeers, ‘but I bear no malice.
1	‘Won’t you stop to say something to Mrs. Crummles?’ asked the manager, following him down to the door.
1	Mr. Stryver then called his few witnesses, and Mr. Cruncher had next to attend while Mr. Attorney-General turned the whole suit of clothes Mr. Stryver had fitted on the jury, inside out; showing how Barsad and Cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them, and the prisoner a hundred times worse.
1	It was a trouble to him to think of this face of Florence.
1	Our place of destination in the first instance is Columbus.
1	I’ll tell her that you have come home.
1	'A porochial life is not a bed of roses, Mrs.
1	‘The old man and his grandchild who travelled with you--where are they?
1	‘Uncle much hove down, Wal’r?’ inquired the Captain, as they were walking along.
1	I could take care of his property when you are away--good care, you see.’ Heaving a long-drawn sigh, Mr. Stiggins paused for a response.
1	‘There’ll shortly be an end of YOU,’ said Wegg, threatening it with the hat-box.
1	‘HE was a long time,’ replied Newman.
1	He has been so careless and said so much that he never meant.
1	Mr Toots was so overjoyed by the success of his present, and was so delighted to see Florence bending down over Diogenes, smoothing his coarse back with her little delicate hand--Diogenes graciously allowing it from the first moment of their acquaintance--that he felt it difficult to take leave, and would, no doubt, have been a much longer time in making up his mind to do so, if he had not been assisted by Diogenes himself, who suddenly took it into his head to bay Mr Toots, and to make short runs at him with his mouth open.
1	I almost think he did.
1	There was an old smoky bust over the mantel-shelf, and a dusty clock above the dock--the only thing present, that seemed to go on as it ought; for depravity, or poverty, or an habitual acquaintance with both, had left a taint on all the animate matter, hardly less unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inanimate object that frowned upon it.
1	His altered character had never been so grossly marked.
1	--Heerd a noise,' continued Mr. Giles.
1	Intent on making one last effort to redeem her character, she breaks from Mr Toots and runs away to find the coach, and show a parting smile.
1	'Have I the lady's promise for that?'
1	‘The talent of the other three is principally in combat and serious pantomime.
1	In moments of confidence too?
1	‘I said mine, didn’t I?’ returned Mr. Crummles.
1	They reflect handsome faces, simpering faces, youthful faces, faces of threescore and ten that will not submit to be old; the entire collection of faces that have come to pass a January week or two at Chesney Wold, and which the fashionable intelligence, a mighty hunter before the Lord, hunts with a keen scent, from their breaking cover at the Court of St. James's to their being run down to death.
1	That you sent messages by, you know!
1	"Yes," I said; "and to be repaid by such gratitude as hers is to be made rich, guardian."
1	He appeared to be meditating some Patriarchal way out of his delicate position, when Mr Pancks, once more suddenly applying the trigger to his hat, shot it off again with his former dexterity.
1	Dick nodded assent, and drained his glass.
1	The predilections of the inexhaustible baby being provided for, Bella could think of nothing else.
1	I myself always clearly foresaw the consequences, and am not surprised.
1	Is there summ’at deadly sticking to my clothes?
1	I should have been surprised if those two could have thought very highly of one another, Mr. Boythorn attaching so much importance to many things and Mr. Skimpole caring so little for anything.
1	He was far from rich, and every day of indecision and inaction made his inheritance a source of greater anxiety to him.
1	‘I recollect meeting a gentleman at Canterbury,’ said Miss Snevellicci, ‘only for a few moments, for I was leaving the company as he joined it, so like you that I felt almost certain it was the same.’ ‘I see you now for the first time,’ rejoined Nicholas with all due gallantry.
1	He had been spurred and whipped and heavily sweated.
1	He’s very deaf indeed,’ cried the sexton petulantly; ‘are you sure you’re right about the figures?’ ‘Oh quite,’ replied the old man.
1	This important point being despatched, Mr. Pell refreshed himself with three chops, and liquids both malt and spirituous, at the expense of the estate; and then they all went away to Doctors’ Commons.
1	Mr. Pickwick returned the glare, concentrated into a focus by means of his spectacles, and breathed a bold defiance.
1	The place consisted of a few poor cottages, and two or three public-houses; the state of whose larders certainly seemed to justify the second designation of the village, for there was nothing to eat in any of them.
1	I had heard them, alone at the bedside, striking their boots with their riding-whips, and loitering up and down.
1	How dare you venture so to affront me, when you know--I do not know better, Sir: I have seen it in your every glance, and heard it in your every word--that in place of affection between us there is aversion and contempt, and that I despise him hardly less than I despise myself for being his!
1	Why, I don’t believe now,’ added Tim, taking off his spectacles, and smiling as with gentle pride, ‘that there’s such a place in all the world for coincidences as London is!’ ‘I don’t know about that,’ said Mr. Frank; ‘but--’ ‘Don’t know about it, Mr. Francis!’ interrupted Tim, with an obstinate air.
1	Would she have him fire off real guns, and have his hair cut, and his whiskers shaved, and his eyes turned right and left, and his trousers pipeclayed?’ ‘Dear Nicholas,’ whispered Kate, ‘you don’t know who that is.
1	‘Mama is blameless,’ she went on, ‘of having ever urged you for herself, and she is blameless in intention every way, I am sure,--but when I saw how many importunate claims were pressed upon you in my name; how you were traded on in my name; how generous you were, and how Mr. Wickfield, who had your welfare very much at heart, resented it; the first sense of my exposure to the mean suspicion that my tenderness was bought--and sold to you, of all men on earth--fell upon me like unmerited disgrace, in which I forced you to participate.
1	I made, and have kept, that plot of ground entirely with my own hands.
1	'Dodger, take off the sausages; and draw a tub near the fire for Oliver.
1	I understand he drives a hackney-coach, though how he does it, unless he stands on the footboard behind, and lies along the roof upon his chest, with his chin in the box, it would be difficult to comprehend.
1	Wherefore Mr. Micawber (who was a thoroughly good-natured man, and as active a creature about everything but his own affairs as ever existed, and never so happy as when he was busy about something that could never be of any profit to him) set to work at the petition, invented it, engrossed it on an immense sheet of paper, spread it out on a table, and appointed a time for all the club, and all within the walls if they chose, to come up to his room and sign it.
1	You only knew the town was there, because you knew there could have been no such sulky blotch upon the prospect without a town.
1	The rest of the half-year is a jumble in my recollection of the daily strife and struggle of our lives; of the waning summer and the changing season; of the frosty mornings when we were rung out of bed, and the cold, cold smell of the dark nights when we were rung into bed again; of the evening schoolroom dimly lighted and indifferently warmed, and the morning schoolroom which was nothing but a great shivering-machine; of the alternation of boiled beef with roast beef, and boiled mutton with roast mutton; of clods of bread-and-butter, dog’s-eared lesson-books, cracked slates, tear-blotted copy-books, canings, rulerings, hair-cuttings, rainy Sundays, suet-puddings, and a dirty atmosphere of ink, surrounding all.
1	Then would Mr Perch descant upon the hours of acute uneasiness he and Mrs Perch had suffered out at Balls Pond, when they first suspected ‘things was going wrong.’ Then would Mr Perch relate to gaping listeners, in a low voice, as if the corpse of the deceased House were lying unburied in the next room, how Mrs Perch had first come to surmise that things was going wrong by hearing him (Perch) moaning in his sleep, ‘twelve and ninepence in the pound, twelve and ninepence in the pound!’ Which act of somnambulism he supposed to have originated in the impression made upon him by the change in Mr Dombey’s face.
1	Bed, sir?” “I shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a barber.” “And then breakfast, sir?
1	I thought you’d allow me to pay my compliments to you.
1	As Mr. Bumble gazed sternly upon him, it rolled down his cheek.
1	It appeared to me that he must be a very happy man indeed, to have so many little drawers in his shop; and I wondered when I peeped into one or two on the lower tiers, and saw the tied-up brown paper packets inside, whether the flower-seeds and bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails, and bloom.
1	“No, no, no; you are too young, too blooming.
1	It was very solitary and very dull, and I did not doubt that I might safely steal upstairs.
1	Good-night, dear, good-night, good-night.’ His quick transition to a state of unbounded pleasure, as he stood at his window, kissing and clapping his hands: and the way in which the light retreated from his features as she passed out of his view, and left a patient melancholy on the little face: were too remarkable wholly to escape even Toots’s notice.
1	‘It was well that I should be pitied and forgiven by you, or anyone of your name, in the first hour of my return!
1	"Then," pursued Richard, "it's monotonous, and to-day is too like yesterday, and to-morrow is too like to-day."
1	You know I do, and I wonder you don’t colour up like fire.
1	Agnes sang with great sweetness and expression, and so did Mrs. Strong.
1	Upwards of an hour elapsed before my guardian put his head into the room where Ada and I were sitting and said, "Come in, my dears!"
1	“You cold, cold heart!” “What?” said Estella, preserving her attitude of indifference as she leaned against the great chimney-piece and only moving her eyes; “do you reproach me for being cold?
1	If my friend Dombey suffers from bodily weakness, and would allow me to recommend what has frequently done myself good, as a man who has been extremely queer at times, and who lived pretty freely in the days when men lived very freely, I should say, let it be in point of fact the yolk of an egg, beat up with sugar and nutmeg, in a glass of sherry, and taken in the morning with a slice of dry toast.
1	So rife and potent was the fever in Bleeding Heart Yard, that Mr Pancks’s rent-days caused no interval in the patients.
1	This was a good freshener to my presence of mind, as a beginning.
1	Was he here this morning?’ ‘No,’ bawled Newman, in a very loud key.
1	And yet a married woman, possessing your attractions, shuts her eyes (and sparklers too), and goes and runs her delicate-formed head against a wall.
1	The certificates were regularly signed as extracts from the parish books, the first letter had a genuine appearance of having been written and preserved for some years, the handwriting of the second tallied with it exactly, (making proper allowance for its having been written by a person in extremity,) and there were several other corroboratory scraps of entries and memoranda which it was equally difficult to question.
1	Apropos of producing, let somebody produce that at its address, and produce the answer here.’ ‘Cavalletto,’ said Arthur.
1	This is not the place for Glubbs of any kind.
1	From that time, whenever he thought of Doctor Blimber’s, it came back as he had seen it in this last view; and it never seemed to be a real place again, but always a dream, full of eyes.
1	Jasper walked on the other side of Neville, and never quitted that position.
1	Here is an inkstand, here are pens and paper, here are wafers.
1	He was there, he was there.
1	It might have cost me a client.
1	“'Pray excuse me,' said I.
1	It happened, that, as she was reading in the old spot by herself one day, this child came running in with his eyes full of tears, and after holding her from him, and looking at her eagerly for a moment, clasped his little arms passionately about her neck.
1	Anyhow, he named to me that the house had a board up, “This Eminently Aristocratic Mansion to be let or sold.”  Me and Mrs Boffin went to look at it, and finding it beyond a doubt Eminently Aristocratic (though a trifle high and dull, which after all may be part of the same thing) took it.
1	The large rooms are too cramped and close.
1	There must always be two parties to a quarrel, says the old adage.
1	And if it was dark and rather dull, we used to say, what did it matter to us, for it only made us remember our last walk with greater pleasure, and look forward to our next one.
1	I beg your pardon; will you allow me to look at that card again?’ ‘Oh!
1	I’ll hold you living, and I’ll hold you dead.
1	Mrs. Badger overheard him and smiled.
1	‘Fine pursuit, sir--fine pursuit.--Dogs, Sir?’ ‘Not just now,’ said Mr. Winkle.
1	There are two bridges across the river: one belongs to the railroad, and the other, which is a very crazy affair, is the private property of some old lady in the neighbourhood, who levies tolls upon the townspeople.
1	said the Jew, bending his head forward, with his eyes almost starting out of it.
1	'I doubt it, my dear young lady,' said the doctor, shaking his head.
1	My denying myself the pleasure of the present agreeable conversation may not be wholly irrespective of your own interests, Mr. C." Richard expressed himself quite sure of that and lighted Mr. Vholes out.
1	‘Stop and take me, if you please, Joe.
1	If he’s there, bring him in.
1	I never saw the mode.
1	But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim and your opportunity, to sustain you.
1	Then, Estella being gone and we two left alone, she turned to me, and said in a whisper,-- “Is she beautiful, graceful, well-grown?
1	Father and son, extremely like each other, looking silently on at the morning traffic in Fleet-street, with their two heads as near to one another as the two eyes of each were, bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys.
1	Here it is, you see, sir!
1	I owe it all to him, my love, my pride!
1	‘Eh, Daisy?’ ‘Yes, indeed,’ said I.
1	Her tears burst forth afresh at the sight; she was ashamed and afraid of it; but it moved her to no anger against him.
1	Plato, Zeno, Epicurus, Pythagoras--all founders of clubs.’ ‘I know that,’ said Mr. Pickwick; ‘but as I cannot put myself in competition with those great men, I cannot presume to wear their dresses.’ The grave man considered deeply, for a few seconds, and then said-- ‘On reflection, Sir, I don’t know whether it would not afford Mrs. Leo Hunter greater pleasure, if her guests saw a gentleman of your celebrity in his own costume, rather than in an assumed one.
1	All is now over, ma’am, and well over.’ During the five minutes or so that Mr. Chillip devoted to the delivery of this oration, my aunt eyed him narrowly.
1	‘There’s one thing about you, T’otherest Governor,’ said Riderhood, faring on again, ‘as looks well and goes fur.
1	‘Is anything the matter here?’ ‘A wedding Sir, a wedding!’ cried several voices.
1	‘There’s nothing like a good ‘un while you ARE about it.’ ‘I have been for a moment,’ said the Secretary, turning from him and falling into his former manner, ‘diverted from the little I have to say.
1	The having originated a precaution which was already in course of execution, was a great relief to Miss Pross.
1	He was about retracing his steps, when he was suddenly transfixed to the spot by a sudden appearance; and the mode and manner of this appearance, we now proceed to relate.
1	He might have been at bottom, but he certainly was not at top, seeing that his coat was of the roughest and most ill-favoured kind.
1	The Perkins Institution and Massachusetts Asylum for the Blind, at Boston, is superintended by a body of trustees who make an annual report to the corporation.
1	I went into a coffee-house to write a little note to Clara, telling her he had gone off, sending his love to her over and over again, and then went to my lonely home,--if it deserved the name; for it was now no home to me, and I had no home anywhere.
1	The stock-in-trade of this old gentleman comprised chronometers, barometers, telescopes, compasses, charts, maps, sextants, quadrants, and specimens of every kind of instrument used in the working of a ship’s course, or the keeping of a ship’s reckoning, or the prosecuting of a ship’s discoveries.
1	Her words and manner had touched Rose Maylie's heart; and, mingled with her love for her young charge, and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour, was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope.
1	Will you read to me a little more?’ Harriet was withdrawing her hand to open the book, when Alice detained it for a moment.
1	‘Arabella wrote, the day before yesterday, to say she had made a stolen match without her husband’s father’s consent, and so you had gone down to get it when his refusing it couldn’t prevent the match, and all the rest of it.
1	'Where he can, your worship,' replied the officer; again pretending to receive Oliver's answer.
1	Twemlow has asked him whether he went to school as a junior with Alfred?
1	Stay, stay,' added the Jew, unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand; 'there's money, my dears.
1	That part of Devonshire in which Nicholas had been himself bred was named as the most favourable spot; but this advice was cautiously coupled with the information, that whoever accompanied him thither must be prepared for the worst; for every token of rapid consumption had appeared, and he might never return alive.
1	Mr Henry Gowan and the dog were established frequenters of the cottage, and the day was fixed for the wedding.
1	Ask the first hundred citizens of Cloisterham, met at random in the streets at noon, if they believed in Ghosts, they would tell you no; but put them to choose at night between these eerie Precincts and the thoroughfare of shops, and you would find that ninety-nine declared for the longer round and the more frequented way.
1	‘Trust your old master not to be fooled by pretty faces, Peg; no, no, no--nor by ugly ones neither, Mrs Sliderskew,’ he softly added by way of soliloquy.
1	Damp rotten houses, many to let, many yet building, many half-built and mouldering away--lodgings, where it would be hard to tell which needed pity most, those who let or those who came to take--children, scantily fed and clothed, spread over every street, and sprawling in the dust--scolding mothers, stamping their slipshod feet with noisy threats upon the pavement--shabby fathers, hurrying with dispirited looks to the occupation which brought them ‘daily bread’ and little more--mangling-women, washer-women, cobblers, tailors, chandlers, driving their trades in parlours and kitchens and back room and garrets, and sometimes all of them under the same roof--brick-fields skirting gardens paled with staves of old casks, or timber pillaged from houses burnt down, and blackened and blistered by the flames--mounds of dock-weed, nettles, coarse grass and oyster-shells, heaped in rank confusion--small dissenting chapels to teach, with no lack of illustration, the miseries of Earth, and plenty of new churches, erected with a little superfluous wealth, to show the way to Heaven.
1	The hard uneven pavement is under us, the soft deep mud is on either side.
1	It may be years hence, or it may be only months, but I shall come to that at last.'
1	Wednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window.
1	A Discovery and a Chase 10.
1	‘Brother, I protest against pride.
1	It was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from among the group.
1	And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison?” “Simply, 'that he has received the letter, and will come.
1	And am I never to have change of air, because the bees don’t?
1	Really and truly pretty comfortable?
1	"You put that to her ladyship, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, from me, Inspector Bucket of the Detective.
1	A series of entertainments in celebration of the late nuptials, and in cultivation of society, were arranged, chiefly by Mr Dombey and Mrs Skewton; and it was settled that the festive proceedings should commence by Mrs Dombey’s being at home upon a certain evening, and by Mr and Mrs Dombey’s requesting the honour of the company of a great many incongruous people to dinner on the same day.
1	Waiting for some reply, I looked about me, noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken, and how the house--of wood with a tiled roof--would not be proof against the weather much longer, if it were so even now, and how the mud and ooze were coated with lime, and how the choking vapor of the kiln crept in a ghostly way towards me.
1	Sir Leicester is majestically wroth.
1	Much that I have seen, but not noted, has come back upon me with new meaning, during this last trying hour.
1	'My advice, or, leastways, I should say, my _orders_, is,' said the fattest man of the party, 'that we 'mediately go home again.'
1	The hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.
1	Why, since Kit has been away, the pony would take his food from nobody but her, and Barbara, you see, not dreaming that Christopher was there, and just looking in, to see that everything was right, has come upon him unawares.
1	Are you any fresher now, or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you thoroughly?'
1	He may be a very superior man, but he is, so to speak, merged--merged--in the more shining qualities of his wife."
1	He has bought two specimens of poultry, which, if there be any truth in adages, were certainly not caught with chaff, to be prepared for the spit; he has amazed and rejoiced the family by their unlooked-for production; he is himself directing the roasting of the poultry; and Mrs. Bagnet, with her wholesome brown fingers itching to prevent what she sees going wrong, sits in her gown of ceremony, an honoured guest.
1	Take your oath of that.’ And reference being made to Mr Perch, he confirms her view of the case.
1	Dead long ago.’ ‘Father or mother alive?’ ‘Dead.’-- ‘And the rest of your relations?’ ‘Dead--if I ever had any living.
1	What have I to do with it?
1	Mr. Chadband, leaning forward over the table, pierces what he has got to follow directly into Mr. Snagsby with the thumb-nail already mentioned.
1	But a great cry, which was audible even above the wind and water, rose from the shore at this moment; the sea, sweeping over the rolling wreck, made a clean breach, and carried men, spars, casks, planks, bulwarks, heaps of such toys, into the boiling surge.
1	Walks by night, does she?
1	I am very susceptible to such horrid things.
1	Be careful, sir, to what lengths your jealousy carries you another time; and be careful, also, before you venture too far, to ascertain your rival’s temper.’ With this parting advice Nicholas picked up Mr. Lenville’s ash stick which had flown out of his hand, and breaking it in half, threw him the pieces and withdrew, bowing slightly to the spectators as he walked out.
1	It was an infamous prosecution, grossly infamous; but not the less likely to succeed on that account.” “You have laid me under an obligation to you for life--in two senses,”  said his late client, taking his hand.
1	‘They’re no good, I suppose.’ ‘They’re no harm,’ said Short.
1	But it was enough for Caddy that SHE was used to it.
1	Free of my commission, I shall be able to compound with some small usurers who will hear of nothing but their bond now--Vholes says so.
1	The dwarf had twice encountered him when he was endeavouring to obtain intelligence of the fugitives.
1	I am glad that time has softened you so much, Miss Dartle.’ She condescended to make no reply, but, turning on me with another scornful laugh, said: ‘The friends of this excellent and much-injured young lady are friends of yours.
1	The assurance she had given her odious suitor was strictly true, though it would have been better (she considered now) if she could have restrained herself from so giving it.
1	My sister will miss you.
1	observes the penitent trooper, shaking his head.
1	You may be sure,” said Wemmick, touching me on the sleeve, “that he never dwelt upon the strength of her hands then, though he sometimes does now.” I had told Wemmick of his showing us her wrists, that day of the dinner party.
1	Mr Lightwood will be in directly.’ ‘I’m not in a hurry,’ said Mr Boffin ‘Thank you, sir.
1	Do not mind me, Trotwood,’ she returned.
1	'I heard the doctor tell them I was dying,' replied the child with a faint smile.
1	When he turned, he had his handkerchief in his hand, and he had been wiping his eyes with it, and he looked tired and ill. ‘Young John, I am very sorry to have been hasty with you, but--ha--some remembrances are not happy remembrances, and--hum--you shouldn’t have come.’ ‘I feel that now, sir,’ returned John Chivery; ‘but I didn’t before, and Heaven knows I meant no harm, sir.’ ‘No.
1	‘Here,’ continued the hardened traitor, tossing the licence at Mr. Pickwick’s feet; ‘get the name altered--take home the lady--do for Tuppy.’ Mr. Pickwick was a philosopher, but philosophers are only men in armour, after all.
1	Now, there is a Grecian urn erected in the centre of a lonely field; now there is a woman weeping at a tomb; now a very commonplace old gentleman in a white waistcoat, with a thumb thrust into each arm-hole of his coat; now a student poring on a book; now a crouching negro; now, a horse, a dog, a cannon, an armed man; a hunch-back throwing off his cloak and stepping forth into the light.
1	A girl can get on anywhere.
1	‘Will you allow me to ask you, sir,’ he said, addressing Mr. Pickwick, who was considerably mystified by this very unpolite by-play--‘will you allow me to ask you, Sir, whether that person belongs to your party?’ ‘No, Sir,’ replied Mr. Pickwick, ‘he is a guest of ours.’ ‘He is a member of your club, or I am mistaken?’ said the lieutenant inquiringly.
1	‘Why, sir, Friday or Saturday, nigh ’bout.’ ‘Friday or Saturday,’ said Tom.
1	I tried to convince her so, but I didn’t succeed.
1	All was so quick and hurried, that he had scarcely time to recollect where he was, or how he came there, when the carriage stopped at the house to which the Jew's steps had been directed on the previous evening.
1	Was she glad to know it?
1	He has been at it all day."
1	He wore thick shoes, and thick leather gaiters, and thick gloves like a hedger’s.
1	"My service to him, too!
1	‘Porkin and Snob,’ growled the bass.
1	Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in less attractive forms.
1	There was no other music than their own singing.
1	Never from the mighty sea may voices rise too late, to come between us and the unseen region on the other shore!
1	It was very little, but even hunger was forgotten in the strange tranquillity that crept over her senses.
1	No bringing up by hand then.
1	But I had lost twenty-four hours.
1	Mrs Skewton returned no answer in words, but smiled upon the Major with so much archness and vivacity, that that gallant officer considering himself challenged, would have imprinted a kiss on her exceedingly red lips, but for her interposing the fan with a very winning and juvenile dexterity.
1	He might have endeavoured to break her heart by a systematic course of insult and neglect; or, if the spirit of her sex, and a proud consciousness of her many wrongs had upheld her under this ill-treatment, he might have sought to take her life, and so get rid of her effectually.
1	Licker they’ll do yo hurt.’ Slackbridge laughed, folded his arms, and frowned sarcastically.
1	‘Should you?’ was the only reply of the bagman, who continued to smoke with great vehemence.
1	‘I am delighted to hear it.’ ‘But I say,’ resumed Lowten, scraping the back of the pen preparatory to making a fresh split, ‘what a soft chap that other is!’ ‘Which other?’ ‘Why, that servant, or friend, or whatever he is; you know, Trotter.’ ‘Ah!’ said Mr. Pickwick, with a smile.
1	It'll be better for him.
1	There is also a legend of a young gentleman, who, not having before his eyes the fear of the canons of the church for such cases made and provided, conceived a passion for his grandmother.
1	But as it is wholesome that the parsimonious public should know what has been doing, and still is doing, in this connexion, I mention here that everything set forth in these pages concerning the Court of Chancery is substantially true, and within the truth.
1	My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing.” “He is right there, Jacques,” murmured Defarge, to him who had interrupted.
1	I mak’ no complaints o’ bein turned to the wa’, o’ bein outcasten and overlooken fro this time forrard, but hope I shall be let to work.
1	Barsad proposed to the rest, “Let her embrace him then; it is but a moment.” It was silently acquiesced in, and they passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place, where he, by leaning over the dock, could fold her in his arms.
1	Because he is not free to show himself and to speak for himself, you would let such people insult him with impunity.
1	Whether it was a criminal act that I had committed?
1	I know wery well that when I’m here o’ nights (and where else should I live, bless your arts, whatever fortun’ I come into!)
1	Mr. Snagsby is behind his counter in his grey coat and sleeves, inspecting an indenture of several skins which has just come in from the engrosser's, an immense desert of law-hand and parchment, with here and there a resting-place of a few large letters to break the awful monotony and save the traveller from despair.
1	I was apprenticed when I was seven year old.’ ‘Oh!
1	But how could I, a poor dazed village lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of men fall every day?
1	‘My love, you will inform Cornelia, if you please.’ ‘Assuredly,’ said Mrs Blimber.
1	Mr Wegg, especially, was in a flaming glow, and stood in the little shop, panting and mopping his head with his pocket-handkerchief, speechless for several minutes.
1	All his pains were taken, to the end that he might incense himself with the sight of the detested figure in her company and favour, in her place of concealment.
1	Go out and ask who is never trifled with, and who is always treated with some delicacy.
1	I thought I often observed besides how right my guardian was in what he had said, and that the uncertainties and delays of the Chancery suit had imparted to his nature something of the careless spirit of a gamester who felt that he was part of a great gaming system.
1	Becoming more and more uncomfortable, as though the prevalent dislike were finding him out somewhere in his sleep and expressing itself to him, the patient at last opens his eyes wide, and is assisted by his daughter to sit up in bed.
1	While he was plunged in very profound and serious meditation upon this theme, Miss Sally sat shaking her head with an air of great mystery and doubt; when the voice of her brother Sampson, carolling a cheerful strain, was heard in the passage, and that gentleman himself, beaming with virtuous smiles, appeared.
1	It was but a few minutes after ten o’clock, when her carriage rolled along the street in which she lived.
1	Rick, it is better for her, much better; you owe it to her.
1	I told him I did, and it was because I did and meant to do so to the last, that I would not stoop to propitiate any of them.
1	He could have wished to have spared that company the painful and disgusting detail on which he was about to enter, but as the explanation had been demanded of him, he had no alternative but to state, boldly and distinctly, that he had been required to eat cold meat.
1	‘that’s wery self-denyin’ o’ you.’ ‘Wery,’ replied his parent, with a sigh.
1	His patron took that opportunity of turning the key in the door, and then sat down upon his bed.
1	Why, Lord love my heart alive, if it ain’t a treat to look at him!’ ‘He is very handsome, is he not?’ said I, my heart warming with this praise.
1	‘I wish the boat of my honourable and gallant friend,’ he murmured, lying down again and speaking into his hat, ‘may be endowed with philanthropy enough to turn bottom-upward and extinguish him!--Mortimer.’ ‘My honourable friend.’ ‘Three burglaries, two forgeries, and a midnight assassination.’ Yet in spite of having those weights on his conscience, Eugene was somewhat enlivened by the late slight change in the circumstances of affairs.
1	‘Nothing is going to be done.
1	Traversing the hollow by the Vale of Heath, he mounted the opposite bank, and crossing the road which joins the villages of Hampstead and Highgate, made along the remaining portion of the heath to the fields at North End, in one of which he laid himself down under a hedge, and slept.
1	There were a couple of young boys, too, nearly naked, lying idle by the well; and they, and he, and _the_ traveller at the inn, turned out to look at us.
1	The scanty parish dress, the livery of his misery, hung loosely on his feeble body; and his young limbs had wasted away, like those of an old man.
1	‘They have never understood you, Micawber,’ said his wife.
1	He’s too proud a chap to eat it!’ and, coming out of her chair, shook her venerable fist so very close to his nose as to tickle the surface.
1	Who told a stranger we could be seen?
1	Afterwards, I sometimes observed her rise, with her eyes full of tears, and go out of the room.
1	She looked very young indeed to be the mother of two children, and I could not help pitying both her and them.
1	When they went away together, in the waning moonlight, and I looked after them, comparing their departure in my mind with Martha’s, I saw that she held his arm with both her hands, and still kept close to him.
1	I released her arms, and called the woman to assist me to compose her figure and the dress she had torn.
1	The body was in _its_ place, and its eyes were as he saw them when he stole away.
1	‘You see,’ said Mr Toots, ‘what I wanted in a wife was--in short, was sense.
1	And, what is very strange, I found him--" "Not to be any out-of-the-way person, I am afraid!"
1	It appears to me, Mr Pancks, that you yourself are too often and too much in that direction, that direction.
1	If he stopped it did the same.
1	"One might suppose I was a-moving in the fashionable circles and getting myself up for almac's," says Mr. Bucket.
1	He had taken up a book from the stall, and there he stood, reading away, as hard as if he were in his elbow-chair, in his own study.
1	They are funny, but not uncommon.’ ‘Funny!’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick involuntarily.
1	‘Of course I know that, Louisa.
1	I know only one thing that I am fit for, and that is, to go for a soldier.
1	Next day came; came Georgiana; and came Fledgeby.
1	‘Do you play ecarte, Sir?’ ‘I shall be very happy to learn under your tuition,’ replied Mr. Winkle.
1	So I'll give you a piece of advice, and it's this, don't you talk too much.
1	At your fireside, my dear Mr. Copperfield, and in the presence of Mr. Traddles, who, though not so old a friend, is quite one of ourselves, I could not refrain from making you acquainted with the course I advise Mr. Micawber to take.
1	He was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked, which divided his attention, and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word.
1	"I accept it with many thanks," returned the trooper.
1	At another time you’re all for work.
1	And here let it be noticed, parenthetically, that the leg of this young man, in its application to the door, evinced the finest sense of touch: always preceding himself and tray (with something of an angling air about it), by some seconds: and always lingering after he and the tray had disappeared, like Macbeth’s leg when accompanying him off the stage with reluctance to the assassination of Duncan.
1	Before retiring, Miss,’ proclaimed the Billickin to Rosa, loftily cancelling Miss Twinkleton, ‘I should wish it to be understood between yourself and me that my transactions in future is with you alone.
1	I shall rise to the surface many thousand times yet, and the harder the thrust that pushes me down, the more quickly I shall rebound, Smike.
1	And that he thinks, at the present time, the feeling ought to be ‘Go one, go all!’ The housemaid is much affected by this generous sentiment, and warmly seconds it.
1	It recalled, at first, that so-different time when I had put up at the Golden Cross, and reminded me of the changes that had come to pass since then; but that was natural.
1	I am in another way of business.
1	‘“It was _not_,” said a deep voice.
1	‘I hope there is nothing the matter, sir,’ said Nell anxiously.
1	'Drive straight to the office and you will be in time,' replied Mr. Losberne.
1	Two or three gigs and chaise-carts were wheeled up under different little sheds and pent-houses; and the occasional heavy tread of a cart-horse, or rattling of a chain at the farther end of the yard, announced to anybody who cared about the matter, that the stable lay in that direction.
1	Upon this, the whole appearance before him and around him changed, and nothing was left as it had been, but himself and the clergyman.
1	Brother Charles turned, and said that it was a death of which they had to tell him, but that his niece was well.
1	As I looked after his figure, crossing the waste in the moonlight, I saw him turn his face towards a strip of silvery light upon the sea, and pass on, looking at it, until he was a shadow in the distance.
1	To Snagsby's, Law-Stationer's, Deeds engrossed and copied, Law-Writing executed in all its branches, &c., &c., &c. It is somewhere about five or six o'clock in the afternoon, and a balmy fragrance of warm tea hovers in Cook's Court.
1	Take one of these, I entreat.
1	“Well, my sweet,” said Miss Pross, nodding her head emphatically, “the short and the long of it is, that I am a subject of His Most Gracious Majesty King George the Third;” Miss Pross curtseyed at the name; “and as such, my maxim is, Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish tricks, On him our hopes we fix, God save the King!” Mr. Cruncher, in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated the words after Miss Pross, like somebody at church.
1	‘Ah!’ said that gentleman, smacking his lips, ‘here’s richness!
1	Ha ha!’ The prospect of playing the spy under such delicious circumstances, and of disappointing them all by walking in alive, gave more delight to Quilp than the greatest stroke of good fortune could possibly have inspired him with.
1	He coached himself up with a blue-book or two; and his brother put it about among the hard Fact fellows, and said, ‘If you want to bring in, for any place, a handsome dog who can make you a devilish good speech, look after my brother Jem, for he’s your man.’  After a few dashes in the public meeting way, Mr. Gradgrind and a council of political sages approved of Jem, and it was resolved to send him down to Coketown, to become known there and in the neighbourhood.
1	Mews Street, Grosvenor Square, was not absolutely Grosvenor Square itself, but it was very near it.
1	In a paroxysm of animosity and rapidity, Mr Pancks then caught the broad-brimmed hat out of the astounded Patriarch’s hand, cut it down into a mere stewpan, and fixed it on the Patriarch’s head.
1	‘Don’t be sorry for me, dear Papa!
1	There, were the people who were always going out to-morrow, and always putting it off; there, were the people who had come in yesterday, and who were much more jealous and resentful of this freak of fortune than the seasoned birds.
1	The inhabitants appeared to have a propensity to throw any little trifles they were not in want of, into the road: which not only made it rank and sloppy, but untidy too, on account of the cabbage-leaves.
1	So expressionless of any approach to spontaneity were his face and manner.
1	And certainly, when one comes to think of it, it WAS very odd that anything should have disturbed a companion.
1	Joe gave me some more gravy.
1	Look what a poor, mean, miserable thing it is!
1	The politeness of the person in authority had secured to me a shelf in a nook near this red curtain, in some degree removed from the great body of sleepers: to which place I retired, with many acknowledgments to him for his attention.
1	“Did you hear that he was dead, Joe?” I presently asked, with increasing diffidence.
1	"Yes, yes, you are tired," said he.
1	"No," said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, "I don't know much about it, either way.
1	‘Can’t he speak?’ ‘Be calm, my dear ma’am,’ said Mr. Chillip, in his softest accents.
1	Now let us talk sensibly.
1	But the sun itself, however beneficent, generally, was less kind to Coketown than hard frost, and rarely looked intently into any of its closer regions without engendering more death than life.
1	All the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can help men in public life, are in store for you.
1	Eugene is also in attendance, with a pervading air upon him of having presupposed the ceremony to be a funeral, and of being disappointed.
1	He used to tell my uncle he didn’t, but I have my doubts about it.
1	We went to an hotel by the sea, where two gentlemen were smoking cigars in a room by themselves.
1	‘Anywheres, my dear,’ said the collector, ‘I am not particular.’ Not particular!
1	‘Let me lie by him.
1	Oh, I understand now.’ ‘You see I have married the mother,’ pursued Snawley; ‘it’s expensive keeping boys at home, and as she has a little money in her own right, I am afraid (women are so very foolish, Mr. Squeers) that she might be led to squander it on them, which would be their ruin, you know.’ ‘I see,’ returned Squeers, throwing himself back in his chair, and waving his hand.
1	‘“Well,” said my uncle, as he looked about him, “a mail travelling at the rate of six miles and a half an hour, and stopping for an indefinite time at such a hole as this, is rather an irregular sort of proceeding, I fancy.
1	"My child, what questions are these!
1	She turned, and looked back.
1	Here, Bull's-eye, mind him, boy!
1	‘But not being a regular musical professional, I should be loath to engage myself for that; and therefore when I dropped into poetry, I should ask to be considered so fur, in the light of a friend.’ At this, Mr Boffin’s eyes sparkled, and he shook Silas earnestly by the hand: protesting that it was more than he could have asked, and that he took it very kindly indeed.
1	‘No, sir, I know that.
1	Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his putting himself in the way of being taken.” “Then you may rely upon it,” said Herbert, “that there would be great danger of his doing it.
1	It does Miss Tox credit.’ ‘And as to anything in the shape of a token, my dear Paul,’ pursued his sister, ‘all I can say is that anything you give Miss Tox will be hoarded and prized, I am sure, like a relic.
1	‘David and I will come down, together.
1	Mists hide in the avenues, veil the points of view, and move in funeral-wise across the rising grounds.
1	Again, I see her dark eyes roll round the church when she says ‘miserable sinners’, as if she were calling all the congregation names.
1	It is night, and she and Walter sit alone, watching the solemn path of light upon the sea between them and the moon.
1	But before I leave Niagara, I must advert to one disgusting circumstance which can hardly have escaped the observation of any decent traveller who has visited the Falls.
1	‘Will you answer me?’ said Quilp.
1	The Progress of an Epidemic      14.
1	I heerd him!” and I nodded at the old gentleman until it is no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him.
1	Notwithstanding which, I feel a little--I don’t want to use a strong word--now shall I say hurt?’ asked Mr Meagles at once with frankness and moderation, and with a conciliatory appeal in his tone.
1	Sir Leicester is content enough that the ironmaster should feel that there is no hurry there; there, in that ancient house, rooted in that quiet park, where the ivy and the moss have had time to mature, and the gnarled and warted elms and the umbrageous oaks stand deep in the fern and leaves of a hundred years; and where the sun-dial on the terrace has dumbly recorded for centuries that time which was as much the property of every Dedlock--while he lasted--as the house and lands.
1	says the constable, "so far, it seems, he had grounds for what he said.
1	None of them, young or old, thought of passing the child without a friendly word.
1	Mr Towlinson replies, from a sense of duty; and that now he is driven to express his opinions, he will openly say, that he does not think it over-respectable to remain in a house where Sales and such-like are carrying forwards.
1	His success was not quite equal to his expectations; for having neglected to take his hat off, it was knocked over his eyes by some unseen person, upon whose toes he had alighted with considerable force.
1	Mr. Pickwick stood up in a state of great agitation, and took a glance at the court.
1	I had thought so more than once lately.
1	In those days, travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers.
1	Mr Blandois proposed having the largest glasses in the house, to which Mr Flintwinch assented.
1	The Chicken himself attributed this punishment to his having had the misfortune to get into Chancery early in the proceedings, when he was severely fibbed by the Larkey one, and heavily grassed.
1	But there is a passion for tall flagstaffs hereabout, and you may see its twin brother in five minutes, if you have a mind.
1	She were a young lass—pretty enow—wi’ good accounts of herseln.
1	If she at all resemble the lady who presided over the store, it is a great charity to keep her as close as possible, and I cannot too strongly express my perfect concurrence in this benevolent proceeding.
1	‘Come with me to my dear father.
1	'There is something in that boy's face,' said the old gentleman to himself as he walked slowly away, tapping his chin with the cover of the book, in a thoughtful manner; 'something that touches and interests me.
1	I have withdrawn by myself, many times today, to weep.
1	‘You don’t remember me, I am afraid,’ said I.
1	It was Miss Murdstone who was arrived, and a gloomy-looking lady she was; dark, like her brother, whom she greatly resembled in face and voice; and with very heavy eyebrows, nearly meeting over her large nose, as if, being disabled by the wrongs of her sex from wearing whiskers, she had carried them to that account.
1	He was standing with his arms folded, over against the wall, looking at the spikes on the top, with a sentimental expression, as if they were the interlacing boughs of trees that had shaded him in his youth.
1	The company of Susan has been, I assure you, Miss Dombey, a consolation and satisfaction to me, in my state of mind, more easily conceived than described.
1	It is a place not to be forgotten or mixed up in the mind with other places, or altered for a moment in the crowd of scenes a traveller can recall.
1	I am a solitary man now, you know, and it will be a charity to come to me.
1	So, likewise, Sheen and Gloss to THEIR Jones, in reference to knowing where to have the fashionable people and how to bring what they (Sheen and Gloss) choose into fashion.
1	Her means and substance wasted; her father nearly beggared by her husband’s hand, and the hourly witness (for they lived now under one roof) of her ill-usage and unhappiness,--she never, but for him, bewailed her fate.
1	The two tables put together in a corner, were, at length, converted into a very fair bed; and the stranger was left to the Windsor chairs, the presidential tribune, the beery atmosphere, sawdust, pipe-lights, spittoons and repose.
1	‘Bless my heart!’ cried Mrs. Nickleby, hastily arranging her cap and front, ‘if it should be--dear me, standing in the passage all this time--why don’t you go and ask them to walk up, you stupid thing?’ While the girl was gone on this errand, Mrs. Nickleby hastily swept into a cupboard all vestiges of eating and drinking; which she had scarcely done, and seated herself with looks as collected as she could assume, when two gentlemen, both perfect strangers, presented themselves.
1	It was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned him so much employment next day in the way of eating and drinking; and withal had so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his temper; that he had neither time nor inclination to be very critical upon her behaviour and deportment.
1	Their bright blue eyes were certainly alike, but his face was so deeply furrowed and so very full of care, that here all resemblance ceased.
1	Hold the light higher, you!” With a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth, and, peering up the chimney, struck and prised at its sides with the crowbar, and worked at the iron grating across it.
1	‘There is no date, gentlemen,’ replied Serjeant Buzfuz; ‘but I am instructed to say that it was put in the plaintiff’s parlour window just this time three years.
1	It was her delight to expatiate on the style in which we were to live in India, and on the establishment we should keep, and the company we should entertain when he got his advancement.
1	Pointing in the direction of Saffron Hill, he inquired whether any one was up yonder to-night.
1	The blinded oxen, over-goaded, over-driven, never guided, run into wrong places and are beaten out, and plunge red-eyed and foaming at stone walls, and often sorely hurt the innocent, and often sorely hurt themselves.
1	I could only be as brisk and busy as possible, and that I had tried to be all along.
1	So they go out in a loose procession, something after the manner of a straggling funeral, and make their inspection in Mr. Krook's back second floor, from which a few of the jurymen retire pale and precipitately.
1	Common abbreviations took new meanings in his eyes, and had sole reference to them.
1	‘Well, and what then?’ said Ralph.
1	The basket packed in silence, they brought her bonnet to her, and smoothed her disordered hair, and put it on.
1	On a balance of the account, however, it may be doubted whether he lost much; for, although he found no property, he found so many debts and various associations of discredit with the proper name, which was the only word he made intelligible, that he was almost everywhere overwhelmed with injurious accusations.
1	But this figure with its head upon its hand returned so often, and remained so long, and sat so still and solemn, never speaking, never being spoken to, and rarely lifting up its face, that Paul began to wonder languidly, if it were real; and in the night-time saw it sitting there, with fear.
1	And why should you take trouble?
1	She did this, twenty, thirty times.
1	There is no improvement in the weather.
1	‘I am sure you will not speak to Walter if I ask you not,’ she added tenderly; ‘and pray don’t, dear.’ Susan sobbed ‘Why not, Miss Floy?’ ‘Because,’ said Florence, ‘I am going to be his wife, to give him up my whole heart, and to live with him and die with him.
1	I should not be able to bear it, and I should not try.
1	So with the Arrow, the Fish, the Scalp, the Big Canoe, and all of them.
1	I forgive her, if I have any cause.
1	I was very sensible of my entertainer’s goodness, and listened to the women’s going to bed in another little crib like mine at the opposite end of the boat, and to him and Ham hanging up two hammocks for themselves on the hooks I had noticed in the roof, in a very luxurious state of mind, enhanced by my being sleepy.
1	The Papers,’ said Mr Perch, taking two steps back again, and comprehensively addressing both the brother and sister in a whisper of increased mystery, ‘is more eager for news of it than you’d suppose possible.
1	‘How are the mighty fallen!’ remarks Cook.
1	‘How old is this boy, for God’s sake?’ inquired Ralph, wheeling back his chair, and surveying his nephew from head to foot with intense scorn.
1	‘Say, when she comes back, that she exerts herself too much.’ Miss Ledrook eked out this speech with so many mysterious nods and frowns before she shut the door again, that a profound silence came upon all the company, during which Miss Snevellicci’s papa looked very big indeed--several sizes larger than life--at everybody in turn, but particularly at Nicholas, and kept on perpetually emptying his tumbler and filling it again, until the ladies returned in a cluster, with Miss Snevellicci among them.
1	‘But you don’t surely mean to walk all the way back?’ ‘Oh, no,’ rejoined Mrs. Nickleby.
1	Some vague period of drowsy laughter must be devoted to the consideration of this possibility.
1	There is no obligation on either side.
1	So blackened by the flying particles of rubbish as to be unrecognisable, they ran back from the gateway into the street, crying and shrieking.
1	After a few preliminary remarks, Mr. Pott turned round to Mr. Pickwick, and said with solemnity-- ‘This contest excites great interest in the metropolis, sir?’ ‘I believe it does,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
1	I would suggest that as you think her worthy of your patronage, you should exert your influence to keep her from these dangerous hands.
1	There he leaves the young man in a large room, not over-light, while he makes report of him.
1	Other seven faces there were, carried higher, seven dead faces, whose drooping eyelids and half-seen eyes awaited the Last Day.
1	If you force your confidence upon me, Mr Headstone, I’ll give up every word of it.
1	‘It is unnatural to see your grey hair lower than mine.
1	I know that when she is clinging to you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your neck.
1	‘How came you here?’ He had followed him, it seemed; had never lost sight of him all the way; had watched while he slept, and when he halted for refreshment; and had feared to appear before, lest he should be sent back.
1	This was a great event for Paul, who sat down on the bottom stair, and watched the operation attentively: now and then glancing at the clock face, leaning all askew, against the wall hard by, and feeling a little confused by a suspicion that it was ogling him.
1	‘If it should be so,’ I began, ‘and I hope it is-’ ‘I don’t know that it is,’ said my aunt curtly.
1	It was opened by the usual maid-servant, and she showed him up at once, with her usual alacrity, to Flora’s sitting-room.
1	Immediately on the magistrate ceasing to speak, Mr. Pickwick, with a smile mantling on his again good-humoured countenance, stepped forward, and said-- ‘I beg the magistrate’s pardon, but may I request a few minutes’ private conversation with him, on a matter of deep importance to himself?’ ‘What?’ said the magistrate.
1	Here they stopped, and Mr Boffin consulted his watch.
1	It brought to her mind the foot of the Cross, and she committed herself to Him who died upon it.
1	And my terror was greatest of all when I found no figure there.
1	Kit was sure she must.
1	'And take yourself away from here, unless you want me to do something desperate.'
1	When the shadows of evening were closing in, I took an opportunity of getting into the garden with Biddy for a little talk.
1	“I'll tell you, however,” said I, “whether you want to know or not.
1	However, that’s beside the question.
1	Could I be accommodated, Sammy?’ Here Mrs. Weller let fall some more tears, and Mr. Stiggins groaned.
1	Though her tread was bold and courageous, she was fatigued, and after a moment of irresolution,--sat down upon a heap of stones; seeking no shelter from the rain, but letting it rain on her as it would.
1	‘I have sold the things.
1	I’ll run out presently, and get a bottle of soda.
1	The respectable old gentleman wrung his hand fervently, and seemed disposed to address some observation to his son; but on Mrs. Weller advancing towards him, he appeared to relinquish that intention, and abruptly bade him good-night.
1	if he has the misfortune to strike out something serviceable to the nation, he must follow where it leads him.’ ‘Hadn’t he better let it go?’ said Clennam.
1	"They are not torn down," cried Scrooge, folding one of his bed-curtains in his arms, "they are not torn down, rings and all.
1	Since that, all is fled, save gall.’ ‘Not all,’ says Mr Wegg, in a tone of sentimental condolence.
1	‘But,’ pursued Louisa, ‘if you have any reliance on my experience, Paul, you may rest assured that there is nothing wanting but an effort on Fanny’s part.
1	I have not done that for many a long year!"
1	Daughters, is there no better way to pass the fleeting hours?” ‘The four elder sisters cast down their eyes as if abashed by the holy man’s reproof, but Alice raised hers, and bent them mildly on the friar.
1	Mr. Tulkinghorn's clerk comes down from his official pew in the chambers to mention to the police that Mr. Tulkinghorn is answerable for its being all correct about the next of kin and that the papers and effects will be formally taken possession of in due time and course.
1	She only knew that she had no Father upon earth, and she said so, many times, with her suppliant head hidden from all, but her Father who was in Heaven.
1	“Spare no detail.” Mr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.
1	Taking into account where he was, the interest that had first brought him there when he had been free to keep away, and the gentle presence that was equally inseparable from the walls and bars about him and from the impalpable remembrances of his later life which no walls or bars could imprison, it was not remarkable that everything his memory turned upon should bring him round again to Little Dorrit.
1	They were at home in such good time that Kit had rubbed down the pony and made him as spruce as a race-horse, before Mr Garland came down to breakfast; which punctual and industrious conduct the old lady, and the old gentleman, and Mr Abel, highly extolled.
1	She lived upon nothing but victuals and drink;     Victuals and drink were the whole of her diet,     And yet this old woman would NEVER be quiet.
1	When I saw her again, an hour afterwards, she lay, indeed, where I had seen her strike her stick, and had heard her say that she would lie one day.
1	I gazed upon the schoolroom into which he took me, as the most forlorn and desolate place I had ever seen.
1	‘Are you coming, or are we to be locked in?’ ‘Yes, yes, I am ready,’ replied Mr. Winkle.
1	Even that frightened him, sturdy as he was; but he held the weapon till it broke, and then piled it on the coals to burn away, and smoulder into ashes.
1	One might have thought that it would have extracted some show of surprise or anger, or other emotion, from Mr Boffin, but it extracted nothing beyond his former comment: ‘Quite so, Venus.’ ‘I have astonished you, sir, I believe?’ said Mr Venus, pausing dubiously.
1	Notwithstanding my inability to settle to anything,--which I hope arose out of the restless and incomplete tenure on which I held my means,--I had a taste for reading, and read regularly so many hours a day.
1	Overpowered by his exertions, he lays his head back on his pillows and closes his eyes for not more than a minute, when he again resumes his watching of the weather and his attention to the muffled sounds.
1	He never took a dice-box in his hand, or held a card, but he was plucked, pigeoned, and cleaned out completely.’ ‘Do you hear what he says?’ whispered the old man.
1	‘I couldn’t believe it, with such a strange companion.’ As he stood near a lamp, listening with surprise to Walter’s hurried explanation, he presented a remarkable contrast to the two youthful figures arm-in-arm before him.
1	As to the house itself, with its three peaks in the roof; its various-shaped windows, some so large, some so small, and all so pretty; its trellis-work, against the south-front for roses and honey-suckle, and its homely, comfortable, welcoming look--it was, as Ada said when she came out to meet me with her arm through that of its master, worthy of her cousin John, a bold thing to say, though he only pinched her dear cheek for it.
1	But what a certainty was that!
1	Sir Barnet Skettles expressed his personal consequence chiefly through an antique gold snuffbox, and a ponderous silk pocket-kerchief, which he had an imposing manner of drawing out of his pocket like a banner and using with both hands at once.
1	‘Not so much of that as you may suppose,’ returned Tom; ‘for our governor had her crammed with all sorts of dry bones and sawdust.
1	‘Where are you going to?’ ‘Back to London, deary.
1	And what’s more,--with one scull gone.
1	Lengthy and prosy in the extreme.
1	At length he said that it was not for him to oppose Mr. Pickwick’s inclination, and that he would be very happy to yield to his advice; upon which, Mr. Pickwick joyfully took him at his word, and called Sam back into the room.
1	What I wish to approach is something very different.
1	Been interceding with him all this time, and sticking to him still?’ said Miss Wren, busy with her work.
1	Order in your pipe and I’ll read you the letter.
1	‘Will you come in?’ said Mr Meagles, presently.
1	Mrs. Steerforth speaking to me about my intention of going down into Suffolk, I said at hazard how glad I should be, if Steerforth would only go there with me; and explaining to him that I was going to see my old nurse, and Mr. Peggotty’s family, I reminded him of the boatman whom he had seen at school.
1	This other fear was so awful, that it hovered about each of them like a ghostly shadow; neither daring to think of its being near herself, far less of its being near the other.
1	Then, we had more tasks until tea, which Mr. Mell drank out of a blue teacup, and I out of a tin pot.
1	‘I have sometimes had it in my thoughts to make that offer and to settle down as many men of my class do: I on the one side of a school, my wife on the other, both of us interested in the same work.’ ‘Why have you not done so?’ asked Lizzie Hexam.
1	‘What is to be done with the remains?’ asked Lightwood.
1	‘I am so glad to be here.’ ‘That’s a fine fellow!’ said Mr. Wickfield.
1	Mrs. Strong, dressed in white, with cherry-coloured ribbons, was playing the piano, when we went in; and he was leaning over her to turn the leaves.
1	Who brought you up by hand?” “You did,” said I.
1	Such a precocious little girl, with such a dowdy bonnet on (that, too, of a gauzy texture), who brought her sandalled shoes in an old threadbare velvet reticule.
1	Now look here, Mr Wegg.
1	I have said so already,’ replied Mr. Wardle, shaking the right hand of his friend, while Mr. Trundle shook the left.
1	said the undertaker; looking up from the book, and pausing in the middle of a word; 'is that you, Bumble?'
1	This is not a time for a lady, however highly connected, to be totally inaudible, and seemingly swallowing marbles.
1	He lowered the window, and looked out at the rising sun.
1	'Nobody shall go near her,' said the man, starting fiercely up, as the undertaker approached the recess.
1	Mrs Lammle said, in a sportive way, she really must show her beautiful Bella what kind of wealthy creatures she and Alfred had on hand, who would as one man fall at her feet enslaved.
1	They were then regaled with a light supper of porridge, and stowed away, side by side, in a small bedstead, to warm each other, and dream of a substantial meal with something hot after it, if their fancies set that way: which it is not at all improbable they did.
1	‘It was not so powerful or so sun-browned when it saved Mr. Crisparkle,’ thought Rosa, glancing at it; ‘but it must have been very steady and determined even then.’ Mr. Tartar told her he had been a sailor, roving everywhere for years and years.
1	It's a weakness to be so affectionate, but I can't help it.
1	(I beg to observe that I think of myself with amazement, when I recall the lies I told on this occasion.)
1	If you feel towards me, in one particular, as you might if I was a lady, give me the full claims of a lady upon your generous behaviour.
1	‘Oh, Diogenes is quite well, Miss Dombey,’ Toots would cry.
1	‘I think your authority on the point as good as his, my dear,’ said Helena, sedately, ‘and you needn’t disappear again for that.’  Odd of Helena!
1	‘Betsey Trotwood don’t look a likely subject for the tender passion,’ said my aunt, composedly, ‘but the time was, Trot, when she believed in that man most entirely.
1	‘Oh, Trot,’ I seemed to hear my aunt say once more; and I understood her better now--‘Blind, blind, blind!’ We both kept silence for some minutes.
1	Well, sir,’ observed Venus, after clutching at his dusty hair, to brighten his ideas, ‘let us put it another way.
1	But I have not the power, Spirit.
1	‘Present circumstances is not what your friends would wish for you, Mister Copperfield, but it isn’t money makes the man: it’s--I am really unequal with my umble powers to express what it is,’ said Uriah, with a fawning jerk, ‘but it isn’t money!’ Here he shook hands with me: not in the common way, but standing at a good distance from me, and lifting my hand up and down like a pump handle, that he was a little afraid of.
1	‘Young, old, or middle-aged, Pancks,’ he said, when there was a favourable pause, ‘I am in a very anxious and uncertain state; a state that even leads me to doubt whether anything now seeming to belong to me, may be really mine.
1	Mr. Tupman, with a trembling voice, read the letter, of which the following is a copy:-- Freeman’s Court, Cornhill, August 28th, 1827.
1	You’ll be rich enough now--with your Boffins.
1	The lights had disappeared, and the shutters were closed--all in bed, no doubt.
1	‘How was it you worn’t one of us, last night?’ inquired Sam, scrubbing his face with the towel.
1	As he was sauntering away his spare time, and stopped to look at almost every object that met his gaze, it is by no means surprising that Mr. Weller should have paused before a small stationer’s and print- seller’s window; but without further explanation it does appear surprising that his eyes should have no sooner rested on certain pictures which were exposed for sale therein, than he gave a sudden start, smote his right leg with great vehemence, and exclaimed, with energy, ‘if it hadn’t been for this, I should ha’ forgot all about it, till it was too late!’ The particular picture on which Sam Weller’s eyes were fixed, as he said this, was a highly-coloured representation of a couple of human hearts skewered together with an arrow, cooking before a cheerful fire, while a male and female cannibal in modern attire, the gentleman being clad in a blue coat and white trousers, and the lady in a deep red pelisse with a parasol of the same, were approaching the meal with hungry eyes, up a serpentine gravel path leading thereunto.
1	‘Upon my soul,’ repeated Sir Mulberry, looking round to his companions; ‘I am afraid of Mrs Nickleby.
1	Reflects mature young lady; raven locks, and complexion that lights up well when well powdered--as it is--carrying on considerably in the captivation of mature young gentleman; with too much nose in his face, too much ginger in his whiskers, too much torso in his waistcoat, too much sparkle in his studs, his eyes, his buttons, his talk, and his teeth.
1	Bleak House," he returned, "must learn to take care of itself."
1	Why does Traddles look so important when he calls upon me this afternoon in the Commons--where I still occasionally attend, for form’s sake, when I have time?
1	Quilp indeed was a perpetual night-mare to the child, who was constantly haunted by a vision of his ugly face and stunted figure.
1	'Not coldly,' rejoined the old lady; 'far from it.'
1	‘Halloa!’ said Fledgeby, falling back, with a wink.
1	What does this mean?’ ‘In the name of God, say what it means, Neville!’ urged Mr. Crisparkle.
1	We turned to the right as I have turned, but I can recall no more.
1	It was nearly dinner-time next day when we appeared before my aunt.
1	I was undressing in my own room, when Mr. Micawber’s letter tumbled on the floor.
1	And now there was a shore before him.
1	I durstn’t do it,’ rejoined the small servant; ‘Miss Sally ‘ud kill me, if she know’d I come up here.’ ‘Have you got a fire down-stairs?’ said Dick.
1	I had just come in one night from my dear girl's and was sitting in the midst of all my new clothes, looking at them all around me and thinking, when a letter from my guardian was brought to me.
1	The sight of you from day to day, has been at once happiness and remorse to me.
1	I Assist at an Explosion      LIII.
1	‘And your master, young man!
1	His judges sat upon the Bench in feathered hats; but the rough red cap and tricoloured cockade was the head-dress otherwise prevailing.
1	These vents for their excitement found, they gradually closed about Mr Toodle again, and eyed him hard as he got through more bread and butter and tea; affecting, however, to have no further expectations of their own in reference to those viands, but to be conversing on foreign subjects, and whispering confidentially.
1	‘Tom Smart was by no means of an irritable or envious disposition, but somehow or other the tall man with the brown coat and the bright basket buttons did rouse what little gall he had in his composition, and did make him feel extremely indignant, the more especially as he could now and then observe, from his seat before the glass, certain little affectionate familiarities passing between the tall man and the widow, which sufficiently denoted that the tall man was as high in favour as he was in size.
1	Ada loved him too well to mistrust him much in anything he said or did, and my guardian, though he frequently complained of the east wind and read more than usual in the growlery, preserved a strict silence on the subject.
1	We were busy with Peepy, taking off his clerical hat, asking him if he remembered us, and so on.
1	‘With nobody present, but our dear and confidential friend Mr. Wickfield, I cannot consent to be put down.
1	He had felt some pride--he acknowledged it freely, and let his enemies make the most of it--he had felt some pride when he presented his Tittlebatian Theory to the world; it might be celebrated or it might not.
1	‘Serjeant Buzfuz and Mr. Skimpin for the plaintiff,’ said the judge, writing down the names in his note-book, and reading as he wrote; ‘for the defendant, Serjeant Snubbin and Mr. Monkey.’ ‘Beg your Lordship’s pardon, Phunky.’ ‘Oh, very good,’ said the judge; ‘I never had the pleasure of hearing the gentleman’s name before.’ Here Mr. Phunky bowed and smiled, and the judge bowed and smiled too, and then Mr. Phunky, blushing into the very whites of his eyes, tried to look as if he didn’t know that everybody was gazing at him, a thing which no man ever succeeded in doing yet, or in all reasonable probability, ever will.
1	Caddy, show Miss Clare and Miss Summerson their rooms.
1	‘What is that?’ said Nicholas, kindly.
1	‘Your occupations must be immense.’ ‘Tolerably so.
1	To see him mooning along to that time of life, laying down nothing by the way and picking up nothing by the way, is delightful.
1	At last he had declared that he would become a Painter; partly because he had always had an idle knack that way, and partly to grieve the souls of the Barnacles-in-chief who had not provided for him.
1	Here everybody said, ‘Hush!’ a good many times; and that being done, no one seemed to have any very distinct apprehension of what was to be done next.
1	They felt as if it were not right to lay him down in the same quiet room.
1	Bleak House has an exposed sound.
1	Get along with you,’ and shut it on him.
1	"Now, what does our young friend say?"
1	Ralph looked at him for an instant, and for an instant only; then, waved his hand, and beating the ground with his foot, said in a choking voice: ‘Go on, gentlemen, go on!
1	I entreated her to tell Dora, if Dora were in a state to hear it, that he had spoken to me with the utmost kindness and consideration; and had coupled nothing but tenderness, not a single or reproachful word, with her name.
1	It would be worth a journey (not to mention the pleasure of a journey with you, Daisy), to see that sort of people together, and to make one of ‘em.’ My heart leaped with a new hope of pleasure.
1	Great Heaven!” “Softly,” said Herbert.
1	"Now, you see," Mr. Bucket proceeds approvingly, "you're comfortable and conducting yourself as I should expect a foreign young woman of your sense to do.
1	Of late, the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known him more scantily than ever; and often when he had thrown himself upon it no longer than a few minutes, he had got up again, and haunted that neighbourhood.
1	She hastened to the door and opened it.
1	But since we have got so far, I ought to take the liberty of mentioning that Copperfield has noticed it too.’ I turned upon him, and asked him how he dared refer to me!
1	As to its adventurous beginning, and all those little circumstances which gave it a distinctive character and relish, he took them into account, more as a pleasant story very agreeable to his imagination, and not to be dismissed from it, than as a part of any matter of fact with which he was concerned.
1	‘I have met him twice.
1	‘You know very little of your guardian?’ the Minor Canon repeated.
1	Sad and grieving was the heart of Florence, as she crept upstairs.
1	You'll hear one presently.” In effect, we had not walked many yards further, when the well-remembered boom came towards us, deadened by the mist, and heavily rolled away along the low grounds by the river, as if it were pursuing and threatening the fugitives.
1	I've been locked up as much as a silver tea-kittle.
1	If you disclose it, there’s an end of it.’ It was too dark for either to see the other’s face; but each seemed very attentive, and to consider before speaking.
1	Not that I want to get rid of the child, any more than I want to thtand in her way.
1	But we had looked forward to my one-and-twentieth birthday, with a crowd of speculations and anticipations, for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly help saying something definite on that occasion.
1	Here Sam recommended his master and Mr. Winkle to seat themselves, while he reconnoitred, and ascertained whether Mary was yet in waiting.
1	People came and looked on, too, which made Mr. Pickwick nervous.
1	‘He can live on very little, sir, and it is expected as he will be able, in time, to make a very good living.
1	The clouds were drifting over the moon at their giddiest speed; at one time wholly obscuring her; at another, suffering her to burst forth in full splendour and shed her light on all the objects around; anon, driving over her again, with increased velocity, and shrouding everything in darkness.
1	If it should go ill with the prisoner, I have ensured access to him, once.” Mr. Lorry's countenance fell.
1	‘Pray ma’am,’ said the single gentleman, whom she found alone in the room, ‘take a chair.’ Miss Brass sat herself down, in a very stiff and frigid state, and seemed--as indeed she was--not a little astonished to find that the lodger and her mysterious correspondent were one and the same person.
1	If he could think himself of so much use, one gleam of day might, by possibility, penetrate into the cheerless dungeon of his remaining existence--though his longevity is, at present (to say the least of it), extremely problematical.
1	Cleopatra, left alone, feels a little giddy from her strong emotion, and falls asleep.
1	‘Here’s Father,’ she would say, presenting him to a neighbour.
1	And but for his illness he would have been put in irons, for he was regarded as a determined prison-breaker, and I know not what else.
1	You, who opposed to both, when your hair was grey, the qualities which made both when you gave him birth!
1	said Mr. Jarndyce, catching at the word.
1	In the drawing-room, groups form as usual.
1	But I have a constitutional objection to this sort of thing.
1	"They say I am like my father, grandmother."
1	He was quite pleased when she pretended to take it away for the purpose, and afterwards had a relish for his little tastes of wine and jelly, that he had not had before.
1	‘Take a word of advice, even from three foot nothing.
1	But the person said--by the bye, you don’t keep a dog, you, Captain Gills?’ The Captain shook his head.
1	In his plain old suit of black, he looked pale and meagre.
1	There's nothing solar about legs of beef and mutton.
1	‘Well; and how came you here?’ said Mr. Pickwick, with a smile in which benevolence struggled with surprise.
1	Since which, Captain Gills--and Lieutenant Walters--I have been perfectly frantic, and have been lying down on the sofa all night, the Ruin you behold.’ ‘Mr Toots,’ said Walter, ‘I am happy to be able to relieve your mind.
1	We spent as much money as we could, and got as little for it as people could make up their minds to give us.
1	‘It would have occurred to most men,’ said Mrs Chick, ‘that poor dear Fanny being no more,--those words of mine will always be a balm and comfort to me,’ here she dried her eyes; ‘it becomes necessary to provide a Nurse.’ ‘Oh!
1	I forget now where they chiefly went, but I think there were some among them that made voyages both to the East and West Indies.
1	Cousin Feenix met her at the door, and took her down to Walter in the dingy dining room, upon whose shoulder she laid her head weeping.
1	I believe there never existed in his station a more respectable-looking man.
1	‘And you were in crack society.
1	They both rolled on to their feet in an untidy sort of manner, when we came in, and said, ‘Halloa, Murdstone!
1	In my forlorn state I became quite attached to the family, and used to walk about, busy with Mrs. Micawber’s calculations of ways and means, and heavy with the weight of Mr. Micawber’s debts.
1	are you a perfect fool?’ and interfered.
1	Kiss our child for me.” That was all the writing.
1	Every pound lost, would have been a hundredweight of happiness gained.
1	‘We keep twenty young women constantly employed in the establishment,’ said Madame.
1	You are here, sir!’ he said, springing on the step, and holding the window-frame by his elbow, as the carriage moved.
1	“Faint heart never won fair lady.” Why was my heart so faint?
1	By the light of the torches, we saw the black Hulk lying out a little way from the mud of the shore, like a wicked Noah's ark.
1	She is sorry to find he is discontented, which is sinful and horrid, and hopes Mr. Squeers will flog him into a happier state of mind; with which view, she has also stopped his halfpenny a week pocket-money, and given a double-bladed knife with a corkscrew in it to the Missionaries, which she had bought on purpose for him.’ ‘A sulky state of feeling,’ said Squeers, after a terrible pause, during which he had moistened the palm of his right hand again, ‘won’t do.
1	I tell you, if I’ve gone too far, I’m sorry.
1	‘When it makes its way into my mind, dear,’ said Rachael, ‘and it will come sometimes, though I do all I can to keep it out, wi’ counting on to high numbers as I work, and saying over and over again pieces that I knew when I were a child—I fall into such a wild, hot hurry, that, however tired I am, I want to walk fast, miles and miles.
1	He could tell you who suffered, but he couldn’t tell you whose fault it was.
1	The young lady was astonished to find visitors at the gate, and expressed her feelings in appropriate action.
1	He sat on one side of the small table, looking keenly at himself on the other side with his chin sunk on his breast, snoring.
1	And if I hear you for half a minute longer, the dog shall have such a grip on your throat as'll tear some of that screaming voice out.
1	Let me help you.’ The young lady, who had been coyly affecting not to know that a gentleman was so near, turned round as Sam spoke--no doubt (indeed she said so, afterwards) to decline this offer from a perfect stranger--when instead of speaking, she started back, and uttered a half-suppressed scream.
1	Accordingly he set it open, and stood upon the threshold, keeping a bright look-out, and sweeping the whole street with his spectacles.
1	He raised her with the utmost tenderness, calling her the best of daughters, and ‘my poor pretty creetur’, and laid her head upon his knee, and tried to restore her.
1	Toots, Esquire, Brighton, Sussex,’ and to preserve them in his desk with great care.
1	Thus did it come to pass that she brought the Chadbands and Mr. Tulkinghorn together, and conferred with Mr. Tulkinghorn on the change in Mr. Guppy, and helped to turn up the circumstances in which the present company are interested, casually, by the wayside, being still and ever on the great high road that is to terminate in Mr. Snagsby's full exposure and a matrimonial separation.
1	Good-night, Tommy!’ As Jackson hurried away in company with the man with the ash stick another man, with a key in his hand, who had been looking on, led the bewildered female to a second short flight of steps leading to a doorway.
1	I’d ha’ got half a dozen have- his-carcases ready, pack’d up and all, by this time.’ What sort of cumbrous and unmanageable machine, Sam Weller imagined a habeas-corpus to be, does not appear; for Perker, at that moment, walked up and took Mr. Pickwick away.
1	In her two long narrow windows, the fire shone sullenly all day, and sullenly all night.
1	‘Quite contrairy.’ ‘You have the appearance of being overcome, Captain Gills,’ observed Mr Toots.
1	Mr Pancks asked, with a little inquiring twist of his head, if he might come in again?
1	Lady Tippins partaking plentifully of the fruits of the earth (including grape-juice in the category) becomes livelier, and applies herself to elicit sparks from Mortimer Lightwood.
1	I tell you plainly, gentlemen, that little as I care for the opinion of the world (as the slang goes), I don’t choose to submit quietly to slander and malice.
1	I proceed to put myself in communication with her; I even happen to possess some special means,’ with a glance at Eugene, ‘of putting myself in communication with her; but I fail too, because she has vanished.’ ‘Vanished!’ is the general echo.
1	We must marry ‘em, Ma’am,’ says Mr Sownds, ‘and keep the country going.’ Mr Sownds is sitting on the steps and Mrs Miff is dusting in the church, when a young couple, plainly dressed, come in.
1	He could not but look at her with disconcertment, as she sat breathing bitterness and scorn, and staring leagues away.
1	There can be no doubt about that.
1	At each, there are a great many small dishes and plates upon the table, with very little in them; so that although there is every appearance of a mighty ‘spread,’ there is seldom really more than a joint: except for those who fancy slices of beet-root, shreds of dried beef, complicated entanglements of yellow pickle; maize, Indian corn, apple-sauce, and pumpkin.
1	‘Why, ma’am,’ said Mr. Kenwigs, ‘it’s not exactly for me to say what they may be, or what they may not be.
1	I know a friend who has a beef-faced boy; a fine boy, they call him; with a round head, and red cheeks, and glaring eyes; a horrid boy; with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams of his blue clothes; with the voice of a pilot, and the appetite of a wolf.
1	You see how you can recall me!’ And afterwards, when he could not speak, he still answered by a slight movement of his head upon her bosom.
1	Is it so, my dear?’  He looked upon her once more, lying cast away there; and without another word went out of the room.
1	How, otherways, could a doubt have come into your head about it, governor?’ ‘As the sun goes down, I intend to go on,’ said Bradley.
1	added Richard, looking closely at the man.
1	Sometimes the world’s wife has so many daughters, that her card reads rather like a Miscellaneous Lot at an Auction; comprising Mrs Tapkins, Miss Tapkins, Miss Frederica Tapkins, Miss Antonina Tapkins, Miss Malvina Tapkins, and Miss Euphemia Tapkins; at the same time, the same lady leaves the card of Mrs Henry George Alfred Swoshle, NEE Tapkins; also, a card, Mrs Tapkins at Home, Wednesdays, Music, Portland Place.
1	Then, at a grocer’s shop, we bought an egg and a slice of streaky bacon; which still left what I thought a good deal of change, out of the second of the bright shillings, and made me consider London a very cheap place.
1	The nondescript knew two Miss Dorrits; one who was born inside--That was the one!
1	‘I must apply to the hemperor for leave of absence,’ said Sam.
1	But it took a morning to scale that wall; and I doubt if any other man than myself (he likes me of old) could have got his leg over it.
1	I was attending to my business, and couldn’t have my eyes in twenty places at once, like a peacock, no more than you could.

1	‘How do you fare to feel about it, Mas’r Davy?’ he inquired at length.
1	Being here and having met with your kind attention, Master, might I, afore I go, ask a question of these here young lambs of yourn?’ ‘If it is in the way of school,’ said Bradley, always sustaining his dark look at the other, and speaking in his suppressed voice, ‘you may.’ ‘Oh!
1	‘I want a backer in this matter; one who can talk, and urge, and press a point, which you can do as no man can.
1	There is a box of barristers on their right hand; there is an enclosure of insolvent debtors on their left; and there is an inclined plane of most especially dirty faces in their front.
1	A great pull!’ said Traddles, with a wince, as if he had had a tooth out.
1	He does not send me to this post as a good one; he disclaims to represent it as being better than it is; and I doubt very much if it will ever lead me to advancement in the House--whether it does not, on the contrary, dispose of me for ever, and put me out of the way.
1	"If I run down to the Dedlock, and get my portmanteau fastened up, and order a gig, or a chaise, or whatever's to be got, we shall have an hour then before starting.
1	You see this is unavoidable?’ ‘Dear friend, I said so.’ ‘True.
1	‘I’m sure aunt’s talking about us,’ whispered Miss Emily Wardle to her sister--‘I’m quite certain of it--she looks so malicious.’ ‘Is she?’ replied Isabella.--‘Hem!
1	Clennam cheering him with a hearty co-operation, was a moral support to him, besides doing good service in his business relation.
1	Experience has never put a chill upon my warm-heartedness.’ ‘I tell you he’s very sorry, don’t I?’ remonstrated Isaac List, ‘and that he wishes you’d go on.’ ‘Does he wish it?’ said the other.
1	I was not aware of it until he struck in on my saying I heard some one crying.
1	Then, to match this young lady, was a young man, who had known Mr. Kenwigs when he was a bachelor, and was much esteemed by the ladies, as bearing the reputation of a rake.
1	Tim Linkinwater’s sister lamented; the housekeeper condoled; and both kept thrusting their heads out of the second-floor window to see if the boy was ‘coming’--which would have been highly satisfactory, and, upon the whole, tantamount to his being come, as the distance to the corner was not quite five yards--when, all of a sudden, and when he was least expected, the messenger, carrying the bandbox with elaborate caution, appeared in an exactly opposite direction, puffing and panting for breath, and flushed with recent exercise; as well he might be; for he had taken the air, in the first instance, behind a hackney coach that went to Camberwell, and had followed two Punches afterwards and had seen the Stilts home to their own door.
1	Most solemnly.’ ‘Never to the Parish!’ with a convulsed struggle.
1	Quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in the courtyard here, even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage.
1	‘What can that young man be going to do?’ He had sat ruminating about the matter for some time, when the voice of Roker, the turnkey, demanded whether he might come in.
1	But, if Nicholas’s own heart embarrassed him, Newman’s came to his relief.
1	When my lips had parted, and had shaped some words that were without sound, I forced myself to tell him (though I could not do it distinctly), that I had been chosen to succeed to some property.
1	“What can we do to raise your spirits, dear mama?” says the little child.
1	Some five minutes elapsed before Captain Cuttle could summon courage to attempt his escape; for Walter waited so long at the street corner, looking back at the house, before there were any symptoms of the hard glazed hat.
1	‘Captain Gills,’ said Toots, kindly, ‘I hope and trust there’s nothing wrong?’ ‘Thank’ee, my lad, not a bit,’ said the Captain.
1	'I don't know where,' replied the girl.
1	He makes no search for his daughter.
1	_I_ turn out nothing else, and I make you a present of the confession.’ To make a vaunt of being poor was another of the incidents of his splenetic state, though this may have had the design in it of showing that he ought to be rich; just as he would publicly laud and decry the Barnacles, lest it should be forgotten that he belonged to the family.
1	Mr. Vholes took that opportunity of holding a little conversation in a low voice with me.
1	A pencil-writing, on a crushed and torn piece of paper, blotted with wet.
1	‘Leave him to me.’ ‘Where is he?
1	Now, your ladyship, a queer thing happened after that man's death.
1	I wished to be generous to him, even in the secret depths of my heart, which he would never know, because I could have loved him--could have been devoted to him.
1	So ended our conference, which I was very glad to bring to a close.
1	I have not often seen a place that commends itself so favourably and pleasantly to a stranger at the first glance as this does: with its clean houses of red and white, its well-paved roads, and foot-ways of bright tile.
1	Mind you, Miss Abbey, I was his pardner.
1	“Oh!” said I, poker in hand; “it's you, is it?
1	‘You hear him say he did it!’ ‘Did it!’ cried John.
1	‘An old man entered the porch just as he reached it.
1	She spoke of it more than once, as we followed your party up the mountain.’ The head of the large retinue, who was gracious but not familiar, appeared by this time to think that he had condescended more than enough.
1	Her tenderness for me was as loving and true as ever; I did not for a moment doubt that; but there was a quiet sorrow about her which she did not confide to me, and in which I traced some hidden regret.
1	The crisis of the disease was safely past.
1	And, Carker, as I was about to say to you--’ Mr Carker, who had sat and listened all this time, now raised his eyes, in which there was a bright unusual light.
1	Behind it, when standing thus on the defensive, was a closet, usually containing something good to drink.
1	During this melancholy pause, the turnkey read his newspaper with a waggish look (he had evidently got among the facetious paragraphs) until, happening to take his eyes off for an instant, as if to get by dint of contemplation at the very marrow of some joke of a deeper sort than the rest, it appeared to occur to him, for the first time, that somebody was crying.
1	I ought to have left Janet at home, instead, and then my mind might perhaps have been at ease.
1	I can never see thee better than so.
1	Then, on the motion--made in dumb show--of Doctor Parker Peps, they went upstairs; the family practitioner opening the room door for that distinguished professional, and following him out, with most obsequious politeness.
1	What’s this?’ and bent his eyes upon me, as if he would have burnt me up with them.
1	He had made a desperate attempt, one night, and had sat up all night for the purpose, to write an acrostic on Florence, which affected him to tears in the conception.
1	One called to mind how he had seen her sitting on that very spot, and how her book had fallen on her lap, and she was gazing with a pensive face upon the sky.
1	But what could I suppose when you said nothing for yourself, you know?
1	'There's an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear,' resumed Mr. Sowerberry, 'which is very interesting.
1	A reconciliation is established on this propitious occasion between the acknowledged wit of the Counting House and an aspiring rival, with whom he has been at deadly feud for months; and a little dinner being proposed, in commemoration of their happily restored amity, takes place at a neighbouring tavern; the wit in the chair; the rival acting as Vice-President.
1	A stagnant, sickening oil with some natural repulsion in it that makes them both shudder.
1	Now, these four retorts arose from Mr. Giles's taunt; and Mr. Giles's taunt had arisen from his indignation at having the responsibility of going home again, imposed upon himself under cover of a compliment.
1	‘It’s rather sudden,’ said Dick shaking his head with a look of infinite wisdom, and running on (as he was accustomed to do) with scraps of verse as if they were only prose in a hurry; ‘when the heart of a man is depressed with fears, the mist is dispelled when Miss Wackles appears; she’s a very nice girl.
1	He took out his purse.
1	"Aye, but they might teach me wrong!"
1	And in that short time!
1	If you must proceed upon your journey, I wish you well through it, and will walk a little way with you before school begins.’ ‘What are we to do, Nell?’ said the old man irresolutely, ‘say what we’re to do, dear.’ It required no great persuasion to induce the child to answer that they had better accept the invitation and remain.
1	"But I could have made the money without this anonymous information."
1	Some half-dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out, and presented him breathless to Monsieur the Marquis.
1	"I am not sure that I understand you, George," replies the ironmaster.
1	That concerns me, if it don't concern Sir Leicester Dedlock.
1	I approached him tenderly, for I loved even him; but he showed his whole set of teeth, got under a chair expressly to snarl, and wouldn’t hear of the least familiarity.
1	She continued to look at him; and if, when he entered the house, he had had any latent hope of prevailing in the least with her, she now looked it out of his heart.
1	When he had gone on thus for some time, he took her hand in his as he was accustomed to do, with nothing of the violence or animation of his late manner; and so, by degrees so fine that the child could not trace them, he settled down into his usual quiet way, and suffered her to lead him where she would.
1	‘Have you any fears for Walter’s safety?’ inquired Florence, from whose face the Captain (so enraptured he was with it) could not take his eyes: while she, in her turn, looked earnestly at him, to be assured of the sincerity of his reply.
1	Whenever you do, George, let us know."
1	Then the discreet automaton who had surveyed his ground, played a blossomless tuneless ‘set,’ and sixteen disciples of Podsnappery went through the figures of - 1, Getting up at eight and shaving close at a quarter past - 2, Breakfasting at nine - 3, Going to the City at ten - 4, Coming home at half-past five - 5, Dining at seven, and the grand chain.
1	The Doctor was quite happy in the prospect of our going to work together on that wonderful performance, and we settled to begin next morning at seven o’clock.
1	These, and a dark-complexioned young woman, with a habit of snorting, who was servant to the family, and informed me, before half an hour had expired, that she was ‘a Orfling’, and came from St. Luke’s workhouse, in the neighbourhood, completed the establishment.
1	"And now I don't so much care how it ends."
1	I am a straw upon the surface of the deep, and am tossed in all directions by the elephants--I beg your pardon; I should have said the elements.’ We walked on, arm-in-arm, again; found the coach in the act of starting; and arrived at Highgate without encountering any difficulties by the way.
1	said Mr. Guppy with a blank look.
1	"I have done you many wrongs, my own.
1	The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover, was, that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked.
1	His head dropped upon his breast; and, muttering his invincible determination not to go to his bed, and a sanguinary regret that he had not ‘done for old Tupman’ in the morning, he fell fast asleep; in which condition he was borne to his apartment by two young giants under the personal superintendence of the fat boy, to whose protecting care Mr. Snodgrass shortly afterwards confided his own person, Mr. Pickwick accepted the proffered arm of Mr. Tupman and quietly disappeared, smiling more than ever; and Mr. Wardle, after taking as affectionate a leave of the whole family as if he were ordered for immediate execution, consigned to Mr. Trundle the honour of conveying him upstairs, and retired, with a very futile attempt to look impressively solemn and dignified.
1	And don’t let me become a perfect fright with teasing and wearing myself at your ingratitude, or when I’m out again in society no soul will know me, not even that hateful animal, the Major.’ But, sometimes, when Edith went nearer to her, and bending down her stately head, put her cold cheek to hers, the mother would draw back as If she were afraid of her, and would fall into a fit of trembling, and cry out that there was a wandering in her wits.
1	Before I run away, I used to sleep in the kitchen--where we played cards, you know.
1	‘The world is before me, after all.’ ‘Tell me,’ urged Smike, ‘is the world as bad and dismal as this place?’ ‘Heaven forbid,’ replied Nicholas, pursuing the train of his own thoughts; ‘its hardest, coarsest toil, were happiness to this.’ ‘Should I ever meet you there?’ demanded the boy, speaking with unusual wildness and volubility.
1	Finally, after a very long sitting, Mr Snittle Timberry vacated the chair, and the company with many adieux and embraces dispersed.
1	When you came in, I was full of it.
1	Because Pumblechook done everything for him.” “Does Pumblechook say so?” “Say so!” replied the landlord.
1	‘What do _you _know of the time when young men shut themselves up in those lonely rooms, and read and read, hour after hour, and night after night, till their reason wandered beneath their midnight studies; till their mental powers were exhausted; till morning’s light brought no freshness or health to them; and they sank beneath the unnatural devotion of their youthful energies to their dry old books?
1	"It has made the south wind easterly, I don't know how often.
1	"You give the house almost a wholesome look.
1	What can it be to me?
1	Miss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked out with care.
1	Then, be as lenient to me as you can, and do not turn to bitterness the only sweet remembrance I shall have.’ The tears that were visible in her eyes as she kept them fixed on Florence, showed that the composed face was but as a handsome mask; but she preserved it, and continued: ‘I have seen what you say, and know how true it is.
1	Chizzle, Mizzle, and otherwise have lapsed into a habit of vaguely promising themselves that they will look into that outstanding little matter and see what can be done for Drizzle--who was not well used--when Jarndyce and Jarndyce shall be got out of the office.
1	"What's to-day, my fine fellow?"
1	But she had the power, and he felt it keenly.
1	After a while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself.
1	“Is it Mr. Sapsea,” he said doubtfully, “or is it—” “It is Mr. Sapsea,” I replied.
1	He gave me his arm, and the two officers courteously bowed me out, and we found at the door a phaeton or barouche with a postilion and post horses.
1	Their pieces were cocked and levelled when we all ran in.
1	Oh, she’s not dead, Peggotty?’ Peggotty cried out No!
1	upon the wall!’ There was the shadow of a man upon the wall close to her.
1	But how?’ ‘I’ll tell you, Pa.
1	And you correspond.’ ‘We write to one another,’ said Rosa, pouting, as she recalled their epistolary differences.
1	‘You are right, sir,’ replied Mr. Pickwick, ‘they are not.
1	In the pathetic supplication to have his heart inclined to keep this law, he quite astonishes his fellows by his melodious power.
1	Try once more, dearest Mr Fledgeby.
1	He’s a low thief, sir.
1	I am such a waif and stray everywhere, that I am liable to be drifted where any current may set.’ ‘It’s extraordinary to me--if you’ll excuse my freedom in saying so--that you don’t go straight to London,’ said Mr Meagles, in the tone of a confidential adviser.
1	I naturally inquired why he was not there too, instead of pacing the streets by himself?
1	I spoke to her, and she started, and cried out.
1	‘Well, but let us know.
1	It’s enough to be robbed while you’re snoring because you’re too comfortable, without being put right with _your_ four seven ones.
1	He is not my private friend and public patron, as Steerforth was, but I hold him in a reverential respect.
1	To think of Jack Dawkins--lummy Jack--the Dodger--the Artful Dodger--going abroad for a common twopenny-halfpenny sneeze-box!
1	‘And then, as if this was not enough, and she had not stood sufficiently in the light of this child’s sister, Betsey Trotwood,’ said my aunt, ‘she marries a second time--goes and marries a Murderer--or a man with a name like it--and stands in THIS child’s light!
1	‘If she ever turns pettish or ill-humoured, I’ll taunt her with that spark,’ he said, when he had recovered.
1	It was made plain enough, by the dressing of the shops, that here too it was Christmas time again; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up.
1	I know that I worked, from morning until night, with common men and boys, a shabby child.
1	Not if you know it, you ain’t.’ Mr Casby shook his head, in Placid and benignant generality.
1	The President rang his bell, and with warmth resumed.
1	It will be sufficient for our purpose to relate, that escaping the snares of the dragons in white aprons, who guard the entrance to that enchanted region, he reached the vicar-general’s office in safety and having procured a highly flattering address on parchment, from the Archbishop of Canterbury, to his ‘trusty and well-beloved Alfred Jingle and Rachael Wardle, greeting,’ he carefully deposited the mystic document in his pocket, and retraced his steps in triumph to the Borough.
1	THE Fairy palaces burst into illumination, before pale morning showed the monstrous serpents of smoke trailing themselves over Coketown.
1	"HE lived here," Jo answers as before.
1	No waking creature save himself appears except in one direction, where he sees the solitary figure of a woman sitting on a door-step.
1	He had not gone five minutes’ walk from the door, when a man came running after him, and begged him to return.
1	“Pip,” said he, putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to the window, “I don't know one from the other.
1	I summoned all the resolutions I had made, in all those many days and nights, and all those many conflicts of my heart.
1	This history concluded, brother Ned related how that, exactly thirty-five years ago, Tim Linkinwater was suspected to have received a love-letter, and how that vague information had been brought to the counting-house of his having been seen walking down Cheapside with an uncommonly handsome spinster; at which there was a roar of laughter, and Tim Linkinwater being charged with blushing, and called upon to explain, denied that the accusation was true; and further, that there would have been any harm in it if it had been; which last position occasioned the superannuated bank clerk to laugh tremendously, and to declare that it was the very best thing he had ever heard in his life, and that Tim Linkinwater might say a great many things before he said anything which would beat THAT.
1	‘I have not found that there is any change in such places,’ was the answer, delivered with supreme indifference.
1	You can tell nothing I don’t know.
1	“Fill to the Lady of Grogzwig!” ‘The four-and-twenty Lincoln greens turned pale, with the exception of their four-and-twenty noses, which were unchangeable.
1	‘You were wishing to speak to Christopher, sir?’ ‘Yes, I was.
1	‘Why then, child,’ said Mrs Chick, ‘you can.
1	'Should I have to hand over?'
1	The plot was most interesting.
1	‘I see it,’ replied Sam, with a placid nod of the head.
1	Now, this back-room was immediately behind the bar, and some steps lower, so that any person connected with the house, undrawing a small curtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the last-named apartment, about five feet from its flooring, could not only look down upon any guests in the back-room without any great hazard of being observed (the glass being in a dark angle of the wall, between which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself), but could, by applying his ear to the partition, ascertain with tolerable distinctness, their subject of conversation.
1	replied the girl, in the same tone.
1	The reply was, that Mr. Bounderby having missed him in the crowd, and seeing nothing of him since, had supposed him to be at Stone Lodge.
1	'And Fagin would RATHER not!'
1	He appeared so miserable, sitting with his head upon his hand, and I appeared so unwelcome, that I was going to offer an apology when Mr. Bucket took the matter on himself.
1	You make your life miserable along of her.
1	Leaving this town directly after breakfast, we pushed forward again, over a rather worse road than yesterday, if possible, and arrived about noon at Tiffin, where we parted with the extra.
1	It was evening, and Bradley was walking in his garden observed from behind a blind by gentle little Miss Peecher, who contemplated offering him a loan of her smelling salts for headache, when Mary Anne, in faithful attendance, held up her arm.
1	You were an orphan, weren’t you?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘And a governess?’ ‘I was nursery-governess in a family where Mr. Copperfield came to visit.
1	She grew to womanhood, and gave her heart to one who could not know its worth.
1	Instead of looking back, therefore, I will look forward.
1	Steel and Iron George's Shooting Gallery is to let, and the stock is sold off, and George himself is at Chesney Wold attending on Sir Leicester in his rides and riding very near his bridle-rein because of the uncertain hand with which he guides his horse.
1	Who, slightly acknowledging the presence of Major Bagstock, and directing a keen glance at her mother, drew back from a window, and sat down there, looking out.
1	Three or four times I feebly thought I would start conversation; but whenever he saw me going to ask him anything, he looked at me with his glass in his hand, and rolling his wine about in his mouth, as if requesting me to take notice that it was of no use, for he couldn't answer.
1	It is small, of course; and the door being not solid, but grated, and without blind or curtain, the prisoner within is at all times exposed to the observation and inspection of any guard who may pass along that tier at any hour or minute of the night.
1	Another’s merits have had their weight, and have had far more weight with Me.
1	he’ll write to me no doubt, or he’ll bid Nelly write--yes, yes, that’s what he’ll do.
1	Then Mr. Datchery admired the Cathedral, and Mr. Sapsea pointed it out as if he himself had invented and built it: there were a few details indeed of which he did not approve, but those he glossed over, as if the workmen had made mistakes in his absence.
1	I only say, that at present I have not found it out.’ There was no shadow of Mr Merdle’s complaint on the bosom now displaying precious stones in rivalry with many similar superb jewel-stands; there was no shadow of Mr Merdle’s complaint on young Sparkler hovering about the rooms, monomaniacally seeking any sufficiently ineligible young lady with no nonsense about her; there was no shadow of Mr Merdle’s complaint on the Barnacles and Stiltstalkings, of whom whole colonies were present; or on any of the company.
1	came down this morning, with a letter from my mother.’ As our looks met, I observed that he was pale even to his lips, though he looked very steadily at me.
1	Irishmen both, and sorely puzzled too, to find out what they seek.
1	‘We--we’re--all right.--I say, Wardle, we’re all right, ain’t we?’ ‘I should think so,’ replied the jolly host.--‘My dears, here’s my friend Mr. Jingle--Mr. Pickwick’s friend, Mr. Jingle, come ‘pon--little visit.’ ‘Is anything the matter with Mr. Snodgrass, Sir?’ inquired Emily, with great anxiety.
1	Is the poor creature much hurt?'
1	This unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted; especially as it was immediately followed up, by the assurance that the old gentleman referred to, would doubtless provide Oliver with a comfortable place, without loss of time.
1	Sam assisted him to rise.
1	Such as I am, I am genuine myself.
1	Sheets and towels, a little wearing apparel, two old-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a few boots.
1	‘Where is Miss Dombey?’ she asked the servant, aloud.
1	Agnes has arrived; has been among us for a whole day and an evening.
1	‘I shall have the pleasure, Carker,’ said Mr Dombey at length: making as if he swallowed something a little too large for his throat: ‘to present you to my--to the Major’s friends.
1	More unlikely things had come to pass.
1	We started in life this morning.’ ‘Well, Uncle,’ said the boy, ‘I’ll drink out of anything you like, so long as I can drink to you.
1	But one of them yet remained in the darkness before her; and while she tracked that one she must be right.
1	"I have not to learn from you, my dear Richard," said I, "of your letter.
1	So strangely did I hold my place in this world that until within a short time back I had never, to my own mother's knowledge, breathed--had been buried--had never been endowed with life--had never borne a name.
1	Always beside him and attached in all his fortunes?
1	He said it was indeed highly important to Society that one in the trying situation of unexpectedly finding himself invested with a power for good or for evil in Society, should become, as it were, merged in the superior power of a more legitimate and more gigantic growth, the influence of which (as in the case of our friend at whose board we sat) was habitually exercised in harmony with the best interests of Society.
1	But so it was; and stranger still--though this is a thing of every day--the warm young heart palpitated with a thousand anxieties and apprehensions, while that of the old worldly man lay rusting in its cell, beating only as a piece of cunning mechanism, and yielding no one throb of hope, or fear, or love, or care, for any living thing.
1	She made no effort at flattery or small talk, and directed all her efforts to looking as warm as she could.
1	you, who can so well!’ and clinging closer to her, with some broken fervent words of gratitude and endearment, Florence, relieved of her sad secret, wept long, but not as painfully as of yore, within the encircling arms of her new mother.
1	I believe I did Lizzie’s father wrong, but never Lizzie’s self; because when things were at the worst I trusted her, had perfect confidence in her, and tried to persuade her to come to me for a refuge.
1	'The child that was half-baptized Oliver Twist, is nine year old to-day.'
1	She was a little lofty with him; so was another old lady, dark-browed and high-nosed, and who must have had something real about her or she could not have existed, but it was certainly not her hair or her teeth or her figure or her complexion; so was a grey old gentleman of dignified and sullen appearance; both of whom had come to dinner.
1	But what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother to love a girl who has no relations, and who can never bother herself or anybody else about her family!” Herbert had told me on former occasions, and now reminded me, that he first knew Miss Clara Barley when she was completing her education at an establishment at Hammersmith, and that on her being recalled home to nurse her father, he and she had confided their affection to the motherly Mrs. Whimple, by whom it had been fostered and regulated with equal kindness and discretion, ever since.
1	I’ve had the gout.’ Newman was very, very far from having the appearance of a gouty subject, and so Kate could not help thinking; but the conference was cut short by Mrs. Nickleby’s insisting on having the door shut, lest Mr. Noggs should take cold, and further persisting in sending the servant girl for a coach, for fear he should bring on another attack of his disorder.
1	There were frowzy fields, and cow-houses, and dunghills, and dustheaps, and ditches, and gardens, and summer-houses, and carpet-beating grounds, at the very door of the Railway.
1	Rather large-boned, a little coarse in the grain, and freckled by the sun and wind which have tanned her hair upon the forehead, but healthy, wholesome, and bright-eyed.
1	The cell-door has been closed too long on all its hopes and cares.
1	I had kept the matter a profound secret, even from my wife; and this, too, I resolved to state in my letter.
1	Thus, was the sublime Snigsworth’s wrath averted, and thus did he snort no larger amount of moral grandeur at the Corinthian column in the print over the fireplace, than was normally in his (and the British) constitution.
1	Thus entreated, the two gentlemen (Mr. Weevle especially) put names to so many things that in course of time they find it difficult to put a name to anything quite distinctly, though they still relate to all new-comers some version of the night they have had of it, and of what they said, and what they thought, and what they saw.
1	I had a dim recollection of having seen her at the theatre, as if I had seen her in a pale magic lantern; but she appeared to remember me perfectly, and still to suspect me of being in a state of intoxication.
1	They sometimes slipped and floundered for a mile together, and we were obliged to come to a standstill to rest them.
1	But nothing could unsay the fact that he had returned, and was there in presence of the Judge and Jury.
1	‘I shouldn’t have thought it, I confess.’ They exchanged no further words, and there Nicholas stood, listening to the loud breathing of Newman Noggs, and imagining that his nose seemed to glow like a red-hot coal, even in the midst of the darkness which enshrouded them.
1	For these reasons Mr Boffin passed but anxious hours until evening came, and with it Mr Wegg, stumping leisurely to the Roman Empire.
1	But I am ill-used, I am ill-used, I am ill-used!’ Here the sobs and the tears, and the tearing hand, which had all been suspended together since the first surprise, went on together anew.
1	However, I come here some time since you left.” “I could have told you that, Orlick.” “Ah!” said he, dryly.
1	‘Did you think a foreign life, like mine, was good for good looks?
1	I replied, with all due deference to his experience (but with more deference, I am afraid, to his being Dora’s father), that perhaps it was a little nonsensical that the Registry of that Court, containing the original wills of all persons leaving effects within the immense province of Canterbury, for three whole centuries, should be an accidental building, never designed for the purpose, leased by the registrars for their Own private emolument, unsafe, not even ascertained to be fire-proof, choked with the important documents it held, and positively, from the roof to the basement, a mercenary speculation of the registrars, who took great fees from the public, and crammed the public’s wills away anyhow and anywhere, having no other object than to get rid of them cheaply.
1	That’s what _you_ did.’ ‘Well!’ said Clennam.
1	I hope she will give me time--a little time.
1	And he inflates his broad chest to its utmost extent as if to assure himself that he is not smothered yet.
1	This done, the draft of the proposed petition was read at length: and the petition said, as all petitions DO say, that the petitioners were very humble, and the petitioned very honourable, and the object very virtuous; therefore (said the petition) the bill ought to be passed into a law at once, to the everlasting honour and glory of that most honourable and glorious Commons of England in Parliament assembled.
1	I learned in a moment that my scarred face was all unchanged to him.
1	do you think there’s still a chance?’ inquired Dick, in surprise at this encouragement.
1	But tell me what it is that I shall do, Eugene!’ ‘I am going!
1	In a gloomy corner, where, for years, had stood a silent dusty pile of merchandise, sheltering its colony of mice, and frowning, a dull and lifeless mass, upon the panelled room, save when, responding to the roll of heavy waggons in the street without, it quaked with sturdy tremblings and caused the bright eyes of its tiny citizens to grow brighter still with fear, and struck them motionless, with attentive ear and palpitating heart, until the alarm had passed away--in this dark corner, was arranged, with scrupulous care, all Kate’s little finery for the day; each article of dress partaking of that indescribable air of jauntiness and individuality which empty garments--whether by association, or that they become moulded, as it were, to the owner’s form--will take, in eyes accustomed to, or picturing, the wearer’s smartness.
1	Dropsical it certainly is, for it will hold a dozen passengers inside.
1	To this, the child, conducting her conversation as upon the occasion of her first interview with Mr Swiveller, again replied, ‘Oh please will you leave a card or message?’ ‘I’ll write a note,’ said the dwarf, pushing past her into the office; ‘and mind your master has it directly he comes home.’  So Mr Quilp climbed up to the top of a tall stool to write the note, and the small servant, carefully tutored for such emergencies, looked on with her eyes wide open, ready, if he so much as abstracted a wafer, to rush into the street and give the alarm to the police.
1	‘Whatever step you take, sir,’ he said, in a voice inaudible beyond themselves, ‘I shall keep a strict account of.
1	‘Here he is at last!’ said old Mr. Wardle.
1	"Mrs. Blinder comes up now and then, and Mr. Gridley comes up sometimes, and perhaps I can run in sometimes, and they can play you know, and Tom an't afraid of being locked up, are you, Tom?"
1	I am only sorry that I cannot have the happiness of being their escort about Chesney Wold, which is a very fine place!
1	"I look forward a little while, and I don't know what great aid may come to me.
1	‘You know,’ said Miss Petowker, reproachfully, ‘that I dislike doing anything professional in private parties.’ ‘Oh, but not here!’ said Mrs. Kenwigs.
1	On the other hand, his meditations were of that fantastic order that it seemed hardly less libellous in him to imagine her grown a woman: to think of her as anything but the same artless, gentle, winning little creature, that she had been in the days of Good Mrs Brown.
1	The house was kept in a homely manner, and the condescension of Mr Blandois was infinite.
1	It was in one of the many small streets for which the favourite undertaker (who turned a handsome sum out of the one poor ghastly pomp of the neighbourhood) kept a black ladder, in order that those who had done their daily groping up and down the narrow stairs might slide out of this working world by the windows.
1	and all the gravestones in the churchyard--it was a large churchyard that they were in--looking on like ghosts in white, while the church tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant.
1	‘Because you won’t let me.
1	'On your business all night.'
1	Through all the spring and summertime, garlands of fresh flowers, wreathed by infant hands, rested on the stone; and, when the children came to change them lest they should wither and be pleasant to him no longer, their eyes filled with tears, and they spoke low and softly of their poor dead cousin.
1	The feelings of Mrs MacStinger, as a woman and a mother, were outraged by the look of pity for Alexander which she observed on Florence’s face.
1	He was exceedingly distrustful, as ignorance usually was, and he was always more or less under the influence of raw gin, of which he drank great quantities and of which he and his back-shop, as we might have observed, smelt strongly; but he did not think him mad as yet.
1	Restraining himself, however, just in time, by a great effort, he glided downstairs, hauling Smike behind him; and placing himself close to the parlour door, to confront the first person that might come out, signed to him to make off.
1	Mystery and disappointment are not absolutely indispensable to the growth of love, but they are, very often, its powerful auxiliaries.
1	“Estella, Estella, Estella, to be proud and hard to me!” Estella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder, but was not otherwise disturbed; when the moment was past, she looked down at the fire again.
1	‘Leading on has been mentioned,’ said Wegg with a melancholy air, ‘and it’s not easy to say how far the tone of my mind may have been lowered by unwholesome reading on the subject of Misers, when you was leading me and others on to think you one yourself, sir.
1	Don’t ask me what it is, because it may not come to anything.
1	‘God’s mercy on you, if you try by coming near me!’ she replied.
1	Still Mr. Winkle said nothing.
1	"I am very sorry, sir," said Bob.
1	I would so put that man down,’ said Tim, tapping the forefinger of his left hand emphatically with his spectacles, ‘so put that man down by argument--’ It was quite impossible to find language to express the degree of mental prostration to which such an adventurous wight would be reduced in the keen encounter with Tim Linkinwater, so Tim gave up the rest of his declaration in pure lack of words, and mounted his stool again.
1	The old gentleman pointed, with some surprise, to his card.
1	Men say, “This is a bad Greek, but there are good Greeks.
1	Do you remember that dance, my honest friend, which, in happier days, you practised with this sweet angel?
1	I have been adopted by an aunt down in that part of the country, and have just finished my education there.
1	“I am instructed to communicate to him,” said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his finger at me sideways, “that he will come into a handsome property.
1	I--I--am getting lost.’ ‘Tell him I am a match-maker; tell him I am an artful and designing woman; tell him you are sure his daughter is best out of my house and my company.
1	Then was heard a subdued footstep on the stairs; and Ralph Nickleby, hat in hand, crept softly into the room, with his body bent forward as if in profound respect, and his eyes fixed upon the face of his worthy client.
1	When Mr. Jarndyce doubted whether he might not already be too old to enter the Navy, Richard said he had thought of that, and perhaps he was.
1	'” I broke out crying and begging pardon, and hugged Joe round the neck: who dropped the poker to hug me, and to say, “Ever the best of friends; an't us, Pip?
1	I should almost think it too, Harriet, but for you.’ ‘Brother, don’t speak like this.
1	‘There is a deal of wickedness going about the world, a deal of wickedness.
1	Her eyes gleamed like fire as she confronted his mother, and broke into a frightful laugh.
1	As to Harlequin and Columbine, I discovered immediately that they lodged (they are always looking after lodgings in a pantomime) at a very small clockmaker’s one story high, near the hotel; which, in addition to various symbols and devices, almost covering the whole front, had a great dial hanging out—to be jumped through, of course.
1	It may be that it couldn’t be trampled upon if it wasn’t there.
1	I may add that I am well acquainted with our manufacturing towns in England, and have visited many mills in Manchester and elsewhere in the same manner.
1	I felt all mine suddenly going away, as I was climbing over it.'
1	Of course I merely joined Ada in saying that we had been greatly pleased with him.
1	He sent me a lithographed portrait of himself soon afterwards; very like, though scarcely handsome enough; which I have carefully preserved in memory of our brief acquaintance.
1	His boast that he had made me a gentleman, and that he had come to see me support the character on his ample resources, was made for me quite as much as for himself.
1	Kate clung closer to his arm, Smike retreated behind them, and John Browdie, who had heard of Ralph, and appeared to have no great difficulty in recognising him, stepped between the old man and his young friend, as if with the intention of preventing either of them from advancing a step further.
1	‘Tell me that I acted for the best.
1	‘I should wish mother to be got into my state.
1	In the civil court an action was trying, for damages sustained in some accident upon a railway.
1	Not that Trabb's boy was of a malignant nature, but that he had too much spare vivacity, and that it was in his constitution to want variety and excitement at anybody's expense.
1	She revered Mind, when launched, or, as I say, precipitated, on an extensive knowledge of the world.
1	The great drawing-room, which I have already mentioned, and the other chambers on the ground-floor, were crowded to excess.
1	Mr. Tulkinghorn, with some shadowy sign of amusement manifesting itself through his self-possession, stands on the hearth-rug with his back to the fire, watching the disappearance of Mr. Smallweed and acknowledging the trooper's parting salute with one slight nod.
1	Yet, even he returned to the public-house on each occasion with the tenacity of a confirmed drunkard.
1	Further down still, sits a man who is going some miles beyond their place of destination, to ‘improve’ a newly-discovered copper mine.
1	They'll all know what a clever fellow he was; he'll show it himself, and not disgrace his old pals and teachers.
1	‘Who said that?’ Of course the teacher who had not said it, indicated the rival who had, whom Miss Monflathers frowningly requested to hold her peace; by that means throwing the informing teacher into raptures of joy.
1	Miss Florence--put your feet on the fender to dry--how damp they are--here’s an adventure, Uncle, eh?--God bless my soul, how hot I am!’ Solomon Gills was quite as hot, by sympathy, and in excessive bewilderment.
1	When the evening closed in, he was always there, and that was her happiest time, for then she half believed that the old Walter of her childhood was not changed.
1	The chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire, scorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by the four fierce figures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke.
1	With regard to such men as the negro burglar and the English thief, even the most enthusiastic have scarcely any hope of their conversion.
1	"I hear the rain-drip on the stones," replies the young man, "and I hear a curious echo--I suppose an echo--which is very like a halting step."
1	I have engaged, on Perker’s representation, a housekeeper--a very old one--and such other servants as she thinks I shall require.
1	I’m not a man!” ‘“What are you then?” asked the baron.
1	“And yet when he went from here (I may say with my blessing), and I spread afore him my humble store, like the Bee, he was as plump as a Peach!” This reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner in which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity, saying, “May I?”  and the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the same fat five fingers.
1	Take it.’ With a disdainful scowl at the object of his anger, who met his eye but uttered not a word, Ralph walked away at his usual pace, without manifesting the slightest curiosity to see what became of his late companion, or indeed once looking behind him.
1	"What did they call the wretched being?"
1	‘He has done a great deal for me.
1	Taking the brewery on my way back, I raised the rusty latch of a little door at the garden end of it, and walked through.
1	A moment before, the boy’s eyes were sparkling with unwonted fire, and every feature had been lighted up with an excitement which made him appear, for the moment, quite a different being.
1	‘He has some objection, my dear,’ replied Mr. Crummles, looking at Nicholas.
1	‘True,’ says Mrs Veneering, ‘but the principle is the same.’ Boots is clear that the principle is the same.
1	There is no local Legislature in America which may not study Mr. Chadwick’s excellent Report upon the Sanitary Condition of our Labouring Classes, with immense advantage.
1	Hence, on three or four days that I can at once recall, we went our several ways after an early breakfast, and met again at a late dinner.
1	It’s well for you to have had so light a part in this business, when mine has been so heavy.
1	Go to your room, Amy, and make yourself look comfortable and pleasant to receive Mr Clennam.’ ‘I would rather stay in my own room, Father,’ returned Little Dorrit, finding it more difficult than before to regain her composure.
1	That shall be opened when Walter comes home again.’ ‘Well said!’ cried the Captain.
1	How have you been since?’ It was by no means apparent that Mr. Grewgious knew what he said, though it was very apparent that he meant to say something highly friendly and appreciative.
1	On the other hand, the noise of the loom, the forge, the carpenter’s hammer, or the stonemason’s saw, greatly favour those opportunities of intercourse—hurried and brief no doubt, but opportunities still—which these several kinds of work, by rendering it necessary for men to be employed very near to each other, and often side by side, without any barrier or partition between them, in their very nature present.
1	‘Then,’ said the old man, clenching his hands desperately, and looking upwards, ‘the child and I are lost!’ ‘Neighbour,’ said Quilp glancing sternly at him, and beating his hand twice or thrice upon the table to attract his wandering attention, ‘let me be plain with you, and play a fairer game than when you held all the cards, and I saw but the backs and nothing more.
1	Anyone who is the parent of a son is interesting to me.’ ‘Has Mrs Blimber any wish to see any remarkable person?’ asked Sir Barnet, courteously.
1	Something to drink?’ asked Steerforth.
1	Six days, seven days, far on into another week.
1	It is twenty-five minutes after its time this afternoon.
1	‘I am reading for the bar.
1	‘In what is that man assisting him, who never looks at me without an inscrutable falsehood in his eyes?
1	‘A baffler, Sir, a baffler, that’s all,’ returned Dick.
1	‘Miss Tox is a very good sort of person, I believe,’ replied Mr Dombey.
1	‘I tell’ee I ha’ gotten scent o’ thot already.
1	‘It is indifferent to me what he says or does.’ ‘Nay, Lavinia,’ quoth Mrs Wilfer, ‘this touches the blood of the family.
1	Don’t let me interrupt you, sir.’ ‘Then, you see, my good fellow,’ said the single gentleman, ‘that while we have no doubt whatever of the truth of this disclosure, which has so providentially come to light--’ ‘Meaning hers?’ said Dick, pointing towards the Marchioness.
1	Now think of it, Sydney.” “I'll think of it,” said Sydney.
1	‘Still, I am quite open to discussion.’ ‘But, my dear Ma, I cannot see how we are to discuss, if you take that line.’ ‘Blame Mr. Neville for it, Sept, and not me,’ said the old lady, with stately severity.
1	Nobody had come out at the gate with us, nobody went in at the gate with me.
1	‘Do you mean that I have not represented the case correctly?’ ‘Al-tro!’ returned John Baptist.
1	I mock you.” “My brave wife,” returned Defarge, standing before her with his head a little bent, and his hands clasped at his back, like a docile and attentive pupil before his catechist, “I do not question all this.
1	Mrs. Badger considers it too yellow.
1	‘I can tell you of what you have lost by my act, what I only can restore, and what, if I die without restoring, dies with me, and never can be regained.’ ‘I tell my money pretty accurately, and generally keep it in my own custody,’ said Ralph.
1	‘“Know you not, O stranger,” was the reply, “of the recent proclamation of our gracious king?” ‘“Proclamation!
1	Old ‘ooman at home sa:’ chuckling very much.
1	Was Mr Dombey pleased to see this?
1	How green the banks were now, how bright the flowers growing on them, and how tall the rushes!
1	"I take it, sir," says Mr. George, "that you know Miss Summerson pretty well?"
1	I am bound to confess that I cried; but I hope it was with pleasure, though I am not quite sure it was with pleasure.
1	Say the next day, and pass as much of tomorrow as you can with us!
1	Mute, close, irresponsive to any glancing light, his dress is like himself.
1	In one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting the raising of fees, and then Mr. Wemmick, backing as far as possible from the insufficient money produced, said, “it's no use, my boy.
1	The girl's life had been squandered in the streets, and among the most noisome of the stews and dens of London, but there was something of the woman's original nature left in her still; and when she heard a light step approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered, and thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another moment contain, she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame, and shrunk as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with whom she had sought this interview.
1	It’s a capital house for study.
1	Ah dear me, dear me!’ So tender were his lamentations, that the kindly Mr Boffin was quite sorry for him, and almost felt mistrustful that in buying the house he had done him an irreparable injury.
1	What's it about?” “_I_ don't know,” said the man.
1	‘Lord bless me!’ cried Mr. Grewgious.
1	The impression made upon me, however made, never left me.
1	"She exerts herself very much for Africa, sir," I said.
1	‘’Scuse the liberty, Sir,’ said Toodle, seeing he was not clearly remembered, ‘but my wife Polly, as was called Richards in your family--’ A change in Mr Dombey’s face, which seemed to express recollection of him, and so it did, but it expressed in a much stronger degree an angry sense of humiliation, stopped Mr Toodle short.
1	Say that again," cried Mr. Smallweed in a shrill, sharp voice.
1	To them which is in adversity, besides, your face is a cord’l.
1	nearly closed, with perhaps two shutters down, or one; but through those gaps such glimpses!
1	She would make him move his chair to her side of the fire, instead of sitting opposite; and there he would remain in a nook between Mrs Pipchin and the fender, with all the light of his little face absorbed into the black bombazeen drapery, studying every line and wrinkle of her countenance, and peering at the hard grey eye, until Mrs Pipchin was sometimes fain to shut it, on pretence of dozing.
1	Thomas and you, to whom the circle of the sciences is open; Thomas and you, who may be said to be replete with facts; Thomas and you, who have been trained to mathematical exactness; Thomas and you, here!’ cried Mr. Gradgrind.
1	No, good darling, I’ll never tell her!’ This helped Mr Dorrit to break his silence.
1	You won't find half so much fault in me if you think of me in my forge dress, with my hammer in my hand, or even my pipe.
1	It only shows how right I was.
1	You do remember them, I know.
1	‘And what does the boy say?’ said my aunt.
1	Well-conducted house, and highly respectable landlady.’ They replied that they would be happy to substitute a reality for the pretence, which, in the main, appeared to be as one with Mr Inspector’s meaning.
1	“My glance had fallen, but a few moments before, on the fragments of a broken sword, lying among the hay.
1	I’m with you directly, sir!
1	His utter disregard of other people, as shown in his way of tossing the little womanly toys of furniture about, flinging favourite cushions under his boots for a softer rest, and crushing delicate coverings with his big body and his great black head, had the same brute selfishness at the bottom of it.
1	This is the way young coves is spiled and drove wrong.
1	Flora, whom he had left a lily, had become a peony; but that was not much.
1	Everything was left, all right.
1	Great fortitude--great strength of mind.’ ‘They must have been very happy,’ said Blandois.
1	'We call it a put-up robbery, ladies,' said Blathers, turning to them, as if he pitied their ignorance, but had a contempt for the doctor's, 'when the servants is in it.'
1	"I beg your pardon, sir," he said to my guardian with a manly kind of diffidence, "but you did me the honour to mention the young lady's name--" "Miss Summerson."
1	‘Good bye, Sir,’ cried Brass faintly.
1	There was a most irritating end to every one of these debates.
1	‘What curious people you are!
1	“I know'd my name to be Magwitch, chrisen'd Abel.
1	With these treasures then, after her own daily lessons were over, Florence sat down at night to track Paul’s footsteps through the thorny ways of learning; and being possessed of a naturally quick and sound capacity, and taught by that most wonderful of masters, love, it was not long before she gained upon Paul’s heels, and caught and passed him.
1	I wanted to do it very quiet, but you wouldn’t let me.
1	I suppose this Halifax would have appeared an Elysium, though it had been a curiosity of ugly dulness.
1	‘You’re never to be trusted,’ screamed the woman; ‘you were out all day yesterday, and gallivanting somewhere I know.
1	'I can't keep her alive, can I?'
1	Mr. Weller reflected for a short time, and then, buttoning up his coat with great determination, said-- ‘I’ll keep a pike.’ ‘Wot!’ exclaimed Sam.
1	“You hit the nail on the head.
1	"I wear the chain I forged in life," replied the Ghost.
1	It was not a face in its first bloom; she was a woman five and thirty years of age.
1	As ill at ease as on the first night of his lying down to sleep within those dreary walls, he wore the night out with such thoughts.
1	'If _you_ please, sir,' returned Mr. Blathers.
1	What am I to say, indoors?
1	So let us say goodbye for the present, and--there, there--take care of that box, my dear sir--and--no, no, not a word now; but be careful of the crossings and--’ And with any disjointed and unconnected words which would prevent Nicholas from pouring forth his thanks, the brothers hurried him out: shaking hands with him all the way, and affecting very unsuccessfully--they were poor hands at deception!--to be wholly unconscious of the feelings that completely mastered him.
1	Mrs Gowan went to a door, looked in beyond it, and came back.
1	Then, he was alone with Sikes, plodding on as on the previous day; and as shadowy people passed them, he felt the robber's grasp upon his wrist.
1	'Only to show you my meaning clearly,' said the Jew, raising his eyebrows.
1	“Yes, go on.” “You anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how earnestly I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been laden.
1	I'll call up that poor lad, Brittles, and save him from being murdered in his bed; or his throat," I says, "may be cut from his right ear to his left, without his ever knowing it."'
1	‘Don’t you feel how naughty it is of you,’ resumed Miss Monflathers, ‘to be a wax-work child, when you might have the proud consciousness of assisting, to the extent of your infant powers, the manufactures of your country; of improving your mind by the constant contemplation of the steam-engine; and of earning a comfortable and independent subsistence of from two-and-ninepence to three shillings per week?
1	They had been engaged when they were both very young, I told him (a little indignantly) and when the prospect before them was much fairer and brighter.
1	Altogether, I am well off, when I tell my income on the fingers of my left hand, I pass the third finger and take in the fourth to the middle joint.
1	While he took his supper, Bella sat by him, sometimes admonishing him to hold his fork by the handle, like a polite child, and at other times carving for him, or pouring out his drink.
1	I’d open one of those doors, and I’d cram ‘em all in, and then I’d lock the door and through the keyhole I’d blow in pepper.’ ‘What would be the good of blowing in pepper?’ asked Charley Hexam.
1	And besides, again, most men are disappointed in life, somehow or other, and influenced by their disappointment.
1	For my own part, I looked on Mr. Jack Maldon as a modern Sindbad, and pictured him the bosom friend of all the Rajahs in the East, sitting under canopies, smoking curly golden pipes--a mile long, if they could be straightened out.
1	With a third call, more imperative than either of the two former, Nell felt obliged to comply, and this time a chorus was maintained not only by the two men together, but also by the third man on horseback, who being by his position debarred from a nearer participation in the revels of the night, roared when his companions roared, and rent the very air.
1	Mistrustful that it might be hazardous to Arthur to see him without preparation, Mr Meagles accepted the offer; and they were left shut up in the room, looking down through its barred window into the jail.
1	Lying still, after that, I found that she sat down near me, whispering to herself ‘Poor boy!’ And then it made me twenty times more wretched, to know how unselfishly mindful she was of me, and how selfishly mindful I was of myself.
1	He's got it buttoned in his breast.
1	They are partly American and partly Irish, and herd together on the lower deck; where they amused themselves last evening till the night was pretty far advanced, by alternately firing off pistols and singing hymns.
1	I am sure it was while I lay in that bed there, that the thought entered my head of turning the danger I had passed through, to the account of being for some time supposed to have disappeared mysteriously, and of proving Bella.
1	‘Yes, they were,’ replied the bagman; ‘very nice men indeed!’ Mr. Pickwick’s conscience had been somewhat reproaching him for his recent neglect of his friends at the Peacock; and he was just on the point of walking forth in quest of them, on the third morning after the election had terminated, when his faithful valet put into his hand a card, on which was engraved the following inscription:-- ‘Person’s a-waitin’,’ said Sam, epigrammatically.
1	I tell you, if I had stood by, tamely and passively, I should have hated myself, and merited the contempt of every man in existence.
1	But the time will come; and when, in their changed ashes, the growth of centuries unborn has struck its roots, the restless men of distant ages will repair to these again unpeopled solitudes; and their fellows, in cities far away, that slumber now, perhaps, beneath the rolling sea, will read in language strange to any ears in being now, but very old to them, of primeval forests where the axe was never heard, and where the jungled ground was never trodden by a human foot.
1	And she actually set off while we three stood looking at one another lost in amazement.
1	‘I have lived an adventurous life.
1	‘I appeal to his lordship.’ ‘I should decidedly say it was a mile,’ remarked Lord Frederick, with a solemn aspect.
1	It must be carried to the market-town: which is not more than four miles off, by the footpath across the field:  and thence dispatched, by an express on horseback, straight to Chertsey.
1	'Take this lantern,' said Sikes, looking into the room.
1	They formed my character, and filled me with an abhorrence of evil-doers.
1	‘A little too much, I think,’ Miss Bella reflected scornfully, ‘to have Pa’s lodger laying claim to me, and keeping eligible people off!
1	exclaimed the old gentleman, reddening.
1	Something seemed to pass into my place that was like the angel he thought me, and I felt so sorrowful for the loss he had sustained!
1	But he was deaf; and when the sexton (who peradventure, on a pinch, might have walked a mile with great difficulty in half-a-dozen hours) exchanged a remark with him about his work, the child could not help noticing that he did so with an impatient kind of pity for his infirmity, as if he were himself the strongest and heartiest man alive.
1	"How do you find them?
1	Here Arthur Clennam stopped to look about him for the domicile of Plornish, plasterer, whose name, according to the custom of Londoners, Daniel Doyce had never seen or heard of to that hour.
1	Indeed,’ said Clennam, glancing from the fair original to the picture and back, ‘I cannot even now say which is not your portrait.’ ‘D’ye hear that, Mother?’ cried Mr Meagles to his wife, who had followed her daughter.
1	‘You look much better.’ ‘Thanks to you, sir--great change--Majesty’s Fleet--unwholesome place-- very,’ said Jingle, shaking his head.
1	‘Thank you, Trotwood,’ returned Mr. Dick, laughing, and reaching across in high glee to shake hands with me.
1	"You don't expect anybody to believe this, about the lady and the sovereign, do you?"
1	Her admiration of her once stately patron is, and has been ever since the morning of her shock in Princess’s Place, platonic, but not weakened in the least.
1	You see I know her.’ Gride looked at him as if he were petrified with astonishment, but did not speak; perhaps lacking the power.
1	So the son, bringing to me the father’s rent (which I receive), imparted his secret, and pointed out that he was determined to pursue his genius, and that it would put him in peril of starvation, and that he was not formed for it.’ ‘For pursuing his genius, sir?’ ‘No, my dear,’ said Mr. Grewgious, ‘for starvation.
1	Look at our mother, think of her, recall her emotion when she recovered you.
1	No change, no degradation, no perversion of humanity, in any grade, through all the mysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and dread.
1	If I found out the nearest proper authorities, and offered myself to go for a soldier, or a sailor, I was such a little fellow that it was most likely they wouldn’t take me in.
1	Mama supposes that these are honourable men, rich and distinguished, and how CAN I--how can I undeceive her--when she is so happy in these little delusions, which are the only happiness she has?
1	No clue to how body came into river.
1	'It's all a lie together,' replied Fagin.
1	‘It cert’nly seems a queer start to send out pocket-’ankerchers to people as don’t know the use on ‘em,’ observed Sam.
1	‘Calm yourself.’ But she still repeated the same words, continually exclaiming, ‘Oh, the river!’ over and over again.
1	O sister-woman, think of me.
1	There has been more than enough of that extreme.
1	‘Shaken out of destiny’s dice-box again into your company, eh?
1	‘Now I am glad to know that!
1	It was by this time dark; I heard the clocks strike ten, as I sat resting.
1	He never could make out why everybody was not quite satisfied, and he felt conscious that he set a brilliant social example in being particularly well satisfied with most things, and, above all other things, with himself.
1	Or at all events, when the sun is down, and the weather is driving in from the sea?’ Helena thought not.
1	Theer’s been kiender a blessing fell upon us,’ said Mr. Peggotty, reverentially inclining his head, ‘and we’ve done nowt but prosper.
1	‘It will serve you as much as bringing it to me, I promise you.
1	He did not laugh himself out of the intention, however, for on he went: picturing to himself, as he approached the place, all kinds of splendid possibilities, and impossibilities too, for that matter, and thinking himself, perhaps with good reason, very fortunate to be endowed with so buoyant and sanguine a temperament.
1	‘You know—and Mr. Grewgious should now know likewise—that I took a great prepossession against Mr. Neville Landless, arising out of his furious conduct on that first occasion.
1	"No, thank you," said I.
1	"In short, my valued friend," pursued Miss Flite, advancing her lips to my ear with an air of equal patronage and mystery, "I must tell you a secret.
1	You may trust in me--I know it and I say it, dear,--with the whole confidence even of your pure heart.
1	‘I have noticed you go past our house, sir, several times in the course of the last week or so.’ ‘Our house,’ repeated the other.
1	says Chickweed, "I've lost him again!"
1	Forbid as I, of all men, should do that, my girl!
1	Those abject wretches--’ ‘Don’t call names, Rokesmith,’ said Mr Boffin.
1	But he never says a word of the true reason of his restlessness, to her, and she finds it best not to hint at it to him.
1	Look in the fire, as I like to hear you tell how you used to do when you lived in that dreary old house that had once been a windmill.
1	We are, Sir, Your obedient servants, Dodson & Fogg.
1	He advanced towards it trembling.
1	When the Sessions came round, Mr. Jaggers caused an application to be made for the postponement of his trial until the following Sessions.
1	I was much disconcerted, but I reflected that if the main point were gained, it mattered little how strangely he perverted everything leading to it.
1	‘I will indeed, upon my soul and body.’ ‘And then,’ said Mrs Brown, with her arms uplifted towards the sky, and her head thrown back and shaking, ‘if he’s true to his word, I’ll never come a-near him though I know where he is, and never breathe a syllable about him!
1	They’ve not doon me a kindness, ma’am, as I know and feel.
1	When he has helped himself, Phil follows suit, sitting at the extreme end of the little oblong table and taking his plate on his knees.
1	But of the loved, revered, and honoured head, thou canst not turn one hair to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious.
1	Fagin raised his right hand, and shook his trembling forefinger in the air; but his passion was so great, that the power of speech was for the moment gone.
1	And as aëronauts make themselves heavier when they wish to descend, similarly Durdles charges himself with more liquid from the wicker bottle, that he may come down the better.
1	‘Suppose I so repeated it to Mr Boffin, as to insinuate that my sensitive delicacy and honour--’ ‘Very good words, Sophronia.’ ‘--As to insinuate that OUR sensitive delicacy and honour,’ she resumed, with a bitter stress upon the phrase, ‘would not allow us to be silent parties to so mercenary and designing a speculation on the Secretary’s part, and so gross a breach of faith towards his confiding employer.
1	‘Take my advice,’ said Codlin: ‘don’t ask me why, but take it.
1	Walks sometimes for two hours when she has them bad.
1	Oh, Walter, if I could have brought you millions, I never could have been so happy for your sake, as I am!’ ‘And you, dear Florence?
1	Then she saw him dead, upon that very bed, and in that very room, and knew that he had never loved her to the last, and fell upon his cold breast, passionately weeping.
1	‘Let me speak a word with you in private,’ said Mr. Lillyvick.
1	After combating, for nearly a week, the feeling which impelled me to revisit the place I had quitted under the circumstances already detailed, I yielded to it at length; and determining that this time I would present myself by the light of day, bent my steps thither early in the morning.
1	The latter ceremony, however little importance the unconscious Captain attached to it, was not wholly superfluous; for, on the previous day, so much excitement had been occasioned in the neighbourhood, by the shutters remaining unopened, that the Instrument-maker’s house had been honoured with an unusual share of public observation, and had been intently stared at from the opposite side of the way, by groups of hungry gazers, at any time between sunrise and sunset.
1	You liked me, didn’t you?
1	Although I am very well off,’ said Mr Toots, with energy, ‘you can’t think what a miserable Beast I am.
1	"I only want to rouse him.
1	Scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place, and by a loud cry which followed it, Oliver let his lantern fall, and knew not whether to advance or fly.
1	That I had a fever and was avoided, that I suffered greatly, that I often lost my reason, that the time seemed interminable, that I confounded impossible existences with my own identity; that I was a brick in the house-wall, and yet entreating to be released from the giddy place where the builders had set me; that I was a steel beam of a vast engine, clashing and whirling over a gulf, and yet that I implored in my own person to have the engine stopped, and my part in it hammered off; that I passed through these phases of disease, I know of my own remembrance, and did in some sort know at the time.
1	'Burn my body, if he isn't more trouble than a whole family of Dodgers.
1	‘You are too considerate.’ ‘Not at all, I thank you,’ answered Mr. Grewgious again.
1	One, the cleverest and most celebrated among them, took me aside, and bidding me prepare for the worst, told me--me, the madman!--that my wife was mad.
1	'” “But I do, and you must take my word for it.
1	Open the door, beautiful Mrs Flintwinch, and in the meantime let me to pass upstairs, to present my compliments--homage of Blandois--to my lady!
1	She has devoted herself to an extensive variety of public subjects at various times and is at present (until something else attracts her) devoted to the subject of Africa, with a view to the general cultivation of the coffee berry--AND the natives--and the happy settlement, on the banks of the African rivers, of our superabundant home population.
1	The parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities, whether there was no female then domiciled in 'the house' who was in a situation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation and nourishment of which he stood in need.
1	Frank chooses as we would have HIM choose.
1	At length, during a moment of comparative silence, the little man called out in a very loud, solemn voice,-- ‘Mr.
1	"Quite an adventure for a morning in London!"
1	‘They were really gone.’ ‘Does he know where to find that lady?’ ‘Can’t say.
1	Whether they would tread in the blood when it crept so far, and carry it about the house among those many prints of feet, or even out into the street.
1	‘Now, Missis,’ said he; ‘where did you come from and where are you going to?’ The poor soul confusedly asked the counter-question where she was?
1	‘Do you know Miss Dorrit?’ asked the new client.
1	Then, he thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffold--and stopped to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool it--and then went on to think again.
1	As he expressed himself to this effect, with assumed carelessness, he took a step or two nearer the concealed spy, as the latter could tell from the distinctness with which he heard him mutter, 'It must be he!'
1	It so happened that Mr. Winkle, senior, instead of being deeply engaged in reading the letter, as Mr. Bob Sawyer thought, chanced to be looking over the top of it at no less a person than Mr. Bob Sawyer himself; rightly conjecturing that the face aforesaid was made in ridicule and derision of his own person, he fixed his eyes on Bob with such expressive sternness, that the late Mr. Grimaldi’s lineaments gradually resolved themselves into a very fine expression of humility and confusion.
1	It being market morning at a neighboring town some ten miles off, Mr. Pumblechook was not at home.
1	My guardian had gone out to inquire about him and did not return to dinner.
1	So like Mr. Grannett, wasn't it?'
1	The Spirit, stronger yet, repulsed him.
1	I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master-passion, Gain, engrosses you.
1	You muthn’t mind your thon having a comic livery on.’ They all three went in; and Mr. Gradgrind sat down forlorn, on the Clown’s performing chair in the middle of the ring.
1	There was not the smallest speculation, however, in the countenance of Newman Noggs.
1	"It comes from other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers, to other kinds of men.
1	Ralph again gazed at him: as it seemed mechanically.
1	She might go a-berryin ME."
1	The landlord of the house had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes, and Barney had only just returned from making the communication above related, when Fagin, in the course of his evening's business, came into the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils.
1	If you must go flopping yourself down, flop in favour of your husband and child, and not in opposition to 'em.
1	Night and day the conquering engines rumbled at their distant work, or, advancing smoothly to their journey’s end, and gliding like tame dragons into the allotted corners grooved out to the inch for their reception, stood bubbling and trembling there, making the walls quake, as if they were dilating with the secret knowledge of great powers yet unsuspected in them, and strong purposes not yet achieved.
1	Has anything taken place, Mr. Jackson?’ said Mrs. Bardell eagerly.
1	My husband was a Powler.’ ‘Beg your pardon, really!’ said the stranger.
1	Steerforth himself confirmed this when it was stated, and said that he should like to begin to see him do it.
1	Florence readily consenting, Lady Skettles ordered out young Barnet as a matter of course.
1	‘Glubb,’ said Mrs Blimber, with a great disrelish.
1	Very good indeed, my dear!'
1	That when Miss Murdstone took her into custody and led her away, she smiled and gave me her delicious hand.
1	‘I am sure,’ said Uriah, writhing himself into the silence like a Conger-eel, ‘that this is a subject full of unpleasantness to everybody.
1	Though I do know better, Tom, and am very sorry for it.’  She came and kissed him, and went back into her corner again.
1	So poor a clerk, though having a limited salary and an unlimited family, that he had never yet attained the modest object of his ambition: which was, to wear a complete new suit of clothes, hat and boots included, at one time.
1	‘Well then; there is,’ said Lammle; ‘there IS something wrong; the whole thing’s wrong.’ ‘I say!’ remonstrated Fascination very slowly, and sitting down with his hands on his knees to stare at his glowering friend with his back to the fire.
1	He said it was like those times, to be alone with Agnes and me again; and he wished to Heaven they had never changed.
1	‘Do you see anything particular, Mr. Noggs?’ said Arthur, trying to follow the direction of Newman’s eyes--which was an impossibility, and a thing no man had ever done.
1	‘Your most obedient, Sir,’ said the Major.
1	'I would not alarm you if I could avoid it,' rejoined Rose; 'but indeed I have tried very hard, and cannot help this.
1	He soon returned, out of breath, to say that Mr Dombey was not there.
1	They are of about the period of the Nuns’ House, irregularly modernised here and there, as steadily deteriorating generations found, more and more, that they preferred air and light to Fever and the Plague.
1	Tip had turned his liberty to hopeful account by becoming a billiard-marker.
1	Rightly judging that under such circumstances it would be madness to follow, he turned down a bye-street in search of the nearest coach-stand, finding after a minute or two that he was reeling like a drunken man, and aware for the first time of a stream of blood that was trickling down his face and breast.
1	Come fresh up to the lessons, I advise you, for I come fresh up to the punishment.
1	Herbert received me with open arms, and I had never felt before so blessedly what it is to have a friend.
1	‘She may have drowned herself, miss,’ returned Mr. Littimer, catching at an excuse for addressing himself to somebody.
1	Many wonderful things did he see and hear, and much irreconcilable moral contradiction did he pass his life among; yet his equality of compassion was no more disturbed than the Divine Master’s of all healing was.
1	But Sawyers was not to be of the party that night; for, before Wegg had found his place, Mrs Boffin’s tread was heard upon the stairs, so unusually heavy and hurried, that Mr Boffin would have started up at the sound, anticipating some occurrence much out of the common course, even though she had not also called to him in an agitated tone.
1	Phil intimates by sidling back a pace or two, with a very unaccountable wrench of his wry face, that he does not regard the transaction as being made more promising by this incident.
1	He has no sleep or rest, but that which he takes by day in his easy chair; for every night and nearly all night long he is away from home.’ ‘Nelly!’ ‘Hush!’ said the child, laying her finger on her lip and looking round.
1	Touchingly and awfully drawn together, he and the little mad woman were side by side and, as it were, alone.
1	'A woman,' replied the gentleman.
1	We are never asunder now; we never shall be’ any more.
1	That time has had its influence on all his later life.
1	‘I don’t think I ever saw such a stiff hand.’ ‘Not like a lady’s hand, is it?’ said Traddles.
1	As there was no getting into this place, and nothing was to be done but walk up and down, and look at it and the other buildings in the village (which were chiefly of wood, painted a dark red like English barns, and composed of many stories like English factories), I have nothing to communicate to the reader, beyond the scanty results I gleaned the while our purchases were making.
1	Then I heard that you were here.
1	Little Dorrit was in front with her brother and Mrs General (Mr Dorrit had remained at home), but on the brink of the quay they all came together.
1	Mrs Boffin (of whose physiognomy I can never speak with the composure I would desire to preserve), and your mother, are not on terms of intimacy.
1	I saw too, and had experienced in this very interview, the sense of my guardian's remark that it was even more mischievous to use persuasion with him than to leave him as he was.
1	I say, stop there.” “See you then, Jacques,” said Madame Defarge, wrathfully; “and see you, too, my little Vengeance; see you both!
1	We both replied together, ‘Yes!’ She lifted up her eyes, and solemnly declared that she would devote herself to this task, fervently and faithfully.
1	‘What are those now, Miss Dorrit?’ ‘Handkerchiefs.’ ‘Are they, though!’ said Pancks.
1	This feat accomplished he drew himself together in his former position, and laughed excessively.
1	‘How much better to take him into favour again, than to hurt yourself by going on in that way.
1	‘Good-bye,’ rejoined the pretty housemaid, turning her head away.
1	‘Oh, no, he shall not,’ rejoined Frank.
1	They fancied, too, a lonely air about him and his house, but perhaps that was because the other people formed a merry company upon the green, and he seemed the only solitary man in all the place.
1	There is a general redness in the faces of the ladies; in the face of Mrs Perch particularly, who is joyous and beaming, and lifted so far above the cares of life, that if she were asked just now to direct a wayfarer to Ball’s Pond, where her own cares lodge, she would have some difficulty in recalling the way.
1	Misses Brow--Brow--!’ The young woman, however, equally unmoved by his direct appeal to her, and by his inarticulate utterance, remained quite neutral, until, after struggling with his assailant into a corner, Rob disengaged himself, and stood there panting and fenced in by his own elbows, while the old woman, panting too, and stamping with rage and eagerness, appeared to be collecting her energies for another swoop upon him.
1	'Because, my pretty cross-examiner,' replied the doctor: 'because, viewed with their eyes, there are many ugly points about it; he can only prove the parts that look ill, and none of those that look well.
1	That if they knew what we were going to do, they would say that you were mad, and part us?’ The old man turned to her with an aspect of wild terror; but she checked him by a look, and bidding him hold some flowers while she tied them up, and so bringing her lips closer to his ear, said-- ‘I know that was what you told me.
1	Think of me at my best, if circumstances should ever part us!’ ‘You have no best to me, Steerforth,’ said I, ‘and no worst.
1	There is meat and drink there at all events.’ ‘Salt meat and new rum; pease-pudding and chaff-biscuits,’ said the manager, taking a whiff at his pipe to keep it alight, and returning to his work of embellishment.
1	He had moved to the door, when he added: ‘Gentlemen, I have shown you my heart.
1	‘Wery pretty.’ ‘I hope it may do you good, Samuel,’ said Mrs. Weller solemnly.
1	By degrees the insupportable solitude and barrenness of the place rouses him from this stupor, and when the trap in his grated door is opened, he humbly begs and prays for work.
1	"There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare say," returned the nephew.
1	As for him, he methodically discusses his matter of business as if she were any insensible instrument used in business.
1	'Don't make your eyes red, Oliver, but eat your food and be thankful,' said Mr. Bumble, in a tone of impressive pomposity.
1	We will refer that question, if you please, to Mr. Micawber.’ ‘Ury--!’ Mrs. Heep began, with an anxious gesture.
1	They traversed the streets in profound silence; and after walking at a round pace for some distance, arrived in one, of a gloomy appearance and very little frequented, near the Edgeware Road.
1	‘Why, Betsy,’ said the old woman, ‘you haven’t been--you don’t mean to say you’ve been a--’ ‘Sitting up all night?’ said Quilp, supplying the conclusion of the sentence.
1	Everything looked wan at that hour.
1	‘And what steps, sir, do you mean to take to obtain redress?’ inquired Mr. Winkle, gaining courage as he saw Pott losing it.
1	The ancient tower of a church, whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there.
1	“There is nothing more to do,” said he, glancing upward at the moon, “until to-morrow.
1	She had a great aunt living in these very times called Lady Scadgers.
1	Don’t ask me nothing about ‘em, Arthur.
1	So, felons were not lodged and fed better than soldiers (to say nothing of paupers), and seldom set fire to their prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavor of their soup.
1	They walked leisurely arm-in-arm down one side of the street, and returned on the opposite side.
1	It lay in a nutshell.
1	‘You wouldn’t believe, sir, that I feel serious now?
1	And either the Roman has some new meaning in him, not expressed before, or the foremost of them goes wild, for looking up at his outstretched hand and looking down at what is below it, that person shrieks and flies.
1	For what says the Captain, if I quote him correctly--and if not,’ with a light-comedy touch of his double eye-glass on his companion’s shoulder, ‘my learned friend will set me right:      “Since laws were made for every degree,      To curb vice in others as well as in me,      I wonder we ha’n’t better company      Upon Tyburn Tree!”’ These words brought them to the drawing-room, where Mr Merdle stood before the fire.
1	‘Wery good, my dear,’ replied Sam.
1	I have known it do as bad deeds, and worse, many a time.
1	He put her hand to his lips, and she quietly drew it away.
1	She can’t live by herself, you know.’ ‘Oh, bless you!’ said Peggotty, looking at me again at last.
1	He was twice her age.
1	‘For Heaven’s sake be careful!
1	And yet she was the innocent cause of all this torture, and he, gambling with such a savage thirst for gain as the most insatiable gambler never felt, had not one selfish thought!
1	said Mr. Jarndyce, giving his head a great rub and stopping short.
1	Now, you shall see me walk back by myself.” “Which do not overdo it, Pip,” said Joe; “but I shall be happy fur to see you able, sir.” The last word grated on me; but how could I remonstrate!
1	Is it to be wondered at if my thoughts were dazed, as my eyes were, when I came out into the natural light from the misty yellow rooms?
1	Rumour finally settled the number at two; the foreigner and Mr Flintwinch.
1	Its signature remains the same.’ And again he said ‘Dombey and Son,’ in exactly the same tone as before.
1	Grandfather Smallweed refers to Phil with a glance of considerable terror and a half-subdued "O Lord!
1	He was obliged to pass very near Sam, however, and the scrutinising glance of that gentleman enabled him to detect, under all these appalling twists of feature, something too like the small eyes of Mr. Job Trotter to be easily mistaken.
1	'You've had a long walk, you know, or I wouldn't mention it.
1	Now, let me go.’ He yielded to her imperious but elated look, and turned her chair back to the place from which he had wheeled it.
1	At the paper-mill.’ ‘Where is it?’ ‘Your face is turned up to the sky, and you can’t see it.
1	But, by good fortune the greenhouse was not far off, and these words brought us to it.
1	He had been bilious, but rich men were often bilious, and therefore he had been persuading himself that he was a man of property.
1	inquired the man, as he followed him out to the landing.
1	‘He hadn’t any money, had he?’ ‘Never had a penny of his own in his whole life, that I know of,’ replied Squeers.
1	Though the disappearance should be accounted for to-morrow, the fact that his mother had been in communication with such a man, would remain unalterable.
1	I know’d in my mind, as he’d have told her wonders of ‘em, and how she was to be a lady theer, and how he got her to listen to him fust, along o’ sech like.
1	‘Elope!’ exclaimed Miss Tomkins, the three teachers, the thirty boarders, and the five servants.
1	‘He had a son with him, hadn’t he?’ ‘No.
1	I advise no man to interfere in proceedings that I choose to take.
1	“Well, then,” said Joe, “It's more than twenty pound.” That abject hypocrite, Pumblechook, nodded again, and said, with a patronizing laugh, “It's more than that, Mum.
1	Whether it had been born alive, or the poor mother's shock had killed it.
1	I was pretty sure of it.’ ‘Flintwinch!’ said the mother, ‘look at my son.
1	They looked as jolly and good-humoured as ever; and, working (here) the hardest for their living and doing any kind of sturdy labour that came in their way, were the most independent fellows there, I thought.
1	When I looked back at Joe in the long passage, he was still weighing his hat with the greatest care, and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of his toes.
1	I asked her how she could answer for what I meant?
1	Everything being hollow and worthless, she had missed nothing and sacrificed nothing.
1	We’ll go to Brighton by the afternoon’s coach.’ If the application must be made to Mr Dombey at all, which was awful to think of, Walter felt that he would rather prefer it alone and unassisted, than backed by the personal influence of Captain Cuttle, to which he hardly thought Mr Dombey would attach much weight.
1	That it makes the senses dull, and by degrees impairs the bodily faculties, I am quite sure.
1	And God only knows how good them mothers was to me!’ It was Martha at the door.
1	The old man shakes his head with sharp sly triumph.
1	Of tolling slowly up a hill, and feeling on its top the fresh sea-breeze; and seeing the morning light upon the edges of the distant waves.
1	Is there nothing to redeem him?
1	It may be that I am a good deal looked up to, in my profession--it may be that I am not.
1	Flora, however, received the remark as if it had been of a most apposite and agreeable nature; approvingly observing aloud that Mr F.’s Aunt had a great deal of spirit.
1	Philosophical philanthropy teaches--’ The rest of the little knot about the stove murmured an objection to the introduction of that threatening expression.
1	At first little Em’ly didn’t like to come, and then Ham went.
1	‘He did not,’ replied Nicholas; ‘I am very glad he did not, for it would then have been my duty to have warned you in time.’ ‘Which no doubt you would have been devilish sorry to do,’ said Squeers in a taunting fashion.
1	‘Everything, my dear Sir,’ was the little man’s reply.
1	I should get the sack, I s’pose--eh?’ At this humorous notion, all the clerks laughed in concert.
1	Ham, dear, try to help me!
1	Why do I do myself the injustice of calling myself a girl?
1	Nor was it without regret that I came home, without having found an opportunity of returning thither, and once more shaking hands with the friends I made that day.
1	"I can never forget it," said Richard.
1	It consisted of a brown body-coat with a great many brass buttons up the front and only one behind, a bright check neckerchief, a plaid waistcoat, soiled white trousers, and a very limp hat, worn with the wrong side foremost, to hide a hole in the brim.
1	It was not until the twilight that Captain Cuttle, fairly dropping anchor, at last, by the side of Florence, began to talk at all connectedly.
1	Finding Peggotty within, and being informed by Peggotty (who always volunteered that information to whomsoever would receive it), that she was my old nurse, he had established a good-humoured acquaintance with her, and had stayed to have a little chat with her about me.
1	You will not go yet.
1	You little thought,” said Mr. Pumblechook, apostrophizing the fowl in the dish, “when you was a young fledgling, what was in store for you.
1	It is not HIS fault."
1	One Saturday afternoon, at dusk, great consternation was occasioned in the Castle by the unlooked-for announcement of Mr Dombey as a visitor to Mrs Pipchin.
1	"If it wasn't that we had been intimate when you stopped at our house," pursued Miss Jellyby, "I should have been ashamed to come here to-day, for I know what a figure I must seem to you two.
1	‘To speak to you of the worth of any sacrifice that you can make now--above all, of any sacrifice of mere money--would be idle and presumptuous.
1	And we have no other place of abode.
1	Here are The Tombs once more.
1	“I do not wish,” she writes in her own handwriting, “to regard myself, nor yet to be regarded, in that boney light”.’ Mr Venus pours himself out more tea, with a look and in an attitude of the deepest desolation.
1	When I left the village, Monday evening as the sun was going to bed, and looked back from the hill, the shadow struck across the church, across the mill, across the prison--seemed to strike across the earth, messieurs, to where the sky rests upon it!” The hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other three, and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him.
1	Such were my words, mother, when I passed this in review before me: 'You have made your bed.
1	Now you know what analysis is, Dombey.’ Dombey didn’t seem to be absolutely blinded by the light let in upon his intellect, but he made Miss Blimber a little bow.
1	When he at last glided out of the dark doorway corner in which he had been compelled to halt, he caught a glimpse of the twins stealthily peeping in at one corner of the glass case, evidently undecided whether they should follow up their late attack without delay, or for the present postpone laying further siege to the inflexible Tim Linkinwater.
1	Make the rain pour down, outside, in torrents.
1	which the old girl follows up with a nod at everybody in succession and a well-regulated swig of the mixture.
1	Bless me, my man should have come in a minute; and so would I; and my assistant would have been delighted; or anybody, I'm sure, under such circumstances.
1	Gargery is your master now.
1	Sermuchser that when he was took to church the gen’lm’n said, it wam’t a chris’en one, and he couldn’t give it.
1	‘That is--yes--oh, yes--certainly.’ ‘You have never known anything in his behaviour towards Mrs. Bardell, or any other female, in the least degree suspicious?’ said Mr. Phunky, preparing to sit down; for Serjeant Snubbin was winking at him.
1	"Had no need to ask, after even my slight experience of Miss Summerson's forethought for every one about her."
1	‘And as the wife of Alfred, may I, dear Mr Fledgeby, wholly without his authority or knowledge, as I am sure your discernment will perceive, entreat you to continue that great service, and once more use your well-earned influence with Mr Riah for a little more indulgence?
1	I asked him where he meant to go?
1	Believe no other good of me,    for I am innocent of nothing else that you have heard,    or will hear, laid to my charge.
1	That he well deserved one, yes.
1	Do you ever think of the home you have laid waste?’ ‘Oh, is there ever night or day, when I don’t think of it!’ cried Emily; and now I could just see her, on her knees, with her head thrown back, her pale face looking upward, her hands wildly clasped and held out, and her hair streaming about her.
1	There he is, no doubt, in his impossible attitude, pointing, unavailingly, all night long.
1	They always received a reference of this kind with a low murmur of response, as if it were convincing; and the Defaulter, however black and discomfited before, always cheered up a little in making it.
1	Just then there appeared from a side-door old Mr. Turveydrop, in the full lustre of his deportment.
1	"Middling," replies Mr. George, taking a chair.
1	Mr. Tulkinghorn is not in a common way.
1	I was happier than ever when the party broke up, and the other people, defeated Red Whisker and all, went their several ways, and we went ours through the still evening and the dying light, with sweet scents rising up around us.
1	He was dressed for the pantomimes in all the absurdity of a clown’s costume.
1	He had looked in at Solomon’s shop sometimes, to ask a question about articles in Solomon’s way of business; and Walter knew him sufficiently to give him good day when they met in the street.
1	When he heard the step behind him, he turned round--for he was walking away in the dark.
1	‘This is a joyful occasion indeed, extremely joyful.
1	He called himself for the plaintiff, there was no getting over his evidence, the counsel for the defendant threw up his brief, and the jury did not even turn to consider.
1	But dear me, I beg your pardon, you're holding the fruit all this time.
1	Mr. Bucket answers, "Not exactly."
1	Herbert had come in, and we held a very serious council by the fire.
1	‘The lady of the house, my dear,’ returned the Captain, in a gruff whisper, and making signals of secrecy.
1	His breathing was a little quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation.
1	The gentleman with the gun-barrel, considering it, on inspection, in a satisfactory state, referred it to the other; receiving confirmation of his views, he fitted it into its place in the case before him, and took out the stock and polished that, softly whistling.
1	I have known such energy as yours do great things before now--though never,” he added, with a smile and a sigh together, “such great things as this.
1	‘I have had a very fatiguing journey, and should be most indifferent company--a far greater check upon your merriment, than a promoter of it, even if I kept awake, which I think very doubtful.
1	That were your observation when I broke it off, Pip?” “Yes, Joe.” “Well,” said Joe, passing the poker in to his left hand, that he might feel his whisker; and I had no hope of him whenever he took to that placid occupation; “your sister's a master-mind.
1	This was all very pleasant and ingenious, but the system of forcing was attended with its usual disadvantages.
1	On Nicholas stopping to salute them, Mr. Lenville laughed a scornful laugh, and made some general remark touching the natural history of puppies.
1	The pretext is none of mine; it’s hers, and she shall have enough of it.’ In the triumphant exaltation of her feelings, Miss Fanny, using her Spanish fan with one hand, squeezed her sister’s waist with the other, as if she were crushing Mrs Merdle.
1	‘What do you mean by that, Sir?’ said Mr. Tuckle, with great asperity.
1	Even to this hour, Mrs. Rouncewell's calm hands lose their composure when she speaks of him, and unfolding themselves from her stomacher, hover about her in an agitated manner as she says what a likely lad, what a fine lad, what a gay, good-humoured, clever lad he was!
1	“No,”  returned Wemmick, “but I like to walk with one.” I thought this odd; however, I said nothing, and we set off.
1	‘That young Pitcher’s had a fever.’ ‘No!’ exclaimed Squeers.
1	‘I begin to be afraid he’s going at the knees.’ ‘That’s a bad look-out,’ said Short.
1	Reflects Podsnap; prosperously feeding, two little light-coloured wiry wings, one on either side of his else bald head, looking as like his hairbrushes as his hair, dissolving view of red beads on his forehead, large allowance of crumpled shirt-collar up behind.
1	‘Where is there one of my size, you dog?’ returned Quilp.
1	I was not the man to touch the Commons, and bring down the country.
1	‘Clara, my dear,’ he said, when I had done his bidding, and he walked me into the parlour, with his hand still on my arm; ‘you will not be made uncomfortable any more, I hope.
1	‘You can go up to Mr Fledgeby as soon as you like,’ said the lady, moving haughtily away.
1	Of our kneeling down together, side by side; of Dora’s trembling less and less, but always clasping Agnes by the hand; of the service being got through, quietly and gravely; of our all looking at each other in an April state of smiles and tears, when it is over; of my young wife being hysterical in the vestry, and crying for her poor papa, her dear papa.
1	Up one minute and down the next; now in spirits and now in despondency!” “Ah!” returned the other, sighing: “yes!
1	"Well, Sir Leicester Dedlock," proceeds Mr. Bucket, "this intemperate foreigner also angrily took it into her head that she had established a claim upon Mr. Tulkinghorn, deceased, by attending on the occasion I told you of at his chambers, though she was liberally paid for her time and trouble."
1	At this remark the face of Mr Dorrit gloomed considerably.
1	He trembled very much though; for, even in his terror, Oliver could see that the knife quivered in the air.
1	‘Yes,’ replied Mr. Muzzle, ‘we tried ‘em at our table when they first come, but we couldn’t keep ‘em.
1	But, a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this.
1	The tobacco business round the corner of Horsemonger Lane was carried out in a rural establishment one story high, which had the benefit of the air from the yards of Horsemonger Lane jail, and the advantage of a retired walk under the wall of that pleasant establishment.
1	‘Do you think he had planned this robbery, when he went with you to the lodging?’ ‘I fear so, father.
1	I am neither; I am wretched.
1	Which there's not a man alive more ready to do, for you're a man of urbanity and suavity, you know, and you've got the sort of heart that can feel for another.
1	Not till we give you leave.
1	The people stand out of the way to let her go by.
1	Those who cannot be enlightened by reason, can only be controlled by force; and this, coupled with her great privations, must soon have reduced her to a worse condition than that of the beasts that perish, but for timely and unhoped-for aid.
1	Size, price, quality, were of no account.
1	Damme, you couldn’t treat me with less respect if I was veneered.” When the old gentleman said this, he looked so fierce that Tom began to grow frightened.
1	You are not Mr Merdle, any more than I am.’ ‘No, sir,’ the Defaulter would reply.
1	With this, he retired; and he had not retired two minutes, when he returned with Mr. Squeers and his hopeful son.
1	I want him, when he comes home, to find no trouble in my face.
1	It appears to the afflicted Mr. Guppy and his inconsolable friend that there is no end to the Dedlocks, whose family greatness seems to consist in their never having done anything to distinguish themselves for seven hundred years.
1	I wish to be honourable and true, so far as in my humble way I can, and I would scorn to pretend for a moment that she ever did, or that she ever led me to believe she did; no, nor even that it was ever to be expected in any cool reason that she would or could.
1	While he was thus employed, the closed eyes opened, and on the pale face there came a placid smile.
1	Mrs. Snagsby sees it all.
1	‘Now jump into bed again, or you’ll catch the rheumatics.
1	‘Am I honoured by your instructions to mention as much to the gentleman, as I pass out?
1	that’s the wonderful Madeira!--there’s only one more bottle!’ Uncle Sol nodded his head, implying that he knew very well what he was about; and having drawn the cork in solemn silence, filled two glasses and set the bottle and a third clean glass on the table.
1	It’s that dull glow near it, coming and going, that I mean.
1	He was pale and seemed agitated.
1	Else why have to do with you at all?
1	Don’t let her have to look back to yours, as the event from which to date a happier life.
1	Where imposture, ignorance, and brutal cupidity, are the stock in trade of a small body of men, and one is described by these characteristics, all his fellows will recognise something belonging to themselves, and each will have a misgiving that the portrait is his own.
1	The table trembled in the silence that followed.
1	‘Take care of this piece of paper, keep him in view without giving offence, ascertain that he IS staying there, and find out anything you can about him.’ The satellite was gone; and Mr Inspector, becoming once again the quiet Abbot of that Monastery, dipped his pen in his ink and resumed his books.
1	"I'll say anythink as you say, sir, for I knows it's good."
1	My darling and I read together, and worked, and practised, and found so much employment for our time that the winter days flew by us like bright-winged birds.
1	You’re a little fuddled tonight, and may not be able to see this as clearly as you would at another time; but this is what you must do, and you’ll need all your senses about you; for a slip might be awkward.’ ‘Oh!’ said Squeers, who had looked cunningly at him, with his head stuck on one side, like an old raven.
1	The hull of a ship!
1	‘You don’t say so!’ ‘I mean to pay him, Eugene, for my part,’ said Mortimer, in a slightly injured tone.
1	However, I proposed that he and I should walk away together to a distant point we could see, and that the boat should take us aboard there, or as near there as might prove feasible, at about noon.
1	'Well, then, look here,' continued Sikes.
1	His lonely daughter, bereft of her final hope and reliance, appealed to them both too strongly.
1	When the fairy had appeared and he wanted to pay us off, Egad we had got into such an exemplary state of checking and counter-checking, signing and counter-signing, that it was six months before we knew how to take the money, or how to give a receipt for it.
1	Her father did not know--she held to it from that time--how much she loved him.
1	‘I will bring it you, if you will let me; and then, perhaps, we may take leave of each other, more like what we used to be to one another.
1	When we came, at last, within a stage of London, and passed the veritable Salem House where Mr. Creakle had laid about him with a heavy hand, I would have given all I had, for lawful permission to get down and thrash him, and let all the boys out like so many caged sparrows.
1	In another moment, Florence was in the arms of the weather-beaten pea-coat.
1	I may mention at once that this became an annual custom.
1	A pretty state of things, if a man isn’t to admire a handsome girl without being beat to pieces for it!’ This reflection appeared to have great weight with the young lady in the bar, who (adjusting her cap as she spoke, and glancing at a mirror) declared that it would be a very pretty state of things indeed; and that if people were to be punished for actions so innocent and natural as that, there would be more people to be knocked down than there would be people to knock them down, and that she wondered what the gentleman meant by it, that she did.
1	Mr. Sikes, finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself, expressed his intention of accompanying her; they went away together, followed, at a little distant, by the dog, who slunk out of a back-yard as soon as his master was out of sight.
1	With another class of customers, Ralph was again another man.
1	For I love him dearly, and I don’t love doctors, or doctors’ stuff.’ Mr. Jasper is a dark man of some six-and-twenty, with thick, lustrous, well-arranged black hair and whiskers.
1	"I thank you, Lawrence, but the suit is hardly at such a point at present," returned Mr. Jarndyce, laughing, "that it would be greatly advanced even by the legal process of shaking the bench and the whole bar."
1	When you don’t know the meaning of an expression, why don’t you seek for information?’ ‘Mrs Pipchin told me I wasn’t to ask questions,’ returned Paul.
1	I’d rather you didn’t see her till she is settled, if it was all the same to you.’ ‘Look here, Hexam.’ Mr Bradley Headstone, highly certificated stipendiary schoolmaster, drew his right forefinger through one of the buttonholes of the boy’s coat, and looked at it attentively.
1	It struck me that if Mrs. Jellyby had discharged her own natural duties and obligations before she swept the horizon with a telescope in search of others, she would have taken the best precautions against becoming absurd, but I need scarcely observe that I kept this to myself.
1	I passed the day in a ditch, and the night in a pigsty.
1	In proof of his really being the person he represented himself, Mr. Bumble laid upon the table the papers he had brought to town.
1	Then came the chemist and druggist, with other tabular statements, showing that when they didn’t get drunk, they took opium.
1	He bitterly felt that he had overreached himself in the beginning, by grasping at Mr Venus’s mere straws of hints, now shown to be worthless for his purpose.
1	‘When I was your age, young Tom,’ said Bounderby, ‘I was punctual, or I got no dinner!’ ‘When you were my age,’ resumed Tom, ‘you hadn’t a wrong balance to get right, and hadn’t to dress afterwards.’ ‘Never mind that now,’ said Bounderby.
1	They had an infant with them, and had laid it down asleep upon a child’s grave, in a little bed of leaves.
1	O look down upon my dear, long-suffering, unfortunate, much-changed, dear dear father!’ Not until the morning came to protect him and encourage him, did she give him a last kiss and leave the small room.
1	Would you do an old man that good turn, sir?"
1	That the shadow should be deep as it came on, like the shadow of an actual presence, was in accordance with the laws of the physical world, for all the Light that shone on Betty Higden lay beyond Death.
1	It affected us to see Caddy clinging, then, to her deplorable home and hanging on her mother's neck with the greatest tenderness.
1	She then hastily attired herself for walking, and leaving word that she should return within a couple of hours, hurried away towards her uncle’s house.
1	Never again.’ ‘She’s very sensitive,’ said Quilp, looking after her.
1	‘I tell you, my good fellow,’ said Lightwood, with his indolent laugh, ‘that I have nothing to do with swearing.’ ‘He can swear AT you,’ Eugene explained; ‘and so can I.
1	They suggested quiet places afar off, and rest, and peace.
1	At length the signal was given, and all the ring leaned forward.
1	He was so honest and warm-hearted, that to see him again and be assured of his truth to her in her distress, was a joy and comfort beyond all price; but for that very reason, it was so affecting to think that she caused him a moment’s unhappiness, or ruffled, by a breath, the harmless current of his life, that her eyes filled with tears, and her bosom overflowed with pity.
1	And the way in which the Mendicant’s bride dashed at the unassailable position so considerately to be held by Miss Lavy, and scattered the whole of the works in all directions in a moment, was triumphant.
1	That he had relented, in consideration of his youth, his professed contrition, and his friends.
1	LET us strike the key-note again, before pursuing the tune.
1	“Do not forget.” The initials of those words are within here now, and were within here then.
1	The administration of infantine doses of physic awakened all the active sympathy of her character; and being on one occasion secreted in a cupboard (whither she had fled in modesty), when Mr Dombey was introduced into the nursery by his sister, to behold his son, in the course of preparation for bed, taking a short walk uphill over Richards’s gown, in a short and airy linen jacket, Miss Tox was so transported beyond the ignorant present as to be unable to refrain from crying out, ‘Is he not beautiful Mr Dombey!
1	At length, and at last, the assembly left off shouting, but Sir Matthew Pupker being voted into the chair, they underwent a relapse which lasted five minutes.
1	He will be very glad.’ ‘Very glad,’ said Mr Meagles, coming forward with his wife and Clennam.
1	Brilliant eyes, lighted up with pleasurable expectation, gleamed from every side; and, look where you would, some exquisite form glided gracefully through the throng, and was no sooner lost, than it was replaced by another as dainty and bewitching.
1	Why, this here old lady next me is a-drowndin’ herself in tea.’ Be quiet, can’t you?’ murmured Sam.
1	‘It’ll stand you in a pound a week.
1	‘Come again!’ ‘Not Mama yet,’ returned the lady, with a serious smile, as she encircled Florence’s neck with her arm.
1	Truly, it looked as gloomy that night as even it had ever looked.
1	He made nothing of the people about him as he tramped on, staring over their heads into the body of the court.
1	It was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his hands in his breeches pockets.
1	Arthur Clennam would have been little disposed to linger in bed, though his bed had been in a more private situation, and less affected by the raking out of yesterday’s fire, the kindling of to-day’s under the collegiate boiler, the filling of that Spartan vessel at the pump, the sweeping and sawdusting of the common room, and other such preparations.
1	‘I believe, Mr. Winkle,’ said Mr. Phunky, ‘that Mr. Pickwick is not a young man?’ ‘Oh, no,’ replied Mr. Winkle; ‘old enough to be my father.’ ‘You have told my learned friend that you have known Mr. Pickwick a long time.
1	How true!’ ‘As I say, sir,’ pompously went on the Mayor, ‘the arm of the law is a strong arm, and a long arm.
1	It seems as if he must go mad in the necessity he feels for haste and the inability under which he labours of expressing to do what or to fetch whom.
1	The old man sat in front to drive, and the two young people sat behind him, and whenever he spoke to them leaned forward, the one on one side of his chubby face and the other on the other, and made a great deal of him.
1	It may be advisable to superadd to the above, the statement that Mrs. Micawber is not in confidential possession of my intentions.’ I read the letter over several times.
1	If dear Fanny were a Dombey!--But I daresay she’ll make it; I have no doubt she’ll make it.
1	Think-not of me, but of the lives that may depend on both of us!” This exordium, and Miss Pross's two hands in quite agonised entreaty clasping his, decided Mr. Cruncher.
1	I developed her into what she is, that she might be loved.
1	This was odd enough: but what was more embarrassing was, that all along the passage, and all along the narrow stairs, blocking up the window, and making the dark entry darker still, was a confused crowd of persons with great importance depicted in their looks; who were, to all appearance, waiting in silent expectation of some coming event.
1	The crisis!’ He had sauntered far enough.
1	Charley got up from the table, making as if she had forgotten something, and went into the next room; and I heard her sob there.
1	‘I have considered the young ‘ooman.
1	It’s very considerate of you to try to hide from me that you are uncomfortable about something, but it’s quite impossible to be done, John love.’ ‘I admit that I am rather uneasy, my own.’ ‘Then please to tell me what about, sir.’ But no, he evaded that.
1	The day was very hot, and heaps of flies, who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell dead at the bottom.
1	And he grew to be proud of the title.
1	Once, I opened the yard-gate, and looked into the empty street.
1	He’d got an old newspaper with him, and some other account in print of the storm.
1	‘I’ve rayther a way o’ putting my hands in my pockets, if it’s all the same to you.’ As Sam said this, he suited the action to the word, and whistled far louder than before.
1	Who’s number twenty-two, that’s to put all the others out?
1	The confidence there has been between us must be broken off.’ ‘When?’ cried Florence.
1	It is her and it an't her.
1	A very valuable person, and deservedly respected."
1	‘What did the brother say?’ ‘Didn’t say a word, ma’am,’ answered Mr Sparkler.
1	Barsad,” he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking over a hand at cards: “Sheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer, so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name.
1	We have in vain pored over the leaves of Mr. Pickwick’s note-book, in the hope of meeting with a general summary of these beautiful compositions.
1	Traders in the avarice, indifference, or imbecility of parents, and the helplessness of children; ignorant, sordid, brutal men, to whom few considerate persons would have entrusted the board and lodging of a horse or a dog; they formed the worthy cornerstone of a structure, which, for absurdity and a magnificent high-minded LAISSEZ-ALLER neglect, has rarely been exceeded in the world.
1	Among sundry minor alterations in Mr Carker’s life and habits that began to take place at this time, none was more remarkable than the extraordinary diligence with which he applied himself to business, and the closeness with which he investigated every detail that the affairs of the House laid open to him.
1	I want to set you more right with yourself."
1	O let us be joyful, joyful!
1	The lull had a sedative and philosophical influence on Joe, who followed me out into the road to say, as a parting observation that might do me good, “On the Rampage, Pip, and off the Rampage, Pip:--such is Life!” With what absurd emotions (for we think the feelings that are very serious in a man quite comical in a boy) I found myself again going to Miss Havisham's, matters little here.
1	It was quite an accident, and the way in which it came about was this.
1	First of all, will you have the goodness to inform me where I shall find my voice; and secondly, what has become of my flesh?’ The Marchioness only shook her head mournfully, and cried again; whereupon Mr Swiveller (being very weak) felt his own eyes affected likewise.
1	"You are kinder to me than I often am to myself," he returned.
1	But the second object of this interview, I must not forget.
1	‘Do you think it a much greater expense to keep two people, than to keep one?’ ‘La, Mr. Pickwick,’ said Mrs. Bardell, colouring up to the very border of her cap, as she fancied she observed a species of matrimonial twinkle in the eyes of her lodger; ‘La, Mr. Pickwick, what a question!’ ‘Well, but do you?’ inquired Mr. Pickwick.
1	"Such an unworldly, uncalculating, gossamer creature is a relief to him and an amusement.
1	I have had a busy evening.’ She was on a low ottoman before the fire, with a little shining jewel of a table, and her book and her work, beside her.
1	“See!” cried madame, pointing with her knife.
1	I don’t think what I said now.
1	I come regular, to tramp about the streets, and see the gentlemen.’ ‘Only to see ’em?’ returned Stephen.
1	Mas’r Davy bor’, gen’l’m’n’s right.
1	'Let me go, will you,--this minute--this instant.'
1	One of these--he who had spoken of his brother--was her little favourite and friend, and often sat by her side in the church, or climbed with her to the tower-top.
1	Mr Gowan stood aloof with his cigar and pencil, but Mr Blandois was on the spot to pay his respects to the ladies.
1	Even this youth, if his jacket could have been unbuttoned and his heart laid bare, would have been seen, as a distant adherent of the Barnacle family, already to aspire to a situation under Government.
1	He struggled hard, and suffered much, for some time; but, having a contented disposition, and a good purpose, succeeded in the end; and, from being a farmer's drudge, and a carrier's lad, he is now the merriest young grazier in all Northamptonshire.
1	We have three daughters besides this son of whom I have spoken, and being fortunately able to give them greater advantages than we have had ourselves, we have educated them well, very well.
1	It is remarkable as showing the wide prevalence of this law, that among the natives of the British possessions in India, also in a considerable part of China, and among the Calmucks of Tartary, the best means of computation yet furnished us by travellers, yield similar results.
1	The sapient pot-boy, looking on officially, then had the conviction borne in upon his soul, that the man was evermore outcast and excommunicate from the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters.
1	Down in the cellars, as up in the bed-chambers, old objects that he well remembered were changed by age and decay, but were still in their old places; even to empty beer-casks hoary with cobwebs, and empty wine-bottles with fur and fungus choking up their throats.
1	"Secondly, what will satisfy me for the trouble of producing it, sir," repeats Mr. George.
1	‘A most admirable memory.’ ‘Thank you, ma’am.
1	I was very much changed--oh, very, very much.
1	I always said it, long before this came out.
1	It announces itself, in the new Railway Advertisers, as a novel enterprise, timidly beginning to spring up.
1	Mr. Pocket, with the normal perplexity of his face heightened and his hair rumpled, looked at them for some minutes, as if he couldn't make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in that establishment, and why they hadn't been billeted by Nature on somebody else.
1	From Twemlow’s, Veneering dashes at Podsnap’s place of business.
1	‘To say to me--?’ ‘That I hope you will not misunderstand my father.
1	If she betrayed any agitation, when she presented herself to Mr. Sikes, he did not observe it; for merely inquiring if she had brought the money, and receiving a reply in the affirmative, he uttered a growl of satisfaction, and replacing his head upon the pillow, resumed the slumbers which her arrival had interrupted.
1	As foreign steamers would leave London at about the time of high-water, our plan would be to get down the river by a previous ebb-tide, and lie by in some quiet spot until we could pull off to one.
1	Herbert said from behind (again poking me), “Massive and concrete.” So I said boldly, as if I had originated it, and must beg to insist upon it, “Massive and concrete.” “I am glad to have your approbation, gentlemen,” said Mr. Waldengarver, with an air of dignity, in spite of his being ground against the wall at the time, and holding on by the seat of the chair.
1	Just as this change had been effected, there presented himself for shaving, a big, burly, good-humoured coal-heaver with a pipe in his mouth, who, drawing his hand across his chin, requested to know when a shaver would be disengaged.
1	It is enough for me to say that some of its circumstances passed before my own eyes; for the remainder I know them to have happened, and there are some persons yet living, who will remember them but too well.
1	Miss La Creevy, who was a member of the little council, ventured to insinuate some doubts relative to the probability of Miss Nickleby’s arriving at this happy consummation in the compass of an ordinary lifetime; but the good lady set that question entirely at rest, by informing them that she had a presentiment on the subject--a species of second-sight with which she had been in the habit of clenching every argument with the deceased Mr. Nickleby, and, in nine cases and three-quarters out of every ten, determining it the wrong way.
1	I want to make it nerve you, and inspire you, Dora!’ ‘Oh, but that’s so shocking!’ cried Dora.
1	‘My dear,’ said Walter, ‘there is someone downstairs who wishes to speak to you.’ She fancied Walter looked grave, and asked him if anything had happened.
1	What should be wrong in Boffinses Bower!
1	He passed along the streets as usual to Bleeding Heart Yard, and had his dinner with his daughter and son-in-law, and gave them Phyllis.
1	The room was so far changed that it was papered now, and had been repainted, and was far more comfortably furnished; but he could recall it just as he had seen it in that single glance, when he raised her from the ground and carried her down to the carriage.
1	We were kimpelled to have him carried down into the kitchen where he now lays.
1	“Call Estella,” she repeated, flashing a look at me.
1	At length, a light on the summit of the rocky staircase gleamed through the snow and mist.
1	Mrs. Corney twice essayed to speak:  and twice failed.
1	‘Madam,’ he resumed, ‘I have done with this.
1	--I shall then have finished for the present," proceeded Mrs. Jellyby with a sweet smile, "though my work is never done.
1	Ever the best of friends.” Enclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which I had been arrested.
1	Except that Steerforth was more to be admired than ever, I remember nothing.
1	If you wath to thee our Children in the Wood, with their father and mother both a dyin’ on a horthe—their uncle a retheiving of ’em ath hith wardth, upon a horthe—themthelvth both a goin’ a black-berryin’ on a horthe—and the Robinth a coming in to cover ’em with leavth, upon a horthe—you’d thay it wath the completetht thing ath ever you thet your eyeth on!
1	Sir Leicester is particularly complacent because he has found in his newspaper some congenial remarks bearing directly on the floodgates and the framework of society.
1	My lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not afford, corrupted the simplicity of his life, and disturbed his peace with anxieties and regrets.
1	I go on board again; open the door of the gentlemen’s cabin and walk in.
1	glancing round upon the three bystanders.
1	He gave an arm to Ada and an arm to me, and bidding Richard bring a candle, was leading the way out when he suddenly turned us all back again.
1	The old lady nodded the satisfaction which this proof of the surly man’s foresight imparted to her feelings; and the surly man giving a smart lash to the chubby horse, they all repaired to Mr. Bob Sawyer’s together.
1	But you are a deep man, and keep your secret close.’ ‘My secret!’ said the other with a haggard look.
1	But after dinner, when I made him take his pipe, and when I had loitered with him about the forge, and when we sat down together on the great block of stone outside it, we got on better.
1	And the pot-boy afterwards remarked, that he hadn’t been ‘so rattled to bed’, since his late mother had systematically accelerated his retirement to rest with a poker.
1	"I am in town on leave just now," said Richard.
1	He was rather reserved, but I thought him very sensible and agreeable.
1	A clattering of clogs upon the pavement; a rapid ringing of bells; and all the melancholy mad elephants, polished and oiled up for the day’s monotony, were at their heavy exercise again.
1	Mr Toots seemed much relieved and gladdened by the acquisition, and chuckled rapturously during the remainder of his visit.
1	I should soon be eased of it, if I did.
1	Unless your mind is prepared for the stairs, it will lead to inevitable disappointment.
1	I tried to cheer my darling, and asked her what it was.
1	The ladies were in the full delight of this altered behaviour on the part of Mr. Nickleby, when the expected swain arrived, with his hair very damp from recent washing, and a clean shirt, whereof the collar might have belonged to some giant ancestor, forming, together with a white waistcoat of similar dimensions, the chief ornament of his person.
1	The man was dressed like a traveller, in a foraging cap with fur about it, and a heap of cloak.
1	That done, he shut down his window, and went to bed again.
1	Mr. and Mrs. Bayham Badger coming one afternoon when my guardian was not at home, in the course of conversation I naturally inquired after Richard.
1	This little round table with the marble top (it’s two feet ten in circumference), I bought.
1	I only throw it out as a legal point.’ ‘Do you think so, Mr Wegg?
1	I am quite myself again, my love, quite myself.
1	You have suffered too much in your own hardships, and in those of your dearest relation, quite to overlook the innocent cause of all the peril and affliction that has befallen you.
1	And may I represent to you that it’s injudicious to say the bee?
1	"Don't tell me there's anything wrong about that security of Lignum's!
1	'I shall never get another!'
1	‘Well!’ said Mr. Nickleby, putting the repeater back in his pocket; ‘perhaps it is.’ Noggs gave a peculiar grunt, as was his custom at the end of all disputes with his master, to imply that he (Noggs) triumphed; and (as he rarely spoke to anybody unless somebody spoke to him) fell into a grim silence, and rubbed his hands slowly over each other: cracking the joints of his fingers, and squeezing them into all possible distortions.
1	How do you spell it?’ ‘Why, as to the spelling of it,’ returned Mr Boffin, with great presence of mind, ‘that’s YOUR look out.
1	This cluster is suddenly broken and put aside by the hands of Mr. Jasper; all the gazing eyes are brought down to the earth by his loudly inquiring of Mr. Crisparkle, at an open window: ‘Where is my nephew?’ ‘He has not been here.
1	But he said not a single word, good or bad.
1	The very first paragraph upon which Mr. Bumble's eye rested, was the following advertisement.
1	But even then his passion for writing letters was too strong to be resisted; for while we were yet in the height of our excitement, hope, and wonder, the following pastoral note was brought to me from a neighbouring tavern, at which he had called to write it:--           ‘Most secret and confidential.
1	And I assure you, sir, the ladies are great observers.
1	The men who play the bells have got scent of the marriage; and the marrow-bones and cleavers too; and a brass band too.
1	‘They are not to be expected to be as sensitive as we are.
1	‘I took the seat I had occupied the night before, and there I sat for hours, listening to sounds which must strike deep to the heart of the most callous among human beings--the awful ravings of a dying man.
1	What do you say?’ ‘I can’t leave her,’ answered the old man.
1	At the water’s edge they were saluted by Blandois, who looked white enough after his late adventure, but who made very light of it notwithstanding,--laughing at the mention of Lion.
1	‘I was thinking, Kit, that we have often houses to let for people we are concerned for, and matters of that sort.
1	Such assistance as I have prevailed upon her to accept, I have been obliged, at her own earnest request, to dole out in the smallest portions, lest he, finding how easily money was procured, should squander it even more lightly than he is accustomed to do.
1	Not so, for I would willingly serve you a year--two years--any term you might appoint--before that should begin to be a consideration between us.’ ‘Where do you come from?’ asked Mr Boffin.
1	‘You are amenable.’ With the set expression of her face all torn away by the explosion of her passion, and with a bursting, from every rent feature, of the smouldering fire so long pent up, she cried out: ‘I will tell it myself!
1	Because he’s a proud, haughty, consequential, turned-up-nosed peacock.’ Mrs. Squeers, when excited, was accustomed to use strong language, and, moreover, to make use of a plurality of epithets, some of which were of a figurative kind, as the word peacock, and furthermore the allusion to Nicholas’s nose, which was not intended to be taken in its literal sense, but rather to bear a latitude of construction according to the fancy of the hearers.
1	We had a struggle near the door.
1	He haunts my thoughts, like a dreadful ghost.
1	Mas’r Davy bor’--gent’lmen growed--so th’ are!’ ‘If you two gent’lmen, gent’lmen growed,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘don’t ex-cuse me for being in a state of mind, when you understand matters, I’ll arks your pardon.
1	Into her mind, as into all others contending with the great affliction of our mortal nature, there had stolen solemn wonderings and hopes, arising in the dim world beyond the present life, and murmuring, like faint music, of recognition in the far-off land between her brother and her mother: of some present consciousness in both of her: some love and commiseration for her: and some knowledge of her as she went her way upon the earth.
1	Mr. Solomon Pell, assisted by a Select Committee of Coachmen, arranges the affairs of the elder Mr. Weller 56.
1	For they said, it was a shame to quarrel upon Christmas Day.
1	You can do as much by me, I have no doubt, beforehand.’ ‘Possibly,’ remarked Eugene.
1	‘And it is very sinful to rebel against them,’ whispered the clergyman.
1	‘It’s very agreeable to hear.
1	This brought him to a stop.
1	At length the breakfast is ready.
1	For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble, by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all; in which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared; or, if they had, that being comprised within a couple of pages, they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography, extant in the literature of any age or country.
1	‘Haven’t I told you what a mercenary little wretch I am?
1	“It would seem like flight, my darling.
1	Comes Mr. Snagsby in his black coat; come the Chadbands; come (when the gorging vessel is replete) the 'prentices and Guster, to be edified; comes at last, with his slouching head, and his shuffle backward, and his shuffle forward, and his shuffle to the right, and his shuffle to the left, and his bit of fur cap in his muddy hand, which he picks as if it were some mangy bird he had caught and was plucking before eating raw, Jo, the very, very tough subject Mr. Chadband is to improve.
1	And now, as I dare urge no more--as I am not sure that I have a right to do so--though Heaven knows, even that doubt may be habit,’ said the gentleman, rubbing his head, as despondently as before, ‘let me; though a stranger, yet no stranger; ask two favours.’ ‘What are they?’ she inquired.
1	‘May I venture to inquire what is your version of the matter?’ ‘You may,’ said Mrs Chivery, ‘and I will give it to you in honour and in word as true as in this shop I stand.
1	I really don’t know what would be best to do, and that’s the truth.
1	In fact, she has very little left, indeed.’ ‘You as-tound me, Copperfield!’ cried Mr. Spenlow.
1	He read that he was dishonoured.
1	This was a question more difficult of solution; but as knaves generally overreach themselves by imputing their own designs to others, the idea immediately presented itself that some circumstances of irritation between Quilp and the old man, arising out of their secret transactions and not unconnected perhaps with his sudden disappearance, now rendered the former desirous of revenging himself upon him by seeking to entrap the sole object of his love and anxiety into a connexion of which he knew he had a dread and hatred.
1	It is his humour too, to say that he does not look forward to going out; that he is not glad the time is drawing near; that he did look forward to it once, but that was very long ago; that he has lost all care for everything.
1	‘Bless my soul!’ said Mrs. Cluppins.
1	What should we do without strength, my friends?
1	If I am ever a little provoking, I am sure you’ll consider what a thing it is to occupy my position and feel a consciousness of being superior to it.
1	“O yes I shall!” said he.
1	The absurdity of the situation put its pathos to the rout.
1	‘Are you reconciled?’ Looking fixedly at me, she puts her hand to her forehead, and moans.
1	That’s the mark; come up to the mark, sir.
1	I will be there and back, before breakfast.’ The old man shook his head, and sighing mournfully, drew her towards him.
1	It was a wonderfully fine thing to have that lofty castle to myself, and to feel, when I shut my outer door, like Robinson Crusoe, when he had got into his fortification, and pulled his ladder up after him.
1	‘Why should you be so uncomfortable?’ ‘Thank you, Trot,’ replied my aunt, ‘I prefer to sit upon my property.’ Here my aunt looked hard at Mrs. Crupp, and observed, ‘We needn’t trouble you to wait, ma’am.’ ‘Shall I put a little more tea in the pot afore I go, ma’am?’ said Mrs. Crupp.
1	Ha, ha!’ Now, it was evident, as Miss Knag laughed, that something struck her as being exceedingly funny; and as the young ladies took their tone from Miss Knag--she being the chief--they all got up a laugh without a moment’s delay, and nodded their heads a little, and smiled sarcastically to each other, as much as to say how very good that was!
1	Do not forget      Your ever grateful and affectionate P.S.--Particularly remember that Minnie Gowan deserves the best remembrance in which you can hold her.
1	Not until the late daylight made the window transparent, did this decaying statue move.
1	How then?” demanded madame, tying another knot, as if there were another enemy strangled.
1	My daughter Lucie is, in this one respect, such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her heart.” “May I ask, sir, if you think she is--” As he hesitated, her father supplied the rest.
1	I had made up my mind to speak to him now.
1	‘You are ashamed of yourself, I hope, Sir?’ said the old gentleman.
1	Now, there must be no misunderstanding regarding what I buy for two hundred a year.
1	‘Take down that scandalous red handkerchief, I beg.
1	‘How d’ye do, Miss Dorrit?’ said Pancks.
1	She was miserably dressed, and carried some skins over her arm.
1	‘Go back to them,’ Miss Wade retorted.
1	‘Oh, decidedly,’ observed the spinster aunt.
1	There is not a morsel of an old letter or of any other writing in either.
1	You want to keep the keys yourself, and give out all the things, I suppose?
1	I have been familiar with every stone in the place.
1	But, whenever Lord Decimus spoke, he shut them again.
1	It was the quietest time the College knew, saving the night hours when the Collegians took the benefit of the act of sleep.
1	If you want to out with something, out with it!"
1	When I was at home expecting to be rich, I thought vaguely of all the great things I would do.
1	At length the procession was dissolved by the violent arrival of a nutmeg, before which the drawing-room door bounced open as if it were a cannon-ball; and while that fragrant article, dispersed through several glasses of coloured warm water, was going the round of society, Miss Podsnap returned to her seat by her new friend.
1	‘What is it, my dear?
1	I am not going home now; I have a visit to make alone.
1	Your knowledge of old Joe, Sir, such as he is, and old Joe’s knowledge of you, Sir, had its origin in a noble fellow, Sir--in a great creature, Sir.
1	that’s nothing in such a service.
1	The mad joy over the prisoners who were saved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against those who were cut to pieces.
1	It wandered back to my godmother's house and came along the intervening track, raising up shadowy speculations which had sometimes trembled there in the dark as to what knowledge Mr. Jarndyce had of my earliest history--even as to the possibility of his being my father, though that idle dream was quite gone now.
1	‘Oh dear, yes, sir!’ cried this hopeful penitent.
1	He rose and raised me with him.
1	Because you HAVE no proof.’ ‘Men are very wise in their way,’ quoth Mrs Lammle, glancing haughtily at the Snigsworth portrait, and shaking out her dress before departing; ‘but they have wisdom to learn.
1	“What'll you drink, Mr. Gargery?
1	Miss La Creevy, too, arrived with two bandboxes (whereof the bottoms fell out as they were handed from the coach) and something in a newspaper, which a gentleman had sat upon, coming down, and which was obliged to be ironed again, before it was fit for service.
1	‘I promise it.’ ‘That’s my dear John.
1	Only by times, because Durdles is growing drowsy.
1	It would do that incorrigible creature: who was the most barbarous infidel in point of poetry: good to be in such company.
1	'Why, that she couldn't very easily get out of doors unless he knew where she was going to,' said Noah; 'and so the first time she went to see the lady, she--ha!
1	Where I might go, what I might do, or when I might return, were questions utterly unknown to me; nor did I vex my mind with them, for it was wholly set on Provis's safety.
1	Oliver brushed away two or three tears that were lingering in his eyes; and seeing no board but the table, fortunately bowed to that.
1	‘Here we are!’ said Squeers, hurrying Smike into the little parlour, where Mr. Snawley and his wife were taking a lobster supper.
1	And when I return, we’ll have a cup of tea, and a chat over future arrangements.
1	So easy is it to move light hearts.
1	Their seat was a part of the window; when there was anything in the way of a procession going on, they used to have bright draperies hung out of the window, and used to kneel or sit on this seat, and look out at it, leaning on the brilliant colour.
1	At last the day came for going home.
1	There was little pain, little uneasiness, but there was no rallying, no effort, no struggle for life.
1	What remained for me now, but to follow him to the dear old forge, and there to have out my disclosure to him, and my penitent remonstrance with him, and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved Secondly, which had begun as a vague something lingering in my thoughts, and had formed into a settled purpose?
1	“If a fool's head can't express better opinions than that,” said my sister, “and you have got any work to do, you had better go and do it.”  So he went.
1	But my blood boils to avenge this poor murdered creature.
1	A very brief conversation ensued.
1	‘Will you unclasp your hand?’ ‘Will you tell me who you are?’ ‘No!’ ‘No!’ In less time than the quickest tongue could tell it, these words were exchanged, and Sir Mulberry shortening his whip, applied it furiously to the head and shoulders of Nicholas.
1	Perhaps he never told you my story?’ ‘No.’ ‘Oh no, why should he!
1	‘Is Mr. Copperfield informed of everything, Rosa?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘And has he heard Littimer himself?’ ‘Yes; I have told him why you wished it.’ ‘You are a good girl.
1	The spinster aunt could hardly believe her eyes.
1	There an't such a rusty bit of metal in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I'm sure there's no such old bones here, as mine.
1	That she was a young widow, Sir.
1	Mr. Weller was so deeply overcome on receiving this intelligence that he found it absolutely necessary to cling to his fair informant for support; and divers little love passages had passed between them, before he was sufficiently collected to return to the subject.
1	He did so, quite ineffectually.
1	Mr Inspector, hastily fortifying himself with another glass, strolled out with a noiseless foot and an unoccupied countenance.
1	Shipping Intelligence and Office Business    14.
1	I am not hurt yet.’ ‘Then you won’t grant my request?’ ‘Decidedly, No,’ said Clennam.
1	There was no need to tell them who it was; his pale face was enough.
1	said Duff, addressing Mr. Giles, with supreme contempt.
1	“She wants this boy to go and play there.
1	“I write this by request of Mr. Gargery, for to let you know that he is going to London in company with Mr. Wopsle and would be glad if agreeable to be allowed to see you.
1	At length the same boy reappeared, and presented me with a note written in pencil, and headed, in a legal manner, ‘Heep v. Micawber’.
1	‘Amy, my love, you know Mr Clennam even better than I have the happiness of doing.
1	'Dear me, I forgot all about it!'
1	The well-known massive gray square tower of its old Cathedral?
1	‘Miss Witherfield,’ said Mr. Magnus, ‘allow me to introduce my very particular friend, Mr. Pickwick.
1	I’m sure I never was more serious.
1	It is the curtain to his bed of death, his winding-sheet, and grave.
1	As he happened not to be doing anything at all, he merely boxed his ears, and told him not to do it again.
1	If you wish to consult me as to your interests, you will find me here at all times alike.
1	This last suggestion particularly delighted the bystanders, who cheered it rather uproariously, and were, with some difficulty, deterred from dropping down the area and breaking open the kitchen door to ascertain the fact.
1	Although the presiding Genii in such an office as this, exercise a summary and arbitrary power over the liberties, the good name, the character, almost the lives, of Her Majesty's subjects, expecially of the poorer class; and although, within such walls, enough fantastic tricks are daily played to make the angels blind with weeping; they are closed to the public, save through the medium of the daily press.
1	The Doctor knew, that up to that time, his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter and his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness.
1	‘Eh?’ cried Mr Boffin, catching at the name.
1	Mr Skettles had repaired abroad, permanently to grace the establishment of his father Sir Barnet Skettles, whose popular manners had obtained him a diplomatic appointment, the honours of which were discharged by himself and Lady Skettles, to the satisfaction even of their own countrymen and countrywomen: which was considered almost miraculous.
1	(always in praise of Liberty) to the music of clanking chains and bloody stripes.
1	“Miss Havisham,” said I, “I went to Richmond yesterday, to speak to Estella; and finding that some wind had blown her here, I followed.” Miss Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down, I took the chair by the dressing-table, which I had often seen her occupy.
1	"Wishermaydie if I don't, sir," says Jo, reverting to his favourite declaration.
1	If the greatest wealth or the highest rank were hers, it would only be important in my sight as removing her still farther from me, and making me more hopeless, if that could be.
1	Very kind of her too, all the folks said, and I said, along with all the folks.
1	‘What is money after all!’ said Mr Dombey, backing his chair a little, that he might the better gaze in sheer amazement at the presumptuous atom that propounded such an inquiry.
1	How de do?’ Mr Toots would say, with a chuckle and a blush.
1	"Thriving, grandmother, in every way."
1	I hope my natur is _NOT _ a soft vun, Sir.
1	They shall all confess your merit, Blandois.
1	You are a common fellow, and a common boaster.’ ‘Pooh, pooh,’ says Edwin Drood, equally furious, but more collected; ‘how should you know?
1	Firstly, it’s enough to have been done, without the mortification of being known to have been done.
1	"It's a pleasure to talk to him.
1	For, when Venus passed to Wegg’s discovery, and from that to their having both seen Mr Boffin dig up the Dutch bottle, that gentleman changed colour, changed his attitude, became extremely restless, and ended (when Venus ended) by being in a state of manifest anxiety, trepidation, and confusion.
1	It was not a little while before I could succeed or could even restrain bursts of grief, but after an hour or so I was better and felt that I might return.
