1	She had hovered for a little while in the near neighbourhood of her abandoned dwelling , and had sold , and knitted and sold , and gone on .
1	And what a leer there was upon the face !
1	You know how poor we are ' ( it is probable he did , having some reason to know it !
1	' Having counted our funds , and reduced to order a great mass of unintentional confusion in the first place , and of wilful confusion and falsification in the second , we take it to be clear that <NAME> might now wind up his business , and his agency-trust , and exhibit no deficiency or defalcation whatever. ' ' Oh , thank <NAME> ! ' cried <NAME> , fervently .
1	' I didn ' t think of that .
1	But you shall see him in his own home , and then you 'll understand him better .
1	Some ( among whom was <NAME> ) were disposed to think that <NAME> contemplated a matrimonial alliance ; but this idea the ladies most strenuously repudiated .
1	' A new one ? ' I repeated .
1	Indeed , I felt the whole state of my mind in reference to her to be weak and unreasonable , and I remonstrated with myself about it as much as I could .
1	Or do you think that my having been unfortunate is a sufficient reason why our relative positions should be changed , and that she should command and I should obey ?
1	The power of this woman is astonishing .
1	" There must have been great intellectual friction going on there under the auspices of such a man ! "
1	<NAME> mentioned his name , and his having promised to call , on the solicitation of Mr Chivery .
1	" And now we have done , <NAME> , fill a bumper of punch , " said <NAME> .
1	It ' s come true , you see. ' He was as imperturbable as ever , to all appearance , and nodded his head in a moralising way as he looked round the room .
1	Although <NAME> and <NAME> met daily under the <NAME> roof , nothing at any time passed between them having reference to <NAME> , after the time , more than half a year gone by , when <NAME> mutely showed the <NAME> Canon the conclusion and the resolution entered in his Diary .
1	He asked me as the subject arose in his mind , in his graceful , light-hearted manner and without the least embarrassment .
1	When the chambermaid asked him just now if he should want a bed , sir , he first made faces at her , and then wanted to kiss her. ' ' Beg him to walk this way , ' said the single gentleman .
1	I am as gay as a lark. ' Which his face confirmed .
1	The old question arose again and again -- What could it be ?
1	Now think of her , and tell me , Newman. ' ' Yes , I will , I will , ' said <NAME> .
1	Was he much the better for his wealth ?
1	" But I am afraid , " said I , " this is an objection to all kinds of application -- to life itself , except under some very uncommon circumstances . "
1	And she ses to me 'do it ' and I dun it and she giv me a sov'ring and hooked it .
1	' YOU , who never cooked when you were at home ? ' ' Yes , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> ; ' that is precisely the state of the case. ' She girded herself with a white apron , and busily with knots and pins contrived a bib to it , coming close and tight under her chin , as if it had caught her round the neck to kiss her .
1	As <NAME> himself , utterly regardless of his sister , had this object at heart , only second to the hope of gain , it seemed to him the more likely to be <NAME> ' s main principle of action .
1	' Quite a young woman , ' said <NAME> , musing .
1	But , that my view of the <NAME> may not be mistaken or misrepresented , I will state it .
1	I got your letter and destroyed it .
1	Saving for a mysterious dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted , his life was very new and agreeable .
1	' Let me see , ' said <NAME> , as they went along ; ' I have been , <NAME> , upon the honourable roll of solicitors of the <NAME> of <NAME> , and attorneys at <NAME> , five years ; and -- except gratuitously taking instructions , on an average once a fortnight , for the will of <NAME> who has nothing to leave -- I have had no scrap of business but this romantic business. ' ' And I , ' said <NAME> , ' have been " called " seven years , and have had no business at all , and never shall have any .
1	The gaps remain , and there are not unpopular lodgings among the rubbish .
1	'It 's all arranged about bringing off the swag , is it ? '
1	' I scarcely exist the next day ; I find the reaction so very great after a tragedy , my lord , and <NAME> is such a delicious creature. ' ' Ye -- es ! ' replied <NAME> .
1	<NAME> o ' clock had hardly ceased striking on the following morning , when <NAME> ' s comprehensive mind was aroused from the state of unconsciousness , in which slumber had plunged it , by a loud knocking at his chamber door .
1	'You will not stop my going because I have trusted in your goodness , and forced no promise from you , as I might have done . '
1	' Was ever man so beset as I ?
1	" He certainly was not active in it .
1	To have seen the mother and son , like two great bats hanging over the whole house , and darkening it with their ugly forms , made me so uncomfortable , that I would rather have remained downstairs , knitting and all , than gone to bed .
1	I see it in your face. ' They went into the nearest room , where <NAME> gave him the letter to read .
1	' I agree to that. ' ' I have your word and honour , sir ? ' ' My good fellow , ' retorted Mr Boffin , ' you have my word ; and how you can have that , without my honour too , I don ' t know .
1	" My father ! " she called to him .
1	You won ' t consider it a liberty ? ' ' I thank you again and again , sir , ' said <NAME> .
1	' <NAME> said look again , mother ; ' and the speaker fixed her eyes upon her .
1	It had been the calling of his life to slink and skulk and dog and waylay , and he knew his calling well .
1	' Did I say " before ? " ' replied old Sol .
1	I entreated <NAME> not to regard this as a thoughtless passion which could ever yield to any other , or had the least resemblance to the boyish fancies that we used to joke about .
1	They used to issue from the lodge on alternate Sunday afternoons with great gravity , bound for some meadows or green lanes that had been elaborately appointed by the turnkey in the course of the week ; and there she picked grass and flowers to bring home , while he smoked his pipe .
1	' You have no business there .
1	' At the apartment of your son .
1	And I said again , " I ca n't help it , <NAME> . "
1	He was rather a shallow sort of young gentleman , I thought , with a handsome face , a rapid utterance , and a confident , bold air .
1	' Ha ! ' he said , ' I thought so .
1	Some indication of a neck being developed in him by these means , he and the sharer of his life 's evening again fronting one another in their two porter 's chairs , like a couple of sentinels long forgotten on their post by the <NAME> , <NAME> .
1	To whom I imparted how my uncle had come in the night and was then asleep , and how the breakfast preparations were to be modified accordingly .
1	Nothing doubting now that the stranger , if not Mr Ketch in person , was one of that company , the whole of the young family wailed the louder , while its more infantine members , unable to control the transports of emotion appertaining to their time of life , threw themselves on their backs like young birds when terrified by a hawk , and kicked violently .
1	To show you how mistaken you are , and what an unfounded assumption yours is , I will lay before you a certificate of <NAME> 's burial , which I happened to have carried in my pocket-book , " with a hurried hand he produced and opened it , " ever since .
1	Mrs. Tisher at the same time grouped herself behind her chief , as representing <NAME> ' s first historical female friend at <NAME> fort .
1	Has a ring of iron on his left foot .
1	' You are a little low this evening , <NAME> , ' said the Father of the <NAME> .
1	' We ' ll not say very crooked , ma ' am , ' said <NAME> piously .
1	The cause is a young child ' s guiltless of all harm or wrong , but nothing goes well with it !
1	" I should have got a lawyer , and he would have said ( as I have often read in the newspapers ) , 'My client says nothing , my client reserves his defence ' : my client this , that , and t'other .
1	When we had retired for the night , and <NAME> and I had had our usual talk in our pretty room , I went out at my door again and sought my guardian among his books .
1	Unembellished by any violence of gesticulation , this might have seemed no very high compliment to the lady 's charms ; but , as <NAME> accompanied the threat with many warlike gestures , she was much touched with this proof of his devotion , and protested , with great admiration , that he was indeed a dove .
1	They have made a perfect palace of the house , positively. ' ' It is handsome , ' said Mr Dombey , looking round .
1	' They are not to be got rid of , for six months at least , unless they could be underlet , and that I don ' t believe .
1	I ' d drop him in the water-butt , and put the lid on ; and if I found he was insensible to kindness , I ' d try the other persvasion. ' The elder <NAME> bestowed a look of deep , unspeakable admiration on his son , and , having once more grasped his hand , walked slowly away , revolving in his mind the numerous reflections to which his advice had given rise .
1	That done , they worked together side by side , contentedly sharing hard labour and hard living for another term , and then their sisters came , and then another brother , and lastly , their old mother .
1	Provide somebody to take care of you .
1	When they came to the warm-baths , all the other people belonging to that establishment were looking out for them at the door , and running up and down the passages .
1	She fades in her turn , and he fades , and all fades , and there is no flute , no Master , no <NAME> , no <NAME> , no anything but heavy sleep .
1	I was so concerned , I recollect , even for the honour of <NAME> , that when <NAME> said , as we drove through its dark streets to the inn , that , as well as he could make out , it was a good , queer , out-of-the-way kind of hole , I was highly pleased .
1	Nor have I been debarred , Though seas between us braid ha ' roared , ( <NAME> ) from participating in the intellectual feasts he has spread before us .
1	Such are the humiliations that society has inflicted upon me , possessing the qualities I have mentioned , and which you know me to possess .
1	I said ( in a tone of conviction ) , " Ah-h ! " " Yes .
1	Please I don ' t believe you are a hard-hearted miser at all , and please I don ' t believe you ever for one single minute were ! ' At this , <NAME> fairly screamed with rapture , and sat beating her feet upon the floor , clapping her hands , and bobbing herself backwards and forwards , like a demented member of some Mandarin ' s family .
1	I never to my knowledge see you afore though , not even in court .
1	Rather better than twelve years ago. ' ' Rather better ? ' said Mr Meagles , ' you mean rather worse .
1	We ' ll try that too. ' He stopped , and then walked on again .
1	" And again , " says mademoiselle with more tight and angry nods .
1	A labyrinth of grandeur , less the property of an old family of human beings and their ghostly likenesses than of an old family of echoings and thunderings which start out of their hundred graves at every sound and go resounding through the building .
1	And besides , it was not a long-considered step .
1	Has a perfectly natural and easy air and is not in the least embarrassed by the great presence into which he comes .
1	' If they hadn ' t been both of a mind in it , how could it ever have been ?
1	'Take a seat , will you ? '
1	" The lawyers have twisted it into such a state of bedevilment that the original merits of the case have long disappeared from the face of the earth .
1	Let us find my brother. ' ' Not yet .
1	<NAME> , who had made one very stiff bow , and risen from his chair , made another very stiff bow , and dropped into it again .
1	My dear Dora , unless we learn to do our duty to those whom we employ , they will never learn to do their duty to us .
1	I saw my mother stop her ears then , and I heard her crying .
1	' Be mine , be mine ! ' repeated the old gentleman .
1	<NAME> came back as we finished exchanging these hurried words and gave me his arm to take me to the coach .
1	We are very thankful to you , ' she added aloud ; ' but neither of us could part from the other if all the wealth of the world were halved between us. ' Mrs <NAME> was a little disconcerted by this reception of her proposal , and looked at the old man , who tenderly took <NAME> ' s hand and detained it in his own , as if she could have very well dispensed with his company or even his earthly existence .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , fair and rosy , and perpetually pitching himself head-foremost into all the deep running water in the surrounding country ; <NAME> , <NAME> , early riser , musical , classical , cheerful , kind , good-natured , social , contented , and boy-like ; <NAME> , <NAME> and good man , lately ' Coach ' upon the chief Pagan high roads , but since promoted by a patron ( grateful for a well-taught son ) to his present <NAME> beat ; betakes himself to the gatehouse , on his way home to his early tea .
1	<NAME> , ' said <NAME> , shading his face with his hand , ' has always been my favourite child. ' The blustrous <NAME> crimsoned and swelled to such an extent on hearing these words , that he seemed to be , and probably was , on the brink of a fit .
1	The first goblin was a most astonishing leaper , and none of the others could come near him ; even in the extremity of his terror the sexton could not help observing , that while his friends were content to leap over the common-sized gravestones , the first one took the family vaults , iron railings and all , with as much ease as if they had been so many street-posts .
1	Bless you , father , not he ! ' This was intended for Mr Toodle ' s private edification , but Rob the <NAME> , whose withers were not unwrung , caught the words as they were spoken .
1	' Made a pretty good thing of marrying , didn ' t you ? ' asked <NAME> .
1	'Compose yourself , <NAME> , and answer me distinctly .
1	'No , no , mistress , ' replied the old woman , 'nobody can ; she 's far beyond the reach of help .
1	It ' s a cruel thing to keep the dear child shut up there .
1	A pause succeeded , during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a series of leaps and crows at little Jane , who appeared to me to be the only member of the family ( irrespective of servants ) with whom it had any decided acquaintance .
1	<NAME> , long ago , ' said <NAME> , without looking at her .
1	<NAME> broke with him when I was by , and he was very angry at it .
1	It ' s Gaffer ! ' They ran to the rope , leaving him gasping there .
1	There ' s time , and to spare , for me to go and come back before the ship sails .
1	Nor can it have been the general expression of her face , which was very sparkling and pretty for an old lady .
1	Give me a pen , give me a pen. ' Even the power of restlessness was gone , except from the poor head , which could just turn from side to side .
1	There was no appearance of its inmates stirring at that early hour .
1	We do not feel justified in laying any particular stress upon the fact , because on the present occasion all Mrs. <NAME> ' s most winning ways were brought into requisition to receive the two gentlemen .
1	As nobody else appeared and it would soon be dark , <NAME> at length took courage , and when he had resumed his pipe and seat , ventured to draw near , leading her grandfather by the hand .
1	' I took care of it , for you , or I dare say it would have been lost long before this , ' replied <NAME> .
1	Who calls so loud ? ' ' " Who calls so loud ? " ' said <NAME> .
1	' In that corner of the churchyard , ' said the old gentleman , after a silence of a few moments , ' in that corner of the churchyard of which I have before spoken , there lies buried a man who was in my employment for three years after this event , and who was truly contrite , penitent , and humbled , if ever man was .
1	There is no school in which a pupil gets on so fast , as that in which <NAME> became a scholar when he gave <NAME> the kiss .
1	" <NAME> , " she says , " I love him. " ' ' " Adore him , " I said , uncle , ' interposed Mrs. Kenwigs .
1	I carried them , one after another , to a bookstall in the <NAME> -- one part of which , near our house , was almost all bookstalls and bird shops then -- and sold them for whatever they would bring .
1	They then parted good friends , and <NAME> walked away .
1	As to his liver , ' said the <NAME> resignedly , ' that , of course , he gave up altogether , when he first went out ! ' ' Does he say all this ? ' asked <NAME> .
1	And where were they all now ?
1	I feared the light might dazzle her eyes and wake her , so I brought it here. ' He spoke rather to himself than to the visitor , but when he had put the lamp upon the table , he took it up , as if impelled by some momentary recollection or curiosity , and held it near his face .
1	The station for the country house was at the opposite end of the town , the time was short , the road not easy ; but she was so quick in pouncing on a disengaged coach , so quick in darting out of it , producing her money , seizing her ticket , and diving into the train , that she was borne along the arches spanning the land of coal-pits past and present , as if she had been caught up in a cloud and whirled away .
1	She had been singing some time , rising between whiles to bend over him and speak to him , when <NAME> came in .
1	' Kill me sooner than take me there .
1	I thought of myself , lying here , when that first great change was being wrought at home .
1	Every gentleman who hears me , is probably acquainted with the reply made by an individual , who -- to use an ordinary figure of speech -- " hung out " in a tub , to the emperor <NAME> : -- " if I were not <NAME> , " said he , " I would be Alexander. " I can well imagine these gentlemen to say , " If I were not Dumkins I would be <NAME> ; if I were not Podder I would be Struggles. " ( <NAME> . )
1	He had one , he said , whose time was up next day ; but he had only been a prisoner two years .
1	<NAME> night , good night ! " We thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms ; and we left him on the landing outside his door , holding a light over the stair-rail to light us downstairs .
1	'Let me out , ' said <NAME> .
1	You never meet with quadrupeds going up and down walls ; you must not have quadrupeds represented upon walls .
1	<NAME> , to relieve him , bade adieu , with many thanks , to <NAME> , and gave her arm to <NAME> .
1	' You are the executor , I see , ' he added , casting his eyes over the paper .
1	" Have you heerd nought ? " " <NAME> , " says I , " I heerd street-door shut , no time at a ' ago .
1	As to who was to blame for it , Mr Plornish didn ' t know who was to blame for it .
1	As few people are known in Tom-all-Alone 's by any <NAME> sign , there is much reference to <NAME> whether he means <NAME> , or the <NAME> , or <NAME> , or <NAME> , or <NAME> , or <NAME> , or the <NAME> .
1	He still sat silent , when <NAME> mildly said : ' <NAME> , you will not distrust me one day , when you know me better. ' ' It goes against me , ' <NAME> answered , in a gentler manner , ' to mistrust any one ; but when I am so mistrusted—when we all are—I can not keep such things quite out of my mind .
1	<NAME> <NAME> did not object to this arrangement , but urged that before any step could possibly be taken in it , it must be submitted to my guardian .
1	The head was covered now .
1	Now confess , <NAME> , that you haven ' t liked me quite as I have liked you .
1	I admit that <NAME> am a spy , and that it is considered a discreditable station -- though it must be filled by somebody ; but this gentleman is no spy , and why should he so demean himself as to make himself one ? " " I play my Ace , <NAME> , " said <NAME> , taking the answer on himself , and looking at his watch , " without any scruple , in a very few minutes. " " I should have hoped , gentlemen both , " said the spy , always striving to hook <NAME> into the discussion , " that your respect for my sister -- " " I could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally relieving her of her brother , " said <NAME> .
1	But I was restlessly curious to look at her -- so curious that I felt it to be one of the few sources of entertainment left to me .
1	It ' s mine , ' retorted <NAME> .
1	What kind of place can it be that you are going to ? ' ' I hardly know , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , pressing his sister ' s hand .
1	Anything to equal the determined reticence of <NAME> under that roof I never saw elsewhere , even in him .
1	What lies beyond this tottering flight of steps , that creak beneath our tread ? —a miserable room , lighted by one dim candle , and destitute of all comfort , save that which may be hidden in a wretched bed .
1	' I can not , therefore , put a price upon services which it is a pleasure to me to render if I can render them spontaneously , but which I could not render in mere return for any consideration .
1	' They came , and raised her , and placed her on the bed .
1	Well , I suppose it wants some years of sticking to , before you master it .
1	I have remarked that at those times , and when he is least like himself , he is most certain to be wanted on some business. ' ' By <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
1	' Yes ! ' the Father of the <NAME> assented .
1	He had repeatedly said he would have everybody ' s life , and become in effect the last man .
1	said the doctor ; 'well , I do n't know ; perhaps it 's as honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen , as to hit your man at twelve paces .
1	Here , <NAME> -- <NAME> -- take these things away , and open another bottle -- d ' ye hear ? ' The fat boy rose , opened his eyes , swallowed the huge piece of pie he had been in the act of masticating when he last fell asleep , and slowly obeyed his master ' s orders -- gloating languidly over the remains of the feast , as he removed the plates , and deposited them in the hamper .
1	And thus , while he was mentally turning the kindest of kind faces on Wegg this morning , he was not absolutely sure but that he might somehow deserve the charge of turning his back on him .
1	' How came you here ? ' ' Child ! ' cried <NAME> , hurrying in .
1	They have no fixed offices , their legal business being transacted in the parlours of public-houses , or the yards of prisons , whither they repair in crowds , and canvass for customers after the manner of omnibus cads .
1	' It ain ' t much , ' said the <NAME> , putting a little pile of halfpence in his hand , ' but it ' s well meant. ' The Father of the <NAME> had never been offered tribute in copper yet .
1	So saying , he put his umbrella under his arm , drew off his right glove , and extended the hand of reconciliation to that most indignant gentleman ; who , thereupon , thrust his hands beneath his coat tails , and eyed the attorney with looks of scornful amazement .
1	I have felt sincerely interested in her , and have had a great desire to know something more about her .
1	Yes , " was the grim reply of <NAME> .
1	They have left off telling me to ' wait a few days more ' .
1	' Is it nothing to see those placards about ?
1	<NAME> tears stood in its eyes , and stained the blotched red of its cheeks .
1	A break-up of the constitootion is it ? -- werry good .
1	' Nor was this the whole extent of the baron ' s misfortunes .
1	You have to do with a man also .
1	' Finching ? ' ' Finching oh yes isn ' t it a dreadful name , but as Mr F. said when he proposed to me which he did seven times and handsomely consented I must say to be what he used to call on liking twelve months , after all , he wasn ' t answerable for it and couldn ' t help it could he , <NAME> man , not at all like you but excellent man ! ' <NAME> had at last talked herself out of breath for one moment .
1	' <NAME> ' t you be a fool and provoke me , <NAME> , but mind what you ' re doing , and do it. ' <NAME> , who was at heart in great fear of his sister , sulkily bent over his writing again , and listened as she said : ' If I determined that the clerk ought not to come , of course he wouldn ' t be allowed to come .
1	She took the first opportunity of angrily ordering my father out of the house , in his presence , and my father has never seen her since. " I thought of her having said , " <NAME> will come and see me at last when I am laid dead upon that table ; " and I asked <NAME> whether his father was so inveterate against her ?
1	<NAME> nodded his concurrence in the opinion .
1	Everything within reach of your hand , in good preservation .
1	' You ' re the wax-work child , are you not ? ' said <NAME> .
1	' He doesn ' t know what to say , ' replied <NAME> .
1	" As often as I can , " said <NAME> , opening her eyes and smiling , " because of earning sixpences and shillings ! "
1	" You could n't have met in a better place , " said old <NAME> , removing his pipe from his mouth .
1	Heaven be with you , <NAME> ! ' cried <NAME> with emotion .
1	Look around and consider the lives of all the world that we know , consider the faces of all the world that we know , consider the rage and discontent to which the <NAME> addresses itself with more and more of certainty every hour .
1	really I can ' t blame you , <NAME> , ' says <NAME> , with frankness .
1	I can say that , with a true and honest heart , any way .
1	I ' m very much obliged to you ! ' ' Grateful soul ! ' cried the dwarf .
1	Without disclosing the precise nature of the documents that had fallen into <NAME> ' s hands , <NAME> had confided the general outline of that story to Mr Meagles , to whom she had also recounted his fate .
1	<NAME> Mrs. <NAME> , we must all trust to that , in our heaviest misfortunes. ' The earnestness of my manner , and the tears in my eyes , alarmed her .
1	' Well , well ! ' said <NAME> .
1	If you can not confidently trust me , whom will you trust ? ' ' Ah , <NAME> ! ' I returned .
1	The young lady then , by an easy digression , led the discourse to her own wardrobe , and after recounting its principal beauties at some length , took her friend upstairs to make inspection thereof .
1	In idle imagination. ' ' I hope not , ' said the eminently practical ; ' I confess , however , that the misgiving _has_ crossed me on my way home. ' ' In idle imagination , <NAME> , ' repeated <NAME> .
1	' How could you go away so long , without saying a word to me or letting me hear of you or know anything about you ? ' asked the poor little woman , sobbing .
1	I was glad to hear this , for it is unquestionably a very indifferent one .
1	O <NAME> , I think you had that trust too ! ' He was touched in the cavity where his heart should have been—in that nest of addled eggs , where the birds of heaven would have lived if they had not been whistled away—by the fervour of this reproach .
1	One or another on ' em , ' said the turnkey , repudiating beforehand the refusal of all his suggestions .
1	Tell me of my ingratitude .
1	'The father of the unhappy <NAME> had _two_ daughters , ' said <NAME> .
1	And now it seems to be everybody , except you. ' Oho !
1	The time might have been when I might have revealed it to you .
1	" Ah , my <NAME> , I have sometimes thought -- forgive my being so free -- that YOU are not happy . "
1	" Will you run over , once again , what the boy said ? "
1	Arrived at the hotel ; I saw no more of the place that night ; being very tired , and glad to get to bed .
1	' Not at all , ' gruffly remarked the elder <NAME> .
1	' Never mind , <NAME> , never mind , ' replied the long gamekeeper ; ' I ' ve no family myself , sir ; and this here boy ' s mother will get something handsome from <NAME> , if he ' s killed on his land .
1	I dare say I owe as much as good-natured people will let me owe .
1	' But I ' m not goin t ' night , <NAME> , nor yet t ' morrow .
1	' Mr Riah , it ' s of no use my holding back the fact .
1	You remember ( to say nothing of our treatment ) this same Creakle turning his son out of doors , I suppose , and the life he used to lead his wife and daughter ? ' ' Perfectly , ' said <NAME> .
1	" It shall not happen again , sir , " I returned , " but at first it is difficult -- " " Nonsense ! "
1	" So he tells me , " returned my guardian .
1	Affery opened it a very little , with a flaring candle in her hands and asked who was that , at that time of night , with that knock !
1	I want to speak to you. ' ' In earnest , <NAME> of the secret chamber ? ' asked <NAME> , clearing her pretty face .
1	To all this , the single gentleman listened with the air of a man quite borne down by grief and disappointment .
1	' It ' s nearly eleven o ' clock , <NAME> .
1	After a few words of confidence in the result of their project had been exchanged , they bade the grinning <NAME> good night .
1	He keeps them on shelves over his head , and will weigh them all .
1	One of <NAME> ' s friends was named <NAME> , and the other <NAME> .
1	The brothers were in a perfect ecstasy ; and their insisting on saluting the ladies all round , before they would permit them to retire , gave occasion to the superannuated bank clerk to say so many good things , that he quite outshone himself , and was looked upon as a prodigy of humour .
1	It was a dark , cold night , with a chill , damp wind , which blew the rain heavily against the windows and house-fronts .
1	' I say , my dear , ' rejoined that lady , with a face of unfathomable mystery , ' what does this invitation to dinner mean ?
1	' I am self-contained and self-reliant ; your opinion is nothing to me ; I have no interest in you , care nothing for you , and see and hear you with indifference ' -- this it said plainly .
1	Accordingly we looked in at a baker ' s window , and after I had made a series of proposals to buy everything that was bilious in the shop , and he had rejected them one by one , we decided in favour of a nice little loaf of brown bread , which cost me threepence .
1	The arrangements of the boat were like those of the <NAME> , and the passengers were of the same order of people .
1	I say , sir -- ' Mr <NAME> affected to start , and looked smilingly round .
1	" Why , no , I ca n't say he has , miss .
1	He had never experienced a greater relief than in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged her to be calm , and not allow herself to become the prey of such fearful fancies .
1	It had the fault of frequent repetition , incidental to all such prayers ; but it was plain and comprehensive in its doctrines , and breathed a tone of general sympathy and charity , which is not so commonly a characteristic of this form of address to the Deity as it might be .
1	' —This young couple came gradually to the discovery ( made on both sides pretty equally , I think ) , that they would be happier and better , both in their present and their future lives , as affectionate friends , or say rather as brother and sister , than as husband and wife. ' <NAME> saw a lead-coloured face in the easy-chair , and on its surface dreadful starting drops or bubbles , as if of steel .
1	I want to get some dinner . "
1	I could not help adding , " So unreasonably ! "
1	Of beautiful sights , and sweet sounds , and pleasant odours , she has no conception ; nevertheless , she seems as happy and playful as a bird or a lamb ; and the employment of her intellectual faculties , or the acquirement of a new idea , gives her a vivid pleasure , which is plainly marked in her expressive features .
1	Then a vote of thanks was moved to the mayor for his able conduct in the chair ; and the mayor , devoutly wishing that he had had a chair to display his able conduct in ( for he had been standing during the whole proceedings ) , returned thanks .
1	Most of the tramping tinkers used to come and lodge at our place ; that was the best part of my master 's earnings .
1	Mrs. Pardiggle , leading the way with a great show of moral determination and talking with much volubility about the untidy habits of the people ( though I doubted if the best of us could have been tidy in such a place ) , conducted us into a cottage at the farthest corner , the ground-floor room of which we nearly filled .
1	' I am so blest , <NAME> -- my heart is so overcharged -- but there is one thing I must say. ' ' Dearest , what ? ' She laid her gentle hands upon my shoulders , and looked calmly in my face .
1	' Perhaps you will think it strange , sir , ' —this was said in a hesitating voice— ' that I should so soon ask you to allow me to confide in you , and to have the kindness to hear a word or two from me in my defence ? ' ' Defence ? ' <NAME> repeated .
1	<NAME> up with the pleasure and joy of the occasion , are the many regrets at quitting home , the tears of parting between parent and child , the consciousness of leaving the dearest and kindest friends of the happiest portion of human life , to encounter its cares and troubles with others still untried and little known -- natural feelings which we would not render this chapter mournful by describing , and which we should be still more unwilling to be supposed to ridicule .
1	They 'll be delighted , every one of 'em . '
1	'Do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you , ' said <NAME> , stepping gently forward .
1	'She charged me to keep it safe , ' replied the woman with a groan , 'and trusted me as the only woman about her .
1	'This is my friend , <NAME> .
1	Mrs <NAME> will do her mending , or her ironing , or her nursing , whatever it is , without minding me : and you ' ll smoke your pipe , too , if you ' re so disposed , <NAME> , won ' t you ? ' ' Thank ' ee , <NAME> , ' said Mr Toodle .
1	And last evening , ' added Mrs. Nickleby , with increased confusion , ' he called gently over the wall , as I was walking in the garden , and proposed marriage , and an elopement .
1	I am going to do so .
1	' <NAME> , wakken oop , will ' ee ? ' After several burrowings into the old corner , and many exclamations of impatience and fatigue , the figure struggled into a sitting posture ; and there , under a mass of crumpled beaver , and surrounded by a semicircle of blue curl-papers , were the delicate features of <NAME> .
1	As my aunt appeared to be annoyed , I thought the best way was to cut her annoyance short .
1	The milliner -- who was not morose or hard-hearted , only newly insolvent -- was touched , took her in hand with goodwill , found her the most patient and earnest of pupils , and made her a cunning work-woman in course of time .
1	The board across the doorway too , acting as a trap equally for the feet of Mrs Higden coming out , and the feet of Mrs Boffin and <NAME> going in , greatly increased the difficulty of the situation : to which the cries of the orphan imparted a lugubrious and inhuman character .
1	And what then , sir ? ' ' Oh !
1	' I ' ll take my Alfred <NAME> , ' muttered Mr Riderhood , slowly relaxing into a dark smile , ' that you know a move .
1	They crossed from the <NAME> into <NAME> <NAME> 's <NAME> ; struck down the small street which terminates at <NAME> 's <NAME> ; through <NAME> and <NAME> ; down the little court by the side of the workhouse ; across the classic ground which once bore the name of <NAME> ; thence into <NAME> ; and so into <NAME> the <NAME> : along which the <NAME> scudded at a rapid pace , directing <NAME> to follow close at his heels .
1	They all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebody 's pleasure , and the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to repress a yawn .
1	'We want to sleep here to-night . '
1	Among the slain was a cow , and among the scattered articles unowned , a widow ' s cap .
1	Every inch of the existence of mankind , from birth to death , was to be a bargain across a counter .
1	Wives , again , put on weeds for their husbands , as if , so far from grieving in the garb of sorrow , they had made up their minds to render it as becoming and attractive as possible .
1	They listened as he spoke again within its silent walls .
1	<NAME> order , cleanliness , and comfort , pervaded every corner of the building .
1	" Now , it a n't necessary to say to a man like you , engaged in your business , which is a business of trust and requires a person to be wide awake and have his senses about him and his head screwed on tight ( I had an uncle in your business once ) -- it a n't necessary to say to a man like you that it 's the best and wisest way to keep little matters like this quiet .
1	Though the fact is , that these fellows , being under orders to cheer most excessively whenever Mr <NAME> ' s name was mentioned , became so proficient that it always woke ' em .
1	" <NAME> , " said <NAME> , with an interest he had never felt before , " tell me if <NAME> will live . "
1	' Here ' s your health , <NAME> , and may you speedily vipe off the disgrace as you ' ve inflicted on the family name. ' In honour of this toast <NAME> imbibed at a draught , at least two-thirds of a newly-arrived pint , and handed it over to his son , to dispose of the remainder , which he instantaneously did .
1	And that opens a pretty picture of things , I hope ?
1	" Do you ? " " Ca n't say , " said I. I felt here , through a tingling in my blood , that if <NAME> 's shoulder had claimed another hair 's breadth of room , I should have jerked him into the window ; equally , that if my own shoulder had urged a similar claim , <NAME> would have jerked me into the nearest box .
1	But , tut , all this is nothing !
1	She has n't much strength in her , so I easily kept her quiet .
1	' I know all about it , <NAME> !
1	' I shouldn ' t be here without him .
1	It was all over now .
1	" You would like some hot water , would n't you ? "
1	<NAME> and loose in one thing , fast and loose in everything .
1	A buzz and hum go up around me , as if the boys were so many bluebottles .
1	His eye-glass and his watch are ready to his hand .
1	If P. J. T. in seventeen-forty-seven , or in any other year of his period , drank such wines—then , for a certainty , P. J. T. was <NAME> .
1	He was a very poor man , who seemed to have no regular employment , but now went roaming about the banks of the river when the tide was low , looking out for bits and scraps in the mud ; and now worked at the unpromising little patch of garden-ground before his cottage ; and now tinkered up a miserable old boat that belonged to him ; or did some job of that kind for a neighbour , as chance occurred .
1	When he told me I had better take a week to consider of what he had said , how could I say I wouldn ' t take a week , yet how could I fail to know that no amount of weeks could influence such love as mine ?
1	' You have not been sent for ? ' ' Not at all , not at all .
1	She can ' t be more than seventeen -- say eighteen at the outside .
1	B. , aged twenty-four next birthday , and committed for eighteen months ' solitary , had himself said ( not that he had ever shown himself particularly worthy of belief ) his ruin began , as he was perfectly sure and confident that otherwise he would have been a tip-top moral specimen .
1	The door was opened , quickly , by some one shrouded in the darkness , and was as quickly closed , when they had passed out .
1	<NAME> <NAME> ' s address was responded to , with a shout of admiration , and the health of the interesting martyr was drunk in a most enthusiastic manner ; for this , the martyr returned thanks , and proposed their visitor , <NAME> -- a gentleman whom he had not the pleasure of an intimate acquaintance with , but who was the friend of <NAME> , which was a sufficient letter of recommendation to any society of gentlemen whatever , or wherever .
1	I wishes ' em no hurt ! )
1	' What I say is , the world ' s wide enough for all of us ! ' ' So it is , my dear , ' said Mr Boffin , ' when not literary .
1	<NAME> pointed to the empty glass , as though it were a sufficient refutation of the charge , and briefly said that he was going downstairs to supper .
1	Perhaps , taken altogether , from top to bottom , it was the most inconvenient little house in <NAME> , and the crookedest ; but then , <NAME> said , what a situation !
1	A crazy old staircase I found it to be , feebly lighted on each landing by a club-headed little oil wick , dying away in a little dungeon of dirty glass .
1	For two or three months , he contented himself with hinting that he feared the air began to disagree with him ; then , finding that the place really no longer was , to him , what it had been , he settled his business on his assistant , took a bachelor 's cottage outside the village of which his young friend was pastor , and instantaneously recovered .
1	What ARE you a doing of this afternoon , <NAME> ! " Mrs. <NAME> received her property , at first with a look of unutterable surprise as if she had never seen it before , and then with a laugh of recognition , and said , " Thank you , <NAME> , " and forgot me , and went on reading .
1	" And it sounds -- somehow it sounds , " said <NAME> , " like a small sum ? "
1	If a picture of the chateau as it was to be a very few years hence , and of fifty like it as they too were to be a very few years hence , could have been shown to him that night , he might have been at a loss to claim his own from the ghastly , fire-charred , plunder-wrecked rains .
1	' Rough , cold night , <NAME> , ' replied the man ; ' and there ' s a wind got up , that drifts it across the fields , in a thick white cloud. ' ' What does <NAME> say ? ' inquired the old lady .
1	Her grandfather was basking in the sun outside , breathing the perfume of the flowers , and idly watching the clouds as they floated on before the light summer wind .
1	The words have probably been repeated several times , for they are ringing in her head before she begins to understand them .
1	It ' ll lead in a roundabout manner to your buying damage and waste of <NAME> and Co. at a nominal price , or even getting it for nothing. ' ' Aha ! ' thought the dressmaker .
1	So I recommend you , as a friend , afore another half a blessed moment has passed over your head , to go and sit down upon that sofy . "
1	Look how you considers of us , and writes of us , and talks of us , and goes up wi ' yor deputations to Secretaries o ' State ' bout us , and how yo are awlus right , and how we are awlus wrong , and never had ' n no reason in us sin ever we were born .
1	<NAME> <NAME> followed , with a thoughtful countenance .
1	The ungainly piece of honesty beamed and blushed as he said it , quite enraptured with the remembrance of having been serviceable .
1	Grandfather Smallweed immediately throws the cushion at her .
1	It is insufferably close ; and you see the hot air fluttering between yourself and any other object you may happen to look at , like the ghost of smoke .
1	That falteringly taken , he would glance at his brother not unadmiringly , put his hands behind him , and shuffle on so at his side until he took another pinch , or stood still to look about him -- perchance suddenly missing his clarionet .
1	' Hope I see you well , sir , ' said <NAME> .
1	I took him to be nearer sixty than fifty , but he was upright , hearty , and robust .
1	' Where are they , <NAME> : where are they ? ' ' <NAME> , hush ! ' replied <NAME> ; and as he assisted <NAME> to dress , he detailed the plan of action on which he proposed to enter .
1	The pleasanter face which had replaced his , on the occasion of my last visit , answered to our summons , and went before us to the drawing-room .
1	If we understand each other now , we shall not fall out any more , perhaps .
1	Sit ye down , and give me your forgiveness for having ever been a worrit to you , <NAME> ' l -- what have my contraries ever been to this ! -- and let us speak a word about them times when she was first an orphan , and when <NAME> was too , and when I was a poor widder woman , and you took me in .
1	It was to be , you thought , and why discuss or dispute it ? ' It was new and strange to him to have himself presented to himself so clearly , in a glass of her holding up .
1	You must squeeze them , sir , or our connection will not continue to be as satisfactory as I could wish it to be to all parties .
1	' I find I gets on better at supper when I does , ' replied Sam .
1	These , however , had no worse effect than causing her to rub her nose very hard , and then fall asleep again .
1	Even the coming sun made but a pale waste in the sky , like a sad sea .
1	A staring old Dedlock in a panel , as large as life and as dull , looks as if he did n't know what to make of it , which was probably his general state of mind in the days of <NAME> .
1	" Wait a bit ! " The united vastness and distinctness of this view so struck him , that he no longer asked if he might shake hands with me , but said he really must , -- and did .
1	I could hardly begin but <NAME> must begin too , so he soon followed .
1	If <NAME> were beyond measure perplexed by this curious conduct on the part of her new acquaintance , and by finding herself involved in this singular treaty , her perplexity was not diminished by ensuing circumstances .
1	Have you no consideration for HIS property ? '
1	Therefore to have the opportunity of speaking to one so well informed about it as yourself , is an immense relief to me .
1	His tone lingered in the air , almost like the tone of a musical instrument .
1	We have arrngd for your being forded , carriage free , pr eight o'clock coach from <NAME> , on Monday morning next , to <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , where one of our clks will be in waiting to convey you to our offe as above .
1	' With pleasure , Monsieur. ' Thereupon the woman withdrew and left him to look at the room .
1	<NAME> <NAME> was lying back on his sofa , winking at his ceiling .
1	Not near the mark , not near the mark. ' ' Oh ! ' said <NAME> , watching him as he benevolently gulped down a good draught of his mixture .
1	I had told <NAME> of the terrible event , and it had greatly shocked him ; but there could be no doubt of the kindness of keeping it a secret , and he had come to help me in this last service .
1	" How does she use you , <NAME> ; how does she use you ? " she asked me again , with her witch-like eagerness , even in <NAME> 's hearing .
1	' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> was a tall figure , ' said <NAME> , ' a splendid woman , with a noble shape , and a nose , gentlemen , formed to command and be majestic .
1	' They keep ' em locked up there till they want ' em , ' resumed the little man .
1	' And I am so grateful to you for it , <NAME> , so bound to you , that there is no name for the affection of my heart .
1	A double tier of bedroom galleries , with old clumsy balustrades , ran round two sides of the straggling area , and a double row of bells to correspond , sheltered from the weather by a little sloping roof , hung over the door leading to the bar and coffee-room .
1	Come and kiss your Bluffy ! "
1	" Can it do any good ? "
1	<NAME> vistas of stately oaks and elm trees appeared on every side ; large herds of deer were cropping the fresh grass ; and occasionally a startled hare scoured along the ground , with the speed of the shadows thrown by the light clouds which swept across a sunny landscape like a passing breath of summer .
1	<NAME> <NAME> felt that Mrs. <NAME> had audaciously anticipated him , and presumed to be wiser than he .
1	' I beg your pardon ; not at all , ' contradiction rising in him .
1	" Ma wo n't be down for ever so long , " she said , " and then it 's a chance if breakfast 's ready for an hour afterwards , they dawdle so .
1	Only the subject we were speaking of , " said I , " was rather painful to me. " The action of her fingers was like the action of knitting .
1	She then seemed to come to it all at once .
1	It is no distance -- comparatively speaking ; and though consideration is due to the kindness of your proposal , I assure you that is a mere matter of form. ' Shall I ever forget how , in a moment , he was the most sanguine of men , looking on to fortune ; or how Mrs. Micawber presently discoursed about the habits of the kangaroo !
1	cried <NAME> , stopping again , and making several absent endeavours to put his candlestick in his pocket .
1	' Gone ! ' He remained in the same attitude , looking steadfastly at him .
1	How base would it be of me to take advantage of the circumstances which placed her here , or of the slight service I was happily able to render her , and to seek to engage her affections when the result must be , if I succeeded , that the brothers would be disappointed in their darling wish of establishing her as their own child , and that I must seem to hope to build my fortunes on their compassion for the young creature whom I had so meanly and unworthily entrapped : turning her very gratitude and warmth of heart to my own purpose and account , and trading in her misfortunes !
1	' Now , let me turn this matter over , and consider what I ought to have if I should help you to success. ' ' But don ' t be hard , ' cried old <NAME> , raising his hands with an imploring gesture , and speaking , in a tremulous voice .
1	The host allowed to <NAME> that it was a little monotonous .
1	She resides with me again .
1	This is to be hushed up if it can be .
1	It was the more necessary for his spirits , because , being of a sensitive temperament , he was apt to consider it personally disgraceful to himself that his master had no clients .
1	'Master of the workhouse , young man ! '
1	<NAME> <NAME> , sir , where is my brother Ned ? ' ' Gone out with <NAME> , about getting that unfortunate man into the hospital , and sending a nurse to his children , ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> <NAME> seemed afraid of a renewal of hostilities , and interposing began : ' <NAME> ! ' ' I beg your pardon , ' observed my aunt with a keen look .
1	said <NAME> , checking himself , with native majesty , 'this is them wicious paupers ! '
1	The evil spirit of his life had flitted away again , months ago , and he had heard no more of her since .
1	As he said this with his widest smile , and bent down close to her to pat his horse ' s neck , <NAME> meeting his eyes , saw , rather than heard him say , ' There is no news of the ship ! ' Confused , frightened , shrinking from him , and not even sure that he had said those words , for he seemed to have shown them to her in some extraordinary manner through his smile , instead of uttering them , <NAME> faintly said that she was obliged to him , but she would not write ; she had nothing to say .
1	He picked the people up at <NAME> , I think ? ' The phrase would have given nobody mortal offence .
1	I hope , " bursting into tears , " I may not repay him by doing him harm to-day. " Buzzing from the blue-flies .
1	In the midst of this sensation , the beadle arrives .
1	Do n't say any more , if you please , <NAME> .
1	<NAME> ' written thereon in pencil , was presently conducted by a Robber , with a very large belt and buckle round his waist , and very large leather gauntlets on his hands , into the presence of his former manager .
1	I could see in the action of <NAME> 's fingers as they worked that she attended to what I said ; but she did not look up .
1	We 've come a long way ; never mind .
1	<NAME> up , if you please , <NAME> Weller. ' ' I mean to speak up , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> ; ' I am in the service o ' that ' ere gen ' l ' man , and a wery good service it is. ' ' Little to do , and plenty to get , I suppose ? ' said <NAME> , with jocularity .
1	' Get along with you , or I ' ll have you carried out ! ' ' My comfort is , ' said <NAME> , looking back at Mr Dombey , ' that I have told a piece of truth this day which ought to have been told long before and can ' t be told too often or too plain and that no amount of <NAME> -- I hope the number of ' em mayn ' t be great ' ( here Mrs <NAME> uttered a very sharp ' Go along with you ! ' and <NAME> repeated the look ) ' can unsay what I have said , though they gave a whole year full of warnings beginning at ten o ' clock in the forenoon and never leaving off till twelve at night and died of the exhaustion which would be a Jubilee ! ' With these words , <NAME> preceded her foe out of the room ; and walking upstairs to her own apartments in great state , to the choking exasperation of the ireful <NAME> , sat down among her boxes and began to cry .
1	I will tell <NAME> to be careful of it .
1	And she has come back , a most beautiful and most elegant creature .
1	Of course , ' said her father , meditating .
1	She is eminently calculated for a mother-in-law .
1	A folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my attention , I opened it and found it to be the play-bill I had received from <NAME> , relative to the celebrated provincial amateur of <NAME> renown .
1	I really don ' t know what to say , ' replied Mrs. Curdle .
1	I have brought an old friend with me. ' Looking round , he saw <NAME> in her big cap which had been long abandoned , with a basket on her arm as in the bygone days , chuckling rapturously .
1	You heard him , but a little time ago .
1	I thall keep your brother here after the performanth .
1	Mrs Miff is not a student of political economy ( she thinks the science is connected with dissenters ; ' Baptists or <NAME> , or some o ' them , ' she says ) , but she can never understand what business your common folks have to be married .
1	He shook his head when I then asked him if she had recovered .
1	He is more courted than anyone else .
1	I have never known the wind to be in the east for a single moment since the day when he took me to the porch to read the name .
1	<NAME> night , _my_ friend and partner ! ' He shook his hand in saying this , as if there had been something serious at the bottom of their conversation ; and they separated .
1	<NAME> , doomed man , while she is near !
1	In one of these rooms , was a window looking into the street , where the child sat , many and many a long evening , and often far into the night , alone and thoughtful .
1	" The course of study and preparation requires to be diligently pursued , " observed my guardian with a glance at <NAME> .
1	'That 's for our share of the trouble , ' said <NAME> ; 'and not half enough , neither .
1	' My darling child , ' cried <NAME> , languidly , ' you are not nervous ?
1	My son is one of the last representatives of two old families .
1	' Ay , ' repeated <NAME> ; ' is it of the greatest consequence ? ' ' Of the very greatest consequence , ' replied <NAME> .
1	' I must leave you now , indeed . '
1	The two children now lay , through the good offices of <NAME> , in one room ; and it was not until the ladies were established at their tea-table that , happening to look towards the little beds , they thought of <NAME> .
1	When he opens the door , candle in hand , his cheerful face falls , and disappointed amazement is in it .
1	I hope the upholsterer may do the same. ' ' Why shouldn ' t he ? ' asked <NAME> , from the other side of the fire .
1	He came round at the appointed time , took out his jackknife , and sat down to his meal .
1	No , no ; confound and curse me !
1	( By this time he had found the eye-glass , and put it up again . )
1	But their self-forgetfulness charmed me .
1	And I 'm so happy and so thankful , miss , " cried <NAME> with a heaving heart , " and I 'll try to be such a good maid ! "
1	" But they ' re so cheap , " says the patient , comin ' down a little , " and so wery fillin ' at the price. " " They ' d be dear to you , at any price ; dear if you wos paid to eat ' em , " says the doctor .
1	The child beat his hand upon his heart ; and looked in his companion 's face , with tears of real agony .
1	Can ' t I make <NAME> terms with you on my friend ' s part , Mr Riah ? ' ' I am but the representative of another , sir , ' returned the Jew in a low voice .
1	Well , well ; it is not so difficult , you see , to tell me , after all .
1	She laid her hand on my arm , and hurried me on to one of the sombre streets , of which there are several in that part , where the houses were once fair dwellings in the occupation of single families , but have , and had , long degenerated into poor lodgings let off in rooms .
1	Its other name was <NAME> ; which is <NAME> , or <NAME> , or <NAME> , or all three -- or all one to me -- for enough. " " Enough <NAME> , " said I ; " that 's a curious name , miss. " " Yes , " she replied ; " but it meant more than it said .
1	Taking him into custody for that purpose , or overshadowing him as if he really were his <NAME> in visible form , Mr <NAME> clapped Mr <NAME> ' s hat upon the back of his head , and walked him out by the arm , asserting a proprietorship over his soul and body that was at once more grim and more ridiculous than anything in Mr <NAME> ' s rare collection .
1	<NAME> has pulled down his spectacles from his forehead , and walked out to the door .
1	<NAME> looks from <NAME> to the woman , and from the woman to <NAME> , waiting for one of them to unravel the riddle .
1	He says he particularly wants you to When I had taken this commission on myself prospectively , <NAME> relapsed into perfect silence ; and I , feeling quite worn out by all that had happened lately , lay down on a sack in the cart and fell asleep .
1	He at once threw himself on the astonished combatants , with his accustomed energy , and loudly called upon the bystanders to interpose .
1	I never saw or heard of any kind of misery that impressed me more than the wretchedness of this man .
1	We all conceived a prepossession in his favour , for there was a sterling quality in this laugh , and in his vigorous , healthy voice , and in the roundness and fullness with which he uttered every word he spoke , and in the very fury of his superlatives , which seemed to go off like blank cannons and hurt nothing .
1	<NAME> and I going to church , therefore , must have been a moving spectacle for compassionate minds .
1	' Dear me ! ' ' I little thought the first time I saw him , <NAME> , ' says <NAME> , pleased with the attorney ' s strong interest in his favourite , ' that I should come to be as intimate with him as I am now. ' ' Ah ! ' rejoins Mr <NAME> , brim-full of moral precepts and love of virtue .
1	' It mustn ' t be , ' said <NAME> .
1	If I had been round the world since we parted , we could hardly have been better pleased to meet again .
1	Why , he might have been going to reveal it the very morning when I examined the body !
1	What is your love to mine ?
1	My sister , having so much to do , was going to church vicariously , that is to say , <NAME> and I were going .
1	And he must be buried , you know . "
1	' I saw the writer yesterday. ' ' The writer ? ' ' Mr Dombey .
1	' What the devil ' s the matter ? ' groaned <NAME> , sitting upright on the couch .
1	He looked at him , as he passed through the hall and up the staircase , going to dinner , with a glazed fixedness that Mr <NAME> did not like .
1	Which is he ? " " I am he .
1	Not much in that , is there ?
1	<NAME> <NAME> taken , my mother !
1	I look upon you , sir , as a man who has placed himself beyond the pale of society , by his most audacious , disgraceful , and abominable public conduct .
1	The solitary child lived on , surrounded by this arabesque work of his musing fancy , and no one understood him .
1	What I am describing , slumbered , and half awoke , and slept again , in the innermost recesses of my mind .
1	He was very fond of her , and said when he took her up in his arms , still sleeping , that whenever he died he would wish to be buried where his dear little child had laid her head .
1	' What is termed a fine woman ; a splendid woman. ' ' Big nose , no doubt , ' is the quiet commentary again .
1	' Yes , there is , ' interposed the link-boy , ' I ' ve been a-ringing at it ever so long. ' ' It ' s only a handle , ' said Mrs. <NAME> , ' the wire ' s broken. ' ' I wish the servants ' heads wos , ' growled the long man .
1	She was eighty-nine if she was a day , and tries to pass upon us now , for ten year younger .
1	We ' ll make some regular <NAME> Nights of it. ' I felt extremely flattered by this arrangement , and we commenced carrying it into execution that very evening .
1	<NAME> Leicester snorts a little to hear the law laid down in this way , but in his honour and his love of truth , he freely , though silently , admits the justice of the ironmaster 's proposition .
1	Let them keep always at it .
1	Mrs <NAME> ' s first visit to the <NAME> ' s bride at the new abode of <NAME> , was a grand event .
1	That certainly IS the way I do it. ' ' And when all the rest of us are discussing our ventures , none of us ever know what a single venture of yours is ! ' ' And none of you ever will from me , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , with another internal chuckle ; ' that certainly IS the way I do it. ' ' Why of course it is , I know ! ' rejoined <NAME> , with a flourish of frankness , and a laugh , and stretching out his hands as if to show the universe a remarkable man in <NAME> .
1	I don ' t go so far as to ask for his lordship ; I only ask for his name .
1	I was called into that room which is now his -- I have never entered it since -- and came out , what you know me .
1	And he said , Now , this schoolroom is a Nation .
1	' I shall take the usual licence , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , as he placed a chair for the bride .
1	said Mrs. Sowerberry : looking piteously on the charity-boy .
1	' Here ' s a game ! ' roared the populace .
1	He had been , in his own person , connected with the incident he so pathetically described ; he had been by name remembered and commended in close association with it ; and his fortunes must have a particular interest in his employer ' s eyes .
1	Then <NAME> proposed : " A <NAME> Christmas to us all , my dears .
1	Oliver ate his share , and the Jew then mixed him a glass of hot gin-and-water : telling him he must drink it off directly , because another gentleman wanted the tumbler .
1	' Then good-morning , ma ' am , ' said <NAME> .
1	Oh , my Darling ! ' Overpowered by sudden grief , he sobbed aloud .
1	' <NAME> , what on earth -- do nothing for three or four weeks ! ' ' It is a long time , ma ' am , ' said <NAME> .
1	He let them fall , turned a smiling face upon her , and said , as he broke into a good-humoured laugh , ' Ay , <NAME> , lass , awlus a muddle .
1	I may have been seen to slap her face -- nothing more .
1	In our station-houses , men and women are every night confined on the most trivial charges -- the word is worth noting -- in dungeons , compared with which , those in <NAME> , occupied by the most atrocious felons , tried , found guilty , and under sentence of death , are palaces .
1	But , according to the success with which you put this and that together , you get a woman and a fish apart , or a Mermaid in combination .
1	Her husband added with some exultation , ' But you may thank your fortunate stars -- the same stars that made you Mrs Quilp -- you may thank them that I ' m upon the old gentleman ' s track , and have got a new light .
1	There he found <NAME> looking out of window , in a state of mind so disconsolate , that he was already half-disposed to ' go in ' for something else .
1	He then rubbed that out and turned the letter " r , " and asked me the same question .
1	Now , one side was down deep in the mire , and we were holding on to the other .
1	" Really , <NAME> , " returns the lawyer , " I state the fact .
1	And so little objection had <NAME> to being deferential in the last degree , that if he might have laid himself at Mr <NAME> ' s feet , or might have called him by some such title as used to be bestowed upon the <NAME> , he would have been all the better pleased .
1	' Now , <NAME> , who is that person ? ' said <NAME> , pointing to <NAME> , who , as the spokesman of his friends , stood hat in hand , bowing with the utmost politeness and respect .
1	It seems like making a great disturbance about nothing particular . "
1	' I am sorry I have troubled you unnecessarily , sir , ' said <NAME> .
1	And as to giving of you up , or reporting where you are , yes verily , and by <NAME> ' s help , so I won ' t , <NAME> catechism , make a note on ! ' This the <NAME> said , reference and all , in one breath , and with much solemnity ; taking off his hat at ' yes verily , ' and putting it on again , when he had quite concluded .
1	' Bunsby ! ' whispered the <NAME> , ' will you twice ? ' Bunsby wouldn ' t twice .
1	" So I am told , sir , " returned <NAME> , still musing and looking on the ground .
1	Oh , my dear Spyers , where is the villain ! "
1	'If you ever want me , I 'm here .
1	My employer -- ' Here <NAME> provokingly left off ; and began to peel the lemons that had been under my directions set before him , together with all the other appliances he used in making punch .
1	The very river , as though it shared one ' s feelings of compassion for the extinct tribes who lived so pleasantly here , in their blessed ignorance of white existence , hundreds of years ago , steals out of its way to ripple near this mound : and there are few places where the <NAME> sparkles more brightly than in the Big Grave Creek .
1	As the reflection died away , and a gloom went creeping up the wall , he watched it deepen , deepen , deepen , into night .
1	The sea has no appreciation of great men , but knocks them about like the small fry .
1	'If I thought it was , ' continued <NAME> ; 'if I thought as any one of 'em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance -- ' 'They would n't have dared to do it , love , ' responded the lady .
1	She spoke coarsely , but with no naturally coarse voice ; there was even something musical in its sound .
1	My poor dear Alfred , who is greatly worried just now about his affairs , went out rather early .
1	I depreciated <NAME> ; I depreciated <NAME> .
1	Everything was so strange -- the stranger from its being night in the day-time , the candles burning with a white flame , and looking raw and cold -- that I read the words in the newspaper without knowing what they meant and found myself reading the same words repeatedly .
1	Be that as it may , he had directed Mrs. Pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature of things must marry a title , and who was to be guarded from the acquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge .
1	It is but the death , it is all the same .
1	When papa came over to <NAME> , he confided everything he had to the same hands , and it is all swept away .
1	I don ' t kiss my coat-cuff ; I kisses the book. ' It was not so much in deference to these strong testimonials to character , as in his restless casting about for any way or help towards the discovery on which he was concentrated , that <NAME> replied : ' You needn ' t take offence .
1	' I ran up to her room ( which Mr Chivery showed me ) and found the door open , and that she had fainted on the floor , dear child .
1	It ' s my innings now , gov ' nor , and as soon as I catches hold o ' this ' ere <NAME> , I ' ll have a good ' un. ' ' I hope you will , <NAME> .
1	' What your uncle says is very true , <NAME> , my dear , ' said Mrs. Nickleby .
1	' You see , ' said <NAME> , ' knowing as you was partial to a little relish with your wittles when you was along with us , we took the liberty .
1	' I can not say , ' replied <NAME> .
1	' I do not think you ever will .
1	Yet it inspired him with an inward fortitude , that rose with his love .
1	Their looks are not prepossessing , and their manners are peculiar .
1	Let us set out in quest of adventures , and look for a furnished lodging .
1	' I am sure of it -- will be a great assistance and support to her .
1	And so all my endeavours to cancel the past and to raise myself in the world , and to raise you with me , are to be beaten down by <NAME> low whims ; are they ? ' ' I will not reproach you , Charley. ' ' Hear her ! ' exclaimed the boy , looking round at the darkness .
1	The celebration of a birthday in the family .
1	Seeing that Mr <NAME> invested himself in his every-day garments , he hastened to do the like , putting on his shoes before his stockings , and thrusting his legs into his coat sleeves , and making such other small mistakes in his toilet as are not uncommon to those who dress in a hurry , and labour under the agitation of having been suddenly roused .
1	But if such shadows flit before him to his bewilderment , there is one other shadow which he can name with something like distinctness even yet and to which alone he addresses his tearing of his white hair and his extended arms .
1	<NAME> <NAME> was for the most part plunged into deep gloom .
1	He was dressed in a canvas jacket , and a pair of such very stiff trousers that they would have stood quite as well alone , without any legs in them .
1	If you think it is a case of accidental death , you will find a verdict accordingly .
1	In the dark room -- for Mrs <NAME> ' s head was no better yet , though she expected to recover permanently to-morrow -- were that lady , <NAME> , and Mr Dombey .
1	Once there ( and it was always lurking thereabout ) , it is very active and nimble in Mrs. <NAME> 's breast , prompting her to nocturnal examinations of <NAME> 's pockets ; to secret perusals of <NAME> 's letters ; to private researches in the day book and ledger , till , cash-box , and iron safe ; to watchings at windows , listenings behind doors , and a general putting of this and that together by the wrong end .
1	As they were to remain with us that day and had taken their places to return by the coach next morning , I sought an opportunity of speaking to <NAME> .
1	' How can I see any objection to such a kind offer , sir ? ' replied <NAME> with his whole heart .
1	It would not extend beyond two people .
1	I saw you with money yesterday .
1	( I thank my honourable friend for that cheer . )
1	Even the two players at dominoes glanced up from their game , as if to protest against philosophical philanthropy being brought by name into the Break of Day .
1	And it is satisfactory to me , as your father , my dear <NAME> , to know that you do not come to the consideration of that question with the previous habits of mind , and habits of life , that belong to many young women. ' ' No , father , ' she returned , ' I do not. ' ' I now leave you to judge for yourself , ' said <NAME> .
1	The irresolute fingers fluttered more and more ineffectually about the trembling lip on every such occasion , and the sharpest practitioners gave him up as a hopeless job .
1	It is not in keeping .
1	Whether from too much east wind or no -- it was an easterly corner -- the stall , the stock , and the keeper , were all as dry as the Desert .
1	' If I dropped a tear upon your hand , may it wither it up !
1	There 's them that ca n't and that wo n't have <NAME> , -- yes , I know the name ! -- alive in the same land with them , and that 's had such sure information of him when he was alive in another land , as that he could n't and should n't leave it unbeknown and put them in danger .
1	It had evidently been a great distress to him , to have the days of his imprisonment recalled .
1	But the likeness ends outside .
1	He is a little man with a face all crushed together , who appears , from a certain blue and speckled appearance that one of his cheeks presents , to have been blown up , in the way of business , at some odd time or times .
1	In short , I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in hiding .
1	' I can not bear to see you so , sir , ' said Mrs. Sparsit .
1	However , he married the young lady , and they lived in a humble dwelling , probably possessing a porch ornamented with honeysuckle and woodbine twining , until she died .
1	What is a dainty repast to <NAME> is then set before him , and he begins to gulp the coffee and to gnaw the bread and butter , looking anxiously about him in all directions as he eats and drinks , like a scared animal .
1	My aunt had written her one of the odd , abrupt notes -- very little longer than a <NAME> note -- to which her epistolary efforts were usually limited .
1	It seemed , at first , as if all that had happened since the days when these objects were familiar to her were the shadows of a dream , but gradually , as the objects became more real to her sight , the events became more real to her mind .
1	You have business before you ; useful business .
1	" <NAME> , <NAME> , I 'm sorry to see you like this .
1	My opinion of the coal trade on that river is , that it may require talent , but that it certainly requires capital .
1	Agents were sent in quest of him , in all directions ; every stratagem that could be invented was resorted to , for the purpose of discovering his place of retreat ; but it was all in vain .
1	" I am not aware that it can . "
1	" Why , you see , <NAME> " -- he had caught the name from me -- " we are a-going at present into the next street .
1	It has been kept from her , and I hope will always be kept from her .
1	On a Monday morning , when <NAME> and I were at breakfast , I received the following letter from <NAME> by the post .
1	' Leave him alone , ' said the green-coated stranger ; ' brandy-and-water -- jolly old gentleman -- lots of pluck -- swallow this -- ah ! -- capital stuff. ' Having previously tested the virtues of a bumper , which had been mixed by the dismal man , the stranger applied the glass to <NAME> ' s mouth ; and the remainder of its contents rapidly disappeared .
1	' It ain ' t a very nasty one , ' returned <NAME> , rather embarrassed by the question .
1	The boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer , was about his own age : but one of the queerest looking boys that <NAME> had even seen .
1	' He is rather anxious , ' pursued the old gentleman , ' to have you in his own service -- take care what you ' re doing , or you will fall down and hurt yourself. ' ' To have me in his service , <NAME> ? ' cried <NAME> , who had stopped short in his work and faced about on the ladder like some dexterous tumbler .
1	At length , without the slightest notice , she opened her eyes again , and recommenced in a short , sharp manner : ' What happens then , I ask !
1	I reply , then , they are not identical with those of Mr .
1	' No one is useless in this world , ' retorted the Secretary , ' who lightens the burden of it for any one else. ' ' But I assure you I DON ' T , Mr Rokesmith , ' said <NAME> , half-crying .
1	Upon my soul you mustn ' t come into the place saying you want to know , you know , ' remonstrated <NAME> junior , turning about and putting up the eye-glass .
1	' But I am more than a lad , ' said <NAME> , with his clutching hand , ' and I WILL be heard , sir. ' ' As a schoolmaster , ' said <NAME> , ' you are always being heard .
1	Many ladies and gentleman , now grown up to be interesting members of society , have been indebted to her care .
1	His visitor professes his regret to hear it and asks him does he remember Jo .
1	" Yes , " returned <NAME> , " and you may suppose how mild it makes his gout .
1	But the offices are shut up now , <NAME> .
1	' Yes , ma ' am -- damn that <NAME> ! -- treacherous dog , <NAME> -- told the old lady -- old lady furious -- wild -- raving -- arbour -- Tupman -- kissing and hugging -- all that sort of thing -- eh , ma ' am -- eh ? ' ' Mr .
1	' -- It would be so useful to us afterwards , ' I went on .
1	There ' s something moving in the name .
1	A fleet of barges were coming lazily on , some sideways , some head first , some stern first ; all in a wrong-headed , dogged , obstinate way , bumping up against the larger craft , running under the bows of steamboats , getting into every kind of nook and corner where they had no business , and being crunched on all sides like so many walnut-shells ; while each with its pair of long sweeps struggling and splashing in the water looked like some lumbering fish in pain .
1	HE was open , liberal , gallant , gay ; I a crafty hunks of cold and stagnant blood , with no passion but love of saving , and no spirit beyond a thirst for gain .
1	My new life had lasted for more than a week , and I was stronger than ever in those tremendous practical resolutions that I felt the crisis required .
1	Between these two irreconcilable conclusions : the one , that what I felt was general and unavoidable ; the other , that it was particular to me , and might have been different : I balanced curiously , with no distinct sense of their opposition to each other .
1	Throughout , I had seemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him ; even now , I could not separate his voice from those voices , though those were loud and his was silent .
1	<NAME> , overhearing her , called up a look , to justify the eulogium , but it was hardly the right look .
1	We must know all about you. ' ' Yes , my deary , but not through letter-writing , because letter-writing -- indeed , writing of most sorts hadn ' t much come up for such as me when I was young .
1	' And when I heard what had happened before that snowy night , from some belonging to our town , ' cried <NAME> , ' the bitterest thought in all my mind was , that the people would remember she once kept company with me , and would say I had corrupted her !
1	At last they reached the passage on the ground floor , where the snoring of Mr Quilp and his legal friend sounded more terrible in their ears than the roars of lions .
1	' <NAME> , ' said his mistress and partner , flashing into a sudden energy that made <NAME> start , ' why do you goad me ?
1	His voice , short , deep , and resonant , is not at all unlike the tones of the instrument to which he is devoted .
1	" Hold ! " said <NAME> the <NAME> .
1	' Do you remain long here ? ' inquired Doctor Slammer of <NAME> , as they walked on most amicably together .
1	In a few instances , <NAME> , coming behind some under-sized young man with a shining hat on , and his sleek hair twisted into one flat curl on each side of his head , almost without glancing at him touches him with his stick , upon which the young man , looking round , instantly evaporates .
1	Her mild but earnest eyes met mine with their own beautiful frankness , and there was no change in her gentle face .
1	<NAME> <NAME> 's face expresses , so far as in its wooden material lies , the highest approbation and acquiescence .
1	" ' I do n't know how she 's there , ' says <NAME> , shivering dreadful with the horrors , 'but she 's standing in the corner at the foot of the bed , awful mad .
1	When I say we speak <NAME> and <NAME> , I mean they do .
1	' <NAME> comfort at this fireside , sir. ' ' Do you understand it , <NAME> ? ' ' Why , in a general way , sir , ' Mr <NAME> was beginning slowly and knowingly , with his head stuck on one side , as evasive people do begin , when the other cut him short : ' You <NAME> ' T understand it , <NAME> , and I ' ll explain it .
1	I shall look in by-and-by when I ' m out , to see how you get on , <NAME> .
1	I dare say they will report progress to-morrow morning . "
1	' But , <NAME> , my dear friend , ' said <NAME> , suddenly recovering his gravity , and drawing the great man ' s great man into a <NAME> , by the lappel of his coat ; ' you must persuade the <NAME> to see me , and my client here. ' ' Come , come , ' said the clerk , ' that ' s not bad either .
1	Her mother had taken it rather as a disturbance than otherwise , to be visited , as she reclined upon her sofa ; young people , <NAME> felt herself all unfit for ; Sissy she had never softened to again , since the night when the stroller ' s child had raised her eyes to look at <NAME> ' s intended wife .
1	' And <NAME> said , when he came just now to see for letters -- but what signifies what he says ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , reddening and breaking off .
1	I am exhausted. ' ' It is very bad weather , monsieur , ' said the landlady .
1	It only brought him in wexation .
1	This ballad , he informs Mrs. Bagnet , he considers to have been his most powerful ally in moving the heart of Mrs. Bucket when a maiden , and inducing her to approach the altar -- <NAME> 's own words are " to come up to the scratch . "
1	<NAME> <NAME> ' s heart was really too full to bear it , and he went upstairs to bed .
1	I may not dwell on all he did , to make the poor , weak creature love him , or my tale would have no end .
1	By degrees , however , the place resolved itself into a bare and dirty room , with a couple of windows , whereof a tenth part might be of glass , the remainder being stopped up with old copy-books and paper .
1	" I have done my best for you , <NAME> ; and my best is as good as another man 's , I believe. " It clearly being incumbent on some one to say , " Much better , " <NAME> said it ; perhaps not quite disinterestedly , but with the interested object of squeezing himself back again .
1	And touched him with the back of his hand upon the breast , and backed to his chair , and sat down on it with a pale face , holding the arms , and shaking his head at him .
1	But by obliging me to employ a boy , <NAME> has embarrassed me to that extent , overwhelmed as I am with public business , that I do n't know which way to turn .
1	' Time was , ' he said , ' when it was well to watch even your rising little star , and know in what quarter there were clouds , to shadow you if needful .
1	<NAME> alighted , took <NAME> by the hand , and they once again walked on .
1	To watch the shadows of the clouds and leaves , and seem to feel a sympathy with shadows .
1	Whom I so respect and honour -- whom I so devotedly love !
1	<NAME> , having nothing more to say , began to chalk , slowly and laboriously , on the table .
1	' Ah ! ' replied <NAME> , ' talk of the country , indeed !
1	He was jocular , too , as to the heeling of his shoes ; but became grave on the subject of his cravat , and promised her that , when she could afford it , she should buy him a new one .
1	During this interval , I glanced at <NAME> again , and observing the same expression on his face , and his eyes still directed to the distant light , I touched his arm .
1	<NAME> had but fifteen " <NAME> " a-week himself ; he pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his <NAME> name ; and yet the <NAME> Present blessed his four-roomed house !
1	I ' ll give him a shilling , presently .
1	But with such an extraordinary compromise between an unqualified assent and a qualified dissent , that his visitor was much disconcerted .
1	' Does the sister suffer under any stigma because of the impossible accusation -- groundless would be a better word -- that was made against the father , and substantially withdrawn ? ' ' <NAME> , sir , ' returned <NAME> , with a kind of anger .
1	This was a joke ; so <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , all the specials , and <NAME> , went into fits of laughter of five minutes ' duration .
1	His mother was on the stage. ' ' Was she ? ' rejoined <NAME> .
1	I never saw him before , in my life , but I instantly lay my finger on him and say " <NAME> ! " I see some cups and saucers of <NAME> make , equally strangers to me personally : I put my finger on them , then and there , and I say " <NAME> , <NAME> , and Canton. " It is the same with <NAME> , with <NAME> , and with bamboo and sandalwood from the <NAME> ; I put my finger on them all .
1	He nodded , twice or thrice , to a passing friend ; and , resisting as many invitations to take a morning dram , pressed steadily onward , until they were clear of the turmoil , and had made their way through <NAME> into <NAME> .
1	He made no mention of the way in which he had employed himself ; merely informing <NAME> that a letter addressed to him under his assumed name at the <NAME> Office , <NAME> , would readily find him , and entreating that worthy friend to write full particulars of the situation of his mother and sister , and an account of all the grand things that <NAME> had done for them since his departure from <NAME> .
1	' I am full of self-reproach that I might have known this and seen this , and known you and seen you , any time these dozen years , and that I never have .
1	<NAME> raised the hand that it might clasp her neck and join its fellow there .
1	You are going to see your nurse , I suppose ? ' ' Why , yes , ' I said , ' I must see <NAME> first of all. ' ' Well , ' replied <NAME> , looking at his watch .
1	' Not to see her , ' said <NAME> , ' though I could have seen her , I daresay , if I had asked , Mr Dombey being out of town : but to say a parting word to <NAME> .
1	I doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these perplexed distinctions. " His collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running cold , as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition .
1	For , all things moved so fast , and decree followed decree with that fierce precipitation , that now upon the third night of the autumn month of September , patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of <NAME> 's house , and had marked it with the tri-colour , and were drinking brandy in its state apartments .
1	Seeing <NAME> , the least expected of men , he looked wilder and said , ' What ' s the matter ? ' ' You asked me once what <NAME> ' s complaint was. ' ' Extraordinary answer !
1	" An extremely dangerous person in any community .
1	I see the blots I threw upon it , faded away .
1	But <NAME> argued the matter with me .
1	Hills swelling above each other ; and undulations shapely and uncouth , smooth and rugged , graceful and grotesque , thrown negligently side by side , bounded the view in each direction ; while frequently , with unexpected noise , there uprose from the ground a flight of crows , who , cawing and wheeling round the nearest hills , as if uncertain of their course , suddenly poised themselves upon the wing and skimmed down the long vista of some opening valley , with the speed of light itself .
1	I don ' t ask what it is , as you have not told me ; but the fact is so .
1	Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an unnatural heavy smear of eyebrow , who caught my eyes as we advanced , and said , when we came up with him , -- " Mr .
1	His eyes were on <NAME> for an instant , and then looked at the ground as he addressed the master of the house .
1	He bit his lip , frowned , laughed , and sat down in it , with a baffled , irresolute , impatient air , he was unable to conceal ; and biting his nail nervously , and looking at her sideways , with bitter discomfiture , even while he feigned to be amused by her caprice .
1	By sticking to it till one or two in the morning , I get oblivion .
1	We were all extremely glad to see <NAME> so put down , and exalted <NAME> to the skies : especially when he told us , as he condescended to do , that what he had done had been done expressly for us , and for our cause ; and that he had conferred a great boon upon us by unselfishly doing it .
1	' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , passing his hand over his forehead and turning suddenly round , as though the subject but that moment flashed upon him , ' what has become of <NAME> ? ' He had been sentenced to transportation for a great many years , she said .
1	Not so old as you think , friend , perhaps .
1	The more you value your number one , the more careful you must be of mine ; so we come at last to what I told you at first -- that a regard for number one holds us all together , and must do so , unless we would all go to pieces in company . '
1	Mr Toots generally said again , after a long interval of staring and hard breathing , ' How are you ? ' To which <NAME> again replied , ' Quite well , <NAME> , thank you. ' One evening Mr <NAME> was sitting at his desk , oppressed by correspondence , when a great purpose seemed to flash upon him .
1	<NAME> was a trying business to <NAME> , who seemed to have no natural power over a pen , but in whose hand every pen appeared to become perversely animated , and to go wrong and crooked , and to stop , and splash , and sidle into corners like a saddle-donkey .
1	<NAME> to see it accomplished , and yet patient , she waited for the last fall , as for the ripeness and fulness of the harvest of her hopes .
1	And it was clear he meant to do it .
1	<NAME> , there is a tall <NAME> clock behind you ( placed there , ' a purpose ) that has a loud beat when it is in motion and can play music .
1	And now you see , ' whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind , adjusting her shawls after the affectionate ceremony , ' I shall be worrying myself , morning , noon , and night , to know what I am to call him ! ' ' Mrs .
1	I , too , whose duty , and pride , and pleasure , <NAME> , it is to have other claims upon me which I will never forget ; and who have the means of a comfortable and happy life already , and have no right to look beyond it !
1	'We had our eyes fixed full upon each other ; and I could swear to him . '
1	' I shall not come to you to take lessons in the art , ma ' am ! ' retorted <NAME> .
1	It began to be said , among these shrewd observers , that <NAME> , of <NAME> ' s , was looking about him to see what he was worth ; and that he was calling in his money at a good time , like the long-headed fellow he was ; and bets were even offered on the <NAME> that <NAME> was going to marry a rich widow .
1	The leg of mutton came up very red within , and very pale without : besides having a foreign substance of a gritty nature sprinkled over it , as if if had had a fall into the ashes of that remarkable kitchen fireplace .
1	How it got into his head , I can ' t say ; I can only say that it never got out .
1	' Mind that , <NAME> ! ' he added , with unusual energy .
1	She took a step backward , and put out her hands in an undecided frightened way , as if to keep me off .
1	<NAME> , ' said the <NAME> , ' was quite vexed about him , poor thing ; so we have got him at home again ; and we have bought him a little Patent place , which agrees with him much better. ' I knew enough of <NAME> to suspect from this account that it was a place where there was not much to do , and which was pretty well paid .
1	All the partnership books and papers must remain in our possession ; all your books and papers ; all money accounts and securities , of both kinds .
1	On we go , all night , and by-and-by the day begins to break , and presently the first cheerful rays of the warm sun come slanting on us brightly .
1	When she first saw me , might she not be a little shocked and disappointed ?
1	Where the dexterity of the lawyers , eager to discover a flaw ?
1	" To hear the names he 's giving me !
1	" I would like to kiss her ! "
1	It 's a freehold , by <NAME> ! " " Is it indeed ?
1	" Now , <NAME> , " said he , " the best thing you can do is to go along with <NAME> to look after your Guster -- " " My Guster , Mr .
1	<NAME> , you shut up the shop ; say another word till your master comes home , at your peril ; and , when he does come home , tell him that <NAME> said he was to send a old woman 's shell after breakfast to-morrow morning .
1	I am in want of nothing .
1	I bore the weight of all our little cares , and all my projects ; <NAME> held the pens ; and we both felt that our shares were adjusted as the case required .
1	What a sweet singer you was when you first come !
1	I do not think I have ever experienced so strange a feeling in my life ( I am wiser now , perhaps ) as that of being with them , remembering how they had been employed , and seeing them enjoy the ride .
1	' Oh , if you please , you ' re to come upstairs , ' replied the tailor ' s daughter , with a smile .
1	But they recall no feeling of disgust or reluctance .
1	' If you can direct us , do .
1	For , coming along I had thought well of what I was going to say .
1	She suffers him to stand by the door and asks him what he wants .
1	Undertakings have been entered on , to swell the reputation of the <NAME> for vast resources , and to exhibit it in magnificent contrast to other merchants ' <NAME> , of which it requires a steady head to contemplate the possibly -- a few disastrous changes of affairs might render them the probably -- ruinous consequences .
1	But he was obliged to answer <NAME> ; and he saw a shade of disappointment on her face , as she checked a sigh , and looked at the low fire .
1	It was not too much trouble , and Mr <NAME> came up .
1	<NAME> <NAME> has worked like a -- I doen ' t know what <NAME> an ' t worked like , ' said <NAME> , looking at her , at a loss for a sufficiently approving simile .
1	Joy of D. who dances round J. while he eats his supper .
1	There ' s the <NAME> establishment , and there ' s your mother ' s <NAME> .
1	He saw us , as we took leave of each other .
1	These being cast on the floor in a promiscuous heap , yielded a quantity of occupation in arranging , erecting , and putting away ; the superintendence of which task evidently afforded the old gentleman extreme delight , and engaged him for some time with great briskness and activity .
1	From the goodness of all about me I derived such consolation as I can never think of unmoved .
1	I saw them quite hard at work , when I looked down through the open skylight .
1	' You have forgotten the water , sir , ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> ha ha ! ' All this time , <NAME> was rubbing his hands , and staring , with ludicrous surprise and dismay , at a great , goggle-eyed , blunt-nosed figure-head of some old ship , which was reared up against the wall in a corner near the stove , looking like a goblin or hideous idol whom the dwarf worshipped .
1	At that time , and for a good many weeks after that time , <NAME> was constant in his visits .
1	' You wouldn ' t mind my asking if it happened to be a job as you was come about , sir , would you ? ' asked <NAME> wistfully .
1	she cried , in a hollow voice .
1	The old man paused a moment while it was gently closed and fastened on the inside , and satisfied that this was done , walked on at a slow pace .
1	' He ' ll be off if you don ' t look sharp ! ' After this , whenever <NAME> dropped a curtsey to <NAME> in the presence of his family , and said in a faltering way , ' I beg your pardon , sir , for being troublesome—but—have you had any letter yet about me ? ' <NAME> would suspend the occupation of the moment , whatever it was , and look for the reply as earnestly as <NAME> did .
1	You have been a pleasant room to me , dear room .
1	We are extra official. " I cordially assented .
1	In the yard , was the man with the shadowy grievance respecting the Fund which the <NAME> embezzled , who had got up at five in the morning to complete the copying of a perfectly unintelligible history of that transaction , which he had committed to Mr <NAME> ' s care , as a document of the last importance , calculated to stun the Government and effect the <NAME> ' s downfall .
1	' I haven ' t nerve to play even if I could .
1	When I came home , she insisted upon my going to see it , and feel its pulse ; and when I told her to put a blister on its back , she seemed to enjoy it amazingly , and almost screamed with delight .
1	" Liz , you 're tired and ill. Let me take him . "
1	The surprise of <NAME> at this summary proceeding , great as it was , was immeasurably exceeded by the astonishment of the doctor .
1	As they go down the little street and the <NAME> pause for a minute looking after them , Mrs. Bagnet remarks to the worthy Lignum that <NAME> " almost clings to <NAME> like , and seems to be really fond of him . "
1	With a twitch -- not of her head merely , this time , but of her whole self -- the <NAME> went on tiptoe to Mr <NAME> ' s door , and knocked .
1	" By my soul , I thought him the worst-looking dog I had ever beheld when he was telling me to take the turning to the right .
1	But it was not my time yet , I was glad to tell her , for I should have been vexed to take her away then .
1	The moment they began to flag , the mischievous <NAME> , addressing <NAME> with great politeness , said -- ' Will you allow me to look at your paper , <NAME> , when you have quite done with it ? ' ' You will find very little to repay you for your trouble in this contemptible _thing_ , sir , ' replied <NAME> , bestowing a Satanic frown on <NAME> .
1	' I thought his cowardice and servility were the best guarantee for his keeping silence .
1	The sound was curiously flawed by the wind ; and I was listening , and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it , when I heard a footstep on the stair .
1	' I must go home , ' replied <NAME> , looking wildly round .
1	That , if <NAME> knew it , and at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life remarked that his beer was flat or thick , the conviction that he suspected tar in it , would bring a rush of blood to my face .
1	" The tall man is lost , and he is sought -- how many months ?
1	The old girl has another trial to undergo after the conclusion of the repast in sitting in state to see the room cleared , the hearth swept , and the dinner-service washed up and polished in the backyard .
1	<NAME> knew nothing about such questions , but he knew that his old home was a very poor place , and that his new one was very unlike it , and yet he was constantly looking back with grateful satisfaction and affectionate anxiety , and often indited square-folded letters to his mother , enclosing a shilling or eighteenpence or such other small remittance , which Mr Abel ' s liberality enabled him to make .
1	Among them all , none showed such fury as the man on horseback , who , throwing himself out of the saddle , and bursting through the crowd as if he were parting water , cried , beneath the window , in a voice that rose above all others , 'Twenty guineas to the man who brings a ladder ! '
1	Mrs. Markleham -- you have not forgotten Mrs. Markleham ? ' Forgotten the <NAME> !
1	<NAME> <NAME> is not here ? "
1	What have these pests of the earth been doing to _you_ ?
1	You must not be surprised to see him take me under his protection , for he has never forgotten that I was a low boy at school and that our friendship began in his knocking two of my head tyrant 's teeth out ( he says six ) before breakfast .
1	I was ingenuous and young , and I thought so .
1	' Let us cut this matter short , and not bandy words here with hare-brained profligates .
1	His neck was saved for the halter , but he got some painful and slow-healing injury for his trouble ?
1	As far as in me lies , I will deserve it , and if I have wavered in my bounden duty to them before , I am now determined to discharge it rigidly , and to put further delays and temptations beyond my reach. ' ' Before you say another word , dear <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , turning pale , ' you must hear what I have to tell you .
1	His door was opened , and the head of the elder <NAME> was put in a very little way , without being turned towards him .
1	To my horror and amazement it is full of sleepers in every stage , shape , attitude , and variety of slumber : in the berths , on the chairs , on the floors , on the tables , and particularly round the stove , my detested enemy .
1	There were three young women in adjoining cells , all convicted at the same time of a conspiracy to rob their prosecutor .
1	Your manner , which I must say does not seem intended to propitiate , induces me to think it possible .
1	I devote myself at daybreak to-morrow morning , to bringing <NAME> here .
1	And how different the parting with them was , from any she had expected , and most of all from that which she had oftenest pictured to herself .
1	Mr <NAME> did not return upon the next day , or the next , or for several days ; and in the meanwhile <NAME> , without any new alarm , lived like a quiet bird in a cage , at the top of the old Instrument-maker ' s house .
1	In the first place , I had made a perfect brute of myself to you , on the subject of <NAME> ; and I felt that if you were asked to any wedding of mine , you would naturally expect that it was with <NAME> , which involved explanations , that upon my word and honour , at that crisis , would have knocked me completely over .
1	And he is in prison . "
1	She was surprised to find a bright light burning ; still more surprised , on looking in , to see that her <NAME> , but partially undressed , was sitting near the ashes of the fire , which had crumbled and dropped away .
1	" I was new here once , " said <NAME> .
1	I saw the wasted limbs -- which a few hours before had been distorted for the amusement of a boisterous gallery , writhing under the tortures of a burning fever -- I heard the clown ' s shrill laugh , blending with the low murmurings of the dying man .
1	It was a great comfort and surprise to me to find him in his low state cheerful and looking forward .
1	' This man alarming you again !
1	Then , the <NAME> locks the iron-barred gates that divide the sanctuary from the chancel , and all of the procession having scuttled into their places , hide their faces ; and then the intoned words , ' WHEN THE <NAME> MAN— ' rise among groins of arches and beams of roof , awakening muttered thunder .
1	' <NAME> true , ' returned <NAME> , shaking his head : ' but I meant a life of habit , <NAME> -- that sort of custom .
1	He stopped short at the door on seeing a stranger , twirled in his hand a perfectly round old hat without any vestige of a brim , and resting himself now on one leg and now on the other and changing them constantly , stood in the doorway , looking into the parlour with the most extraordinary leer I ever beheld .
1	Now -- shall I take you in ? ' ' <NAME> , uncle , ' said <NAME> , a little flurried , as people much more conversant with society often are , when they are about to enter a room full of strangers , and have had time to think of it previously , ' are there any ladies here ? ' ' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , shortly , ' I don ' t know any. ' ' Must I go in immediately ? ' asked <NAME> , drawing back a little .
1	cried Monks , in a voice which , from its very suppression , seemed only the more furious .
1	I had given my darling to him now , and I meant to go ; but I lingered for one more look of the precious face which it seemed to rive my heart to turn from .
1	My aunt took her hand in hers , and laughed .
1	All this was gall and wormwood to the heart of <NAME> ; and when groups of children bounded out of the houses , tripped across the road , and were met , before they could knock at the opposite door , by half a dozen curly-headed little rascals who crowded round them as they flocked upstairs to spend the evening in their Christmas games , <NAME> smiled grimly , and clutched the handle of his spade with a firmer grasp , as he thought of measles , scarlet fever , thrush , whooping-cough , and a good many other sources of consolation besides .
1	At last , biting her thin lips , and bridling up , she said -- ' It can ' t be .
1	If I might make so bold as to defend that extravagant conception , Mr Merdle , I would hint that it originated after the Railroad-share epoch , in the times of a certain <NAME> bank , and of one or two other equally laudable enterprises .
1	I bar , ' said <NAME> , <NAME> , thoughtfully .
1	I really don ' t know , <NAME> .
1	My deary , deary , deary , wife of <NAME> and mother of his little child !
1	When we came near the churchyard , we had to cross an embankment , and get over a stile near a sluice-gate .
1	said Mrs. Bumble , in a voice of command .
1	' I didn ' t know it would be so ; it was impossible for me to foresee it .
1	The figure stood quite still , and so did she ; not boldly , but of necessity ; for going back into the room was hardly less terrible than going on .
1	<NAME> , quite unconscious , reads on through his double eye-glass , occasionally stopping to remove his glass and express approval , as " Very true indeed , " " Very properly put , " " I have frequently made the same remark myself , " invariably losing his place after each observation , and going up and down the column to find it again .
1	For , we turn up our eyes and say that we are all alike in death , and we might turn them down and work the saying out in this world , so far .
1	' He ' s shocked at the way your father goes on in , ' replied Mrs. Weller .
1	It ' s only to say that I shall see him to-morrow or maybe next day , and that I couldn ' t do that little business for him this morning .
1	' It seems to me , ' said <NAME> , ' that you have had no money at all , ever since we have been married. ' ' What seems to you , ' said Mr Lammle , ' to have been the case , may possibly have been the case .
1	Would you take a seat in Mr Lightwood ' s room , sir , while I look over our Appointment Book ? ' <NAME> made a great show of fetching from his desk a long thin manuscript volume with a brown paper cover , and running his finger down the day ' s appointments , murmuring , ' Mr Aggs , Mr Baggs , Mr Caggs , Mr Daggs , Mr Faggs , Mr Gaggs , Mr Boffin .
1	But though he was afraid to make up to them , he couldn ' t bear to lose sight of them ; so when they walked faster he walked faster , when they lingered he lingered , and when they stopped he stopped ; and so they might have gone on , until the darkness prevented them , if <NAME> had not looked slyly back , and encouragingly beckoned <NAME> to advance .
1	That fellow ! ' said <NAME> , beating a lump of coal on the top of the fire , with the poker .
1	Then why should they quarrel with us ?
1	That 's a nice innocent place to live in , ai n't it ? "
1	" It makes no pretensions , but it is a comfortable little place , I hope , and will be more so with such bright young looks in it .
1	Thus , they lingered on till the hour of separating for the night was long past ; and then they found that they might as well have given vent to their real feelings before , for they could not suppress them , do what they would .
1	Mrs <NAME> stopped in her lamentations on the corruption of human nature , even when beckoned to the paths of virtue by a <NAME> ; and received her with a welcome something short of the reception due to none but perfect Dombeys .
1	Remember of what importance you are to society , and do not allow yourself to be worried by what is so very inconsiderately told you by people who ought to know better .
1	' When , ' said <NAME> , as he took the piece of paper , ' when shall I call again ? ' This was addressed to the daughter , but the father answered immediately .
1	Indeed , the poor little creature experienced so much trouble and delay from having to grope for these articles of dress in mud and kennel , and suffered in these researches so much jostling , pushing , squeezing and bandying from hand to hand , that by the time she reached the street in which the notary lived , she was fairly worn out and exhausted , and could not refrain from tears .
1	It had been almost dark before , but now it seemed quite dark , and soon afterwards very dark .
1	Its gentle touch , though it had been light and instantaneous , appeared still present to the old man 's sense of feeling .
1	When they are shut into the back room , they speak low .
1	' <NAME> , ' cried <NAME> eagerly , as he looked from the coach window , ' they are at the corner of the lane still !
1	' Ah , my beloved Lizzie ! ' he said , faintly .
1	He was taken on board , and instantly manacled at the wrists and ankles .
1	hush ! ' cried <NAME> , suddenly starting up , and covering <NAME> ' s mouth with his trembling hand .
1	Now , <NAME> , I am employed by <NAME> , <NAME> , to follow her and find her , to save her and take her his forgiveness .
1	' How now ? ' said <NAME> , looking sternly round .
1	' My house , ' answered the disconsolate <NAME> , affected perhaps by its loneliness .
1	The other had that likeness too -- as you have -- but was not the same .
1	In the pleasant towns of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , her figure came to be quite well known for some short weeks , and then again passed on .
1	Never were such shouts heard as those which greeted <NAME> ' s efforts to fix the sugar-loaf hat on his head , by way of entering the garden in style .
1	The pint-pots were great strokes of genius : but the milk-can was a perfect masterpiece . '
1	Then she asked : ' Did your father know so much himself , that he wished you to be well taught too , <NAME> ? ' <NAME> hesitated before replying , and so plainly showed her sense that they were entering on forbidden ground , that <NAME> added , ' No one hears us ; and if any one did , I am sure no harm could be found in such an innocent question. ' ' No , <NAME> , ' answered <NAME> , upon this encouragement , shaking her head ; ' father knows very little indeed .
1	' No , not exactly. ' ' Figures of some sort , I would venture a bet , ' said <NAME> .
1	You understand to what I allude , Mr Wegg ?
1	Give him several to take away .
1	This will be a blow to him , I am much afraid ! ' She hurried on , without resting , and hurried on until they had passed under the gatehouse into the street ; once there , she asked : ' Has he followed us ?
1	' You will be glad to talk together. ' As his uneasy figure went on before them among the evening shadows , the boy said to his sister , petulantly : ' When are you going to settle yourself in some <NAME> sort of place , <NAME> ?
1	' " Who calls so loud ? " ' cried <NAME> .
1	Some evil-minded person who had seen him come upstairs with a handsome watch in his hand , perhaps .
1	Sensible of the risk he ran , the <NAME> took leave of <NAME> , at those times , with the solemnity which became a man who might never return : exhorting him , in the event of his ( the <NAME> ' s ) being lost sight of , for a time , to tread in the paths of virtue , and keep the brazen instruments well polished .
1	The two opposing kinds of pride confronting one another , I can see , even in this <NAME> ; the gentleman 's , all negligent indifference ; the peasant 's , all trodden-down sentiment , and passionate revenge .
1	The weightiest of men had said to projectors , ' Now , what name have you got ?
1	I was prepared for a great change in him , after what I had heard from <NAME> , but his appearance shocked me .
1	' I submit that , in the present company , that ' ere song ' s political ; and , wot ' s much the same , that it ain ' t true .
1	He also wrote a pamphlet , addressed to the seventeen learned societies , native and foreign , containing a repetition of the statement he had already made , and rather more than half intimating his opinion that the seventeen learned societies were so many ' humbugs. ' Hereupon , the virtuous indignation of the seventeen learned societies being roused , several fresh pamphlets appeared ; the foreign learned societies corresponded with the native learned societies ; the native learned societies translated the pamphlets of the foreign learned societies into <NAME> ; the foreign learned societies translated the pamphlets of the native learned societies into all sorts of languages ; and thus commenced that celebrated scientific discussion so well known to all men , as the <NAME> controversy .
1	She observes him very cautiously , as though mentally feeling her way to her next remark .
1	They were looking at the birds , while a medical gentleman who was so good as to attend <NAME> with much solicitude and compassion spoke with her cheerfully by the fire .
1	If she went to <NAME> , and told her what had passed , that very act might bring down the irreparable mischief that he threatened he had the power , and that she knew he had the will , to do .
1	To have struggled with him in the street , or to have exacted any lower recompense from him than his heart 's best blood , would have been futile and degrading .
1	But he has repressive power , and she has none .
1	With his quadrant at his round black knob of an eye , and his figure in its old attitude of indomitable alacrity , the <NAME> displayed his elfin small-clothes to the best advantage , and , absorbed in scientific pursuits , had no sympathy with worldly concerns .
1	Everything within the house and without , seemed to be the perfection of neatness and order .
1	' Why , it ' s that very house ; she ' s been living there these six weeks .
1	' Mr Wrayburn , I desire to say something to you on my own part. ' ' Come , come , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , with a languid approach to impatience as the other again struggled with himself ; ' say what you have to say .
1	' She was off somewhere at daybreak this morning .
1	That you can find out .
1	Mr <NAME> was much distressed when the quarter of an hour expired , and came hopping in , a very bad second .
1	Yet what did <NAME> expect ?
1	I have got three sacks of ladies ' hair below , but none so beautiful and fine as this .
1	As his own position was not a very pleasant one until the matter was set at rest one way or other , he did so ; and <NAME> , plying her snuff-box at a most wasteful rate , corroborated his account .
1	His life is a mystery to the partner of his joys and sorrows -- I again allude to his wife -- and if I should assure you that beyond knowing that it is passed from morning to night at the office , I now know less of it than I do of the man in the south , connected with whose mouth the thoughtless children repeat an idle tale respecting cold plum porridge , I should adopt a popular fallacy to express an actual fact .
1	Spiritual revelations were conceded to <NAME> at that favoured period , as at this .
1	<NAME> , try ! ' His friend gave him what aid he could , and encouraged him to believe that he was more composed , though even then his eyes were losing the expression they so rarely recovered .
1	I judged him to be about my own age , but he was much taller , and he had a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance .
1	<NAME> , sir , ' returned brother <NAME> : no less mildly than before , but firmly too : ' I come here against my will , sorely and grievously against my will .
1	' No , ' the man assented in a surly way ; ' my letter -- it ' s wrote by my daughter , but it ' s mine -- is about my business , and my business ain ' t nobody else ' s business. ' As <NAME> passed out at the gate with an undecided foot , he heard it shut behind him , and heard the footstep of the man coming after him .
1	What had once , and at no remote period , been called , even by the erudite <NAME> herself , ' the half ; ' but what was now called , as being more elegant , and more strictly collegiate , ' the term , ' would expire to-morrow .
1	' <NAME> ' t ! ' Old Sol endeavoured to assume a cheery look , and smiled across the little table at him as pleasantly as he could .
1	When he had said goodbye all round and came to <NAME> , he could not but mark the difference between their present separation and their parting at <NAME> .
1	My first question when I saw <NAME> had been of course , whether all was well down the river ?
1	" And as <NAME> and you are happily good friends , I should like to know , " said my guardian , " what you think , my dear .
1	' Do you think they WERE crooked ? ' said <NAME> , in an insinuating tone .
1	I told him seven shillings .
1	They expected me home before <NAME> ; but had no idea of my returning so soon .
1	' When he ' s well he do , ' she answered .
1	' No , Pa. ' ' Is there anybody else who would take his chance between Yes and <NAME> , if you would let him , my dear ? ' ' Not that I know of , Pa. ' ' There can ' t be somebody who won ' t take his chance when you want him to ? ' said the cherub , as a last resource .
1	The piping is carried above your jistes , and it is best that it should be made known to you. ' <NAME> and <NAME> exchanged looks of some dismay , though they had not the least idea what latent horrors this carriage of the piping might involve .
1	This made him doubt whether he had locked his door last night , and feel a little surprised at having a companion in the room .
1	What do you say ? ' ' To the system ? ' inquired Traddles , looking grave .
1	I have seen passion in many forms , but I have never seen it in such a form as that .
1	Never let us be parted any more , <NAME> .
1	If we have n't all three met here without meaning it ! "
1	They are married , and have signed their names in one of the old sneezy registers , and the clergyman ' s surplice is restored to the dust , and the clergyman is gone home .
1	It was remarkable ( but perhaps the wretched life he had led accounted for it ) that he was the least anxious of any of us .
1	' I must leave you somewhere for a few minutes , ' said the schoolmaster , at length breaking the silence into which they had fallen in their gladness .
1	There ain ' t a gent ' lman in all the land -- nor yet sailing upon all the sea -- that can love his lady more than I love her , though there ' s many a common man -- would say better -- what he meant. ' I thought it affecting to see such a sturdy fellow as <NAME> was now , trembling in the strength of what he felt for the pretty little creature who had won his heart .
1	' Oh ! ' sneered <NAME> , looking after him as she entered .
1	And there was a passive congeniality between them , besides this active one .
1	We had no more purchases to make now ; I had completed all his packing early in the afternoon ; and our time was disengaged until night , when he was to go to <NAME> for <NAME> .
1	<NAME> <NAME> ' s oration upon this occasion , together with the debate thereon , is entered on the Transactions of the <NAME> .
1	A noticeable relaxation of discipline had for some few days pervaded the <NAME> ' House .
1	<NAME> and strange among this wealth of colour and voluptuous glitter , strange and constrained towards its haughty mistress , whose repellent beauty it repeated , and presented all around him , as in so many fragments of a mirror , he was conscious of embarrassment and awkwardness .
1	said <NAME> when they had returned .
1	Turning his eyes towards the door , they encountered the new-comer ; and in him , through his rags and dirt , he recognised the familiar features of <NAME> .
1	<NAME> down into my place ! " and flung himself in the sea ! ' The kindling eye and heightened colour of the boy , who had risen from his seat in the earnestness of what he said and felt , seemed to remind old Sol of something he had forgotten , or that his encircling mist had hitherto shut out .
1	' See after your friend , and be in the way to-morrow at one .
1	He was a year younger than I , and young-looking even when that allowance was made .
1	Oh , if you knew how my heart is torn .
1	So we got on , until she was able to smile , and then to laugh , and then to sit up , half ashamed ; while <NAME> recalled her stray ringlets , dried her eyes , and made her neat again , lest her uncle should wonder , when she got home , why his darling had been crying .
1	<NAME> him to drink it , <NAME> . '
1	The little dressmaker stood up at the foot of the bed , humming her song , and nodded to him brightly .
1	If I am correctly informed , he is cognizant of the business on which I wish to speak to you . '
1	Who gave them out , whence they last came , where they began , through what agency they crookedly quivered and jerked , scores at a time , over the heads of the crowd , like a kind of lightning , no eye in the throng could have told ; but , muskets were being distributed -- so were cartridges , powder , and ball , bars of iron and wood , knives , axes , pikes , every weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise .
1	Therefore , I note here , though it may not be at all necessary , that there are hundreds of <NAME> ( as they are called ) , far more remarkable than that fancied in this book ; and that the stores of the Prerogative Office teem with instances of testators who have made , changed , contradicted , hidden , forgotten , left cancelled , and left uncancelled , each many more wills than were ever made by the elder Mr Harmon of <NAME> .
1	She was not , indeed , withheld by the same considerations as her agreeable friend ; for , having recently removed into the neighborhood of <NAME> from the remote but genteel suburb of <NAME> , she was not under the same apprehension of being recognised by any of her numerous acquaintances .
1	Good-bye , <NAME> ! ' and with a kiss for each Miss <NAME> turned to the door .
1	' You bring Trent to me .
1	Then the strong-rooms underground , at <NAME> 's , with such of their valuable stores and secrets as were known to the passenger ( and it was not a little that he knew about them ) , opened before him , and he went in among them with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle , and found them safe , and strong , and sound , and still , just as he had last seen them .
1	Stay. ' He hastily put away a padlocked cash-box that was on the table , and substituted in its stead an empty purse .
1	That , <NAME> , having been solemnly assured by one not then producible that <NAME> was not the son of <NAME> , and this person having offered to make oath to that effect , if necessary , they had by this communication been first led to doubt the claim set up , which they would otherwise have seen no reason to dispute , supported as it was by evidence which they had no power of disproving .
1	There they are always as he first imagined them—an old man on the right ; a younger man upon the left—whose hidden features torture him to death , and have a mystery that makes him tremble .
1	' Have you got your gloves on ? ' Yes , Sir. ' ' Then take the kiver off. ' ' Yes , Sir. ' The greengrocer did as he was told , with a show of great humility , and obsequiously handed <NAME> the carving-knife ; in doing which , he accidentally gaped .
1	In the same spirit he said to the gate-porter as he went out , ' If some one staying in the hotel should wish to send across the road to me in the night , a crown will be ready for the messenger. ' In the same spirit , he walked up and down outside the iron gate for the best part of an hour , with some solicitude ; occasionally looking in between the bars , as if he had laid a dove in a high roost in a cage of lions , and had it on his mind that she might tumble out .
1	Where can I have it , <NAME> ? ' <NAME> ' s knowledge of <NAME> was extensive and peculiar .
1	What have you got to say to me ? ' ' Bless you , <NAME> -- <NAME> , I mean -- a great many things , if you will come away somewhere , where we can talk comfortably .
1	Every one waited with his grasp set , and his body bent down to the work , ready to reverse and wind in .
1	I know that in the novelty of possessing a tithe of such means as <NAME> has placed at your disposal , ladies are apt to run into a sudden extreme .
1	I could no more have removed my eyes from her pale face than I could have stirred from the bench on which I sat .
1	That done , he replaced the candle and took the hand again .
1	I have been thinking , sir , for some time , that I was getting it , and now I have got it .
1	<NAME> <NAME> had been looking for us .
1	Morning came ; and the little cottage was lonely and still .
1	' Ah , <NAME> -- a precious seedy-looking customer .
1	This was first put into my head by his seeing a shoot that had come up in the night , and saying , " What , <NAME> ?
1	So let it be. ' After yielding herself up , in this pattern manner , to sisterly advice and the force of circumstances , <NAME> became quite benignant : as one who had laid her own inclinations at the feet of her dearest friend , and felt a glow of conscience in having made the sacrifice .
1	The wickets were pitched , and so were a couple of marquees for the rest and refreshment of the contending parties .
1	I appeal to our mutual friend Smallweed whether he has or has not heard me remark that I ca n't make him out . "
1	'Your tale is of the longest , ' observed Monks , moving restlessly in his chair .
1	Her little stock of money amounted to but a few guineas .
1	' I wish it would kill something of its own accord. ' ' It ' ll do that afore long , <NAME> , ' observed the tall man , in a low , prophetic voice .
1	She also stumbled , with a large balance of success against her failures , through various philanthropic recommendations to Try our Mixture , Try our <NAME> , <NAME> our Orange-flavoured Pekoe , challenging competition at the head of <NAME> ; and various cautions to the public against spurious establishments and adulterated articles .
1	For scores of years gone by , <NAME> had squeezed it and wrung it , and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures of the chase -- now , found in hunting the people ; now , found in hunting the beasts , for whose preservation <NAME> made edifying spaces of barbarous and barren wilderness .
1	Upon reference to the book , it appeared that the dozen secretaryships had dwindled down to one .
1	Now , the man who did the sexton ' s duty was a little older than he , though much more active .
1	If I don ' t brood over all I want , it is the better for me , and not the worse for anyone .
1	No favoring in this shop .
1	" Hah ! " said <NAME> at last , as he moved towards the papers on the table .
1	It ' s a satisfaction to know that she ' ll wait for me any length of time , and that she really is the dearest girl -- ' ' When are you to meet her at the coach ? ' I ask .
1	It was on this very first day that I had the misfortune to throw her , though she was not subject to such weakness in general , into a state of violent consternation .
1	I wonder you do n't starve in your own way also .
1	That more than this she would never ( and he was well persuaded of the steadfastness of her resolution ) for any human consideration disclose .
1	Therefore I had wanted to be alone , and therefore I said , now alone , in my own room , " Esther , if you are to be happy , if you are to have any right to pray to be true-hearted , you must keep your word , my dear . "
1	After solemn argument , this point ( with others of a technical nature , whose humorous extravagance it would be difficult to exaggerate ) was referred to the judges for their decision , <NAME> being meantime removed to his former quarters .
1	Gravely , <NAME> , for the subject is grave enough , you know how it is as well as I do .
1	Is that the boat , where I see a light yonder ? ' ' That ' s the boat , ' said I .
1	Their money may be soon got out of them , without violence , ' said the man .
1	What the deuce is it all about ?
1	Now , my bachelor gatehouse is a few yards from here , and the heater is on the fire , and the wine and glasses are on the table , and it is not a stone ' s throw from <NAME> .
1	To put before you any appeal to reconsider your purpose or to set narrow limits to it , would be , I feel , not less so .
1	I am incapable of designs .
1	that ' s not a general rule by any means , ' observed Mrs. Nickleby ; ' for I remember , as well as if it was only yesterday , employing one that I was particularly recommended to , to make me a scarlet cloak at the time when scarlet cloaks were fashionable , and she had a very red face -- a very red face , indeed. ' ' Perhaps she drank , ' suggested <NAME> .
1	And yet other ears and eyes were there and greedily taking in all that passed , and moreover they were the ears and eyes of no less a person than Mr <NAME> , who , having entered unseen when the child first placed herself at the old man ' s side , refrained -- actuated , no doubt , by motives of the purest delicacy -- from interrupting the conversation , and stood looking on with his accustomed grin .
1	<NAME> <NAME> kept his word , and remained unmarried , for two years .
1	' Get off ! ' cried <NAME> , indignant at this process , and vainly endeavouring to extricate himself from the grasp of his enthusiastic acquaintance .
1	Thus <NAME> had grown to be an amiable , giddy , wilful , winning little creature ; spoilt , in the sense of counting upon kindness from all around her ; but not in the sense of repaying it with indifference .
1	' You ' re the best of human creatures .
1	I am glad to see you , and glad you are not too proud to know me . "
1	<NAME> <NAME> was very red and hot , for your outlaws are desperate fellows to shout .
1	' None of your close shavers the <NAME> ain ' t .
1	It is lowly , but airy , open at the back , and considered one of the 'ealthiest outlets .
1	' Never read anything but letters and accounts .
1	Even when he kissed her -- and I never saw him approach her , but I felt that nature had given him the soul of a gentleman -- she seemed to cling closer to her uncle , even to the avoidance of her chosen husband .
1	With the thought , her purity and goodness came before him in their brightest light .
1	I can ' t , ' replied the girl ; ' <NAME> raked out the kitchen fire afore she went to bed , and locked up the kittle. ' ' Oh , never mind ; never mind .
1	That woman , <NAME> , is always the same -- always the same bustling , lively , active , saving creetur that you see her now. ' <NAME> sighed involuntarily at the thought of the agreeable domestic prospect thus opened to him ; but <NAME> was , fortunately , too much occupied with his own reflections to perceive it .
1	He is the greatest tyrant that every lived , she daren ' t call her soul her own , he makes her tremble with a word and even with a look , he frightens her to death , and she hasn ' t the spirit to give him a word back , no , not a single word. ' Notwithstanding that the fact had been notorious beforehand to all the tea-drinkers , and had been discussed and expatiated on at every tea-drinking in the neighbourhood for the last twelve months , this official communication was no sooner made than they all began to talk at once and to vie with each other in vehemence and volubility .
1	He was obviously very ill at ease , however .
1	<NAME> does not see , otherwise , what he has to do with marriage .
1	It was <NAME> , <NAME> . "
1	' Here they are , you see , ' said Mr Meagles .
1	' To ask you if you ' ll have another rasher would be unmeaning flattery , for it would make you thirsty all day .
1	They parted , therefore , in the friendliest manner , and with the kindest feeling on both sides .
1	" How long should I have to hold out ? "
1	Come here , my little witch !
1	But I never own to it before her .
1	The child readily complied , and he went out .
1	<NAME> of paint , bare of paper on the walls , bare of furniture , bare of experience of human life .
1	' Then what do you think , mother , has become of ' em ?
1	A man with no hat , and with broken shoes , and with an old rag tied round his head .
1	I rather think the gov ' nor wants to have a word and a half with you , Sir. ' <NAME> bestowed a look of intelligence on <NAME> , intimating that he understood he was not to say he had been sent for ; and beckoning him to approach , whispered briefly in his ear .
1	He was a snub-nosed , flat-browed , common-faced boy enough ; and as dirty a juvenile as one would wish to see ; but he had about him all the airs and manners of a man .
1	Sikes and his companion enveloped their necks and chins in large dark shawls , and drew on their great-coats ; <NAME> , opening a cupboard , brought forth several articles , which he hastily crammed into the pockets .
1	I know as well that you feel none towards me .
1	At breakfast-time my sister declared her intention of going to town with us , and being left at <NAME> 's and called for " when we had done with our fine ladies " -- a way of putting the case , from which <NAME> appeared inclined to augur the worst .
1	" It-can't-be , " muttered <NAME> , retrospectively , and idling his glass ( which fortunately was a small one ) again .
1	Give him time to get rid of it , you know .
1	To an unfortunate bachelor of a fellow who has lived alone all his life , you know , it ' s positively delicious .
1	Without stopping to inquire whether the intervening day appeared to <NAME> to consist of the usual number of hours of the ordinary length , it may be remarked that , to the parties more directly interested in the forthcoming ceremony , it passed with great rapidity , insomuch that when <NAME> awoke on the succeeding morning in the chamber of <NAME> , she declared that nothing should ever persuade her that that really was the day which was to behold a change in her condition .
1	<NAME> <NAME> eyed the old man with great curiosity , and the remainder of the company smiled , and looked on in silence .
1	said <NAME> , walking again at a great pace , with a candle in his hand that had gone out .
1	Such an amazing power of taking people by surprise ! ' <NAME> paid no regard whatever to these compliments , nor to the dubious and frightened look into which the lawyer gradually subsided , nor to the shrieks of his wife and mother-in-law , nor to the latter ' s running from the room , nor to the former ' s fainting away .
1	In both , there were several knots of loungers , squalid and miserable , but now with a manifest sense of power enthroned on their distress .
1	I made acquaintance , on this journey , with a mild and modest young quaker , who opened the discourse by informing me , in a grave whisper , that his grandfather was the inventor of cold-drawn castor oil .
1	' Now , you are something like a genteel boy !
1	Then Mrs Bangham , long popular medium of communication with the outer world , began to be infirm , and to be found oftener than usual comatose on pavements , with her basket of purchases spilt , and the change of her clients ninepence short .
1	' <NAME> if I can make it out ! ' said he , staring at them .
1	' The younger brother had been a traveller in many countries , and had made his pilgrimage through life alone .
1	All that day , though he waited for Mr Abel until evening , <NAME> kept clear of his mother ' s house , determined not to anticipate the pleasures of the morrow , but to let them come in their full rush of delight ; for to-morrow was the great and long looked-for epoch in his life -- to-morrow was the end of his first quarter -- the day of receiving , for the first time , one fourth part of his annual income of <NAME> in one vast sum of <NAME> -- to-morrow was to be a half-holiday devoted to a whirl of entertainments , and little <NAME> was to know what oysters meant , and to see a play .
1	Do you mind me ? ' Glad to be released , the woman quickly disappeared .
1	Unfortunately <NAME> is no snuff-taker .
1	<NAME> wilt uphold her here to her last hour .
1	At such times , he would look constantly round him , for fear of thieves , and would keep slapping all his pockets in turn , to see that he had n't lost anything , in such a very funny and natural manner , that <NAME> laughed till the tears ran down his face .
1	One fair evening , when <NAME> was not inclined to go out , my aunt and I strolled up to the <NAME> ' s cottage .
1	One of these is his own sleeping chamber : the other is his nephew ' s .
1	Touch my face with yours , in case I should not hold out till you come back .
1	' My dear Copperfield , ' said <NAME> , ' I have already done so , because I begin to feel that I have not only been inconsiderate , but that I have been positively unjust to <NAME> .
1	The moment the result was known , the minority ( a large one ) cheerfully yielded to the rest , and withdrew all kind of opposition .
1	" And now , " says <NAME> , stirring the fire , " touching this same bundle of letters .
1	I would have withdrawn , but the <NAME> made a gesture to detain me , and I remained .
1	Can you feel quite assured of that , my dear ? "
1	With a window near it , out of which our house can be seen , and IS seen many times during the morning ' s service , by <NAME> , who likes to make herself as sure as she can that it ' s not being robbed , or is not in flames .
1	" The door is locked then , my friend ? " said <NAME> , surprised .
1	<NAME> <NAME> and his <NAME> forfeit the good Opinion of all worldly and prudent People On the next morning after <NAME> ' s disclosure had been made , <NAME> returned home .
1	When she spoke to him , he listened , and in due course answered , but never looked at her , that I could see .
1	<NAME> , who had been looking at the fire and pondering , here said that something had come into his thoughts arising out of <NAME> 's suggestion , which it might be worth while to pursue .
1	The darkness found him occupied with these thoughts .
1	How are you now , my dear ?
1	Before we go , I should like to speak to him a moment .
1	A person may tell a person to dive off a bridge head foremost into five-and-forty feet of water , <NAME> , but a person may be very far from diving. ' ' There now , ' said <NAME> , ' you ' re angry because you ' re a good little thing , and fond of <NAME> ; and yet you turn round on me , because there ' s nobody else. ' ' It ' s very easy for some to keep their tempers , and be soft-spoken , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , slightly mollified , ' when their child ' s made as much of as a prince , and is petted and patted till it wishes its friends further , but when a sweet young pretty innocent , that never ought to have a cross word spoken to or of it , is rundown , the case is very different indeed .
1	' Bless thee a hundred times !
1	<NAME> had also been appointed Secretary , and had been enjoined to give instant notice of resignation to <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , for ever and ever .
1	What a state of mind I was in !
1	If you haven ' t heard of Dr. Crocus , it ' s your fault , gentlemen , who live a little way out of the world here : not Dr. Crocus ' s .
1	<NAME> has prevented me from mixing much with general society in any but a professional character ; still I trust I am competent to perceive that she is a highly genteel young lady .
1	You could make no discovery in reference to me that would do me the least service or give me the least pleasure .
1	Oh , he is a worthy gentleman , <NAME> !
1	' Fill your glass , and pass the wine , ' said the indefatigable visitor .
1	And now go ! " At the mention of each name , she had struck the table with her stick in a new place .
1	' To be sure , ' said <NAME> .
1	Mr Lillyvick ? ' It was , indeed , the collector of water-rates who , regarding Nicholas with a fixed look and immovable countenance , shook hands with most portentous solemnity , and sat himself down in a seat by the chimney-corner .
1	' If not , we must try the young lady ' s persuasion ; and that is what anybody but you would have done at first. ' <NAME> was taking a pinch of snuff with various grotesque contractions of countenance , eulogistic of the persuasive powers appertaining unto young ladies , when the murmur of inquiry and answer was heard in the outer office , and <NAME> tapped at the door .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , not much doubting who the young man was , unlocked the door ; which he had no sooner done than <NAME> entered with great precipitation , and carefully relocking it on the inside , deliberately put the key in his waistcoat pocket ; and , after surveying <NAME> from head to foot , said -- ' You ' re a wery humorous young gen ' l ' m ' n , you air , <NAME> ! ' ' What do you mean by this conduct , <NAME> ? ' inquired <NAME> indignantly .
1	<NAME> was to be my travelling companion , though I am sure I wanted none and would willingly have left her at home .
1	Then , he sat down by the light of a single candle , and began to think , for the first time , on all that had taken place that day .
1	That ' s what I feel so strong , you know !
1	<NAME> <NAME> could not determine this in his mind .
1	When I have come to you , at last ( as I have always done ) , I have come to peace and happiness .
1	And whatever opinion you take away of me , shall make no difference in my remembrance of you .
1	The man with the rough voice was a burly fellow of middle age , with large black whiskers , broad cheeks , a coarse wide mouth , and bull neck , which was pretty freely displayed as his shirt collar was only confined by a loose red neckerchief .
1	' In one instant , after the clock struck two , the whole of this deserted and quiet spot had become a scene of most extraordinary life and animation .
1	' <NAME> , at once , here ! ' His passion was so great , that he could not articulate , but stood clenching his fist , tearing his hair , and stamping upon the ground .
1	Taking note of the wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features , and having the expression of prisoners ' faces fresh in his mind , he was strongly reminded of that expression .
1	' Here ' s <NAME> , dear Mrs Quilp , ' said her husband .
1	There ' s no such name now .
1	That boy , <NAME> , ' said the Major in a lower tone , ' will live in history .
1	" <NAME> , " said I , when we were walking homeward , " I wish you could put me right. " " I wish I could ! " said <NAME> .
1	' Why , no considerable change has taken place in the state of my system , since I see you cocked up behind your governor ' s chair in the parlour , a little vile ago , ' replied <NAME> .
1	At first the two travellers spoke little , and only in whispers , but as they grew more familiar with the place they ventured to converse with greater freedom , and talked about the country through which they were passing , and the different objects that presented themselves , until the old man fell asleep ; which the lady of the caravan observing , invited <NAME> to come and sit beside her .
1	I say no more of that .
1	' Look on to the end -- ' <NAME> was beginning to remonstrate , when he caught at the words : ' Ah !
1	Jingling and clattering , till distance rendered its noise inaudible , and its rapid progress only perceptible to the eye , the vehicle wound its way along the road , almost hidden in a cloud of dust : now wholly disappearing , and now becoming visible again , as intervening objects , or the intricacies of the way , permitted .
1	' Make my compliments to <NAME> , and say I am here now. ' Miss <NAME> ' s compliments came down in return , and , if it were not too much trouble , would Mr <NAME> be so kind as to come up before he went ?
1	Then this respectability of <NAME> is brought into powerful play against them .
1	I am bent upon it -- so is <NAME> .
1	Being of age now and having taken the step I have taken , I consider myself free from any accountability to <NAME> ; but <NAME> being still a ward of the court , I do n't yet ask her to renew our engagement .
1	' Speak up like a man , since you are a man , and tell us about yourself and this Combination. ' ' Wi ' yor pardon , sir , ' said <NAME> , ' I ha ' nowt to sen about it. ' <NAME> , who was always more or less like a Wind , finding something in his way here , began to blow at it directly .
1	You ' re all affection and et cetera , ain ' t you ? ' ' Oh , yes , my Lady ! ' ' Yes , I ' m sure you are ; and so ' s that gentlemanly creature Grangeby .
1	How they affected my aunt , nobody knew ; for immediately upon the separation , she took her maiden name again , bought a cottage in a hamlet on the sea-coast a long way off , established herself there as a single woman with one servant , and was understood to live secluded , ever afterwards , in an inflexible retirement .
1	And <NAME> , who of course saw through her own threadbare blind perfectly , and who knew that <NAME> saw through it perfectly , and who knew that <NAME> would see through it perfectly , came out of this form , notwithstanding , as she had gone into it , with immense complacency and gravity .
1	" We have borne this a long time , " said <NAME> , turning her eyes again upon <NAME> .
1	Do I understand you ? ' ' I couldn ' t have understood myself better , sir. ' ' There , then , ' said <NAME> , tossing the pocket-book upon the table .
1	' You must tell me what I can do for you , <NAME> my friend , ' said <NAME> confidentially , ' if not to-day , next time. ' ' Thank you all the same , ma ' am , but I want nothing for myself .
1	Come straight to the stolen money ! ' ' Wretch that you are , ' she answered , and now her hands clasped her head : ' through what fatal error of <NAME> ' s , through what incompleteness on his part , who was the only other person helping in these things and trusted with them , through whose and what bringing together of the ashes of a burnt paper , you have become possessed of that codicil , I know no more than how you acquired the rest of your power here -- ' ' And yet , ' interrupted <NAME> , ' it is my odd fortune to have by me , in a convenient place that I know of , that same short little addition to the will of <NAME> , written by a lady and witnessed by the same lady and our old intriguer !
1	I was wondering who it was , who kept the fire off. " With that , I poked tremendously , and having done so , planted myself side by side with <NAME> , my shoulders squared and my back to the fire .
1	' It ' s a coincidence , Mr Twemlow ; ' here he descended from his perch , and sauntered towards him ; ' that the friends I am standing by to-day are the friends at whose house I met you !
1	Yes , <NAME> told this gentleman to look sharp , and he not only said he would look sharp , but he actually did , and presently came running back with the newest loaves , and the freshest butter , and the largest oysters , ever seen .
1	He must be made a partner , brother <NAME> ; and if he won ' t submit to it peaceably , we must have recourse to violence. ' ' Quite right , ' replied brother Ned , nodding his head as a man thoroughly determined ; ' quite right , my dear brother .
1	<NAME> night ! ' She took the hand he offered her , and gratefully and almost reverently raised it to her lips .
1	The features of the surrounding picture were , a church with hoarding and scaffolding about it , which had been under suppositious repair so long that the means of repair looked a hundred years old , and had themselves fallen into decay ; a quantity of washed linen , spread to dry in the sun ; a number of houses at odds with one another and grotesquely out of the perpendicular , like rotten pre-Adamite cheeses cut into fantastic shapes and full of mites ; and a feverish bewilderment of windows , with their lattice-blinds all hanging askew , and something draggled and dirty dangling out of most of them .
1	It is impossible ; it is a child ' s tale .
1	It was what was always being dinned into you and me at school ; it ' s what goes down best .
1	That could hardly be , she knew , until an hour past midnight ; but in the country silence , which did anything but calm the trouble of her thoughts , time lagged wearily .
1	' You have answered very well , <NAME> .
1	He ain ' t a father to neither .
1	Do n't keep him too warm , ma'am ; but be careful that you do n't let him be too cold ; will you have the goodness ? '
1	Says you -- what name is it ? ' ' Her name ? ' ' Ah ! ' said <NAME> , with a nod of his head .
1	Could I not have asked her any day ? ' ' Then you don ' t care to know ? ' ' I do not. ' Mr Flintwinch , having expelled a long significant breath said , with his former emphasis , ' For I have accidentally -- mind ! -- found out. ' ' Wherever she lives , ' said <NAME> , speaking in one unmodulated hard voice , and separating her words as distinctly as if she were reading them off from separate bits of metal that she took up one by one , ' she has made a secret of it , and she shall always keep her secret from me. ' ' After all , perhaps you would rather not have known the fact , any how ? ' said <NAME> ; and he said it with a twist , as if his words had come out of him in his own wry shape .
1	<NAME> ho ! ' ' What ' s the matter ? ' demanded <NAME> , looking sleepily up .
1	What could I say but yes !
1	' It ' s a good thing , ' thought the child , ' I am very glad they pass the church. ' And then she stopped , to fancy how the noise would sound inside , and how gently it would seem to die away upon the ear .
1	Perhaps some momentary recollection of the story of the <NAME> may have been in her mind .
1	The building rang with a tremendous shout , and another , and another , and then it echoed loud groans , that gathered strength as they swelled out , like angry thunder .
1	All this time , however , there hovered upon the tip of his tongue a confession that the very same objections which <NAME> had stated to the employment of his nephew in this commission applied with at least equal force and validity to himself , and a hundred times had he been upon the point of avowing the real state of his feelings , and entreating to be released from it .
1	Let us go forth again into the cheerful streets .
1	With these last words she snaps her teeth together as if her mouth closed with a spring .
1	As there was only one house in the enclosure , there was no room for uncertainty , so he went up the steps of that house and knocked .
1	<NAME> face to face for the first time with the daughter of his supposed murderer , it was natural that <NAME> should have his own secret reasons for a careful scrutiny of her countenance and manner .
1	' To bed again , poor boy ! ' ' Ay ! ' cried the child , in a burst of despair .
1	And I find ( <NAME> ' <NAME> said ) that in a given time a hundred thousand persons went to sea on long voyages , and only five hundred of them were drowned or burnt to death .
1	Mr <NAME> arrived more than an hour ago , and told us you were walking down. ' His own hand shook , as he accepted a rose or two from hers and thanked her .
1	If the change that you must see in me after so long an absence -- must see , for I , upon whom it has come by slow and hard degrees , see it and know it well -- will not move you to pity , let the knowledge that bread ; not the daily bread of the <NAME> ' s <NAME> , which , as it is offered up in cities like this , is understood to include half the luxuries of the world for the rich , and just as much coarse food as will support life for the poor -- not that , but bread , a crust of dry hard bread , is beyond my reach today -- let that have some weight with you , if nothing else has. ' ' If this is the usual form in which you beg , sir , ' said <NAME> , ' you have studied your part well ; but if you will take advice from one who knows something of the world and its ways , I should recommend a lower tone ; a little lower tone , or you stand a fair chance of being starved in good earnest. ' As he said this , <NAME> clenched his left wrist tightly with his right hand , and inclining his head a little on one side and dropping his chin upon his breast , looked at him whom he addressed with a frowning , sullen face .
1	She WAS worth any six , and she IS worth any six .
1	" This , " said <NAME> , " is Pip. " " This is <NAME> , is it ? " returned the young lady , who was very pretty and seemed very proud ; " come in , Pip. " <NAME> was coming in also , when she stopped him with the gate .
1	In what station of life is this man ? " <NAME> looked at his cap , and looked at the floor , and looked at the ceiling , and looked at the clerk , and even looked at me , before beginning to reply in a nervous manner , " We 've dressed him up like -- " when my guardian blustered out , -- " What ?
1	" You know I do ; you see me do it . "
1	' Well , will you leave a message , <NAME> , or will you call again ? ' ' Ask him to be so kind as to leave out word what has been done in my business , ' said the man ; ' for <NAME> ' s sake don ' t neglect it , <NAME> Lowten. ' ' No , no ; I won ' t forget it , ' replied the clerk .
1	I forgot Mr Pancks last time .
1	<NAME> , seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about to say something disagreeable , asked <NAME> to step downstairs and tell Mrs. Bedwin they were ready for tea ; which , as he did not half like the visitor 's manner , he was very happy to do .
1	" Says <NAME> : 'Why , you fool , do n't you know she 's got a living body ?
1	' Is there nothing else , <NAME> ? ' I said .
1	' What shall I get by it ? ' asked the driver .
1	Both the private father and the Father of the <NAME> were strong within him then .
1	However loud the general voice might be in giving me encouragement , and however fervent the emotions and endeavours to which it roused me , I heard her lightest word of praise as I heard nothing else .
1	<NAME> <NAME> took no pains to conceal his implacable dislike of <NAME> , yet he never referred it , however distantly , to such a source .
1	Beadles are but men : and <NAME> smiled .
1	However , when we began to jolt upon a stone pavement , and particularly when every other conveyance seemed to be running into us , and we seemed to be running into every other conveyance , I began to believe that we really were approaching the end of our journey .
1	' They ' ve got all the lot , <NAME> !
1	<NAME> , my good woman -- dear me , what a situation -- pray consider. -- Mrs .
1	That cruel man with the wooden leg aggravated my sufferings .
1	" You are right , " he returned .
1	' Now with regard to the matter on which I , with the concurrence of these gentlemen , sent for you , ' said <NAME> .
1	' You say , <NAME> , ' pursued Mr Dorrit , ' that you think you require time .
1	Everybody gave me a present .
1	Save me from Jere-_mi_-ah ! ' Mr <NAME> had made a run at her , but <NAME> had caught him in his arms midway .
1	I could tell her nothing but that there was such a sister ; beyond that , I knew nothing .
1	How dare you appeal to me just now , you false rascal , as if we had been in discussion together ? ' As we stood , front to front , I saw so plainly , in the stealthy exultation of his face , what I already so plainly knew ; I mean that he forced his confidence upon me , expressly to make me miserable , and had set a deliberate trap for me in this very matter ; that I couldn ' t bear it .
1	Never ! ' Again the <NAME> inclined his head and showed his teeth , and seemed to say , ' Remarkable indeed !
1	' <NAME> has improved even in this little time , I have no doubt , ' said <NAME> , glancing proudly at her daughter .
1	In short , it is such an admirable thing that <NAME> ca n't forget it ; but at meals for days afterwards , even among her countrywomen and others attached in like capacity to the troop of visitors , relapses into silent enjoyment of the joke -- an enjoyment expressed , in her own convivial manner , by an additional tightness of face , thin elongation of compressed lips , and sidewise look , which intense appreciation of humour is frequently reflected in my <NAME> 's mirrors when my Lady is not among them .
1	' Believe ! ' retorted the other , ' can anybody doubt it ?
1	' That ' s me , ' said the lady .
1	By our own schemes , I mean our joint interest .
1	Our Dear Brother A touch on the lawyer 's wrinkled hand as he stands in the dark room , irresolute , makes him start and say , " What 's that ? "
1	Then , eyeing <NAME> as she had previously eyed <NAME> and the door , <NAME> chopped that very sudden and keen chop in which her jaws sometimes indulged , leaned back in her chair with folded arms , and thus expressed herself : ' Humph !
1	' There is some spell about that boy , ' said <NAME> , grinding his teeth .
1	' Never , ' said my aunt , ' be mean in anything ; never be false ; never be cruel .
1	I have seen him beat mine , more than once or twice , and I never forgot it. ' ' Nothing , ' said <NAME> , ' not even a beloved and beautiful sister ' s tears under dastardly ill-usage ; ' he became less severe , in spite of himself , as his indignation rose ; ' could justify those horrible expressions that you used. ' ' I am sorry I used them , and especially to you , sir .
1	" Well to be sure ! " said <NAME> , astounded .
1	' It ' s the second floor , <NAME> , ' said the same voice ; ' what a stupid thing you are !
1	These , with their perplexities and inconsistencies , were the shifting quicksands of my mind , from the time of my departure to the time of my return home , three years afterwards .
1	I could go to <NAME> in the evening , and come to your chambers afterwards. " " Then I say yes , " said <NAME> : " I wo n't go up there now , I am not so hot upon it as that comes to ; I say yes , and I shall expect you to look in to-night .
1	' You may make it necessary , if you are foolish or obstinate , <NAME> , ' he observed , ' for me to send my daughter abroad again , for a term ; but I have a better opinion of you .
1	And I don ' t speak of myself , particular , ' said <NAME> , ' because , sir , the way I look at it is , that we are all drawing on to the bottom of the hill , whatever age we are , on account of time never standing still for a single moment .
1	' Ah , dear me ! ' sighed <NAME> , giving me the tea-caddy scoop instead of her fingers .
1	He had been prepared to miss her very much , but not so much .
1	' Can you drink anything ? ' was his next inquiry .
1	' <NAME> ' t be frightened , mistress , ' said <NAME> , after a pause .
1	You are different from other children , <NAME> , because you were not born , like them , in common sinfulness and wrath .
1	Would you have the kindness to make a few plasters and put ' em on ?
1	Unless it was taken by somebody in jest -- only in jest , dear grandfather , which would make me laugh heartily if I could but know it -- ' ' Who would take money in jest ? ' returned the old man in a hurried manner .
1	Why , then he lurked about and dogged me in the street .
1	Bred in meanness and hard dealing , this had rescued him to be a man of honourable mind and open hand .
1	' Well , ma ' am , she will soon be quite comfortable , I hope , ' returned <NAME> .
1	Bless your eyes , here 's old <NAME> .
1	Do you think you can degrade , or bend or break , me to submission and obedience ? ' Mr <NAME> smiled , as he might have smiled at an inquiry whether he thought he could raise ten thousand pounds .
1	' You will find her , ' pursued my aunt , ' as good , as beautiful , as earnest , as disinterested , as she has always been .
1	Some said one thing , and some another ; but all talked together , and all agreed upon two points : first , that it was very meritorious and highly praiseworthy in Mrs. Kenwigs to do as she had done : and secondly , that there never was such a skilful and scientific doctor as that Dr Lumbey .
1	" <NAME> , will you allow me ?
1	In time , <NAME> was despatched for a coach , the visitors keeping shop meanwhile ; and when he brought it , they got into it , leaving word for <NAME> that they would be sure to call again , on their way back .
1	As it extorted nothing from that gentleman but a smile , the old lady tossed her head , and smoothed down her apron preparatory to another speech , when she was stopped by <NAME> .
1	' You are cold ; I felt you tremble .
1	It is not until they are gone , that <NAME> moves .
1	Well then , I will say no more about it .
1	And is your brother acquainted with all this , my dear ? ' ' Oh , no , no , ' replied <NAME> , changing colour .
1	' By the upsetting of a boat in which his nurse had no business to have put him , ' said the Major .
1	When she paid the coachman she took her money out of a hard steel purse , and she kept the purse in a very jail of a bag which hung upon her arm by a heavy chain , and shut up like a bite .
1	The Jew shook his head impatiently , and said in a whisper , 'Is _he_ here ? '
1	But you have not told me where he is now , <NAME> .
1	<NAME> YOU off now , father ? "
1	But he remained too late .
1	Not even doing that much , so that the old lady were busy and pleased , he would quietly swallow what was given him , merely taking a corrective dip of hands and face into the great bowl of dried rose-leaves , and into the other great bowl of dried lavender , and then would go out , as confident in the sweetening powers of <NAME> and a wholesome mind , as <NAME> was hopeless of those of all the seas that roll .
1	Never separate the two , like the heathen waggoner .
1	Two or three violins and a wind instrument from the Opera band reside within its precincts .
1	When the <NAME> had said these words , ' Gentlemen , we will resume our studies at seven tomorrow , ' the pupils bowed again , and went to bed .
1	Mrs Wickam then sprinkled a little cooling-stuff about the room , with the air of a female grave-digger , who was strewing ashes on ashes , dust on dust -- for she was a serious character -- and withdrew to partake of certain funeral baked meats downstairs .
1	This place has taken my breath away , and I shall never get it back again until <NAME> is out of this place. ' ' How is that a reason for going off again to-morrow morning ? ' ' You shall understand , ' said Mr Meagles .
1	<NAME> to see you look , and hear you speak , as you did on that night when we parted , is happiness to me that there are no words to utter ; and to be loved and trusted as your brother , is the next gift I could receive and prize ! ' ' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , looking at him earnestly , but with a changing face , ' what is that which is due to me , and must be rendered to me , at the sacrifice of all this ? ' ' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , in a low tone .
1	I have heard her , many a time , talk just like him .
1	Where sat the many legislators of coarse threats ; of words and blows such as coalheavers deal upon each other , when they forget their breeding ?
1	' You are wet through , ' said <NAME> , passing his hand hastily over the coat which <NAME> had thrown off ; ' and I -- I -- haven ' t even a change , ' he added , with a wistful glance at the shabby clothes he wore himself .
1	The figure had plunged down the precipice , and she felt herself , as it were , attending on the body .
1	' I scarcely know of what , ' replied the girl .
1	Seeing me interested in this contrivance , he looked up at it with a great deal of pride , and said that he had been thinking of improving it , and that he hoped the hammer and a little piece of broken glass beside it ' would play music before long. ' He had extracted some colours from the yarn with which he worked , and painted a few poor figures on the wall .
1	' <NAME> me ! ' said <NAME> , with an air of constraint , ' I speak of my friend Heep as I have experience. ' ' I am glad your experience is so favourable , ' I returned .
1	I fancied , as I looked at her , that I slipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again .
1	' Indeed ? ' was all she answered .
1	They went out by another staircase , avoiding the lodge ; and coming into the front court-yard , now all quiet and deserted , gained the street .
1	" Of course I know that. " " How do you know it ? " said I .
1	' Is it not a good place ? ' ' Yes , yes , ' said the schoolmaster .
1	<NAME> ways and yards , which here and there diverged from the main street , disclosed little knots of houses , where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in filth ; and from several of the door-ways , great ill-looking fellows were cautiously emerging , bound , to all appearance , on no very well-disposed or harmless errands .
1	' This whelp is the only creature she cares for .
1	So expressive it was , of a hopeless and lost creature , that a famished traveller , wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness , would have remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die .
1	Though not before he had whispered something , on the door-mat , to the footman , in which there was the phrase ' old-fashioned ' -- for <NAME> heard it .
1	Not my fault ! ' and to pass on before the instant had elapsed which was requisite to his recovery of the realities about him .
1	In another part of the city , is the <NAME> for the Destitute : an Institution whose object is to reclaim youthful offenders , male and female , black and white , without distinction ; to teach them useful trades , apprentice them to respectable masters , and make them worthy members of society .
1	And what do you intend to make of him , ma'am ?
1	I shall leave this at five o ' clock , and ride there on horseback .
1	It 's rare for you both that you went out early in life -- Judy to the flower business , and you to the law .
1	I remember when <NAME> was born -- ' ' Ay , ay , ay , ' said Mr Dombey , bending over the basket bedstead , and slightly bending his brows at the same time .
1	' Drink of this cup , you ' ll find there ' s a spell in its every drop ' gainst the ills of mortality .
1	The carriage was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the door and alight before I came up with it .
1	'What fancy have you got in your head now ? '
1	" What company is this , <NAME> ? "
1	But I feel it , I do feel it , although I am disgusted. ' Miss Knag here relapsed into softness , and the young ladies renewing their attentions , murmured that she ought to be superior to such things , and that for their part they despised them , and considered them beneath their notice ; in witness whereof , they called out , more emphatically than before , that it was a shame , and that they felt so angry , they did , they hardly knew what to do with themselves .
1	He had been stoned in the streets .
1	But as he drew nearer and nearer home he forgot it again , and began to think how very dull and solitary the house would be inside .
1	The week passed away in a most delightful manner .
1	This flower-pot and stand , she bought herself .
1	It ' s a topic that I wouldn ' t touch upon , to any soul but you .
1	'And very grateful indeed , sir , for your goodness to me . '
1	<NAME> ! ' When <NAME> arrived at this point , he turned the corner at which he had been long hesitating , and fell fast asleep .
1	' Upon my honour , ' says <NAME> , ' although it ' s an unusual sort of thing in a private gentleman ' s house , I must beg leave to call upon you to drink what is usually called a -- in fact a toast. ' The Major very hoarsely indicates his approval .
1	" Five more days , and then the day before the day !
1	<NAME> and lower thoughts , as that his dead boy was now superseded by new ties , and he could forgive the having been supplanted in his affection , may have occasioned them .
1	Our own emotions are our recompense .
1	If you had brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of these rooms , and had never let her know that there was such a thing as the daylight by which she had never once seen your face , -- if you had done that , and then , for a purpose had wanted her to understand the daylight and know all about it , you would have been disappointed and angry ? " <NAME> , with her head in her hands , sat making a low moaning , and swaying herself on her chair , but gave no answer .
1	" Unless my cousin <NAME> is blind , my pet , " said I , " I should think my cousin <NAME> knows pretty well as much as we know . "
1	The old woman looked at him , as though she had a strong impulse upon her to make another clutch at his head and throat , but was restrained by a certain dogged mystery in his face .
1	What she had overheard was a reason , not for soothing herself , but for saving him ; and <NAME> did it , in pursuance of the study of her heart .
1	Now , Mr Nickleby , ' said the man , with a strange mixture of humility and sense of power , ' what help and assistance will you give me ; what bribe , to speak out plainly ?
1	Let me first tell you , once for all , that it ' s of no use your paying visits to me .
1	Nor was the scenery , as we approached the junction of the <NAME> and <NAME> rivers , at all inspiriting in its influence .
1	' Like a demd native ? ' asked the husband .
1	Did History chronicle a king of men ?
1	' What of him ? ' ' <NAME> called , ' said <NAME> .
1	I rely on that promise .
1	I could have wished , I own , to have given the lady at whose feet I would lay my humble duty and devotion -- for is she not your wife ! -- no new cause of dislike ; but a wish from you is , of course , paramount to every other consideration on earth .
1	He didn ' t wish to trouble nobody , and if he had troubled anybody by what he said , he asked pardon , that was all .
1	These household cares involve much pattening and counter-pattening in the backyard and considerable use of a pail , which is finally so happy as to assist in the ablutions of Mrs. Bagnet herself .
1	" For the honour of the family , I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent .
1	I see little to choose , between assistant to a brutal pedagogue , and toad-eater to a mean and ignorant upstart , be he member or no member. ' ' I hardly know whether I should tell you what I heard this morning , or not , ' said <NAME> .
1	He was one of the very many descendants of <NAME> proper to this continent , who seem destined from their birth to serve as pioneers in the great human army : who gladly go on from year to year extending its outposts , and leaving home after home behind them ; and die at last , utterly regardless of their graves being left thousands of miles behind , by the wandering generation who succeed .
1	' <NAME> to have placed you in this disagreeable situation , ' said <NAME> , addressing <NAME> ; ' allow me to suggest , that the best way of avoiding a recurrence of such scenes in future will be to be more select in the choice of your companions .
1	He had likewise a pair of little eyes that were always half shut up , and a mouth that was always half expanded into a grin , as if he had , that moment , posed a boy , and were waiting to convict him from his own lips .
1	I have been under a Taboo in that infernal scoundrel ' s service .
1	For , the state of the man was murderous .
1	It ' s a great deal worse than <NAME> ' s. ' Captain Cuttle , without altering his position , signed to Mr Toots not to mind him ; and presently turned round , with his glazed hat thrust back upon his ears , and his hand composing and smoothing his brown face .
1	The top shelf in the right-hand corner -- oh ! '
1	The aunt , the two young ladies , and <NAME> , each vying with the other in paying zealous and unremitting attentions to the old lady , crowded round her easy-chair , one holding her ear-trumpet , another an orange , and a third a smelling- bottle , while a fourth was busily engaged in patting and punching the pillows which were arranged for her support .
1	How dare I say it is my sister ' s ! ' She was weeping still .
1	' <NAME> , <NAME> , certainly -- fifty more if you like to hear ' em -- strange life mine -- rather curious history -- not extraordinary , but singular. ' In this strain , with an occasional glass of ale , by way of parenthesis , when the coach changed horses , did the stranger proceed , until they reached <NAME> bridge , by which time the note-books , both of <NAME> and <NAME> , were completely filled with selections from his adventures .
1	I thought you was poor , my improvident friend ! ' Why , <NAME> , how hard it was upon a man !
1	' And , my dear ! ' whispered <NAME> , ' tell the pretty little angel that I should so have liked to see her , only for a minute !
1	The house is a ruin , and the rats fly from it .
1	Bring him to the lamp ! " <NAME> , and up , and head foremost on the steps of the building ; now , on his knees ; now , on his feet ; now , on his back ; dragged , and struck at , and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his face by hundreds of hands ; torn , bruised , panting , bleeding , yet always entreating and beseeching for mercy ; now full of vehement agony of action , with a small clear space about him as the people drew one another back that they might see ; now , a log of dead wood drawn through a forest of legs ; he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one of the fatal lamps swung , and there <NAME> let him go -- as a cat might have done to a mouse -- and silently and composedly looked at him while they made ready , and while he besought her : the women passionately screeching at him all the time , and the men sternly calling out to have him killed with grass in his mouth .
1	' Twas evident she knew not of the disaster .
1	" You come here to make a remarkably modest demand , which you have just stated , and it not being conceded , you will come again . "
1	When you lose , you ' re martyrs ; but I don ' t find that when you win , you look upon the other losers in that light .
1	How do they call her ?
1	Ten thousand pounds could not effect it. ' ' Sissy has effected it , father. ' He raised his eyes to where she stood , like a good fairy in his house , and said in a tone of softened gratitude and grateful kindness , ' It is always you , my child ! ' ' We had our fears , ' <NAME> explained , glancing at <NAME> , ' before yesterday ; and when I saw you brought to the side of the litter last night , and heard what passed ( being close to <NAME> all the time ) , I went to him when no one saw , and said to him , " <NAME> ' t look at me .
1	When it thundered very loudly , he glanced towards <NAME> , having it in his mind that some of the tall chimneys might be struck by lightning .
1	These two brothers had been brought up together in a school at <NAME> ; and , being accustomed to go home once a week , had often heard , from their mother ' s lips , long accounts of their father ' s sufferings in his days of poverty , and of their deceased uncle ' s importance in his days of affluence : which recitals produced a very different impression on the two : for , while the younger , who was of a timid and retiring disposition , gleaned from thence nothing but forewarnings to shun the great world and attach himself to the quiet routine of a country life , <NAME> , the elder , deduced from the often-repeated tale the two great morals that riches are the only true source of happiness and power , and that it is lawful and just to compass their acquisition by all means short of felony .
1	I wonder what you will say when you come to this !
1	<NAME> <NAME> was meditating ; it might be that the insects brought to mind , some painful passage in his own past life .
1	' Death of my life , sir , it ' s my character to be impatient ! ' ' EH ! ' cried <NAME> , astounded , and with all his colour gone in a moment .
1	' I know better , ' said <NAME> .
1	' I am , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
1	By degrees , however , as some of it cleared away through the open door , an assemblage of heads , as confused as the noises that greeted the ear , might be made out ; and as the eye grew more accustomed to the scene , the spectator gradually became aware of the presence of a numerous company , male and female , crowded round a long table : at the upper end of which , sat a chairman with a hammer of office in his hand ; while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose , and his face tied up for the benefit of a toothache , presided at a jingling piano in a remote corner .
1	<NAME> ' t look for him in me , at thirty shillings a week , but look for him in <NAME> , at I don ' t know how much a year ! ' ' Good ! ' cried several voices .
1	It is to be regretted , I suppose , but it could not be helped . "
1	It ' s a pleasure to me to look at you. ' ' I have nothing left to begin with , ' returned <NAME> , blushing , ' because I was going to say that it was a pleasure to me to look at you , <NAME> .
1	I am not impertinently curious , but have a good object .
1	One summer afternoon ; a year , wanting some odd days , after the marriage in the <NAME> church ; there was a buzz and whisper upon ' Change of a great failure .
1	After waiting some quarter of an hour alone in the family sitting-room , which presented traces of having been so hastily arranged after a meal , that one might have doubted whether it was made tidy for visitors , or cleared for blindman ' s buff , Mr and <NAME> became aware of the entrance of Mrs <NAME> , majestically faint , and with a condescending stitch in her side : which was her company manner .
1	' I want that pretty frock , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' and that little bonnet , and a petticoat or two , and anything else you can spare .
1	But I confess I do n't see why our young friend , in his degree , should not seek to invest himself with such poetry as is open to him .
1	You must not stir from my side during the whole interview .
1	' Mr <NAME> ? ' said the suitor .
1	<NAME> is quite sure of it .
1	Thank you for reminding me .
1	' And these heer pretty ones , ' said <NAME> .
1	It won ' t answer to have <NAME> about , while this business of ours is about .
1	It led him to nothing , and therefore is no great matter , save in the intention .
1	' Can ' t say. ' ' Will it be long before <NAME> is disengaged , <NAME> ? ' ' Don ' t know. ' Here the man proceeded to mend his pen with great deliberation , while another clerk , who was mixing a <NAME> powder , under cover of the lid of his desk , laughed approvingly .
1	' May I ask , ' he said , ' is this true about <NAME> ? ' ' My dear doctor , ' she returned , ' you ask me the very question that I was half disposed to ask you. ' ' To ask me !
1	" Why , you 're six foot two , I suppose ? "
1	It appears that <NAME> had become somewhat noisy , _and that the barkeeper_ , _determined to preserve order_ , _had threatened to shoot <NAME> , whereupon <NAME> drew a pistol and shot the barkeeper down .
1	Even I , safe as an Englishman , and even <NAME> 's , important as they are to <NAME> credit , avoid all naming of the matter .
1	That _is_ his knock , ma ' am , no doubt. ' He stepped to the window ; and looking out , and drawing in his head again , confirmed himself with , ' Yes , ma ' am .
1	Yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been in constant terror ; for , when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer into the boat , and he was stepping out , I hinted that I thought he would be safest where he was , and he said .
1	<NAME> , rousing up the <NAME> betimes in the morning , proposed that they should carry thither such furniture out of the little parlour as would grace it best , so that Florence might take possession of it when she rose .
1	why can not we push them back , only a week or two in our memories , so as to put them at once at that convenient distance whence they may be regarded either with a calm indifference or a pleasant effort of recollection !
1	Mrs <NAME> was a meek woman , of a fair complexion , with her eyebrows always elevated , and her head always drooping ; who was always ready to pity herself , or to be pitied , or to pity anybody else ; and who had a surprising natural gift of viewing all subjects in an utterly forlorn and pitiable light , and bringing dreadful precedents to bear upon them , and deriving the greatest consolation from the exercise of that talent .
1	You know the horse-riders are famous for never minding what they say , ' addressing <NAME> .
1	' And calculated on it , ' she rejoined , ' and so pursued me .
1	In the first place because I want to profit by everything you tell me , and in the second place because I have no secrets from <NAME> . "
1	Not stumbling on the means after all , I was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchman there to come with his lantern .
1	It has been sometimes urged that , in the unavailing efforts which have been made to advance the cause of <NAME> in the republic of <NAME> ( strange cause for history to treat of !
1	' I am afraid it is a poor room for you , ' said <NAME> , with a smile of welcome , as she offered the post of honour by the fireside .
1	Many of its streets ( as its _alias_ sufficiently imports ) are planted with rows of grand old elm-trees ; and the same natural ornaments surround <NAME> , an establishment of considerable eminence and reputation .
1	' That you should -- ha -- at this early hour , bestow any of your priceless time upon me , is -- ha -- a compliment that I acknowledge with the greatest esteem. ' Mr Dorrit positively trembled in addressing the great man .
1	The representatives of the <NAME> dropped in next , and Mr Merdle ' s physician dropped in next .
1	' And yesterday too , master. ' ' Dear me , you ' ve had a deal of trouble .
1	What may be called its private life was confined to the hearth , and all easy-chair , and an old-fashioned occasional round table that was brought out upon the rug after business hours , from a corner where it elsewise remained turned up like a shining mahogany shield .
1	' Do you think he is in earnest , my dear Major ?
1	He advanced to meet them , and tenderly obliging the old man to lean upon his arm , conducted him with slow and trembling steps towards the house .
1	An old red-brick mansion , used as a school , was in its place ; and a fine old house it must have been to go to school at , as I recollect it .
1	She thought of the sunrise on rolling rivers , of the sunrise on wide seas , of the sunrise on rich landscapes , of the sunrise on great forests where the birds were waking and the trees were rustling ; and she looked down into the living grave on which the sun had risen , with her father in it three-and-twenty years , and said , in a burst of sorrow and compassion , ' No , no , I have never seen him in my life ! ' If <NAME> had had the inclination and the power to write a satire on family pride , he would have had no need to go for an avenging illustration out of the family of his beloved .
1	Oh so nice it was .
1	Twice , <NAME> knocked with a careful hand , and listened .
1	It is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject , however ; for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom <NAME> had seen on a former occasion , caused the conversation to flow afresh .
1	Still , there was no abatement in the storm , but it blew harder .
1	' The strange gentleman -- him as had his arm hurt -- a-kissin ' and huggin ' -- ' ' Who , <NAME> ?
1	I should have had it before to be of use to me .
1	But tell me his name , deary ! ' cried <NAME> .
1	Well , Mr Clennam , he addresses himself to the Government .
1	' <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> -- ' Law , civil power , and exekative ; them ' s my titles ; here ' s my authority .
1	I couldn ' t say at this minute , sir , whether it ' s two and two months , or whether it ' s two and five months .
1	The gentlemen soon saunter after them .
1	said the old lady : observing in great surprise , the look of awe with which the child regarded the painting .
1	Six quiet years ( I find I am saying it for the second time ) I had passed at <NAME> , seeing in those around me , as it might be in a looking-glass , every stage of my own growth and change there , when , one November morning , I received this letter .
1	Mr <NAME> took the lead , towing Mr Wegg , in order that his refractory leg might be promptly extricated from any pitfalls it should dig for itself .
1	It quite spoiled my pleasure for that night because it was so very embarrassing and so very ridiculous .
1	an honest man , ' replied <NAME> ; ' honest in ought but ever putting legs under seame table wi ' such as thou. ' ' Scandal ! ' said <NAME> , exultingly .
1	Thus encumbered the old gentleman lifted his legs awkwardly once or twice , as if they were very clumsy and imperfect pieces of machinery , and then looking down on his own side of the wall , burst into a loud laugh .
1	She darted a hopeful glance at me , when I said ' <NAME> ' ; but seeing that I looked as usual , she took off her spectacles in despair , and rubbed her nose with them .
1	At this hour and by this light it changes into threatening hands raised up and menacing the handsome face with every breath that stirs .
1	A solitary window , gazed through years ago , looked out upon an ocean , miles and miles away ; upon its waters , fancies , busy with him only yesterday , were hushed and lulled to rest like broken waves .
1	'He can not be hardened in vice , ' said <NAME> ; 'It is impossible . '
1	What sort of stuff do you think I ' m made of ?
1	<NAME> , why are you come again ? ' ' Since then , ' said <NAME> , with the same grasp of her arm , and the same look in her face , ' I have seen him !
1	" I only said I would n't go without one of the servants came up to <NAME> , " returns <NAME> .
1	He was only twenty-five years old , he said , and had grown recently , for it had been found necessary to make an addition to the legs of his inexpressibles .
1	'It seems a strange sort of a thing , a knock coming at such a time in the morning , ' said <NAME> , surveying the pale faces which surrounded him , and looking very blank himself ; 'but the door must be opened .
1	Now I have answered you , answer me .
1	His first impression was confirmed .
1	Go ! ' Mrs <NAME> departed according to order , and her amiable husband , ensconcing himself behind the partly opened door , and applying his ear close to it , began to listen with a face of great craftiness and attention .
1	But , <NAME> thought he saw , as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk , with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands , that he was in some misty way asking himself , " Why not ? " The sagacity of the man of business perceived an advantage here , and determined to hold it .
1	To a certain written statement respecting not wishing to be regarded in a certain light .
1	That ain ' t the worst on it , neither .
1	you ' ll know better by-and-by : ' when suddenly the novice , who had been backing towards the gangway in his noisy merriment , fell overboard before their eyes , and splashed heavily down into the river between the vessel and the dock .
1	" You do n't mind these things ; neither does <NAME> .
1	' If I chose to beg , sir , and stoop to ask assistance from people I despise , three or four months would not be a long time ; three or four years would not be a long time .
1	The eldest Miss <NAME> is not a little girl .
1	And what I was going to say , sir , is , that if I knew him , and I might -- but I don ' t know him and I must not -- I know that ! -- I would tell him that I shall never any more lie down to sleep without having prayed to <NAME> to bless him and reward him .
1	Mr Cripples ' s pupils , who were by this time coming to school , desisted from their morning recreation of cuffing one another with bags and books , to stare with all the eyes they had at a stranger who had been to see <NAME> .
1	' I say , ' whispered <NAME> to <NAME> , as the man let down the steps , ' they don ' t suppose we ' re going to kill game enough to fill those bags , do they ? ' ' Fill them ! ' exclaimed old <NAME> .
1	But I counted twenty-three gentlemen in wigs who said they were " in it , " and none of them appeared to understand it much better than I .
1	I don ' t know what I should do , <NAME> , if I didn ' t. ' The mere idea of Mrs. <NAME> ' s failing in her action , affected Mrs. Sanders so deeply , that she was under the necessity of refilling and re- emptying her glass immediately ; feeling , as she said afterwards , that if she hadn ' t had the presence of mind to do so , she must have dropped .
1	If what you have got to say _can_ be said before a born lady , this lady will stay where she is. ' ' Sir , I hope I never had nowt to say , not fitten for a born lady to year , sin ' I were born mysen ' , ' was the reply , accompanied with a slight flush .
1	Probably we shall make the most of it that is to be made. ' ' Probably , ' said <NAME> .
1	" So I tell him honourably ( you are to know I have written to him about all this ) that we are at issue and that we had better be at issue openly than covertly .
1	<NAME> , it did sometimes happen that it was not easy to find another , without making a long circuit ; and so I had passed that way , upon the whole , pretty often .
1	Mr <NAME> was one of the very few marriageable men for whom <NAME> had no terrors , the argument with which he reassured himself being twofold ; that is to say , firstly , ' that it wouldn ' t do twice , ' and secondly , ' that he wasn ' t worth it. ' Fortified within this double armour , Mr <NAME> snorted at <NAME> on easy terms .
1	A woman , probably of not less than two-and-twenty , she might have been passed in the street for little more than half that age .
1	And more than that , " says he , " I can make a weal a beef- steak , or a beef-steak a kidney , or any one on ' em a mutton , at a minute ' s notice , just as the market changes , and appetites wary ! " ' ' He must have been a very ingenious young man , that , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , with a slight shudder .
1	The right hand path , friend , is the road. -- There is no ill news for our good gentleman , I hope ? ' <NAME> thanked him , and made him a hasty answer in the negative ; he was turning back , when his attention was caught by the voice of a child .
1	'Ca n't you look at the gentleman , you obstinate boy ? '
1	' Your wretched brother , ' said <NAME> .
1	' Is that all ? ' said the mother .
1	After another moment 's listening , <NAME> ( who was a good judge ) agreed , and <NAME> ( who was a bad judge ) agreed .
1	When he knew I saw him , he looked frightened ; for he started , and shrunk away .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , in her seminarial state of existence , has combated the romantic aspect of this destiny by affecting to shake her head over it behind <NAME> ' s dimpled shoulders , and to brood on the unhappy lot of that doomed little victim .
1	She then bent over the unconscious man , and , for the first time , kissed him on the cheek , and kissed the poor maimed hand that was nearest to her .
1	He might have done it thrice , but the pony kicked up his heels and shook his head , as if he were suddenly taken with convulsions of delight , and <NAME> being frightened , ran away -- not straight to where her mother and <NAME> ' s mother were , though , lest they should see how red her cheeks were , and should ask her why .
1	There ' s no way out of it , <NAME> , sir , ' observed <NAME> , ' when it ' s got to this. ' ' -- that I did , ' said <NAME> , glancing helplessly and distractedly at his partner , ' that I did doubt her , and think her wanting in her duty to you ; and that I did sometimes , if I must say all , feel averse to Agnes being in such a familiar relation towards her , as to see what I saw , or in my diseased theory fancied that I saw .
1	' Was it real , now , or only to display the eyelashes ? ' Kate , looking anxiously towards the door , made no reply .
1	' If that is all you want , ' said <NAME> , pointing to the pen , and smiling , in spite of himself , at the affected embarrassment of the schoolmaster ' s daughter , ' perhaps I can supply his place. ' Miss Squeers glanced at the door , as if dubious of the propriety of advancing any nearer to an utter stranger ; then round the schoolroom , as though in some measure reassured by the presence of forty boys ; and finally sidled up to <NAME> and delivered the pen into his hand , with a most winning mixture of reserve and condescension .
1	' On my honour , no , ' said <NAME> , answering the look and smiling carelessly ; ' I don ' t wonder at your supposing so , but on my honour , no .
1	<NAME> night ! ' The unfortunate Mr Venus gives him a shake of the hand with a shake of his own head , and drooping down in his chair , proceeds to pour himself out more tea .
1	She had nothing else to tell him but that <NAME> ' s secret had no reference whatever to the cruel charge , or its withdrawal .
1	' There can be no disparity in marriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose ' -- ' no disparity in marriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose. ' ' There is nothing , ' said <NAME> , ' that we have in common .
1	To come to tea here for ever ?
1	I thought I ' d try another room , and shake it off .
1	" No ; there are only two ; mother and daughter .
1	' Come on then , ' said <NAME> .
1	' <NAME> ' t you ? ' said the waiter .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , do n't you go a-sidling round the gallery like that " -- the dirty little man was shuffling about with his shoulder against the wall , and his eyes on the intruder , in a manner that looked threatening -- " because I know you and wo n't have it . "
1	The pupils ate apples and put straws down one another 's backs , until <NAME> 's great-aunt collected her energies , and made an indiscriminate totter at them with a birch-rod .
1	What is the cause of this here ? ' ' Would these two travellers make much difference to the horses , if we took them with us ? ' asked his mistress , offering no reply to the philosophical inquiry , and pointing to <NAME> and the old man , who were painfully preparing to resume their journey on foot .
1	I regret to leave you , and more to leave her , now , but I will not encourage this compound of meanness and cruelty , and , as I will not ask you to renounce him , I see you no more. ' If <NAME> had not known and felt his power in wounding those he hated , his glances at <NAME> would have shown it him , in all its force , as he proceeded in the above address .
1	My Aunt Astonishes Me XXXVII .
1	<NAME> ceased to be , within the shadow of the roof .
1	My husband drew a little nearer towards <NAME> , and I saw him solemnly lift up his hand to warn my guardian .
1	Never did wrap up enough ; ' the Major being buttoned to the chin .
1	We shall mount to a hundred soon .
1	Every kind of finer tendon and ligament that is in the nature of poultry to possess is developed in these specimens in the singular form of guitar-strings .
1	It was unavailing ; he extended his arm towards them , and made another violent effort .
1	He had not a word .
1	<NAME> , therefore , not being a high-spirited young man according to common parlance , and deeming it a greater degradation to borrow , for the supply of his necessities , from <NAME> , than to teach <NAME> to the little Kenwigses for five shillings a week , accepted the offer with the alacrity already described , and betook himself to the first floor with all convenient speed .
1	' I can , ' said <NAME> , almost aloud .
1	I looked at him eagerly when he looked at me , and slightly moved my hands and shook my head .
1	In the pleasant little parlour opening on the garden , sat a gentleman , who rose to advance towards her when she came in , but turned off , by reason of some peculiarity in his legs , and was only stopped by the table .
1	" But , my dear , " she went on in her mysterious way , " there 's a dreadful attraction in the place .
1	" Yes , my dear , " said I .
1	repeats Mrs. Rouncewell , " <NAME> !
1	<NAME> <NAME> raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness ; and , bringing them down again to the brim of the cup , lifted it to his nose .
1	'And what have you got , my dear ? '
1	But you show it. ' ' Show what ?
1	" <NAME> hundred pounds. " " If I give you the money for this purpose , will you keep my secret as you have kept your own ? " " Quite as faithfully. " " And your mind will be more at rest ? " " Much more at rest. " " Are you very unhappy now ? " She asked this question , still without looking at me , but in an unwonted tone of sympathy .
1	What is her observation upon that ?
1	But though I liked him more and more the better I knew him , I still felt more and more how much it was to be regretted that he had been educated in no habits of application and concentration .
1	A month ' s notice terminates my tenancy .
1	Ruin him , seize and sell his lands and goods , drive him from house and home , and drag him forth a beggar in his old age , to die in a common jail. " ' " But the costs , my dear Sir , the costs of all this , " reasoned the attorney , when he had recovered from his momentary surprise .
1	Is that it , my dear ? '
1	Neither will I more than hint at my foreigner-like mistake in supposing that a party of most active persons , who scrambled on board at the peril of their lives as we approached the wharf , were newsmen , answering to that industrious class at home ; whereas , despite the leathern wallets of news slung about the necks of some , and the broad sheets in the hands of all , they were Editors , who boarded ships in person ( as one gentleman in a worsted comforter informed me ) , ' because they liked the excitement of it. ' Suffice it in this place to say , that one of these invaders , with a ready courtesy for which I thank him here most gratefully , went on before to order rooms at the hotel ; and that when I followed , as I soon did , I found myself rolling through the long passages with an involuntary imitation of the gait of <NAME> P. Cooke , in a new nautical melodrama .
1	You shall see the whole case clear , from first to last . "
1	When that time should come , it would not be the heavier to him , for this that she was going to do ; and it might fall something lighter upon her .
1	'Then my aunt invests you with full power , ' said <NAME> , smiling through her tears ; 'but pray do n't be harder upon the poor fellows than is indispensably necessary . '
1	The star had shown him where to find the God of the poor ; and through humility , and sorrow , and forgiveness , he had gone to his <NAME> ' s rest .
1	He now abruptly opens them , and says , in unison with the deepened voice ' Ah ! ' —rather as if stopping himself on the extreme verge of adding— ' men ! ' ' I have been since , ' says <NAME> , with his legs stretched out , and solemnly enjoying himself with the wine and the fire , ' what you behold me ; I have been since a solitary mourner ; I have been since , as I say , wasting my evening conversation on the desert air .
1	An ' t that as nat ' ral as a sheep ' s bleating , or a pig ' s grunting , or a horse ' s neighing , or a bird ' s singing ?
1	<NAME> <NAME> had made his preliminary arrangements , and was looking over the coffee-room blinds at the passengers in the street , when the waiter entered , and announced that the chaise was ready -- an announcement which the vehicle itself confirmed , by forthwith appearing before the coffee- room blinds aforesaid .
1	You may thank me for restoring him to you .
1	" Now , <NAME> , " he said to me , " you wo n't be alarmed whatever comes off , I know .
1	" Mother by adoption , " retorted <NAME> , never departing from the easy grace of her attitude , never raising her voice as the other did , never yielding either to anger or tenderness , -- " mother by adoption , I have said that I owe everything to you .
1	They were , in truth , very rugged , noisy fellows , and quite brutal among themselves , though civil enough to their two passengers .
1	' Why , what a thing it would be for yourselves and your family , <NAME> and Mrs. Micawber , if you were to emigrate now. ' ' Capital , madam , capital , ' urged <NAME> , gloomily .
1	One word ! " Thus calling him back as I went out of the door , I heard her say to <NAME> in a distinct emphatic voice , " The boy has been a good boy here , and that is his reward .
1	<NAME> dropped on one knee , and implored him , with a redundancy of gesticulation , to hear what had brought himself into such foul company .
1	She told me that everything would be arranged for me by <NAME> , and that I should want for nothing , and gave me the kindest words and the best advice .
1	" The dear little thing , " returned <NAME> , " holds dutifully to her father as long as he lasts ; but he wo n't last long .
1	After recovering twice or thrice , and as often relapsing , he wiped his eyes and said grace ; and a very cheerful meal their scanty supper was .
1	'The first question is , of what nature was her communication ? '
1	Having relieved her mind of these disclosures , she partook of shrimps and porter , and evinced a disposition to swear eternal friendship .
1	You know that when I became enough of a man to find myself an embodied conundrum , I bored myself to the last degree by trying to find out what I meant .
1	<NAME> <NAME> is the gentleman ' s name. ' ' I hope you have preserved the unities , sir ? ' said <NAME> .
1	' I can not disguise from you , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , knitting his brow , ' that the result of your probation there has disappointed me ; has greatly disappointed me .
1	' I entreat <NAME> to bear with me in entering into these details .
1	I hear nothing now , indeed .
1	I was with him when he was sick and well , rich and poor .
1	I have been carted out of <NAME> in the dead of night , and carried leagues away from it packed in straw .
1	He knew no better fields than those near <NAME> , and no better means of getting at them than by passing Mr <NAME> ' s house .
1	There 's no one here but the finest creature upon earth -- a child . "
1	" Did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner ? " Not so like ( the witness said ) as that he could be mistaken .
1	They were all silent for a long while .
1	' It was summer-time ; and wrapped in his gloomy thoughts , he would issue from his solitary lodgings early in the evening , and wandering along a narrow path beneath the cliffs , to a wild and lonely spot that had struck his fancy in his ramblings , seat himself on some fallen fragment of the rock , and burying his face in his hands , remain there for hours -- sometimes until night had completely closed in , and the long shadows of the frowning cliffs above his head cast a thick , black darkness on every object near him .
1	You never run up and down stairs for me , all day long .
1	' What ails you ? ' said the man , immediately aware of it , though so intent on the advancing waters ; ' I see nothing afloat. ' The red light was gone , the shudder was gone , and his gaze , which had come back to the boat for a moment , travelled away again .
1	' " You did ? " said <NAME> , at last finding breath to speak .
1	' I shall be stronger than I was afore .
1	Therefore , he stayed to dinner .
1	I do n't know how it is exactly , but the law seems to put things up in price .
1	The Father of the <NAME> , even humming a tune , and wearing his black velvet cap a little on one side , so much improved were his spirits , went down into the yard , and found his old pensioner standing there hat in hand just within the gate , as he had stood all this time .
1	It is <NAME> 's habit -- it is the head and front of his pretensions indeed -- to keep this sort of debtor and creditor account in the smallest items and to post it publicly on the most trivial occasions .
1	I don ' t say she has got it .
1	These various signs and tokens , marked by the little woman , are not lost upon her .
1	It was on the very next day after he had eased his mind by arriving at this decision , that the Major , sitting at his breakfast , saw an apparition so tremendous and wonderful in <NAME> Tox ' s little drawing-room , that he remained for some time rooted to his chair ; then , rushing into the next room , returned with a double-barrelled opera-glass , through which he surveyed it intently for some minutes .
1	It might be more according to the rights of things , to say Two-thirds ; it might be more according to the rights of things , to say Three-fourths .
1	' The people are coming down the crescent now .
1	And there my sister became so excited by the twenty-five guineas , that nothing would serve her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the <NAME> , and that <NAME> must go over in his chaise-cart , and bring the <NAME> and <NAME> .
1	It happened to be the <NAME> ' s birthday , too .
1	' Ah , well ! ' he said , wiping his face .
1	I will not sit here , and hear such comparisons made. ' With that she stalked out , and made the door bang after her .
1	I wished that <NAME> had not met me , or that I had not yielded to him and gone with him , so that , of all days in the year on this day , I might not have had <NAME> in my breath and on my clothes .
1	He ' d be afraid of you , and wouldn ' t talk .
1	<NAME> <NAME> eyed him intently as he turned from the bottom line of the first page to the top line of the second , and from the bottom of the second to the top of the third , and from the bottom of the third to the top of the fourth ; but not the slightest alteration of countenance afforded a clue to the feelings with which he received the announcement of his son ' s marriage , which <NAME> knew was in the very first half-dozen lines .
1	She was calmed and comforted by the thought , and went to rest with a lighter heart .
1	And the broad stomacher heaves , and the quaint upright old-fashioned figure bends under its load of affectionate distress .
1	<NAME> himself was the chief impediment .
1	He 'll be here soon enough for us all . '
1	Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw in his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much spawn , to develop into the fish that were to come to his net , -- to be prosecuted , defended , forsworn , made orphans , bedevilled somehow. " " I follow you , sir. " " Put the case , <NAME> , that here was one pretty little child out of the heap who could be saved ; whom the father believed dead , and dared make no stir about ; as to whom , over the mother , the legal adviser had this power : " I know what you did , and how you did it .
1	No one , however , had been there .
1	She raised her veil , for an instant , while she preferred the inquiry , and disclosed a countenance of most uncommon beauty , though shaded by a cloud of sadness , which , in one so young , was doubly remarkable .
1	There was a fire in the tap-room , and some country-labourers were drinking before it .
1	<NAME> concluded , Mr <NAME> ' s horse was ordered out again , and Mr Carker mounting his own , they rode off for the <NAME> together .
1	Down there ! ' At first this , and her terrific screams , were all that could be got from <NAME> , by any tears , by any prayers , by any representations , by any means .
1	His black hat was brown before he could afford a coat , his pantaloons were white at the seams and knees before he could buy a pair of boots , his boots had worn out before he could treat himself to new pantaloons , and , by the time he worked round to the hat again , that shining modern article roofed-in an ancient ruin of various periods .
1	' I an ' t a talker , ' replied the other .
1	By little and little he began ; laying down his knife and fork with a noise , taking things up sharply , biting at his bread as if he were offended with it , and in other similar ways showing that he was out of sorts .
1	However , as it must be done , I went down , after two or three false starts half-way , and as many runs back on tiptoe to my own room , and presented myself in the parlour .
1	His scrambling home , from week 's end to week 's end , is like one great washing-day -- only nothing 's washed ! "
1	I ' d go anywhere about the house the same as ever .
1	" Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are , " she returned .
1	Mrs Tickit , though minutely circumstantial in her reply , had no settled opinion between five seconds and ten minutes .
1	However , there I have ' em , just the same .
1	You do n't forget how happily and peacefully my life is all marked out for me , and by whom ?
1	When she loved him , <NAME> , right well .
1	I have reflected that if I should wear out , he will be able to watch that judgment .
1	' The avocations of R. W. , my husband , ' Mrs <NAME> explained , on resuming her seat , ' keep him fully engaged in the <NAME> at this time of the day , or he would have had the honour of participating in your reception beneath our humble roof. ' ' Very pleasant premises ! ' said Mr Boffin , cheerfully .
1	' I feel it more than anybody else , ' said Mrs. Gummidge ; ' I ' m a lone lorn creetur ' , and she used to be a ' most the only thing that didn ' t go contrary with me. ' Mrs. Gummidge , whimpering and shaking her head , applied herself to blowing the fire .
1	Are we to be exposed to this unnatural conduct every moment of our lives ?
1	' She then gave <NAME> a string of beads which she used to wear at home , which were recognised by the child at once , who , with much joy , put them around her neck , and sought me eagerly to say she understood the string was from her home .
1	She went through with me , she went through with the <NAME> , she went through with herself , she went through with everythink .
1	' It is a tale of life , and life is made up of such sorrows , ' returned the other , courteously , but in a grave and sad tone of voice .
1	' Yes , ' says <NAME> , with sudden spirit , ' The politeness was my guardian ' s , not mine .
1	" I go there at other times , " said <NAME> , " but <NAME> does not come then .
1	" <NAME> ? " asked <NAME> , inquisitively raising her dark eyebrows .
1	He said gently , ' Tattycoram , come to me a moment , my good girl. ' She went up to the window .
1	She then got on her bonnet and went out , having been anxious to get out much sooner .
1	A man is hungry all day long .
1	As a portion of the world affect to despise the power of money , I must try and show them what it is. ' And being , by this time , in a pleasant frame of mind for slumber , <NAME> went to bed .
1	' Nobody ' s at home at present , ' returned the child , with a glib assertion of her dignity , ' except the person of the house .
1	How -- or perhaps I should rather say where -- IS <NAME> ? ' ' Not here , ' Mrs <NAME> proclaimed , with folded arms .
1	' So she wrote to me to say that if I ever felt myself hurt , ' she looked down at her young mistress , ' or found myself worried , ' she looked down at her again , ' I might go to her , and be considerately treated .
1	The night crept on apace , the moon went down , the stars grew pale and dim , and morning , cold as they , slowly approached .
1	<NAME> <NAME> put his dead glove , which scarcely seemed to have any hand in it , on my fingers , and then on my guardian 's fingers , and took his long thin shadow away .
1	' Oh , how-de-do , Mr Gills ? ' The salutation was addressed to the <NAME> , now emerging from the back parlour with a most transparent and utterly futile affectation of coming out by accidence .
1	' If , ' said <NAME> , with solemn patience , ' I have not expressed myself with clearness , <NAME> , the fault of course is mine .
1	' Not a word , ' resumed <NAME> , ' and never will be .
1	' That is , <NAME> , when they took some of the trouble out of you-know-who ' s head , and put it you know where , there was a -- ' <NAME> made his two hands revolve very fast about each other a great number of times , and then brought them into collision , and rolled them over and over one another , to express confusion .
1	To enlighten it with the lights of a stone passage , a flight of stairs , a brown window-curtain , and a black man .
1	Do not mind the rain .
1	We held one another for a little space yet , but she was so firm that she took my hands away , and put them back against my breast , and with a last kiss as she held them there , released them , and went from me into the wood .
1	The law-stationer 's establishment is , in <NAME> 's eyes , a temple of plenty and splendour .
1	And he whittled with such industry and hearty good will , that but for his being called away very soon , it must have disappeared bodily , and left nothing in its place but grist and shavings .
1	' It ' s from <NAME> and <NAME> ' s. ' ' And it ' s uncommon handsome o ' <NAME> and <NAME> , as knows so little of me , to come down vith a present , ' said <NAME> .
1	It was not yet daylight ; for the candle was still burning , and it was quite dark outside .
1	Having inspected the docks and shipping , and viewed the cathedral , he inquired his way to <NAME> , and being directed thither , took the route which was pointed out to him .
1	" What have you been thinking about , my dear ? "
1	they ' re too beautiful to live , much too beautiful ! ' On hearing this alarming presentiment of their being doomed to an early death in the flower of their infancy , all four little girls raised a hideous cry , and burying their heads in their mother ' s lap simultaneously , screamed until the eight flaxen tails vibrated again ; Mrs. <NAME> meanwhile clasping them alternately to her bosom , with attitudes expressive of distraction , which <NAME> herself might have copied .
1	' I like your conversation much .
1	The procession up the aisle was beautiful .
1	But happily ( and Mrs. Snagsby tightly shakes her head and tightly smiles ) that boy was met by <NAME> yesterday in the streets ; and that boy , as affording a subject which <NAME> desires to improve for the spiritual delight of a select congregation , was seized by <NAME> and threatened with being delivered over to the police unless he showed the reverend gentleman where he lived and unless he entered into , and fulfilled , an undertaking to appear in <NAME> 's Court to-morrow night , " to -- mor -- row -- night , " Mrs. Snagsby repeats for mere emphasis with another tight smile and another tight shake of her head ; and to-morrow night that boy will be here , and to-morrow night Mrs. Snagsby will have her eye upon him and upon some one else ; and oh , you may walk a long while in your secret ways ( says Mrs. Snagsby with haughtiness and scorn ) , but you ca n't blind ME !
1	What is your name ? ' A question more decidedly rushing at the secret he was keeping from her , could not have astounded him .
1	On the day when matters were concluded between <NAME> and <NAME> , we were all under engagement to dine at <NAME> 's house .
1	Boats were putting off , torches were lighting up , people were rushing tumultuously to the water ' s edge .
1	" If you please , " said <NAME> .
1	There was a back-garret window with rusty bars outside , which had no shutter ; and out of this , <NAME> often gazed with a melancholy face for hours together ; but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused and crowded mass of housetops , blackened chimneys , and gable-ends .
1	<NAME> of you gentlemen ' s name ' s <NAME> ? ' At this inquiry , <NAME> gave such a very undisguised and palpable start , that no further reply was needed .
1	I know it , and have heard my father say so .
1	" A multitude of people , and yet a solitude ! " said <NAME> , when they had listened for a while .
1	Oh , for mercy ' s sake , tell uncle that I never loved him half so dear as now .
1	I think not at all , <NAME> , " he returned with an effort .
1	' He is shooting in <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> for the <NAME> prisoner 's kindred in <NAME> Force !
1	' An unexpected playsure , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , taking his glass out of his right eye , where it had , until now , done duty on <NAME> , and fixing it in his left , to bring it to bear on <NAME> .
1	' <NAME> , ' the mother resumed , ' is self-willed and resolute ; and as these people naturally strain every nerve to catch him , I can entertain very little hope , Mr Clennam , that the thing will be broken off .
1	His worship knew this perfectly well ; but it was a good annoyance , and a safe one .
1	When I cries out that night , " I know you now , you ' re <NAME> ! " -- which was my exact words ; wasn ' t they , <NAME> ? ' ' Your exact words , ' said <NAME> , laying his hand on hers .
1	" Are you <NAME> ? " ' " Yes , sir. " ' " Then I have to tell you that you are a— " ( applying an appropriate epithet ) .
1	said he after giving us a courteous greeting .
1	I brought it with me to send from these parts , as <NAME> might be a painful name just now to the person it 's written to .
1	" I am pretty well , I thank you , " answered <NAME> , with meekness ; " how are you ? " " Nothing to boast of , " said <NAME> .
1	Lastly , as he had not yet been seen by the laundress or her niece , he was to keep himself out of their view until his change of dress was made .
1	Is it , <NAME> ? ' A deceiving Bella she was , to look at him with that pensively abstracted air , as if her mind were full of her book , and she had not heard a single word !
1	Has there been none here this fifteen years ? ' Thus was she always balancing her bargains with the <NAME> of heaven , posting up the entries to her credit , strictly keeping her set-off , and claiming her due .
1	I am very , very sorry , dearest Pa , to have brought home all this trouble. ' ' My pet , ' returned her father , in the simplest good faith , ' don ' t make yourself uneasy about that .
1	By day , are there no Punches , <NAME> , Dancing-dogs , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , or even Barrel-organs ?
1	" Not that it affects you , though , I 'm sure , " said <NAME> , putting up the steps .
1	If he be ever asked how , why , when , or wherefore , he shuts up one eye and shakes his head .
1	' Just come in , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> .
1	To read it ? ' ' Bless ye ! ' She reads it with surprise , and looks down with a new expression and an added interest on the motionless face she kneels beside .
1	'And he 'd uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it , ' responded <NAME> , knocking his stick upon the floor .
1	But happening to look up at Mrs. Pocket as she sat reading her book of dignities after prescribing <NAME> as a sovereign remedy for baby , I thought -- Well -- No , I would n't .
1	said I when we had sat before the fire a little while .
1	" You are , of course , the person who has written me so many letters ? "
1	' Shall I tell you that the young man , who , looking back to the earliest of his childhood ' s days to which memory and consciousness extended , and carrying his recollection down to that moment , could remember nothing which was not in some way connected with a long series of voluntary privations suffered by his mother for his sake , with ill-usage , and insult , and violence , and all endured for him -- shall I tell you , that he , with a reckless disregard for her breaking heart , and a sullen , wilful forgetfulness of all she had done and borne for him , had linked himself with depraved and abandoned men , and was madly pursuing a headlong career , which must bring death to him , and shame to her ?
1	<NAME> <NAME> , after laughing cheerfully and clapping him on the shoulder , assists in these arrangements and helps to get the gallery into business order .
1	' My darling , ' said <NAME> , ' you wear that pretty black frock in remembrance of your Mama. ' ' I can remember my Mama , ' returned the child , with tears springing to her eyes , ' in any frock. ' ' But people put on black , to remember people when they ' re gone. ' ' Where gone ? ' asked the child .
1	' Well , <NAME> , ' said the other -- ' Doctor <NAME> was of the same mind , I believed .
1	Having descended in safety from the wall , and not forgotten to devote a few moments to his own particular business in the same department , <NAME> then made the best of his way back to the <NAME> , where his prolonged absence had occasioned much speculation and some alarm .
1	<NAME> and <NAME> has warped him out of himself and perverted me in his eyes .
1	<NAME> sighed , and shook his head despondingly .
1	' Was he not , <NAME> ? ' ' You know he was not. ' ' He was , ' cried the woman .
1	He has been for some time particularly desirous to serve his country in a post of good emoluments , unaccompanied by any trouble or responsibility .
1	Then , without a scrap of courage , but with a great deal of desperation , I went softly in and stood beside her , touching her with my finger .
1	So I thought one day when I went to <NAME> to meet <NAME> , at her solicitation , I would ask <NAME> to be in waiting for me at the coach-office , that we might have a little talk together .
1	And so _he_ goes up the postern stair .
1	He wore it the last time you ever saw him , and the last time you ever will see him -- in this world. ' ' It ' s my belief you mean to tell me to my face you killed him ! ' exclaimed <NAME> ; but , nevertheless , allowing his glass to be filled again .
1	Among them is a very little boy , who chews tobacco like a very big one ; and a droning gentleman , who talks arithmetically and statistically on all subjects , from poetry downwards ; and who always speaks in the same key , with exactly the same emphasis , and with very grave deliberation .
1	<NAME> and <NAME> had often dealt in hides , but never in hearts .
1	Also , while he still grasped that feature , he directed several thoughtful looks down the street , after the retiring figure of Mr Boffin .
1	Therefore I take every opportunity of openly stating to a friend of <NAME> how <NAME> is situated .
1	what have I done to be looked at , like that ? ' ' My lad , ' said <NAME> , ' don ' t you sing out afore you ' re hurt .
1	' It is my duty to find out why she made that stipulation .
1	<NAME> ' ever , there is law for us women , mis ' rable creeturs as they ' d make us , if they could ; and that your master will find out , young man , to his cost , afore he ' s six months older. ' At this consolatory reflection , Mrs. <NAME> bridled up , and smiled at Mrs. Sanders , who smiled back again .
1	He laid open his affairs without the smallest reserve , and descanted at some length upon the merits of his company , and the acquirements of his family ; of both of which , the two broad-sword boys formed an honourable portion .
1	Wednesday being so close upon us , we determined to go back to <NAME> that night , three in the post-chaise ; the rather , as we should then be clear away before the night 's adventure began to be talked of .
1	You are travelling for amusement and instruction .
1	Upon the undertaker 's stating in the <NAME> 's bar in the course of the day that he has received orders to construct " a six-footer , " the general solicitude is much relieved , and it is considered that <NAME> 's conduct does him great honour .
1	In his sullen and unwholesome brooding , the unhappy man , with a dull perception of his alienation from all hearts , and a vague yearning for what he had all his life repelled , made a distorted picture of his rights and wrongs , and justified himself with it against her .
1	Running on thus , and now holding Oliver from her to mark how he had grown , now clasping him to her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair , the good soul laughed and wept upon his neck by turns .
1	' You are , sir , I perceive , a man of sense and talent , ' said <NAME> , almost breathless with the vehemence of his patriotic declaration .
1	' If anyone had told me this yesterday , ' said <NAME> , with majesty , ' or even half-an-hour ago , I should have been tempted , I almost believe , to strike them to the earth .
1	The President will have a gentleman before him soon .
1	In another part of the building , there was a male patient in bed ; very much flushed and heated .
1	He may not have money , but he always has what is much better -- family , my dear . "
1	Travellers ' <NAME> , ' cross the green. ' The boy instantly darted off with the shilling , lest <NAME> should repent , but stopped at a safe distance , on the happy chance of his being uneasy in his mind about it , to goad him with a demon dance expressive of its irrevocability .
1	I can do it without <NAME> , of course , but this is the shortest way . "
1	Although I was treated in every other respect like the rest of the school , this single difference was made in my case from the first .
1	If you have nothing better to do than to walk up town with me , I shall be glad to introduce you to <NAME> ' s daughter. ' ' Mr .
1	The house was dark and shabby , and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in <NAME> 's room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase for years .
1	The excellent old gentleman being at these times a mere clothes-bag with a black skull-cap on the top of it , does not present a very animated appearance until he has undergone the two operations at the hands of his granddaughter of being shaken up like a great bottle and poked and punched like a great bolster .
1	Thus he will say , touching his strange sights : ' Durdles come upon the old chap , ' in reference to a buried magnate of ancient time and high degree , ' by striking right into the coffin with his pick .
1	R. W. scratched his head and looked apologetically all round the table until he came to his wife , when observing her as it were shrouded in a more sombre veil than before , he once more hinted , ' My dear , I am really afraid you are not altogether enjoying yourself ? ' To which she once more replied , ' On the contrary , R. W. Quite so. ' The wretched Mr <NAME> ' s position at this agreeable entertainment was truly pitiable .
1	'How do you do , sir ?
1	The reason is all mine , I do not insinuate that it is in any way yours. ' ' Well , sir , ' she returned , repeating a little less haughtily than before her former invitation to him to be seated : to which he now deferred , as she seated herself .
1	Who loosed it ? ' <NAME> , being on his road to the <NAME> , approaches it by way of <NAME> .
1	The name of <NAME> is the name of the age .
1	' Then who knows but the gentleman , anticipating our objection to play for love , civilly desired to play for money ? ' The old man replied by shaking the little purse in his eager hand , and then throwing it down upon the table , and gathering up the cards as a miser would clutch at gold .
1	' Yes , yes , yes , yes. ' ' And if , my dear Frederick -- if you could , without putting any great constraint upon yourself , throw a little ( pray excuse me , <NAME> ) , a little polish into your usual demeanour -- ' ' <NAME> , <NAME> , ' said the other , shaking his head , ' it ' s for you to do all that .
1	I ' ll write another to-morrow morning .
1	'Yes , ' said <NAME> , recoiling a few steps , as if to be nearer assistance in case she should require it .
1	With no greater experience of the world than he had acquired for himself in his short trials ; with a sufficient share of headlong rashness and precipitation ( qualities not altogether unnatural at his time of life ) ; with a very slender stock of money , and a still more scanty stock of friends ; what could he do ?
1	I am ashamed that you should have the trouble. ' He was gone before it came to that ; but soon returned , saying exactly as before , ' Here ' s your black box : ' which he also put down with care .
1	So artful , and so ungrateful you have been , <NAME> ; for when did I ever injure you ? ' ' There was also , ' Mr <NAME> went on , in a meditative manner , ' a errand connection , in which I was much respected .
1	The trooper shakes his head .
1	Hence she had at last consented to play off against <NAME> a stricken market-gardner known to be ready with his offer on the smallest encouragement , and hence -- as this occasion had been specially assigned for the purpose -- that great anxiety on her part for <NAME> ' s presence which had occasioned her to leave the note he has been seen to receive .
1	Now I lost him , now I saw him , now I lost him , now I was cut at with a whip , now shouted at , now down in the mud , now up again , now running into somebody ' s arms , now running headlong at a post .
1	Good-bye ! ' And so he left her : first observing that she sat down on the corner of a seat , and not only rested her little hand upon the rough wall , but laid her face against it too , as if her head were heavy , and her mind were sad .
1	I will not lose sight of him again , in a hurry. ' With these words , <NAME> shook <NAME> ' s hand once more , and , having done the same by <NAME> , threw himself into an arm-chair , his jolly red face shining again with smiles and health .
1	I felt very brave at being left alone in the solitary house , the protector of Em ' ly and Mrs. Gummidge , and only wished that a lion or a serpent , or any ill-disposed monster , would make an attack upon us , that I might destroy him , and cover myself with glory .
1	" Are there any more of you besides <NAME> ? "
1	When he comes back , he has recovered his composure , except that he contends against an avoidance of the boy , which is so very remarkable that it absorbs the woman 's attention .
1	Before what ? ' said <NAME> , putting her hand upon his arm .
1	<NAME> cares about me now , and it ' s very nat ' ral they shouldn ' t. ' Here the old lady tossed her head , and smoothed down her lavender-coloured silk dress with trembling hands .
1	At last he resolved to watch <NAME> and know more of her story .
1	I ' ve been looking for you , sir , rather what I may call specially. ' ' You don ' t say so , <NAME> ? ' ' Yes , I do say so , sir .
1	<NAME> for her father was the first distinct emotion that made head against the flood of sorrow which overwhelmed her .
1	<NAME> Peggotty suggesting to me , in a whisper , what had already occurred to myself , I took out my purse ; but I could not prevail upon her to accept any money , nor could I exact any promise from her that she would do so at another time .
1	By this time Mr <NAME> had remarked that he never found the visitor looking at any room , after throwing one quick glance around , but always found the visitor looking at him , Mr Flintwinch .
1	One disagreeable result of whispering is that it seems to evoke an atmosphere of silence , haunted by the ghosts of sound -- strange cracks and tickings , the rustling of garments that have no substance in them , and the tread of dreadful feet that would leave no mark on the sea-sand or the winter snow .
1	When I landed in <NAME> , I could not help being strongly impressed with the contrast their Custom-house presented , and the attention , politeness and good humour with which its officers discharged their duty .
1	A little hard-headed , <NAME> pippin-faced man , was conversing with a fat old gentleman in one corner ; and two or three more old gentlemen , and two or three more old ladies , sat bolt upright and motionless on their chairs , staring very hard at <NAME> and his fellow-voyagers .
1	But the <NAME> had somehow come to the knowledge that <NAME> kept a school .
1	A shadowy idea of wickedness committed , haunts every individual in the party ; and each one secretly thinks the other a companion in guilt , whom it would be agreeable to avoid .
1	' You ' ll always find a little bit of soap in the kitchen window ; that belongs to you. ' <NAME> opened his eyes , but not his mouth ; and <NAME> was again going away , when he once more turned back .
1	I know this in much the same way , I suppose .
1	When <NAME> asked him what he thought of the <NAME> , <NAME> said he had thought of that , too , and it was n't a bad idea .
1	There was an alacrity in his manner , too , which was equally unaccountable ; every time his eyes met those of <NAME> or <NAME> , he smirked and grinned ; once , <NAME> could have sworn , he saw him wink .
1	I ca n't go into a long explanation before company ; but I could n't help it , upon my honour . '
1	The very feet of the dog were bloody .
1	A field-marshal has his uniform ; a bishop his silk apron ; a counsellor his silk gown ; a beadle his cocked hat .
1	So , the close of every week was a delicious time for me ; and I got through the rest of the week by looking forward to it .
1	This , at the time I write , has been proved , I believe , to be the case ; but , as it would have been flat blasphemy against the system to have hinted such a doubt then , I looked out for the penitence as diligently as I could .
1	Sounds of recognition and greeting pass between the <NAME> and somebody else , at the stair-foot .
1	' I ask one promise , ' said <NAME> .
1	Rumbling along with most unwonted noise , the caravan stopped at last at the place of exhibition , where <NAME> dismounted amidst an admiring group of children , who evidently supposed her to be an important item of the curiosities , and were fully impressed with the belief that her grandfather was a cunning device in wax .
1	It was a great point too that <NAME> himself was flattered by the sensation he created , and after several efforts to preserve his gravity , burst into a loud roar , and so stood with his mouth wide open and his eyes nearly shut , laughing violently .
1	' Not if it should happen to have been a tame bull , you little <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> .
1	' When she finds how much we know , and how we know it , ' he said , ' and that she is clearly compromised already , we are not without strong hopes that we may be enabled through her means to punish the other two effectually .
1	Night after night does this excellent man -- don ' t frown , <NAME> ; I _will _say you _are _an excellent man -- come and sit here , for hours together , and it has not the least effect upon him. ' Well , that is odd , ' said <NAME> ; ' it ' ud have a wery considerable effect upon me , if I wos in his place ; I know that. ' ' The fact is , my young friend , ' said <NAME> solemnly , ' he has an obderrate bosom .
1	Finally she burst into violent weeping , and , when her sister came and sat close at her side to comfort her , said , ' Amy , you ' re an Angel ! ' ' But , I tell you what , my Pet , ' said <NAME> , when her sister ' s gentleness had calmed her , ' it now comes to this ; that things can not and shall not go on as they are at present going on , and that there must be an end of this , one way or another. ' As the announcement was vague , though very peremptory , <NAME> returned , ' Let us talk about it. ' ' Quite so , my dear , ' assented <NAME> , as she dried her eyes .
1	Within a few more minutes he is reported as sending his respects , and could my Lady please to receive him for a word or two after her dinner ?
1	' He is only the representative of another ! ' cried <NAME> .
1	' We call Crummles that , because his style of acting is rather in the heavy and ponderous way , ' said <NAME> .
1	So off they set ; the plaintiff and defendant walking arm in arm , the officer in front , and eight stout coachmen bringing up the rear .
1	But I AM such a nasty little thing ! ' ' My dear ! ' urged <NAME> again .
1	That I 'll do , and render an account of course .
1	If he had been in <NAME> indeed , and the time had been sunset , and the scene a stately terrace !
1	There was no sleep for <NAME> on that night when <NAME> turned so easily in his bed ; there was no sleep for little Miss Peecher .
1	What you have said to me could have affected me so much from no other lips , for there are none that could give it such a value to me .
1	He returned home one evening from an interview with her father , who had mentioned that she was out visiting -- which was what he always said when she was hard at work to buy his supper -- and found Mr Meagles in an excited state walking up and down his room .
1	He then stirred the fire and left me .
1	No , that she won ' t , but you little think why , <NAME> boy ! ' While Mrs. Sliderskew , influenced possibly by some lingering feelings of disappointment and personal slight , occasioned by her old master ' s preference for another , was giving loose to these grumblings below stairs , <NAME> was cogitating in the parlour upon what had taken place last night .
1	Ha -- send for the horses , pack the carriages , I ' ll not set foot in this man ' s house again ! ' No one had interfered in the dispute , which was beyond the <NAME> colloquial powers of <NAME> , <NAME> , and scarcely within the province of the ladies .
1	' I augur all sort of good from your sensible decision. ' ' <NAME> , you do us a great deal of honour , ' he rejoined .
1	I told the gentleman at first , when he told me upstairs it was come to light , that I would answer for your being umble , and making amends .
1	Drop it altogether. " " Yes , Jerry. " " Yes , <NAME> , " repeated <NAME> sitting down to tea .
1	I spoke to him , and he spoke to me .
1	I ' ll tell you what I ' ve said and done tomorrow. ' Without waiting for a reply , he darted off at a rapid pace , and , plunging into the crowds which thronged the street , was quickly lost to view .
1	Finally he gave a faint single rap , and <NAME> -- such was the compromising name of the avenging boy -- announced " Mr .
1	' If you ' re in arnest , you see , my lad , ' said the <NAME> , ' you ' re a object of clemency , and clemency is the brightest jewel in the crown of a <NAME> ' s head , for which you ' ll overhaul the constitution as laid down in <NAME> , and , when found , that is the charter as them garden angels was a singing of , so many times over .
1	He was standing close beside it , with one of his skeleton hands over his mouth , and the other resting on the <NAME> ' s table .
1	He returned no reply , but it was evident that he heard what was said , and that he thought about it , however confusedly .
1	" No , no , we will try to prevent that .
1	As he looked , she became blended with the child he had loved , and he could hardly separate the two .
1	" I believe it , my dear Charley .
1	'Not one , ' replied <NAME> , in a voice rendered husky by regret ; 'not one . '
1	It was altogether unaccountable that a young gentleman whose imagination had been strangled in his cradle , should be still inconvenienced by its ghost in the form of grovelling sensualities ; but such a monster , beyond all doubt , was <NAME> .
1	' My dear Sir , ' she said , addressing Mr Dombey , at whose munificence both she and <NAME> were shedding tears copiously ; ' I think you have overlooked something .
1	It was a weight to bear alone ; still my present duty appeared to be plain , and blest in the attachment of my dear , I did not want an impulse and encouragement to do it .
1	The women were seated at a long table , reading and writing , knitting , sewing , and embroidering ; the men were for the most part standing behind their chairs , or lingering up and down the room .
1	You can put on the cards and in the advertisements , " Education by <NAME> and able assistants , " without having any assistants , can ' t you ?
1	How unfortnet do you want me fur to be ?
1	So I thanked her ardently for this mark of her affection , and for all her other kindnesses towards me ; and after a tender good night , she took her nightcap into my bedroom .
1	Observe the blood which is trickling from her finger ; also the gold-eyed needle of the period , with which she is at work. ' All this , <NAME> repeated twice or thrice : pointing to the finger and the needle at the right times : and then passed on to the next .
1	I hope _she_ is not mad ? ' ' Yes. ' ' On what subject ?
1	' These are only some pupils of mine , ' said <NAME> , pointing to the little boy on the trunk and the two little boys on the floor , who had been staring at each other without uttering a word , and writhing their bodies into most remarkable contortions , according to the custom of little boys when they first become acquainted .
1	Having stolen in unobserved , he playfully leaned on the back of <NAME> ' s chair , and , as <NAME> saw him , put one of <NAME> ' s wandering locks to his lips , and waved a kiss from it towards <NAME> .
1	' Quite so , ' assented his partner .
1	<NAME> , you are a wag .
1	<NAME> do n't , father , " urged his son .
1	The stranger said nothing until <NAME> put his key in his door ; then , seeming to make sure of his identity from the action , he spoke : ' I beg your pardon , ' he said , coming from the window with a frank and smiling air , and a prepossessing address ; ' the beans. ' <NAME> was quite at a loss .
1	'We must make up for lost time when we 've got things into a good train .
1	The connection between the two places was by a hilly turnpike-road , and the travelling on that road was very slow .
1	'What do _you_ do here ? '
1	But how the graces and elegancies which she had dispersed about the poorly-furnished room went to the heart of <NAME> !
1	It was like her cordial voice in my ears .
1	' Does he deny that he did ?
1	Therefore , when <NAME> and I sat down with him by his fire , I asked him first of all whether he relied on <NAME> 's judgment and sources of information ?
1	He was going to say that you were not -- what ?
1	<NAME> to the Institution for the <NAME> in <NAME> ? ' ' I have seen it. ' ' Well !
1	Put him out , Smike. ' The drudge knew better from long experience , than to hesitate about obeying , so he bundled the victim out by a side-door , and <NAME> perched himself again on his own stool , supported by Mrs. Squeers , who occupied another at his side .
1	' For why ? ' growled <NAME> , looking at his friend for the first time .
1	' But let me go on thinking the facts out , and avoid confusing them with my speculations .
1	' How can I feel otherwise than flattered by your notice in any way ? ' ' Oh !
1	I released her arms , and called the woman to assist me to compose her figure and the dress she had torn .
1	And I do not doubt that this man -- whatever they call him , I forget his name -- is one of them. ' The landlady ' s lively speech was received with greater favour at the Break of Day , than it would have elicited from certain amiable whitewashers of the class she so unreasonably objected to , nearer <NAME> .
1	Sometimes my aunt and <NAME> were invited to do so , and accepted the invitation .
1	Oh , I should be so glad if you did know better , but I am so very much afraid that I must know best ! ' <NAME> asked her , laughing outright , whether she ever saw her own face or heard her own voice ?
1	" Really , I think I could do a greater thing than that if the need were pressing .
1	Sometimes , towards the end of a long stage , he suddenly breaks out into a discordant fragment of an election song , but his face never sings along with him : it is only his voice , and not often that .
1	I was at the coach office to take leave of her and see her go ; and there was he , returning to <NAME> by the same conveyance .
1	Many feet came up the creaking stairs ; and the step of some seemed to his listening ear so like that of the man for whom he waited , that <NAME> often stood up to be ready to address him when he reached the top ; but , one by one , each person turned off into some room short of the place where he was stationed : and at every such disappointment he felt quite chilled and lonely .
1	He lighted his lantern from that which <NAME> had detached from the rope , and now carried in his hand ; and making no effort to prolong the discourse , descended in silence , followed by his wife .
1	He followed , however , quickly ; and saw Mr Meagles going down the street with his enemy at his side .
1	" This foreign young woman has been my lodger for some weeks back . "
1	" If I could buy the furniture now hired for me , " said I , " and one or two other little things , I should be quite at home there. " " Go it ! " said <NAME> , with a short laugh .
1	' Show us into the room at once , without announcing us , ' said the little man , ' and it ' s yours. ' <NAME> threw the painted tops into a corner , and led the way through a dark passage , and up a wide staircase .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , thus mutely appealed to ; and possibly feeling his personal pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of <NAME> to reason ; gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and threats , the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the fertility of his invention .
1	'Very true , ' said the undertaker ; 'they would indeed . '
1	" Of <NAME> , " says <NAME> , hitting him again .
1	They have wondered how I have suffered it .
1	If ever an old gentleman had made a point of appearing in public , shaved close and clean , that old gentleman was <NAME> .
1	' Yes , ' he said without emotion , ' it was <NAME> , he knew .
1	After a preliminary raising of his spirits with the information that she considered the patient decidedly worse , she would further cheer him up by relating how dull , listless , and low-spirited <NAME> was , because <NAME> foolishly talked about nothing else but him and family matters .
1	' Well , well ! ' he said with a sigh , dismissing , as I then saw , some trial she had borne , or was yet to bear , in connexion with what my aunt had told me .
1	Learning from <NAME> that the invitation referred to the evening then wearing away , I expressed my readiness to do honour to it ; and we went off together to the lodging which <NAME> occupied as <NAME> , and which was situated near the top of the <NAME> ' s <NAME> .
1	<NAME> Leicester generally refers back in his mind to <NAME> and arranges a sequence of events on a plan of his own .
1	When they were within two paces of each other , <NAME> 's <NAME> held up its hand , warning him to come no nearer .
1	' <NAME> requires me to put perfect faith in him , and he shall not be disappointed. ' She went up to <NAME> one day , to meet him , in order that they might make some purchases .
1	I never in my life did see such listless , heavy dulness as brooded over these meals : the very recollection of it weighs me down , and makes me , for the moment , wretched .
1	If he is not -- and you tell me he is not ; on any pretence ; it is indifferent to me what -- my doors are shut against him henceforth , and yours , I take it for granted , are open to him. ' To this address , my aunt had listened with the closest attention , sitting perfectly upright , with her hands folded on one knee , and looking grimly on the speaker .
1	Though it would cost him a hard pang to leave her , and though he could think of no similar place in which his condemnation would not pursue him , perhaps it was almost a relief to be forced away from the endurance of the last four days , even to unknown difficulties and distresses .
1	' Now , what I will say for you , my dear , ' the cherub pursued mildly and without a notion of complaining , ' is , that you are so adaptable .
1	He turned his thoughts back to the starting-point of this unknown injury ; and in the meantime <NAME> , having rolled his green packet pretty round , cut it carefully into three pieces , and laid it on a plate as if it were some particular delicacy .
1	' Not to deceive you , sir , I notice it , ' said <NAME> , ' and I take it kind of you. ' He was at a loss to understand what she meant ; and by expressing as much in his looks , elicited her explanation .
1	The scene was altered to a small bedroom , where the fairest and youngest child lay dying ; the roses had fled from his cheek , and the light from his eye ; and even as the sexton looked upon him with an interest he had never felt or known before , he died .
1	Indeed , the quarrel , from slight beginnings , rose to a considerable height , and was assuming a very violent complexion , when both parties , falling into a great passion of tears , exclaimed simultaneously , that they had never thought of being spoken to in that way : which exclamation , leading to a remonstrance , gradually brought on an explanation : and the upshot was , that they fell into each other ' s arms and vowed eternal friendship ; the occasion in question making the fifty-second time of repeating the same impressive ceremony within a twelvemonth .
1	It is far better to lie down at night beneath an open sky like that yonder -- see how bright it is -- than to rest in close rooms which are always full of care and weary dreams .
1	There had been snow , some hours before ; and it lay , not deep , but hard-frozen on the ground .
1	the only neighbouring thing at all akin to the other little captives , some of whom , shrinking from the hot hands of drunken purchasers , lie drooping on the path already , while others , soddened by close contact , await the time when they shall be watered and freshened up to please more sober company , and make old clerks who pass them on their road to business , wonder what has filled their breasts with visions of the country .
1	' Have you any other apartments , ma ' am ? ' he asked .
1	In the fair city of this vision , there were airy galleries from which the loves and graces looked upon him , gardens in which the fruits of life hung ripening , waters of <NAME> that sparkled in his sight .
1	Sometimes , parliamentary questions were asked about it , and even parliamentary motions made or threatened about it by demagogues so low and ignorant as to hold that the real recipe of government was , How to do it .
1	You can understand what I read aloud ? ' ' Altogether .
1	His enemy , muttering to himself , after wringing his wounded hand for sometime , slowly drew off his neck-kerchief and bound it up ; then held it in his other hand , and sat upon his table with his sullen face looking down .
1	They soon grew into a habit ; and we are creatures of habit -- creatures of habit ! ' Putting his hands into his pockets , and leaning back in his chair , he looked at the brother and sister as if it were interesting to him to see them together ; and went on to say , with a kind of irritable thoughtfulness : ' It ' s this same habit that confirms some of us , who are capable of better things , in <NAME> ' s own pride and stubbornness -- that confirms and deepens others of us in villainy -- more of us in indifference -- that hardens us from day to day , according to the temper of our clay , like images , and leaves us as susceptible as images to new impressions and convictions .
1	If you are poor , let us be poor together ; but let me be with you , do let me be with you ; do not let me see such change and not know why , or I shall break my heart and die .
1	But whatever you do , do n't you fall a-crying , my dear ; and do n't you worry yourself no more than you can help .
1	Similarly , <NAME> continues to post tremendous placards on the disputed thoroughfare and ( with his bird upon his head ) to hold forth vehemently against <NAME> in the sanctuary of his own home ; similarly , also , he defies him as of old in the little church by testifying a bland unconsciousness of his existence .
1	<NAME> and you 'll hear all the bells in the city jangling . "
1	As his lineaments soften with life , their faces and their hearts harden to him .
1	My life has been passed in this poor prison , and my teaching has been very defective ; but let me implore you to remember later and better days .
1	' I admire it greatly , sir , ' said <NAME> .
1	' <NAME> ' s the pleasant word as soom heer has spok ' n wi ' me ; monny ' s the face I see heer , as I first seen when I were yoong and lighter heart ' n than now .
1	I have felt it dreadfully .
1	<NAME> <NAME> had received them with a familiar nod and a friendly look , but without any more particular greeting in the midst of his address .
1	" You may get cheated , robbed , and murdered in <NAME> .
1	The little judge turned to the witness as soon as his indignation would allow him to speak , and said -- ' Do you know who that was , sir ? ' ' I rayther suspect it was my father , my lord , ' replied <NAME> .
1	That would make it quite complete , that would : quite. ' When he had become restored to his usual condition by these and other comments on his approaching triumph , <NAME> put away his book , and , having locked the chest with great caution , descended into the kitchen to warn <NAME> to bed , and scold her for having afforded such ready admission to a stranger .
1	It was characteristic of the police people that they had all more or less suspected poor Joe ( though he never knew it ) , and that they had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest spirits they had ever encountered .
1	He is such a ridiculous fellow ! "
1	" You are a good woman . "
1	Every black spot in every mountain of water that rolled away was a bit o ' the ship ' s life or a living man , and so she went to pieces , <NAME> , and no grass will never grow upon the graves of them as manned that ship. ' ' They were not all lost ! ' cried <NAME> .
1	Why should I not ? ' ' I thought , my dear , that perhaps your face might -- ' ' My face might be a martyrdom , but what would that import , or who should know it , if I smiled ? ' And she did smile ; manifestly freezing the blood of Mr <NAME> by so doing .
1	It may be a cheerful language .
1	' Thank you , ' replied <NAME> ; ' I ' d rather not. ' ' What do _you _think , <NAME> ? ' inquired <NAME> .
1	The <NAME> , more blue-faced and staring -- more over-ripe , as it were , than ever -- and giving vent , every now and then , to one of the horse ' s coughs , not so much of necessity as in a spontaneous explosion of importance , walked arm-in-arm with Mr Dombey up the sunny side of the way , with his cheeks swelling over his tight stock , his legs majestically wide apart , and his great head wagging from side to side , as if he were remonstrating within himself for being such a captivating object .
1	He had been high with Mr Rugg , and had threatened to employ some one else .
1	But the altar of our country sir -- ' ' You ' ll have a hackney-coach , I suppose ? ' interrupted the constable , holding <NAME> ( whom his other captors had released ) carelessly by the arm , a little above the elbow .
1	' What is the matter ? ' ' I don ' t know .
1	We was living then in a solitary place , but among the beautifullest trees , and with the roses a-covering our <NAME> to the roof .
1	I forgive you ; but I am so grieved , <NAME> , that you should have such bad passions in your heart. ' They had persuaded her that I was a wicked fellow , and she was more sorry for that than for my going away .
1	As my father 's came there .
1	He was disconcerted and walked to the window ; I almost believed with an intention of jumping out , until he turned and I was reassured by seeing in his eyes what he had gone there to hide .
1	' He ' s opposed to us ; he leads on the other side .
1	' <NAME> ; and that makes it the more vexatious , ' observed <NAME> , in the same pettish tone .
1	' <NAME> ' t I know that you were hanging about the house the other night , like a thief , eh ?
1	He smooths it out upon the table with his heavy palm , and thoughtfully walking up and down the gallery , makes a halt before it every now and then to come upon it with a fresh eye .
1	<NAME> brother to <NAME> ? " " Who 's he ? " said <NAME> .
1	Your sister will be in , in about a quarter of an hour .
1	If you are unable to make up your quantum , my boy , you had better address yourself to a principal ; there are plenty of principals in the profession , you know , and what is not worth the while of one , may be worth the while of another ; that 's my recommendation to you , speaking as a subordinate .
1	' I am ready to walk with you. ' ' Thank you , Mr Headstone .
1	<NAME> <NAME> is already enough impressed by <NAME> , to feel indignant that <NAME> ( far below her ) should hold his prize so lightly .
1	General <NAME> will help us out . "
1	<NAME> has consulted me in reference to what he has in contemplation ; and I have advised him to the best of my judgement. ' ' Unless I deceive myself , <NAME> , ' pursued <NAME> , ' what I contemplate is a disclosure of an important nature. ' ' Highly so , ' said <NAME> .
1	But -- it 's a flowing so soft and pleasant through the water , p'raps , as makes me think it -- I was a thinking through my smoke just then , that we can no more see to the bottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this river what I catches hold of .
1	Perhaps one of the highest uses of their ever having been there , was , that there might be left behind , that blessed air of tranquillity which pervaded <NAME> , and that serenely romantic state of the mind—productive for the most part of pity and forbearance—which is engendered by a sorrowful story that is all told , or a pathetic play that is played out .
1	I never saw him ( for this happened five-and-twenty years ago , before you and I were , <NAME> ) , but I have heard my father mention that he was a showy man , and the kind of man for the purpose .
1	<NAME> felt a little vague trepidation as to the subject-matter of this same consultation , until Mrs <NAME> announced it .
1	When we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits , and were going out for the walk with that training preparation on us , I was considerably surprised to see <NAME> take up a fishing-rod , and put it over his shoulder .
1	<NAME> , the gentleman who had the pleasure of meeting <NAME> at the house of their mutual acquaintance , <NAME> , a few days since , begs to inclose <NAME> the herewith invitation .
1	She was particularly proud of her turn for business ; and she showed it now in reducing everything to pen and ink , and being moved by nothing .
1	And the <NAME> of <NAME> , who on account of always having the whole of his little income anticipated stood in fact pledged to abstain from cakes as well as tobacco , so swelled with grief and rage when we passed a pastry-cook 's shop that he terrified me by becoming purple .
1	Happily , ' said Mr Rugg , with sarcasm , ' I did not so far travel out of the record as to ask the gentleman for his name. ' ' I suppose I have no resource but to see him , ' sighed <NAME> , wearily .
1	' There ' s <NAME> , ' he said , with flashing eyes ; ' the woman has spirit , determination , purpose -- was she asleep , or petrified ?
1	And wotsume'er the failings on his part , he were a corn and seedsman in his hart. " " Is it <NAME> 's house that has been broken into , then ? " " That 's it , <NAME> , " said <NAME> ; " and they took his till , and they took his cash-box , and they drinked his wine , and they partook of his wittles , and they slapped his face , and they pulled his nose , and they tied him up to his bedpust , and they giv ' him a dozen , and they stuffed his mouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out .
1	He saw her pause irresolutely at the door and look towards him ; and he saw no more .
1	And although I have been resident abroad , for some years ( it would give me great pleasure to receive my friend <NAME> , and everybody here , at Baden-Baden , and to have an opportunity of making ' em known to the <NAME> ) , still I know enough , I flatter myself , of my lovely and accomplished relative , to know that she possesses every requisite to make a man happy , and that her marriage with my friend <NAME> is one of inclination and affection on both sides. ' Many smiles and nods from Mr Carker .
1	' It gives me great pleasure , ' said Mr Dombey , with cumbrous gallantry , ' that a gentleman so nearly connected with myself as <NAME> is , should have had the honour and happiness of rendering the least assistance to Mrs Granger. ' Mr <NAME> bowed to her .
1	He made his way by sea to <NAME> , and back , after hearing the narrative to which <NAME> had assisted me .
1	I suppose I dodged them up and down this sofa for at least a quarter of an hour , without reaching them once ; and by the time I did catch them , the brandy-and-water was diminished , by constant spilling , to a teaspoonful .
1	Stealing lower down the stairs , and observing what passed , she saw her father come out in his morning gown , and start when he was told his wife had not come home .
1	' In the church , down yonder , ' said the <NAME> , pointing his thumb over his shoulder .
1	Though not a partner in the concern -- a distinction hitherto reserved solely to inheritors of the great name of <NAME> -- he was in the receipt of some percentage on its dealings ; and , participating in all its facilities for the employment of money to advantage , was considered , by the minnows among the tritons of the <NAME> , a rich man .
1	" At any rate , " said I , " I have no warning given me just now , for you wrote to me to come to you , this time. " " That 's true , " said <NAME> , with a cold careless smile that always chilled me .
1	He hath a lamb from the fold ! ' cried the preacher , raising his voice still higher and pointing to the baby .
1	Do you not know what is due to guests ?
1	She has called to me in her sleep before now , sir ; as I have sat by , watching , I have seen her lips move , and have known , though no sound came from them , that she spoke of me .
1	" Hah ! " said Mrs. <NAME> , restoring <NAME> to his station .
1	' <NAME> , ' blurted out Mr Toots , one day all at once , as his manner was , ' do you think you could think favourably of that proposition of mine , and give me the pleasure of your acquaintance ? ' ' Why , I tell you what it is , my lad , ' replied the <NAME> , who had at length concluded on a course of action ; ' I ' ve been turning that there , over. ' ' Captain Gills , it ' s very kind of you , ' retorted Mr Toots .
1	'Why , what does the boy mean ? '
1	" You go down here , and straight through the street , and past the fountain -- " " To the Devil with all that ! " interrupted the other , rolling his eye over the landscape .
1	But he invited <NAME> to dinner , and even brought him within range of the dangerous ( because expensive ) fascinations of <NAME> .
1	' <NAME> , ' said the watchful <NAME> , observing the effect which the praise of <NAME> had produced .
1	Meanwhile , <NAME> walked to and fro in his little back-office , troubled in mind by what had just occurred .
1	' Then p ' raps you ' ll give him Mrs <NAME> ' s respects , and say that the next time he lowers himself and his lodgings by talking out of the winder she ' ll thank him to come down and open the door too. ' Mrs <NAME> spoke loud , and listened for any observations that might be offered from the first floor .
1	It is true that How not to do it was the great study and object of all public departments and professional politicians all round the <NAME> Office .
1	Be so good as chair that there member in this direction , will you ? "
1	I adore her in it !
1	<NAME> recognised the sally in his usual way , and took in his provender in his usual way .
1	If that dark-visaged eldest boy could look more malicious than he had already looked , this was the time when he did it .
1	He rose to honour the toast ; and , carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner , advanced to the table , filled a glass with spirits , and drank off its contents .
1	said <NAME> , reflectively ; 'how queer ! '
1	" Dear <NAME> , have you heard what becomes of her property ? " " Well , old chap , " said <NAME> , " it do appear that she had settled the most of it , which I meantersay tied it up , on <NAME> .
1	' <NAME> ' em to call again. ' ' Oh , but please will you come and show the lodgings , ' returned the girl ; ' It ' s eighteen shillings a week and us finding plate and linen .
1	As his mind was teeming with these thoughts , the encounter took him altogether unprepared , so that the other passenger had had time to say , boisterously , ' <NAME> !
1	" My friend , " said <NAME> , standing with his back to the fire after giving up the sketch when it was half finished , " I should like to ask you something , without offence . "
1	Some of these had ladies with them , to whom they were showing the premises ; others were lounging on the chairs and sofas ; others , in a perfect state of exhaustion from listlessness , were yawning drearily .
1	It is a bare office , with bare windows , looking on the iron view below .
1	' But now isn ' t it , <NAME> , isn ' t it , <NAME> , invigorating , ' said Mrs. Markleham , mechanically following her with her eyes , ' to find a man at <NAME> ' s time of life , with the strength of mind to do this kind of thing ?
1	Even then , it was only to ask : ' Where is your Lock ? ' ' Twenty mile and odd -- call it five-and-twenty mile and odd , if you like -- up stream , ' was the sullen reply .
1	<NAME> <NAME> replied with solemnity , ' No , dearest <NAME> , I am but too well aware that I am merely human. ' Mrs <NAME> , for her part , still further improved the occasion by sitting with her eyes fastened on her husband , like two great black notes of interrogation , severely inquiring , Are you looking into your breast ?
1	<NAME> lady ? ' ' Yes , ' I said , ' rather. ' ' Pretty stiff in the back ? ' said he , making himself upright .
1	The party that had overtaken them , and followed in their train , consisted of only three members : one lady and two gentlemen .
1	' Your uncle ' s time is very valuable , my dear ; and however desirous you may be -- and naturally desirous , as I am sure any affectionate relations who have seen so little of your uncle as we have , must naturally be to protract the pleasure of having him among us , still , we are bound not to be selfish , but to take into consideration the important nature of his occupations in the city. ' ' I am very much obliged to you , ma ' am , ' said <NAME> with a scarcely perceptible sneer .
1	" <NAME> of <NAME> 's <NAME> .
1	Physicians ' prescriptions carefully prepared , " and all the rest of it .
1	What is the matter with you ? ' While <NAME> raised up the collector , <NAME> had performed the same office for <NAME> , who now regarded his late adversary in tipsy amazement .
1	The man obeyed , and <NAME> followed the light closely with his eyes .
1	When <NAME> was dressed -- which was very soon done , for he felt unwell and drowsy , and was not able to stand about it very long -- he went down into the drawing-room ; where he found <NAME> pacing up and down the room full dressed , but with a dignified and unconcerned demeanour , as if he thought it barely possible that one or two people might drop in by and by .
1	Since no one here knows anything about him , it might be as well to send for <NAME> .
1	As he looked , he saw her for an instant by a clearer and a brighter light , not bending over that child ' s pillow as his rival -- monstrous thought -- but as the spirit of his home , and in the action tending himself no less , as he sat once more with his bowed-down head upon his hand at the foot of the little bed .
1	I can walk quite strongly .
1	' My life ! ' said <NAME> , taking her in his arms .
1	After labouring for two or three years in their precious scheme , to find that they ' ve got a beggar at last , and one of them tied for life .
1	I ' ll slit his nose and ears , flog him , maim him for life .
1	" I am glad I think so , <NAME> .
1	Between five and six o ' clock in the morning we got up , and some of us went on deck , to give them an opportunity of taking the shelves down ; while others , the morning being very cold , crowded round the rusty stove , cherishing the newly kindled fire , and filling the grate with those voluntary contributions of which they had been so liberal all night .
1	But he saw nothing of this .
1	" Draw off a bit here , <NAME> , " says <NAME> as a kind of shabby palanquin is borne towards them , surrounded by a noisy crowd .
1	Who ? ' Clennam , replying in <NAME> , said the <NAME> lady ; he wished to see the <NAME> lady .
1	-- Of _shoes_ , sir , ' said <NAME> , turning upon him , and laying great emphasis on the word ; 'seized the loaded pistol that always goes upstairs with the plate-basket ; and walked on tiptoes to his room .
1	It is so very unusual to find you here at this hour .
1	Not in regular government pay and employment , to lay traps ?
1	From this spot , <NAME> wandered along all the galleries , up and down all the staircases , and once again round the whole area of the yard .
1	Is SHE working ? ' ' She is , ' says Veneering .
1	<NAME> given ; with the sarcastic addition ( from <NAME> ) of " Without slugs , Polly ! "
1	'Now , ' said the robber , 'come and sit aside of me , and put on your own face ; or I 'll alter it so , that you wo n't know it agin when you do want it . '
1	Patterns of carpets faded and became perplexed and faint , like the memory of those years ' trifling incidents .
1	I could not dress myself without help ; but I made up the fire , which was still burning , and got some coffee ready for them .
1	he ! ' ' Not many , I think , ' said <NAME> .
1	I ' ve heerd , in my dreams , of <NAME> ' s father and his uncle .
1	Some of these leaves , in a timid rush , seek sanctuary within the low arched Cathedral door ; but two men coming out resist them , and cast them forth again with their feet ; this done , one of the two locks the door with a goodly key , and the other flits away with a folio music-book .
1	It was not I who cautioned you once never to found a hope or expectation on the family curse . "
1	' Well , now I look at him closely , there _is_ a likeness. ' ' We were always considered like each other , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , with a cunning look just lurking in the corners of his eyes , ' only I was really of a serious nature , and he never was .
1	' And naturally , ' continued <NAME> , ' I who am , <NAME> PRESENT -- hem -- an unprotected female , can not afford to lose by the apartments. ' ' Of course you can ' t , ma ' am , ' replied <NAME> .
1	' I ' ll give the lady my card. ' She produced it from her pocket with an air , after struggling with the gigantic door-key which had got upon the top of it and kept it down .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , I ' m sure you know that he was always very umble , sir ! ' It was singular to see how the mother still held to the old trick , when the son had abandoned it as useless .
1	Come in , ma ' am ! ' then said Mrs. Sparsit , reversing her former word of command .
1	' And when does the ship sail , <NAME> ? ' asked my aunt .
1	So glad of the opportunity , I am sure ! ' When the first shock fell upon him , <NAME> twice skipped back in his neat little shoes and his neat little silk stockings of a bygone fashion , as if impelled to leap over a sofa behind him ; but the large man closed with him and proved too strong .
1	I have determined to remove this weight from my mind .
1	You mustn ' t show yourself to him , child .
1	' How do you find yourself arter it , my love ? ' ' <NAME> ! ' exclaimed Mrs. Weller .
1	' <NAME> , ' he resumed ; ' your dear sister , our Fanny , has contracted ha hum -- a marriage , eminently calculated to extend the basis of our -- ha -- connection , and to -- hum -- consolidate our social relations .
1	That ' s all. ' With that , and ' Good night , ' the Secretary lowers the window , and disappears .
1	I am not changed towards you . "
1	" You are a vixen , a vixen ! "
1	It must be very steadily and seriously undertaken , <NAME> Pipchin. ' ' Well , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' I can say nothing to the contrary. ' ' I was quite sure , <NAME> , ' returned Mr Dombey , approvingly , ' that a person of your good sense could not , and would not. ' ' There is a great deal of nonsense -- and worse -- talked about young people not being pressed too hard at first , and being tempted on , and all the rest of it , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , impatiently rubbing her hooked nose .
1	' I have seen enough , ' said <NAME> , as he threw himself into a chair in his little apartment .
1	" Dear mother , are you so resolved ? "
1	You won ' t be put off for another single minute , won ' t you ? ' <NAME> to immediate action by the master ' s tone and look , the old man took up his hat from the little counter where it lay .
1	In the vagueness and indistinctness of all her new experiences and perceptions , as everything about her was mysterious to herself she began to be mysterious to others : and became as difficult to be made out to anybody ' s satisfaction as she found the house and everything in it difficult to make out to her own .
1	" Glasses round ! " " This other gentleman , " observed <NAME> , by way of introducing <NAME> , " is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out .
1	There never was such a curious man .
1	It was a busy time , and I trotted about with him all day long , buying a variety of things of which he stood in need .
1	Do you wish to say anything further to him ? ' ' You knew me , a long time before I came here and was changed , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , looking at me ; and a more villainous look I never saw , even on his visage .
1	And <NAME> at the door , inquiring who is within .
1	he asks , good-humouredly making light of what he has done as she gets up and curtsys .
1	So dearly do I love the scene of my poverty and your kindness .
1	When from thy boiling store , thou shalt fill each jar brim full by-and-by , dost thou think that thou wilt always kill outright the robber Fancy lurking within—or sometimes only maim him and distort him !
1	' But the inner dressing-room was locked and the key gone. ' Her father seized a candle that was flaming on the ground -- someone had put it down there , and forgotten it -- and came running upstairs with such fury , that <NAME> , in her fear , had hardly time to fly before him .
1	I write this to repeat most earnestly for myself all that she said to you and to let you know how sure I am that you will sooner or later find our cousin <NAME> a pattern of truth , sincerity , and goodness , when you will deeply , deeply grieve to have done him ( without intending it ) so much wrong .
1	' It was very cruel , I know , ' she said , still looking out -- and said with such calm disdain , that the Major was discomfited , and could think of nothing in reply .
1	It may be that he became a little smarter in his dress after that memorable occasion ; and he certainly liked in his leisure time to walk towards that quarter of the town where Mr <NAME> ' s house was situated , on the vague chance of passing little Florence in the street .
1	At sight of the dismayed look with which <NAME> regarded his tormentors , <NAME> , who was blessed with a lively sense of the ludicrous , fell into another ectasy , more boisterous than the first .
1	He had eyes that assorted very well with that decoration , being of a surface black , with no depth in the colour or form , and much too near together -- as if they were afraid of being found out in something , singly , if they kept too far apart .
1	' You missed a friend , you know ; or you missed a foe , you know ; or you wouldn ' t have come here , you know .
1	you have brought your pigs to a very indifferent market , Arthur. ' If <NAME> had patience , <NAME> had not .
1	( I redeemed that promise afterwards , in characters larger than those in which apartments are usually announced in manuscript , as being to let . )
1	He had gone into every late or early public-house where there was a light ( they were not a few at that time , the road being then much frequented by drovers ) and had got down to talk to the turnpike-keepers .
1	He did each single thing , as if he did nothing else -- a pretty certain indication in a man of that range of ability and purpose , that he is doing something which sharpens and keeps alive his keenest powers .
1	' The chief evil of their presence in the house , ' said <NAME> , ' is that I can not be as near papa as I could wish -- <NAME> being so much between us -- and can not watch over him , if that is not too bold a thing to say , as closely as I would .
1	Let me go ! " " Ah ! " he returned , " I 'll let you go .
1	Will you come and see the gentleman , Mr .
1	<NAME> <NAME> was standing in a box by one of the coffee-room fire-places , fitted with one such table as is usually seen in coffee-rooms , and two of extraordinary shapes and dimensions made to suit the angles of the partition .
1	Mrs Wickam shaking her head , and letting fall several tears , pointed out the little group to <NAME> , and turned her eyes up to the ceiling .
1	You are a man of business , too. " " And as such , " quoth <NAME> , whom the counsel learned in the law had now shouldered back into the group , just as he had previously shouldered him out of it -- " as such I will appeal to <NAME> , to break up this conference and order us all to our homes .
1	<NAME> replies that " all them are , " and further that in all , for months and months , the people " have been down by dozens " and have been carried out dead and dying " like sheep with the rot . "
1	And so you shall , my darling -- when I tell you !
1	I was very angry with him indeed , for the first time in my life , but it only lasted a moment .
1	It is a part of <NAME> 's policy and mastery to have no political opinions ; indeed , <NAME> opinions .
1	' Oh ! ' said <NAME> , as soon as he recovered his suspended power of speech .
1	'Well , and good morning to _you_ , sir , ' replied Mrs. Mann , with many smiles ; 'and hoping you find yourself well , sir ! '
1	'There ough n't to be , if there is , ' replied <NAME> .
1	And your sister <NAME> has a fine brave spirit of another kind , a spirit of pure devotion , a beau-ti-ful spirit !
1	Surrounded by these influences , they walked on pleasantly enough .
1	When a boy , " <NAME> added with great solemnity .
1	There was not even a closet in it .
1	Much as I desired to put an end to the interview , I felt that I had no right to present myself ; that it was for <NAME> alone to see her and recover her .
1	' <NAME> , I am sure ! ' ' I understand , ' said <NAME> , ' from my son <NAME> , that he has already improved that chance occasion .
1	I ' ll tell you wot it is , sir ; them as is always a-idlin ' in public- houses it don ' t damage at all , and them as is alvays a-workin ' wen they can , it damages too much .
1	He was writing at a table , with a great confusion of clothes , tin cases , books , boots , brushes , and portmanteaus strewn all about the floor .
1	' My pa -- <NAME> -- he ' s stopping here .
1	We shall be able to set you to rights in a very short time , I have no doubt , ma ' am .
1	On the table before him , stood a pot of ale , a cold round of beef , and a very respectable-looking loaf , to each of which he distributed his favours in turn , with the most rigid impartiality .
1	Let me not be considered as wishing to detract from the merits of the former gentlemen .
1	' I excessively regret poor Gay , ' said <NAME> , ' and the crew .
1	He had been over the <NAME> in the course of the morning and whimsically described the family pictures as we walked .
1	" Now , I 'll put you in a corner , " forensically shaking a forefinger at him .
1	' Nev ' r mind , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , ' it ' ll be a wery agonisin ' trial to me at my time of life , but I ' m pretty tough , that ' s vun consolation , as the wery old turkey remarked wen the farmer said he wos afeerd he should be obliged to kill him for the <NAME> market. ' ' Wot ' ll be a trial ? ' inquired <NAME> .
1	' Not at all caring for , and indeed as it seems to me rather enjoying , ' said <NAME> , with peculiar unction , ' the precious kick-up and row that will come off between Mr Twemlow and the said great party ? ' This required no answer , and received none .
1	I wouldn ' t touch the ' lowance , not if I was dying of want , <NAME> ' l <NAME> ; but I ' ll go with you and <NAME> ' ly , if you ' ll on ' y let me , to the world ' s end !
1	' However doubtful reason I may have , <NAME> , ' said Mr Dombey , still going majestically on , as if she had not spoken , ' to hold the occasion in very pleasant remembrance just now , there are appearances in these things which must be maintained before the world .
1	I endure without murmuring , because it is appointed that I shall so make reparation for my sins .
1	If I may ! ' ' Why , it ' s but a dull life that we lead here , boy , I am afraid , ' he said .
1	' The fact is -- but I have an appointment at the <NAME> , if you ' ll have the goodness to excuse me. ' With that he rose in a great hurry , and was going out of the room , when I made bold to say that I feared , then , there was no way of arranging the matter ?
1	His desire to impart something that was on his mind , his unspeakable yearning to have speech with his friend and make a communication to him , so troubled him when he recovered consciousness , that its term was thereby shortened .
1	When we were in our own room , and when she might perhaps have told me what I was so unprepared to hear , I gave her no encouragement to confide in me ; I never thought she stood in need of it .
1	But I must impose one or two conditions on you , before you enter my house in that capacity .
1	I am going away again .
1	Being what it is , she neither knows nor cares . "
1	You have lived a gentleman ; you will die a gentleman .
1	But those were capital days , too , in <NAME> !
1	You have never entertained in secret any other proposal ? ' ' <NAME> , ' she returned , almost scornfully , ' what other proposal can have been made to _me_ ?
1	Look angry at me , <NAME> .
1	How -- ha -- how are they all , <NAME> ? ' ' Thank you , sir , They ' re all pretty well , sir .
1	And in any one of these his many cares , from first to last , <NAME> never flagged nor faltered .
1	<NAME> there no party of her own , in other times , on which the stars had shone ?
1	<NAME> <NAME> lingered , but the old gentleman drew her arm through his , and led her , with gentle force , away .
1	'You 've got the boy , and what more would you have ? -- Let him be -- let him be -- or I shall put that mark on some of you , that will bring me to the gallows before my time . '
1	To add to his defeat , <NAME> , considering any such efforts an invasion of his peculiar privilege , eyed the offender steadily , through his glass , as if astonished at his presumption , and audibly stated his impression that it was an ' infernal liberty , ' which being a hint to <NAME> , he put up HIS glass , and surveyed the object of censure as if he were some extraordinary wild animal then exhibiting for the first time .
1	' I ' d come back to see you , after I was let out. ' ' Give me the money again , ' said the other , eagerly , ' and I ' ll keep it , and never spend it .
1	It was the more questionable justice , <NAME> thought , in the <NAME> , from his having certainly overheard that great authority give his assent on the previous evening , to the proposition ( stated by <NAME> ) that poor dear little <NAME> was more old-fashioned than ever .
1	Pulling at the bell again and getting no reply , she pushed the outer door , and found it standing ajar .
1	He had neither eaten nor drunk since last night , and , in addition to the anxiety of mind he had undergone , had been travelling about , from place to place almost incessantly , for many hours .
1	In commercial phrase , coffins were looking up ; and , in the course of a few weeks , <NAME> acquired a great deal of experience .
1	God bless you ! ' and withdrew .
1	But there were worse troubles yet in store for him , and as they came on , his melancholy and sadness increased .
1	And let it be added , to <NAME> ' s honour , that , though we have called her <NAME> , he called her the <NAME> from first to last ; and that upon every anniversary of the day on which he found her in his sick room , Mr <NAME> came to dinner , and there was great glorification .
1	The family are not wealthy -- they ' re poor , indeed -- and she lives upon a small jointure ; but if you come to blood , <NAME> ! ' The <NAME> gave a flourish with his stick and walked on again , in despair of being able to say what you came to , if you came to that .
1	They ' ll be good shots one of these days .
1	' Where is my old pensioner all this while ?
1	Mr <NAME> , after writhing about , in a great many strange attitudes , and often twisting his face and eyes into an expression like that which is usually produced by eating gooseberries very early in the season , was by this time awake also .
1	You ought to know better. ' The letter was reluctantly produced ; and as I handed it to the old lady , I saw how the unwilling hand from which I took it , trembled .
1	Accepting the <NAME> as the type of self-sufficient stupidity and conceit—a custom , perhaps , like some few other customs , more conventional than fair—then the purest jackass in <NAME> is <NAME> , <NAME> .
1	She had nothing for it now , therefore , but to run after the chaise , and to call to Mr Abel to stop .
1	I could wish , however , to have seen it in a better light than it can ever be viewed in , where it stands .
1	I wish for your sake <NAME> was not a Sheep of the Prisons. " Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy , under the gaolers .
1	What , you know him , do you ? "
1	It slowly grew to that .
1	At one of the periodical meetings of the inspectors of this prison , a working man of <NAME> presented himself before the <NAME> , and earnestly requested to be placed in solitary confinement .
1	The bride ' s father , our good friend there , is a noble person , and I am proud to know him ( great uproar ) .
1	<NAME> of us two can repeat most poetry ?
1	And when I come away from him , you know that my thoughts are with him. " The dreadful condition to which he was brought , was so appalling to both of us , that we could not refer to it in plainer words .
1	I should be an inconvenience at <NAME> 's ; I was not expected , and my bed would not be ready ; I should be too far from <NAME> 's , and she was exacting and might n't like it .
1	' Thank you , it ' s of no consequence , ' retorted Mr Toots .
1	' Leave her alone , everybody ! ' cried Mrs. Sparsit , with great energy .
1	Over and above this , <NAME> was very anxious " to learn housekeeping , " as she said .
1	<NAME> was truly repentant , and would not say another syllable .
1	<NAME> could make no reply , but looked his anxiety to be gone at once .
1	If I am present at the meeting -- a mutual friend , who is old enough to be the father of both parties -- the voice of calumny can never be raised against her hereafter. ' <NAME> ' s eyes lightened with honest exultation at his own foresight , as he spoke thus .
1	It was a subject of which the affectionate creature never tired ; and our interest in hearing the many examples which she , who was so much with him , had to relate , was equal to hers in relating them .
1	I went , with my wife , at about ten .
1	' To complain of you , ' returned brother <NAME> , ' to poison our ears with calumnies and falsehoods ; but he came on a fruitless errand , and went away with some wholesome truths in his ear besides .
1	Nor hurt ? ' she asked him , anxiously .
1	But <NAME> had gone home after dressing her mistress , and the fat boy came back again more disturbed than before .
1	Kit no sooner comes in , than that single gentleman ( never was such a busy gentleman ) charges all the glasses -- bumpers -- and drinks his health , and tells him he shall never want a friend while he lives ; and so does Mr <NAME> , and so does <NAME> , and so does Mr Abel .
1	Alter this law , sir , and what will be the effect of your rash proceeding on a class of practitioners very worthily represented , allow me to say to you , by the opposite attorney in the case , <NAME> ?
1	' What ' s a man made for ? ' ' For nothing else ? ' said <NAME> .
1	I do not quite know how to write what I wish to say next , but I trust you will understand it as I mean it .
1	'Oh , you have n't , have n't you ? '
1	" Well , and how are you ? "
1	After an interval of Mrs. Kidgerbury -- the oldest inhabitant of <NAME> , I believe , who went out charing , but was too feeble to execute her conceptions of that art -- we found another treasure , who was one of the most amiable of women , but who generally made a point of falling either up or down the kitchen stairs with the tray , and almost plunged into the parlour , as into a bath , with the tea-things .
1	The morning is by this time getting on apace .
1	<NAME> , ' said <NAME> , looking round him with increased caution , and speaking in a whisper .
1	In short , she had such a natural , captivating , winning manner that in a few minutes we were sitting in the window-seat , with the light of the fire upon us , talking together as free and happy as could be .
1	I know I am a silly little thing ! ' said <NAME> , slowly looking from one of us to the other , and then putting up her pretty lips to kiss us as she lay upon her couch .
1	Why are we now in the mansions of the rich and great , my friends ?
1	She laid her hand upon her breast , murmuring the sacred name that had been read to her ; and life passed from her face , like light removed .
1	And all 's fish that comes to my net .
1	I freely admit , I am a woman of business .
1	Still , ' said <NAME> , ' I need not point out to you , <NAME> , that it is governed by the laws which govern lives in the aggregate. ' ' While it lasts , I would wish to do the little I can , and the little I am fit for .
1	It has crept , as if for shelter , into the lintels of the great door -- under it , into the corners of the windows , into every chink and crevice of retreat , and there wastes and dies .
1	" I repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred .
1	Do I understand aright ? ' <NAME> answered in a low voice : ' It is only known to us three who are here together. ' ' It is not at all known to the young lady , your friend ? ' ' On my soul , no ! ' ' I require you , then , to give me your similar and solemn pledge , <NAME> , that it shall remain the secret it is , and that you will take no other action whatsoever upon it than endeavouring ( and that most earnestly ) to erase it from your mind .
1	I never thought he 'd a done it under a gold watch , chain , and seals , at the lowest .
1	'It 's a break-up of the system altogether .
1	' Friend of yours , sir ? ' ' Not exactly a friend , ' replied <NAME> , in a low tone .
1	Go along with you ! ' But the inflexible <NAME> , merely honouring <NAME> with another look , remained .
1	He would have followed her , but <NAME> , twisting his hand in his coat collar , dragged him towards the passage by which they had entered .
1	He ' d open his eyes , that boy would , if he knew how empty of learning _my_ young maw was , at his time of life. ' Which , by the by , he probably did know , for he had heard of it often enough .
1	' I can ' t account for more than five , ' said <NAME> , with an air of perplexity .
1	She was quicker to perceive the slightest matter here , than in any other case -- but one .
1	At length he rises , throws open the door of a corner cupboard , and refers to a few uncouth chalked strokes on its inner side .
1	' The late <NAME> , gentlemen , was very fond of me , ' said <NAME> .
1	You are acquainted , perhaps , with the famous name of <NAME> ? ' ' The great Merdle ! ' exclaimed Mrs General .
1	And my eldest brother lean ' d upon his sword , Mr Boffin , And wiped away a tear. ' Much impressed by this family circumstance , and also by the friendly disposition of Mr Wegg , as exemplified in his so soon dropping into poetry , Mr Boffin again shook hands with that ligneous sharper , and besought him to name his hour .
1	' I have done no worse , I have not disgraced you .
1	My name 's <NAME> , as you are aware , and I have got a peace-warrant against <NAME> .
1	Here he by no means diminished the impression he had just produced , for he ate hard eggs , shell and all , devoured gigantic prawns with the heads and tails on , chewed tobacco and water-cresses at the same time and with extraordinary greediness , drank boiling tea without winking , bit his fork and spoon till they bent again , and in short performed so many horrifying and uncommon acts that the women were nearly frightened out of their wits , and began to doubt if he were really a human creature .
1	<NAME> anybody any idea ? ' ' Not roast man , I believe , ' replied the voice of the second gentleman of the party of three .
1	I couldn ' t very well get out of it , ' he explained , turning to the latter .
1	When she fell asleep in the little armchair by the high fender , the turnkey would cover her with his pocket-handkerchief ; and when she sat in it dressing and undressing a doll which soon came to be unlike dolls on the other side of the lock , and to bear a horrible family resemblance to Mrs Bangham -- he would contemplate her from the top of his stool with exceeding gentleness .
1	These portentous infants being alarming creatures to stalk about in any human society , the eighteen denominations incessantly scratched one another ' s faces and pulled one another ' s hair by way of agreeing on the steps to be taken for their improvement—which they never did ; a surprising circumstance , when the happy adaptation of the means to the end is considered .
1	Then , and but then , he met her glance for an instant in her first surprise ; but when he touched her , in alighting , with his soft white hand , it overlooked him altogether as before .
1	More and more agitated , <NAME> paced her room , and paced the gallery , and looked out at the moon with a new fancy of her likeness to a pale fugitive hurrying away and hiding her guilty face .
1	That 's a card not to be beaten .
1	These were among the echoes to which <NAME> , sometimes pensive , sometimes amused and laughing , listened in the echoing corner , until her little daughter was six years old .
1	' Therefore , my dear Doctor , ' said the <NAME> , giving him several affectionate taps , ' you may command me , at all times and seasons .
1	And indeed , I think we are all engaged , except the baby. " " Then you are ? " said I .
1	That 's all to be said at present .
1	<NAME> and time have taught me what to do .
1	It passed me , and went on to <NAME> .
1	Log of the <NAME> states , that a breeze springing up in the night , the wreck was seen no more .
1	There young <NAME> was , at any rate ; possessed of the gruffest of voices and the shrillest of minds ; sticking ornamental pins into his shirt , and keeping a ring in his waistcoat pocket to put on his little finger by stealth , when the pupils went out walking ; constantly falling in love by sight with nurserymaids , who had no idea of his existence ; and looking at the gas-lighted world over the little iron bars in the left-hand corner window of the front three pairs of stairs , after bed-time , like a greatly overgrown cherub who had sat up aloft much too long .
1	What ' s your motive in this ? ' ' <NAME> take the man ! ' exclaimed my aunt .
1	' I see I take you with me !
1	Likeways when I went to them two Governors , <NAME> and the t ' other Governor , with my information , I may have been a little over-eager for the cause of justice , or ( to put it another way ) a little over-stimilated by them feelings which rouses a man up , when a pot of money is going about , to get his hand into that pot of money for his family ' s sake .
1	<NAME> away. ' ' It is upon honour , sir ? ' the other still stipulated , with respectful firmness .
1	There was a third , <NAME> , who I fancied would sing it .
1	On the entrance of his friends , that gentleman laid down his knife and fork , and with a mournful air advanced to meet them .
1	<NAME> <NAME> being indeed fatigued , fell into a slumber , and waking in about half an hour , inquired what time it was .
1	After great difficulty and much puzzling , he contrived to read as follows : -- My dear young Man .
1	The old man , having obeyed his directions , sat down on the edge of a chair , and , folding his hands before him , gradually yielded to the influence of the warmth , and dozed .
1	Lieutenant <NAME> turned round to his friend <NAME> , with a scarcely perceptible shrug of the shoulder , as if implying some doubt of the accuracy of his recollection .
1	A blazing sun upon a fierce August day was no greater rarity in southern <NAME> then , than at any other time , before or since .
1	How dare you think , <NAME> , that we would have you marry for money , when youth , beauty , and every amiable virtue and excellence were to be had for love ?
1	<NAME> cleaned down with soft soap and soda .
1	She has a lover , who has followed her , first all the way from <NAME> , and then all the way from <NAME> , and who has just confided to me that he means to follow her everywhere .
1	He was seated on the ice , making spasmodic efforts to smile ; but anguish was depicted on every lineament of his countenance .
1	To think that this lost child , who was to have divided with him his riches , and his projects , and his power , and allied with whom he was to have shut out all the world as with a double door of gold , should have let in such a herd to insult him with their knowledge of his defeated hopes , and their boasts of claiming community of feeling with himself , so far removed : if not of having crept into the place wherein he would have lorded it , alone !
1	' <NAME> , help your master up to the box ; t ' other leg , <NAME> , that ' s it ; give us your hand , <NAME> .
1	' I am a lone lorn creetur ' , ' were Mrs. Gummidge ' s words , when that unpleasant occurrence took place , ' and everythink goes contrary with me. ' ' Oh , it ' ll soon leave off , ' said <NAME> -- I again mean our Peggotty -- ' and besides , you know , it ' s not more disagreeable to you than to us. ' ' I feel it more , ' said Mrs. Gummidge .
1	' <NAME> , I think , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
1	But he bought more than one. ' ' Yes , to be sure , sir ; he bought several ; and wishing to lay out his money to the best , he took my opinion to guide his choice , and we went over the collection together .
1	' As thick , ' repeated Mr Rugg , ' as we could reasonably have expected .
1	" 'At last she is dead ? '
1	But I can not bear it. ' ' It ' s my belief you hate the sight of the very river. ' ' I -- I do not like it , father. ' ' As if it wasn ' t your living !
1	' What is the matter between us ? ' said <NAME> .
1	Even money could not buy them now ; everything must come out , and everybody must know all .
1	However , it has nothing to do with the present subject , excepting that <NAME> looked so like it at the moment that it came into my head . "
1	You will be good enough to observe , <NAME> , that no message to Mrs Dombey with which you are or may be charged , admits of reply .
1	' You know me , boy ? ' ' Please , <NAME> , yes , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , tumbling with his hat , and still fixed by Mr <NAME> ' s eye , and fruitlessly endeavouring to unfix himself .
1	You will be sure to hear when the jury come in .
1	' On wi ' ' em , ' said <NAME> , forcing the wrong arm into the wrong sleeve , and winding the tails of the coat round the fugitive ' s neck .
1	' When I married , I found that my brother was even at that time heavily in debt .
1	' Halloa ! ' he cried , calling him roughly back .
1	No shame upon her brow ; no late repentance bending her disdainful neck .
1	" I do n't expect nothink at all , sir , much , but that 's the true hist'ry on it . "
1	) , it is a curious thing that she is going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the <NAME> , for whom <NAME> was exalted to that height of so many feet ; in other words , the present <NAME> .
1	But some people will die .
1	Why have they not been here ? '
1	She has been with us a long time : we don ' t forget her claims upon us , and I hope we know how to make allowances. ' ' You hope to know how to make allowances ? ' she returned , in a level , measured voice .
1	" To me , women ! " cried madame his wife .
1	He toiled out at that low door so bent and worn , and then he took his breath and stood upright , and looked all round him at the sky , and the wind blew upon him , and his life down in the dark was over ! -- Till he was called back to life , ' she added , looking round at <NAME> with that lower look of sharpness .
1	I am thrown away in society .
1	You shall see her tomorrow night .
1	I have a presentiment that he WILL mention it the first thing this morning . "
1	There was a pause , during which , <NAME> , who had covered her face with one hand , gave free vent to her tears .
1	Bother your people ! ' interposed <NAME> , with a toss of her head .
1	<NAME> after book was added to the heap of failures , <NAME> being firmly watchful of us all the time .
1	And you ain ' t gone , ain ' t you ?
1	' I remember very well , sir , ' rejoined <NAME> .
1	She was particularly delighted when <NAME> assured her that there were hospitals , and very kindly conducted hospitals , in <NAME> .
1	I ' ve brought little Wackford up , on purpose to show to parents and guardians .
1	Soon he was up again , and away , -- not far into the country , but back towards <NAME> by the high-road -- then back again -- then over another part of the same ground as he already traversed -- then wandering up and down in fields , and lying on ditches ' brinks to rest , and starting up to make for some other spot , and do the same , and ramble on again .
1	He ' s never been heerd fur to complain .
1	Regular flayers and grinders , my dear <NAME> , ' repeated <NAME> with a peculiar relish , ' and they ' ll skin you by the inch , from the nape of your neck to the sole of your foot , and grind every inch of your skin to tooth-powder .
1	" Nothing was ever discovered , <NAME> ? " " Nothing. " " Do you know what is become of <NAME> ? " " I should think from the color of his clothes that he is working in the quarries. " " Of course you have seen him then ? -- Why are you looking at that dark tree in the lane ? " " I saw him there , on the night she died. " " That was not the last time either , <NAME> ? " " <NAME> ; I have seen him there , since we have been walking here. -- It is of no use , " said <NAME> , laying her hand upon my arm , as I was for running out , " you know I would not deceive you ; he was not there a minute , and he is gone. " It revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by this fellow , and I felt inveterate against him .
1	I mourned for my child-wife , taken from her blooming world , so young .
1	<NAME> tracks were found in the garden below the window , and a pistol picked up supposed to have been overloaded , and thrown from the hand of the scoundrel who fired it .
1	Some slight symptoms of vitality having been awakened in <NAME> by the soda-water , he suffered himself to be prevailed upon to wash his face and hands , and to submit to be brushed by <NAME> .
1	Upon my word , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' I scarcely slept all last night through thinking of doing this ; and could not make up my mind when I was out , whether to do it or not ; and yet I am sure it is the true feeling of my heart , and I should have been quite miserable afterwards if I had not relieved it. ' His honest voice and manner corroborated what he said , and quite established its ingenuousness .
1	' That ' s the pint , sir , ' interposed <NAME> ; ' out vith it , as the father said to his child , when he swallowed a farden. ' ' We want to know , in the first place , ' said <NAME> , ' whether you have any reason to be discontented with your present situation. ' ' Afore I answers that ' ere question , gen ' l ' m ' n , ' replied <NAME> , ' I should like to know , in the first place , whether you ' re a-goin ' to purwide me with a better ? ' A sunbeam of placid benevolence played on <NAME> ' s features as he said , ' I have half made up my mind to engage you myself. ' ' Have you , though ? ' said <NAME> .
1	" Perhaps it is as well we _did _lose sight of him , for he has been living alone there , in the most abject misery , all the time , and he is poor -- very poor. " ' " Very good , " said the attorney .
1	It is represented that he is not in strong health , and has separated sadly from a friend who is under the displeasure of the <NAME> .
1	' By keeping silence upon the subject , my dear sir , ' returned brother Charles .
1	I ' m sure of him where he is , whenever I want him for my own purposes , and , besides , he ' s a good unconscious spy on <NAME> , and tells , in his cups , all that he sees and hears .
1	There was plenty of width for that , and room to spare ; which is perhaps the reason why <NAME> thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom .
1	But there ' s no need to talk ; tomorrow will soon be here. ' ' And wha-at ' s to be done tomorrow ? ' inquired <NAME> .
1	'Good boy , <NAME> -- well done -- ' he mumbled .
1	You are sure you understand. ' He had wormed a finger , in the darkness , through a button-hole of <NAME> ' s coat , and was screwing that corner of the garment tight up round and round , in an extraordinary manner .
1	' What say you , <NAME> ? ' <NAME> scratched his head and shook it , but said nothing at all .
1	' You could go away , and grow almost out of knowledge , and never come to tell your poor old friend how fortunate you were , proud lad !
1	what is to be done ! ' It naturally occurred to him on very little reflection , that the first step to take would be to communicate with one of the Mr Garlands instantly .
1	' Now , my life , ' said <NAME> , taking her on his knee , ' tell me all about it. ' All very well to say , ' Tell me all about it ; ' but <NAME> was very much confused .
1	" Your mind will be all the better for not running on one point too continually , and I 'll tell you for a change .
1	I wondered whether he could be a doctor ; but no , I thought ; he could n't be a doctor , or he would have a quieter and more persuasive manner .
1	He had scarcely moved since the trial began ; and now that the judge ceased to speak , he still remained in the same strained attitude of close attention , with his gaze bent on him , as though he listened still .
1	' The fence between this wharf and the next is easily climbed , ' said the dwarf , when he had taken these precautions .
1	Sit down , you dancing , prancing , shambling , scrambling poll-parrot !
1	' Old lady , ' said Mr Boffin , ' stop that noise !
1	' I ' ve found ' em out , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
1	' I was acquainted with all this , you know , ' said <NAME> , ' except the last clause , long ago .
1	It was profoundly dark ; perplexed , with great beams , crossing and recrossing it at every possible angle ; and through the broad chinks and crevices in the floor , the rapid river gleamed , far down below , like a legion of eyes .
1	But , it would have been a stranger contrast still , to have read the hearts that were beating side by side ; to have laid bare the gentle innocence of the one , and the rugged villainy of the other ; to have hung upon the guileless thoughts of the affectionate girl , and been amazed that , among all the wily plots and calculations of the old man , there should not be one word or figure denoting thought of death or of the grave .
1	This is a great advancement for her in life , Mr Rokesmith .
1	We must have <NAME> here .
1	I ought to have thought of it before. ' Immediately flying to the bell , and calling for mulled wine as impetuously as if it had been wanted for instant use in the recovery of some person apparently drowned , the single gentleman made <NAME> ' s mother swallow a bumper of it at such a high temperature that the tears ran down her face , and then hustled her off to the chaise again , where -- not impossibly from the effects of this agreeable sedative -- she soon became insensible to his restlessness , and fell fast asleep .
1	All his proceedings were the result of the nicest and coldest calculation ; and it was not without cause that Mrs. Sparsit habitually observed of him , that he was a young man of the steadiest principle she had ever known .
1	At length there was a cry of silence , and a breathless look from all towards the door .
1	Yet <NAME> was in one of his sanguine states and in good spirits and was thoroughly pleased to see <NAME> again , whom he had always liked .
1	So he said , ' Florence , you may go and look at your pretty brother , if you like , I daresay .
1	said <NAME> , reflectively , 'if I 'd only got that young boy of <NAME> , the chimbley-sweeper 's !
1	Unfortunately , the property of <NAME> was settled upon herself .
1	Sometimes , when much excited with his subject , he had an odd way—compounded of <NAME> , and <NAME> of Burley—of taking his great quarto Bible under his arm and pacing up and down the pulpit with it ; looking steadily down , meantime , into the midst of the congregation .
1	As he stands at his door in <NAME> 's Court in his grey shop-coat and black calico sleeves , looking up at the clouds , or stands behind a desk in his dark shop with a heavy flat ruler , snipping and slicing at sheepskin in company with his two 'prentices , he is emphatically a retiring and unassuming man .
1	Can you spare me a very few minutes ? ' ' Surely , surely , ' returned brother <NAME> , looking at him with an anxious countenance .
1	' It ' s like you did , <NAME> ' r <NAME> .
1	These , it seemed , were calculations of compound interest on what he called ' the principal amount of forty-one , ten , eleven and a half ' , for various periods .
1	' So my friend being invited down to this marriage in <NAME> , ' with a pleasant sense of the readiness of this joke , ' goes .
1	Of the air with which old <NAME> , with his hat under his left arm ( the inside presented at the clergyman like a cannon ) and his eyes creasing themselves up into his wig , stood stiff and high-shouldered behind us bridesmaids during the ceremony , and afterwards saluted us , I could never say enough to do it justice .
1	I think <NAME> ' s means were straitened at about this time ; but it is little to the purpose .
1	<NAME> <NAME> would often ask me in a whisper , or when we were alone , " Does she grow prettier and prettier , <NAME> ? " And when I said yes ( for indeed she did ) , would seem to enjoy it greedily .
1	' It is not worth my while , ' pursues <NAME> , becoming handsomely mollified , ' and it is the reverse of important to my position .
1	They know what a clever lad he is ; he 'll be a lifer .
1	This passenger is reported to have lost fourteen pounds at Vingt-et-un in the saloon yesterday ; and that passenger drinks his bottle of champagne every day , and how he does it ( being only a clerk ) , nobody knows .
1	Where have you hidden her ? ' Showing that he was taken by surprise , the old man looked at his master with some passing confusion , which the master highly enjoyed .
1	When I tried to conquer my misplaced love , and to be generous to the man who was more fortunate than I , though he should never know it or repay me with a gracious word , in whom had I watched patience , self-denial , self-subdual , charitable construction , the noblest generosity of the affections ?
1	His look was thoughtful , but had a benignant expression in it which I often ( how often ! )
1	My dear Trot ! ' cried my aunt , in a terrified whisper , and pressing my arm .
1	You call her Little Dorrit ? ' No road in that direction .
1	<NAME> number three , wrote leaden little books for them , showing how the good grown-up baby invariably got to the Savings-bank , and the bad grown-up baby invariably got transported .
1	At least , <NAME> asked me if I did not , and I said yes .
1	The dark windows over yonder. ' ' I may go to <NAME> to-morrow ? ' asked <NAME> .
1	repeated the young lady , with great stress upon the word .
1	Next , you really have done wonders for me , <NAME> , in easing my money-perplexities , and with such a guardian and steward beside me , as the preserver of my life ( I am hardly strong yet , you see , for I am not man enough to refer to her without a trembling voice -- she is so inexpressibly dear to me , Mortimer !
1	For dinner we ' ll have a tureen of the hottest and strongest soup available , and we ' ll have the best made-dish that can be recommended , and we ' ll have a joint ( such as a haunch of mutton ) , and we ' ll have a goose , or a turkey , or any little stuffed thing of that sort that may happen to be in the bill of fare—in short , we ' ll have whatever there is on hand. ' These liberal directions <NAME> issued with his usual air of reading an inventory , or repeating a lesson , or doing anything else by rote .
1	Then the child ' s head disappeared , and the prison-keeper ' s head disappeared , but the little voice prolonged the strain until the door clashed .
1	' <NAME> , ' said that eccentric functionary , ' furniter ' s cheap where you come from , <NAME> .
1	<NAME> , for <NAME> ' s sake , explain it ! ' <NAME> , who had only waited for a hearing , at once recounted how he had been placed in his then distressing predicament ; how the fear of giving rise to domestic dissensions had alone prompted him to avoid <NAME> on his entrance ; how he merely meant to depart by another door , but , finding it locked , had been compelled to stay against his will .
1	<NAME> , make room for one of these gentlemen on the box .
1	When he had been gone about a minute , the door reopened , and his hat and his head reappeared .
1	' Who do you suppose will ever employ a professional man , when they see his boy playing at marbles in the gutter , or flying the garter in the horse-road ?
1	' Not his merit that he don ' t cheat me , ' was Mr Fledgeby ' s commentary delivered with a wink , ' but my precaution. ' He then with a lazy grandeur asserted his rights as lord of <NAME> and Co. by poking his cane at the stools and boxes , and spitting in the fireplace , and so loitered royally to the window and looked out into the narrow street , with his small eyes just peering over the top of <NAME> and Co. ' s blind .
1	Why are you not in your usual spirits , <NAME> ? ' <NAME> faltered that she was much the same as she was in general ; she was not aware of being different .
1	' I am not too proud to believe it , <NAME> .
1	<NAME> no more about the lists ?
1	The father had long ago taken up his bundle and bidden himself away with it , when the women who had tended the bundle while it lay on the base of the fountain , sat there watching the running of the water and the rolling of the <NAME> -- when the one woman who had stood conspicuous , knitting , still knitted on with the steadfastness of <NAME> .
1	<NAME> , whom I had seen at <NAME> 's on the same occasion , also turned up .
1	Holly , mistletoe , red berries , ivy , turkeys , geese , game , poultry , brawn , meat , pigs , sausages , oysters , pies , puddings , fruit , and punch , all vanished instantly .
1	How long have they taken these lodgings for ? ' ' Only from week to week , ' replied <NAME> .
1	" Why , I hear of her , <NAME> , " replied <NAME> , " through <NAME> , but I see very little of her .
1	Overpowered with watching and exertion , I had closed my eyes for a few minutes , when I felt a violent clutch on my shoulder .
1	I have been very unhappy since she died .
1	' Now then ! ' cried <NAME> , poking his head out at the front-door .
1	What has been my history , that I should be at the pains of entreating either them or you not to have it so !
1	" You ! " He appeared disposed to add more , but indignation choked his utterance , so he lifted up one of his very pliable legs , and , flourishing it above his head a little , to insure his aim , administered a good sound kick to <NAME> ; immediately after which , all the goblins in waiting crowded round the wretched sexton , and kicked him without mercy , according to the established and invariable custom of courtiers upon earth , who kick whom royalty kicks , and hug whom royalty hugs .
1	' Here is a gentleman in <NAME> ' s apartment , whom he wishes to have the pleasure of presenting to you , my love ! ' <NAME> immediately reappeared , and shook hands with me again .
1	You are a young gentleman to be smiled on , <NAME> , and you must learn your walue , sir. ' Mrs. Crupp always called me <NAME> : firstly , no doubt , because it was not my name ; and secondly , I am inclined to think , in some indistinct association with a washing-day .
1	' My brother and I are just the same .
1	You know that at length I gave it up , and declined to guess any more .
1	" I can not think , " said <NAME> , raising her eyes after a silence " why you should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after a separation .
1	' This is what your loving <NAME> calls the best time in the day and night , ' said the person of the house .
1	I then caused him to make the letters _bread_ , and in an instant <NAME> went and brought him a piece : he smelled at it ; put it to his lips ; cocked up his head with a most knowing look ; seemed to reflect a moment ; and then laughed outright , as much as to say , " Aha !
1	' You will restrain any demonstrative championship or vengeance in this place , of course , <NAME> ? ' said she , looking over her shoulder at me with the same expression .
1	Out with it. ' ' How ' tis , ma ' am , ' resumed <NAME> , appearing still to find his natural refuge in <NAME> ' s face , ' that what is best in us fok , seems to turn us most to trouble an ' misfort ' n an ' mistake , I dunno .
1	Excuse me , but you do seem a little tired , and unless you ' re very anxious to get on -- ' ' Yes , yes , we are , ' returned the old man fretfully .
1	From the moment of that interchange of looks , they never uttered his name , or any reference to him , aloud ; nor ever pursued the subject of the robbery , when <NAME> spoke of it .
1	So it is with the one great cardinal virtue , which , properly nourished and exercised , leads to , if it does not necessarily include , all the others .
1	' Do you mean to go and seek your fortune ? ' ' I expect I shall be forced to go to <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , ' and live there. ' ' You might have gone farther off , ' I said , brightening a little , ' and been as bad as lost .
1	When the last ' natural ' had been declared , and the profit and loss account of fish and sixpences adjusted , to the satisfaction of all parties , <NAME> rang for supper , and the visitors squeezed themselves into corners while it was getting ready .
1	' We should all have been lost without <NAME> .
1	That ' s what you ' ll have to break to her .
1	It was the poor schoolmaster .
1	Let it stand for this day week , and you shall receive my printed address in the meantime .
1	" I think you had better call me guardian , my dear . "
1	The local influence of my family was quite unavailing to obtain any employment in that department , for a man of <NAME> ' s abilities .
1	Nothing but flight can save us .
1	I was to stay in the house , and was to be married from the house .
1	' That stone has worn away and been replaced by others , and many generations have come and gone since then .
1	It is natural , under these circumstances , that he , in his turn , should remember the friend to whom he is indebted for so promising an acquaintance .
1	And notwithstanding various blandishments on the part of <NAME> , <NAME> still said no , and said it too with such determined and resolute ill-temper , that <NAME> was clearly taken aback .
1	The bottle-green suit had been brushed , ready for the morrow .
1	Who set this chap on , in this dress , when the carting began ?
1	Your mind will be more at peace , lying here , if you make Lizzie your wife .
1	This was his unvarying reply .
1	' But come , ' said <NAME> , as if suddenly recollecting himself ; ' we must not forget our mission in the pleasure of this interview .
1	When he was freshest and truest , he loved me .
1	There was a very dirty lady in his little room , and two wan girls , his daughters , with shock heads of hair .
1	From hour to hour I reproach myself for that excess of faith and trustfulness which has led to such distressing consequences ; and almost from minute to minute , I hope that Mr Dombey may explain himself , and relieve the torture I undergo , which is extremely wearing .
1	That he had the bottle somewhere about him could not be doubted ; where , was not so clear .
1	Bail you to any amount , and only charge half a crown .
1	It brushes the <NAME> cobwebs away , and pleases the <NAME> .
1	So the day came , as all other days come to people who will only stick to reason ; and when it came , there were married in the church of the florid wooden legs—that popular order of architecture—Josiah <NAME> of <NAME> , to <NAME> eldest daughter of <NAME> of <NAME> , M.P .
1	' Perhaps , ' he returned , ' I have said enough .
1	' How can I care a pinch of snuff for <NAME> , when I think of that ' ere darling child ?
1	" Either this boy sticks to it like cobbler's-wax or there is something out of the common here that beats anything that ever came into my way at <NAME> and <NAME> 's . "
1	He pulled it off and showed 'em me .
1	<NAME> grass and rank weeds straggled over all the marshy land in the vicinity .
1	I am well , and your father has influence around me .
1	But he suffered Mr Casby to go out , without offering any further remark , and then took a peep at him over the little green window-blinds .
1	'In that way of business , ' rejoined <NAME> ; 'and so are the people of the house .
1	Has a scar on his right hand ; his thumb and forefinger being injured by being shot last fall .
1	I can stand any fire better than a fire of cross questions .
1	' You addressed the daughter , I observed , ' said Mr Dombey , after a short pause , ' as <NAME> Granger. ' ' Edith <NAME> , <NAME> , ' returned the Major , stopping short again , and punching a mark in the ground with his cane , to represent her , ' married ( at eighteen ) Granger of <NAME> ; ' whom the Major indicated by another punch .
1	' But WERE you ever married , <NAME> ? ' says I .
1	They told her I was gone to seek her , and what my parting words was. ' ' Is that another letter in your hand ? ' said I .
1	' But I am made , ' said <NAME> to Mr Chick , ' of no more account than <NAME> !
1	Advancing to the door of the mysterious apartment , they were not a little surprised to hear a human voice , chanting with a highly elaborated expression of melancholy , and in tones of suffocation which a human voice might have produced from under five or six feather-beds of the best quality , the once popular air of ' Has she then failed in her truth , the beautiful maid I adore ? ' Nor , on bursting into the room without demanding a parley , was their astonishment lessened by the discovery that these romantic sounds certainly proceeded from the throat of some man up the chimney , of whom nothing was visible but a pair of legs , which were dangling above the grate ; apparently feeling , with extreme anxiety , for the top bar whereon to effect a landing .
1	This was all so pleasant that I hope it made me still more like the mountain than I had been before .
1	Considering myself sufficiently incongruous on my legal eminence , I have until now suppressed my domestic destiny .
1	Confining yourself rigidly to <NAME> , the question of Fact you state to yourself is : Does <NAME> ask me to marry him ?
1	The ole garden is open to you , and your airy pinions carry you through it .
1	' Yes , my lady lass , ' returned the <NAME> .
1	The old Instrument-maker , seated in a corner between <NAME> and <NAME> , and nodding at <NAME> , who was looking on , all smiles and delight , answered the Captain thus : ' <NAME> , my dear boy , although I have heard something of the changes of events here , from my pleasant friend there -- what a pleasant face she has to be sure , to welcome a wanderer home ! ' said the old man , breaking off , and rubbing his hands in his old dreamy way .
1	The chance to hush it is to let in these people now in a wrangle with your footmen .
1	I ha ' read i ' th ' papers that great folk ( fair faw ' em a ' !
1	<NAME> engaged beds for himself and <NAME> at the inn where the coach stopped , and repaired , without the delay of another moment , to the lodgings of <NAME> ; for his anxiety and impatience had increased with every succeeding minute , and were almost beyond control .
1	the time had come when my first parting words to you were true -- when she was glad to lay her poor head on her stupid cross old <NAME> ' s arm -- and she died like a child that had gone to sleep ! ' Thus ended <NAME> ' s narration .
1	" Is this your young attendant ? "
1	As we were thus conversing in a low tone while <NAME> 's sustained growl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling , the room door opened , and a very pretty , slight , dark-eyed girl of twenty or so came in with a basket in her hand : whom <NAME> tenderly relieved of the basket , and presented , blushing , as " Clara. " She really was a most charming girl , and might have passed for a captive fairy , whom that truculent <NAME> , <NAME> , had pressed into his service .
1	Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were mingled with them also , and both were audible to <NAME> , in a hushed murmur -- like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore -- as the little Lucie , comically studious at the task of the morning , or dressing a doll at her mother 's footstool , chattered in the tongues of the Two Cities that were blended in her life .
1	Exactly , ' said the old man .
1	Upon the whole , the sweet greatly preponderated over the bitter , so Miss Squeers said she would get the frock made , and that she hoped ' Tilda might be happy , though at the same time she didn ' t know , and would not have her build too much upon it , for men were strange creatures , and a great many married women were very miserable , and wished themselves single again with all their hearts ; to which condolences <NAME> added others equally calculated to raise her friend ' s spirits and promote her cheerfulness of mind .
1	He rode like a highwayman .
1	He threw himself back in his easy-chair , wrapped in contemplations of his future greatness .
1	<NAME> is the thief of time .
1	' Ay , ' said the <NAME> , reverentially ; ' it ' s a almighty element .
1	I know that from the beds of those who were past recovery , thanks have often , often gone up , in the last hour , for his patient ministration .
1	' Be careful how you go , my dear friend .
1	<NAME> <NAME> never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again .
1	I observe it , because I can ' t help observing it , being accustomed to take a powerful sight of notice ; but I don ' t object .
1	I am not about to be hipped again , <NAME> ; but I tell you , my good fellow , once more , that it would have been well for me ( and for more than me ) if I had had a steadfast and judicious father ! ' His face was always full of expression , but I never saw it express such a dark kind of earnestness as when he said these words , with his glance bent on the fire .
1	" My dearest <NAME> , " asked <NAME> , " why not ? "
1	' <NAME> mind. ' ' But I DO mind , ' said the <NAME> , laying her fan upon his lips .
1	' <NAME> ' t talk to me , you aggravating thing , don ' t ! ' said Mrs. Nupkins .
1	Mrs. Chadband is a stern , severe-looking , silent woman .
1	<NAME> <NAME> faltered out a reply in the affirmative ; and both gentlemen were forthwith invested with a slip of paper , and a shilling each , by the dexterous <NAME> .
1	He made his face shine with the punch , so that it looked as if it had been varnished all over .
1	Mr Feeder then gave him to understand that he would be expected to inform <NAME> and <NAME> , in superfine small-hand , that Mr P. Dombey would be happy to have the honour of waiting on them , in accordance with their polite invitation .
1	'Very good , ' said that gentleman , sipping his peppermint ; ' I 'll call at <NAME> 's as I go home , and tell him to send to-morrow morning .
1	He had heard from <NAME> ' s own lips when he stood tapping at the door on that night of his taking the lodgings , that the marriage would have been on her part thoroughly mercenary .
1	Evening had come on when I lifted up my eyes and saw my guardian standing in the little hall .
1	Through all his stages , <NAME> followed him with the same strange interest .
1	After <NAME> had got into bed , he lay awake for a long time , still bemoaning his analysis , and saying he knew it was all wrong , and they couldn ' t have analysed a murderer worse , and -- how would Doctor Blimber like it if his pocket-money depended on it ?
1	Now , this is a pretty sort of thing , isn ' t it , that you should have been left here , all these years , and no money paid after the first six -- nor no notice taken , nor no clue to be got who you belong to ?
1	<NAME> ' t I , <NAME> , my dear ?
1	The daily visits I could make him were shortened now , and he was more strictly kept .
1	' I don ' t rightly know which is your brother , miss , ' replied <NAME> .
1	No more than that was ever said against her , <NAME> ? ' ' <NAME> , father , ' said Mrs. Joram .
1	I could have wished my noble friend had been alive to have seen my management of this case .
1	<NAME> gives a howl at the recollection .
1	I ' ll not ask you , with your remembrance of my house and all belonging to it , whether you believe it .
1	' I fear -- I hope it is not against the rules -- that she will bring the children. ' ' The children ? ' said the turnkey .
1	But being bitten beyond his power of endurance , he turned out again , and fled for shelter to the coach , which was airing itself in front of the house .
1	Starting on equal terms , I want to put before you how you have shown your gratitude to me , for doing all I could to further your wishes with reference to my sister .
1	' No -- not much o ' that either ; you ' ve lost ten minutes here , and gone away as wise as you came , arter all .
1	<NAME> <NAME> kept the brown pocket-handkerchief before his eyes for some minutes , moaning decently meanwhile , and then , mastering his feelings by a strong effort , put it in his pocket and buttoned it up .
1	Go on with your report. ' ' Am I pardoned ? ' he asked , with an air of half abashed gallantry .
1	But , in the composure of his manner he was unaltered , except that to the shrewd glance of <NAME> it disclosed some shadowy indication that the old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him , like a cold wind .
1	Mr Sloppy having shaken his head to a considerable extent , proceeded to remark that he thought <NAME> ' must have took ' em from the Minders. ' Being asked what he meant , he answered , them that come out upon him and partickler his chest .
1	<NAME> , a disappointed suitor , has been here to-day and has been alarming .
1	I have sometimes sat alone here of an evening , listening , until I have made the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by-and-bye into our lives. " " There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives , if that be so , " Sydney <NAME> struck in , in his moody way .
1	But that had nothing to do with it .
1	' Then they are not the Misers I mean .
1	Then he fell to dumbly playing , without striking the notes , while his little pupil was taken to an open window for air , and was otherwise petted and restored .
1	I would not shame you by seeming to take them to heart , or treat them earnestly for an instant .
1	' No. ' ' Charming woman , <NAME> , ' said the Major , with a fat laugh rising in his short throat , and nearly suffocating him .
1	If she likes to make any little arrangement , afterwards , in the way of doing any little thing for us at home , very well .
1	Meanwhile Mrs. Cluppins , with the combined assistance of Mrs. <NAME> , Mrs. Sanders , <NAME> , and <NAME> , was hoisted into the witness- box ; and when she was safely perched on the top step , Mrs. <NAME> stood on the bottom one , with the pocket-handkerchief and pattens in one hand , and a glass bottle that might hold about a quarter of a pint of smelling-salts in the other , ready for any emergency .
1	A long room with three long rows of desks , and six of forms , and bristling all round with pegs for hats and slates .
1	' I ' m sure to bring him through it , ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> at her now , my <NAME> , how she turns upon her poor old mother with her looks. ' As <NAME> drew her purse out with a trembling hand , and eagerly fumbled for some money , which the other old woman greedily watched for -- their heads all but touching , in their hurry and decrepitude -- <NAME> interposed : ' I have seen you , ' addressing the old woman , ' before. ' ' Yes , my <NAME> , ' with a curtsey .
1	The call being repeated , <NAME> looked out again , so cautiously that no part of the old man ' s body was visible .
1	It is a hundred to one if I should avail myself of it four times in a year .
1	At length , it was suggested that the letters were not initials , but the complete word , <NAME> .
1	She eyed him narrowly , while he spoke ; and cast upon him a look of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she guessed what had been passing in his thoughts .
1	said I , beginning to let down my hair .
1	But it is full of indignation to-night after undergoing the ordeal of consigning to the tomb the remains of a faithful , a zealous , a devoted adherent . "
1	Where I live , I mean. ' ' Indeed ! ' returned <NAME> quickly .
1	There was one dim unformed fear lingering about his sister ' s mind , to which she never gave utterance , which surrounded the graceless and ungrateful boy with a dreadful mystery .
1	' The Helter-Skelter Plate at the races , child -- the plate that was run for on the second day. ' ' On the second day , ma ' am ? ' ' Second day !
1	Let it be a secret between you and me ; and mind you tell me everything !
1	The morning of day and the morning of life are but too much alike. ' ' You speak truly , sir , ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> had kept his chair all night .
1	You know Snagsby the stationer ? "
1	And it was a comfort to me , and an impulse to me , and I felt a dignity rise up within me that was derived from him when I thought so .
1	' Yes , he is , <NAME> , ' replied the landlady .
1	But her affectionate nature was so happy in what I now said to her with my whole heart , that her face became a laughing one before her glittering eyes were dry .
1	He sat looking at the horse ' s ears , as if he saw something new there ; and sat so , for a considerable time .
1	'_I_ did that , sir , ' said a great lubberly fellow , stepping forward ; 'and preciously I cut my knuckle agin ' his mouth .
1	Now , what do you say -- eh ! -- now -- come -- what do you say to that -- an ' t you sorry you took so much trouble for nothing ?
1	And how am I to set about it ?
1	But there ' s no harm in my trying. ' His breath fell like a flame of fire on <NAME> ' s ear , it was so hot .
1	When I had money enough , I used to get half-a-pint of ready-made coffee and a slice of bread and butter .
1	Her brother and sister is high in their views , and against Our <NAME> .
1	There is something melancholy in it , and I don ' t know why .
1	' No , sir , ' said Mr Venus , winking his weak eyes and shaking his head .
1	Even when it had grown dusk , and the shadows of coming night made it more solemn still , the child remained , like one rooted to the spot , and had no fear or thought of stirring .
1	There you sit , a man as has had his head broke from infancy up ' ards , and has got a new opinion into it at every seam as has been opened .
1	' <NAME> us all aboot it , mun ; coom , quick ! ' Although he could not keep pace with <NAME> ' s impatience , Mr Squeers related the lucky chance by which <NAME> had fallen into his hands , as quickly as he could , and , except when he was interrupted by the admiring remarks of his auditors , paused not in the recital until he had brought it to an end .
1	" Not even any one who had attended on him ? "
1	Dear Mr Clennam , I write to you from my own room at <NAME> , thinking you will be glad to hear from me .
1	For a man so expert in most things of that kind , <NAME> takes time to open the door and makes some noise too .
1	" <NAME> , " he said , " it may be so ; and I freely admit that the young lady who has taken <NAME> 's name upon herself in so ill-advised a manner -- you will I am sure not quarrel with me for throwing out that remark again , as a duty I owe to <NAME> 's connexions -- is a highly genteel young lady .
1	' It was as true , ' said <NAME> , ' as turnips is .
1	' Have some legal help. ' ' Perhaps I had better. ' ' Have Rugg. ' ' There is not much to do .
1	And yet I should have dearly liked , I own , to have touched her lips ; to have questioned her , that she might have opened them ; to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes , and never raised a blush ; to have let loose waves of hair , an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price : in short , I should have liked , I do confess , to have had the lightest licence of a child , and yet to have been man enough to know its value .
1	Similarly , he dealt us clean plates and knives and forks , for each course , and dropped those just disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair .
1	Because , why should I do anything else ?
1	I rather thought that everyone was struck by his not being proud , and taking notice of us .
1	' Do you remember , <NAME> , on the day we were married , <NAME> ' s speaking of the ships that might be sailing towards us from the unknown seas ? ' ' Perfectly , my darling ! ' ' I think ... among them ... there is a ship upon the ocean ... bringing ... to you and me ... a little baby , <NAME> ' The <NAME> had stopped work for the night , and the paths and roads in its neighbourhood were sprinkled with clusters of people going home from their day ' s labour in it .
1	The place through which he made his way at leisure was one of those receptacles for old and curious things which seem to crouch in odd corners of this town and to hide their musty treasures from the public eye in jealousy and distrust .
1	Men talk of <NAME> as an abstract thing , and lose sight of what is natural while they do so .
1	<NAME> made his best bow , and stepped into the presence of a lady and gentleman seated at breakfast .
1	He told me once there should be a day of reckoning between us , sooner or later .
1	' I don ' t know why we unfortunate creatures should be supposed to want common sense , but it is generally taken for granted that we do .
1	' Have you the face to utter the word to me ? ' ' The face , too ! ' replied <NAME> , staring at him with cold scorn .
1	My whispered words to Mrs. Bucket when she had the sheet in her mouth were , 'My dear , can you throw her off continually with natural accounts of my suspicions against <NAME> , and this , and that , and t'other ?
1	' And have a highly respectable reference for everything , have you ? ' <NAME> replied that she had , and laid her uncle ' s card upon the table .
1	I have had a pattern in my hand. " He glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride .
1	This was indeed the case ; but as it was not <NAME> 's habit to repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody , it should be observed , in justice to that gentleman , that he had trusted <NAME> to this extent , in order that , if they were pursued , the money might be found on her : which would leave him an opportunity of asserting his innocence of any theft , and would greatly facilitate his chances of escape .
1	' Let me see to your hurts first. ' ' I have no hurts to see to , beyond a little soreness and stiffness that will soon pass off , ' said <NAME> , seating himself with some difficulty .
1	" Have you no wish in reference to your case ? "
1	He shall not do it again , if I can help it ; I ' ll expose him !
1	It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too , and even at the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind between it and the better rooms to which I was going , as I had been in so often between the forge and <NAME> 's , and <NAME> and <NAME> .
1	' <NAME> must have gone down to the <NAME> , sir .
1	But it ' s a dear good world , and I love it ! ' ' It lies fair before you now , ' said <NAME> .
1	We must guard ourselves from recognizing any positive engagement between <NAME> and our niece , until we have had an opportunity -- ' ' Until YOU have had an opportunity , sister <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
1	Anything else we can do for him , besides giving her up ?
1	Still I think it charming .
1	How dare you to insinuate that you don ' t know my character better than your words imply ? ' ' I am sure , ' my poor mother went on , at a grievous disadvantage , and with many tears , ' I don ' t want anybody to go .
1	The old gentleman is newly shaken up by <NAME> to bear his part in the conversation .
1	'Why , I suppose if I was n't , I should n't be here , ' replied <NAME> .
1	The two travelled all night , except when they were left , for odd numbers of minutes , at branch-places , up illimitable flights of steps , or down wells—which was the only variety of those branches—and , early in the morning , were turned out on a swamp , a mile or two from the town they sought .
1	What else could you have made this young lady out to be , if she had listened to such addresses as yours ? ' ' What else , if I had been so happy as to win her affections and possess her heart ? ' ' Win her affections , ' retorted Mr Boffin , with ineffable contempt , ' and possess her heart !
1	<NAME> ill , sir ? ' Mr <NAME> had staggered up , with his lower jaw dropped , catching <NAME> by the shoulder , and pointing to the half-door .
1	No personality is intended towards the name you will so soon change , when I remark that while the general growth of people seem to have come into existence , buds , I seem to have come into existence a chip .
1	'Not for the world , ' replied <NAME> .
1	" <NAME> and <NAME> , " cried one of the nurses to two of the children , " if you go a bouncing up against them bushes you 'll fall over into the river and be drownded , and what 'll your pa say then ? " At the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. <NAME> 's handkerchief , and said , " If that do n't make six times you 've dropped it , <NAME> ! " Upon which Mrs. <NAME> laughed and said , " Thank you , <NAME> , " and settling herself in one chair only , resumed her book .
1	' What do you think of the other ? ' said I .
1	Thus speaking , he leaned over , as if to replace her in her chair ; but the young lady , making a violent effort to disengage herself , he lost his balance , and measured his length upon the ground .
1	The landlord slightly inclined his head .
1	This one was a sailor , with two anchors and a flag and G. F. T. on his arm .
1	" Not quite so far , I hope ? "
1	" I come from arriving at this so detestable house with your wife .
1	There was an open carriage-and-four , for the <NAME> ; and there were four carriage-and-pair , for his friends and supporters ; and the flags were rustling , and the band was playing , and the constables were swearing , and the twenty committee-men were squabbling , and the mob were shouting , and the horses were backing , and the post- boys perspiring ; and everybody , and everything , then and there assembled , was for the special use , behoof , honour , and renown , of the <NAME> , of <NAME> , one of the candidates for the representation of the borough of <NAME> , in the <NAME> of <NAME> of the <NAME> .
1	If you should happen , by any unlikely chance , to know a man more blest in a laugh than <NAME> 's nephew , all I can say is , I should like to know him too .
1	She partly drew aside the curtain of the long , low garret window and called our attention to a number of bird-cages hanging there , some containing several birds .
1	<NAME> languished in <NAME> ' s <NAME> for six months , and at the expiration of that term sauntered back one evening with his hands in his pockets , and incidentally observed to his sister that he was not going back again .
1	To this retreat Mr <NAME> repaired regularly every Sunday to spend the day -- usually beginning with breakfast -- and here he was the great purveyor of general news and fashionable intelligence .
1	Still , I can not help doubting whether <NAME> , in her desire to shake off the absurdities and abuses of the old system , may not have gone too far into the opposite extreme ; and whether it is not desirable , especially in the small community of a city like this , where each man knows the other , to surround the administration of justice with some artificial barriers against the ' Hail fellow , well met ' deportment of everyday life .
1	The daughters , who appeared to be very fond of him , were amused by this droll fact , particularly the <NAME> daughter .
1	Here were she , <NAME> , and her husband discoursing at once affectingly and effectively , but discoursing alone .
1	' You are so changed , ' said <NAME> -- ' I changed ! ' she interrupted .
1	' When a boy gets weak and ill and don ' t relish his meals , we give him a change of diet -- turn him out , for an hour or so every day , into a neighbour ' s turnip field , or sometimes , if it ' s a delicate case , a turnip field and a piece of carrots alternately , and let him eat as many as he likes .
1	' He is not hurt in the least. ' ' Don ' t let him come any nearer , ' said <NAME> , retiring as far as she could .
1	' We must get more , ' said the old man , ' we must earn it , <NAME> , hoard it up , scrape it together , come by it somehow .
1	What I was thinking of was this .
1	I rose and joined <NAME> , who was by this time putting on her bonnet .
1	' I know another case , ' said the little old man , when his chuckles had in some degree subsided .
1	But , there my Lord interposed ( with as grave a face as if it had not been true ) , saying that he could not sit upon that <NAME> and suffer those allusions .
1	' Not at all , sir , ' replied <NAME> ; ' it was my fault .
1	We meet with it in a chin , and we say , " There it is !
1	On examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts , but that they of themselves were far from hopeless ; the danger lay mainly in the nervous shock .
1	repeats <NAME> , in his desperation clutching at the clump of hair at the back of his bald head .
1	<NAME> went through it all in his patient manner , and admired it all exceedingly .
1	' But there ' s some of his old friends not so patient as me .
1	'And if it is not ? '
1	<NAME> cats scamper across the road .
1	" Yes. " " You know he is <NAME> 's man of business and solicitor , and has her confidence when nobody else has ? " This was bringing me ( I felt ) towards dangerous ground .
1	Having been hard at work in one dull enclosure all his life , he had a child ' s delight in looking at shops .
1	'Why , soldiers , why -- should we be melancholy , boys ? '
1	To this mind of the heart , if I may call it so , in <NAME> , some bright ray of the truth shot straight .
1	The child had sat at his parents ' feet for hours together , with his little hands patiently folded in each other , and his thin wan face raised towards them .
1	He left the messengers at the gate , and saw them admitted by the porter .
1	Mr Dombey , <NAME> Skewton. ' The lady in the chair was gracious .
1	But I held her tight all the while , and could have wept over her I do n't know how long .
1	' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
1	That fountain suggested the <NAME> fountain , the little bundle lying on the step , the women bending over it , and the tall man with his arms up , crying , " Dead ! " " I am cool now , " said <NAME> the <NAME> , " and may go to bed. " So , leaving only one light burning on the large hearth , he let his thin gauze curtains fall around him , and heard the night break its silence with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep .
1	To Lizzie it was so new , so pretty , at once so womanly and so childish , that it won her completely .
1	I had never thought it possible that we three could be together undisturbed , once more ; and I felt , for the time , as if the old days were come back .
1	When I cries out that night , " I know you now !
1	Some straggling carts and coaches rumbling by , first broke the charm , then others came , then others yet more active , then a crowd .
1	' None of it , ' answered <NAME> .
1	He goes downstairs , and <NAME> tries to compose himself before the fire for waiting a long time .
1	The rich and beautiful wardrobe purchased by these agents , in the course of a few weeks made its way through the intervening country , bristling with custom-houses , garrisoned by an immense army of shabby mendicants in uniform who incessantly repeated the <NAME> ' s Petition over it , as if every individual warrior among them were the ancient Belisarius : and of whom there were so many Legions , that unless the <NAME> had expended just one bushel and a half of silver money relieving their distresses , they would have worn the wardrobe out before it got to <NAME> , by turning it over and over .
1	she ' ll make a sweet miniature. ' As <NAME> spoke , she held up an ivory countenance intersected with very perceptible sky-blue veins , and regarded it with so much complacency , that <NAME> quite envied her .
1	And beside him , white with rage or fear , or both , were the scowling features of the man who had accosted him in the inn-yard .
1	He arrived post-haste with the intelligence one evening , and had a long conference with my guardian .
1	What does he mean , <NAME> ? ' ' Live there , <NAME> , ' faltered <NAME> .
1	And of course he 's going .
1	Well ; arter the tea was over , they sang another hymn , and then the shepherd began to preach : and wery well he did it , considerin ' how heavy them muffins must have lied on his chest .
1	' As to what was found in the dust now .
1	' I wonder , ' thought the boy , ' if one of these gentlemen knew there was nothing in the cupboard at home , whether he ' d stop on purpose , and make believe that he wanted to call somewhere , that I might earn a trifle ? ' He was quite tired out with pacing the streets , to say nothing of repeated disappointments , and was sitting down upon a step to rest , when there approached towards him a little clattering jingling four-wheeled chaise , drawn by a little obstinate-looking rough-coated pony , and driven by a little fat placid-faced old gentleman .
1	The cause of this is not to be found in any local superstition that attaches to the Precincts—albeit a mysterious lady , with a child in her arms and a rope dangling from her neck , has been seen flitting about there by sundry witnesses as intangible as herself—but it is to be sought in the innate shrinking of dust with the breath of life in it from dust out of which the breath of life has passed ; also , in the widely diffused , and almost as widely unacknowledged , reflection : ' If the dead do , under any circumstances , become visible to the living , these are such likely surroundings for the purpose that I , the living , will get out of them as soon as I can. ' <NAME> , when <NAME> and <NAME> pause to glance around them , before descending into the crypt by a small side door , of which the latter has a key , the whole expanse of moonlight in their view is utterly deserted .
1	' You ' re a nice young gentleman ! ' said Mr Carker , shaking his head at him .
1	Reluctantly , I confessed myself quite unable to answer the question .
1	I dare say you would , <NAME> .
1	His coffee was produced , by the special activity of <NAME> , a full hour before he wanted it .
1	She was too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved her affection , and with <NAME> 's friendly reassurances , adequately to heed what she observed .
1	I had bought a spotted wooden horse over-night as a parting gift to little <NAME> -- that was the boy -- and a doll for little Emma .
1	Except the clock , there was not such an accurate and unimpeachable instrument in existence as the little thermometer which hung behind the door .
1	He lies , dressed , across a large unseemly bed , upon a bedstead that has indeed given way under the weight upon it .
1	' I can ' t help it , ' cried Mrs. Nickleby .
1	Little <NAME> was not ashamed of her poor shoes .
1	<NAME> answers with a nod of deepest meaning and calls , as she scrapes the butter on the loaf with every precaution against waste and cuts it into slices , " You , <NAME> , where are you ? "
1	He has time before him , and the race to run .
1	So every true soul ever was , ever is , and ever will be .
1	' I want to see a ruddier touch here , <NAME> , ' he said , indicating his own healthy cheek by way of pattern .
1	The Game Made While <NAME> and the <NAME> of the prisons were in the adjoining dark room , speaking so low that not a sound was heard , <NAME> looked at <NAME> in considerable doubt and mistrust .
1	' How came -- eh ! -- oh -- demmit , how d ' ye do ? ' ' I have been waiting , here some time , ma ' am , ' said <NAME> , addressing <NAME> .
1	Will you have the goodness to charge yourself with that commission , <NAME> ? ' ' Certainly ! ' rejoined <NAME> .
1	I was only too happy to be in such request .
1	' There is quite a bloom upon your demd countenance , ' said <NAME> , seating himself unbidden , and arranging his hair and whiskers .
1	Let me see thee , a ' so good , and so forgiving .
1	But <NAME> , looking up and smiling through her tears , cried , " Yes , I do !
1	In the galleries themselves , and more especially on the stair-cases , there lingered a great number of people , who came there , some because their rooms were empty and lonesome , others because their rooms were full and hot ; the greater part because they were restless and uncomfortable , and not possessed of the secret of exactly knowing what to do with themselves .
1	I took a sudden resolution .
1	Consequently she made out nothing , and Mr Dombey in his den remained a very shade .
1	He has no hand free , to wave to me ; I dare not call to him ; he regards me like a dead man. " Defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another .
1	If the matter had only been properly taken up at first , as I wished it to be !
1	" Sir , " returned <NAME> , " as I believe I have already mentioned , it is next door .
1	He was then attacked by scarlet fever ; in four weeks became deaf ; in a few weeks more , blind ; in six months , dumb .
1	" Your ladyship , " replies <NAME> , again referring to his paper , " I am coming to that .
1	' Have you seen <NAME> , my dear , ' he said , ' since she left your house ? ' ' No , sir ! ' replied <NAME> .
1	I may drop into the <NAME> , and clear off that way .
1	He , anything but a guide , a support , and a friend to me !
1	Some of the people of the chateau , and some of those of the posting-house , and all the taxing authorities , were armed more or less , and were crowded on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way , that was highly fraught with nothing .
1	To prepare the mind for such a heavy sleep , its growth must be stopped by rigour and cruelty in childhood ; there must be years of misery and suffering , lightened by no ray of hope ; the chords of the heart , which beat a quick response to the voice of gentleness and affection , must have rusted and broken in their secret places , and bear the lingering echo of no old word of love or kindness .
1	However , he took affairs as coolly as it was in human nature to do , and entertained himself with the facetious idea of the training more than once .
1	A negro lad , startled from his sleep by the officer ' s voice—he knows it well—but comforted by his assurance that he has not come on business , officiously bestirs himself to light a candle .
1	'They have n't no more philosophy nor political economy about 'em than that , ' said the beadle , snapping his fingers contemptuously .
1	<NAME> threadbare coats and trousers , such fusty gowns and shawls , such squashed hats and bonnets , such boots and shoes , such umbrellas and walking-sticks , never were seen in <NAME> .
1	Boiled beef and greens constitute the day 's variety on the former repast of boiled pork and greens , and Mrs. Bagnet serves out the meal in the same way and seasons it with the best of temper , being that rare sort of old girl that she receives <NAME> to her arms without a hint that it might be <NAME> and catches light from any little spot of darkness near her .
1	Not troubled by any such weak imagining , <NAME> merely speculated on the time of life at which his beard had begun , and thought once more what a good ' un he was for the part .
1	Better to begin slowly. " Thus , <NAME> , in a stern voice , to <NAME> , as they began ascending the stairs .
1	I address myself to that Doctor. " Then she raised her voice and called out , " Citizen Doctor !
1	At last I rose to go to bed , much to the relief of the sleepy waiter , who had got the fidgets in his legs , and was twisting them , and hitting them , and putting them through all kinds of contortions in his small pantry .
1	' We call it a Hall up in <NAME> , because it sounds better , but they don ' t know it by that name in these parts .
1	At the <NAME> ' s <NAME> , the gallant steed , the <NAME> ' s ark , yellow bird , and the officer in the <NAME> , were made as welcome as their child-owner .
1	( When she spoke of their living together , she meant that the old gentleman had all the good things and all the good lodging , while she and her husband had what they could get , and were poked into two corner rooms over the Mews . )
1	' Keep the pot a-bilin ' , <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> ; and down went <NAME> again , and then <NAME> , and then <NAME> , and then <NAME> , and then <NAME> , and then the fat boy , and then <NAME> , following closely upon each other ' s heels , and running after each other with as much eagerness as if their future prospects in life depended on their expedition .
1	If I could only fold you in my arms , and squeeze your ribs , as I COULD squeeze them if I once had you tight -- what a meeting there would be between us !
1	<NAME> ' s gentleman , not knowing how the matter really stands , is afraid to pursue the subject .
1	<NAME> <NAME> had risen from his seat , and taken two steps with his eyes shut , to accompany his description with appropriate action , when he started violently , in common with the rest of the company , and hurried back to his chair .
1	' I am going , ma ' am , ' said <NAME> , ' to marry <NAME> ' s daughter. ' ' Yes , sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit .
1	' And imposition , ' added <NAME> , laughing ; ' we won ' t leave out the imposition .
1	' I never will believe it , sir , ' replied the old lady , firmly .
1	' I despise 'em , ' said the beadle , growing very red in the face .
1	<NAME> is very fond of <NAME> , and <NAME> ' s very fond of him , and if you were to tell about it , the old gentleman would carry you all away miles into the country , where you ' d see nobody. ' ' No , no , I won ' t tell , ' said the fat boy stoutly .
1	<NAME> ' s place was at the bottom of the school , at the opposite end of the long room .
1	I will not say a word more .
1	" This , " said she , pointing to the long table with her stick , " is where I will be laid when I am dead .
1	Sometimes , he gets up in the dead of the night , and will be heard , by us overhead there , walking up and down , walking up and down , in his room .
1	' If he has had time to think of it , ' said <NAME> , ' he has not had time to think better of it -- or differently of it , if that ' s better .
1	' Well , godmother , ' said <NAME> , as they remained upon the steps together , looking at one another .
1	' Now , <NAME> , ' said Mr Carker , taking him by the shoulder , ' come along ! ' The prodigal son was evidently nervous of visiting the parental abode ; but Mr Carker pushing him on before , he had nothing for it but to open the right door , and suffer himself to be walked into the midst of his brothers and sisters , mustered in overwhelming force round the family tea-table .
1	" _I_ go through no streets and past no fountains .
1	For the rest , uncertainty and danger seemed written upon everything .
1	And a beautiful world we live in , when it _is_ possible , and when many other such things are possible , and not only possible , but done -- done , see you ! -- under that sky there , every day .
1	The very soil of the earth is made up of minute fragments such as these ; each pool of stagnant water has its crust of vegetable rottenness ; on every side there are the boughs , and trunks , and stumps of trees , in every possible stage of decay , decomposition , and neglect .
1	<NAME> of <NAME> learnt his letters from the outsides of the shops , Mrs. Gradgrind , and was first able to tell the time upon a dial-plate , from studying the steeple clock of <NAME> <NAME> ' s <NAME> , <NAME> , under the direction of a drunken cripple , who was a convicted thief , and an incorrigible vagrant .
1	Their way lies through strange places .
1	Of course he might come in. ' And so he did .
1	<NAME> , he believed that <NAME> had no particular pair of shoes .
1	It ' s not a celebrated name .
1	Your Toxes and your Chickses may draw out my two front double teeth , <NAME> , but that ' s no reason why I need offer ' em the whole set. ' This proposition was also assented to by <NAME> , as an obvious one .
1	' This , ' said <NAME> , ' seems to be some deed of sale of the right of presentation to the rectory of <NAME> , in the valley of <NAME> .
1	Without presuming to decide where doctors disagreed , it did appear to <NAME> , viewing it as a question of common sense and not of so-called legal penetration , that this new system was -- might be , in the presence of so great an authority -- say , <NAME> ?
1	' Rokesmith. ' ' No , it ain ' t ! ' cried <NAME> , clapping her hands , and shaking her head .
1	I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation , and the rumour openly going about among your admirers , the nature of your calling .
1	Mr Toots tells <NAME> when he comes at night , that he hasn ' t been so wretched all day long , and yet he likes it .
1	She does her duty. ' <NAME> fancied that he heard in these praises a certain tone of custom , which he had heard from the father last night with an inward protest and feeling of antagonism .
1	And when I wait upon ' em , they ' ll say to me sometimes -- WITH IT ON -- thick , and no mistake -- " How am I looking , <NAME> ?
1	<NAME> , who had expected no more uncommon appearance than <NAME> in a clean shirt , was not a little astonished to see that the opener was a man in handsome livery , and that there were two or three others in the hall .
1	People couldn ' t ask one to wedding breakfasts .
1	After going through another dreamy place—a long aqueduct across the <NAME> , which was stranger than the bridge at <NAME> , being a vast , low , wooden chamber full of water—we emerged upon that ugly confusion of backs of buildings and crazy galleries and stairs , which always abuts on water , whether it be river , sea , canal , or ditch : and were at <NAME> .
1	Then you see , " said <NAME> , shaking his head , " I am hopeless of understanding it . "
1	And you will see how truly I spoke of myself just now , in saying I had no feelings , and that all the relations I hold with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations , when you reflect that I have never seen you since .
1	But what 's the matter , <NAME> ? "
1	he repeated , and I saw by his face that all the time he talked he was listening for the discovery of the letter , to my own great agitation , for I knew then how important it must be ; " I 'll tell you what he means , ma'am .
1	They entered the house , the crowd opening right and left to let them pass , and cheering vociferously .
1	I had not got far into it , when I judged from her looks that she was thinking in a discursive way of me , rather than of what I said .
1	<NAME> gently detained his sister , who made an effort to retire ; and asked , ' Why not ? ' ' I could not sleep , ' said <NAME> , grasping the hand which his friend extended to him .
1	She lives with me at my table here . "
1	What her pitiful look saw , at that early time , in her father , in her sister , in her brother , in the jail ; how much , or how little of the wretched truth it pleased God to make visible to her ; lies hidden with many mysteries .
1	' There ' s a letter been waiting here for you four days ; you hadn ' t gone away , half an hour , when it came ; and more than that , it ' s got " immediate , " on the outside. ' ' Vere is it , my love ? ' inquired <NAME> .
1	'Not bad , any way , ' replied <NAME> with a smile .
1	But in reply to these considerate representations , and many others both from <NAME> and <NAME> , <NAME> could only be brought to state that he was never merrier in his life ; and so went on all day , and so went towards home at night , still turning over and over again the same subjects , thinking over and over again the same things , and arriving over and over again at the same conclusions .
1	' Coming down the yard now , <NAME> , ' replied the hostler .
1	' In what respect ? ' asked <NAME> .
1	'This is far enough , ' said a voice , which was evidently that of the gentleman .
1	' Dear me , sir ! ' said <NAME> , surveying me with his head on one side .
1	At least I had nothing in my mind that I could say .
1	'No , I know you 're not .
1	No , nor in the hall , which was so bare that he could see that , at a glance .
1	For the rest , the <NAME> was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard , from which pale travellers set out continually , in carts and coaches , on a violent passage into the other world : traversing some two miles and a half of public street and road , and shaming few good citizens , if any .
1	I dare say the resemblance is not so exact , though , as that your informant became known to you through a letter from a correspondent with whom he had deposited money ?
1	He is the best judge of his own responsibility ; he acts upon his responsibility .
1	We walked about on the cliff after that , and sat on the grass , and looked at things through a telescope -- I could make out nothing myself when it was put to my eye , but I pretended I could -- and then we came back to the hotel to an early dinner .
1	Thank you , sir , thank you .
1	Probably much more ! " ' I whispered a few words to <NAME> , who was weeping , half joyfully , half sorrowfully , at my side ; and there was a movement among us , as if <NAME> had finished .
1	If great criminals told the truth -- which , being great criminals , they do not -- they would very rarely tell of their struggles against the crime .
1	' Good-night , ' he said , after having sunk into a moody silence , with his hands clasped behind him , and his eyes suspiciously wandering about Wegg. -- ' No !
1	' Thank you , ma ' am , ' said <NAME> , knuckling his forehead again , in return for the favour of Mrs. Sparsit ' s improving conversation .
1	There was abundance of time to look about him again though , when he had rung it , for nobody came , so after ringing it twice or thrice he sat down upon his box , and waited .
1	" He come in at the door , " said the old man , slowly pointing an imaginary track along the shop , " on the day he did it -- the whole neighbourhood had said for months before that he would do it , of a certainty sooner or later -- he come in at the door that day , and walked along there , and sat himself on a bench that stood there , and asked me ( you 'll judge I was a mortal sight younger then ) to fetch him a pint of wine .
1	However , they got to the corner of <NAME> Place without any molestation from that terrible fire-ship ; and the Captain mounting the coach-box -- for his gallantry would not allow him to ride inside with the ladies , though besought to do so -- piloted the driver on his course for <NAME> ' s vessel , which was called the <NAME> , and was lying hard by <NAME> .
1	Are they -- are they near here ? ' ' A long way from here , ' returned the gentleman , shaking his head .
1	Who am I , and who is he ? ' ' Professore , ' returned the ambassador , ' and who is <NAME> ? ' Without appearing at all interested in the latter question , <NAME> angrily whistled Mr Dorrit away .
1	What , are you here , <NAME> ?
1	In his lifetime , and likewise in the period of <NAME> 's " time " of seven long years , there dwelt with <NAME> in the same law-stationering premises a niece -- a short , shrewd niece , something too violently compressed about the waist , and with a sharp nose like a sharp autumn evening , inclining to be frosty towards the end .
1	I might strive to disguise my real feelings from anybody but you ; but I will tell you that -- briefly and plainly , <NAME> -- that I love her. ' Kate ' s eyes brightened , and she was going to make some reply , when <NAME> laid his hand upon her arm , and went on : ' Nobody must know this but you .
1	Still , at the same time , I wouldn ' t commit such an injustice for the world .
1	" <NAME> , there is my husband ! " she cried , pointing him out .
1	I had alighted from <NAME> 's back on the brink of the ditch when we came up , and had not moved since .
1	You shall well and truly try -- ' ' I beg this court ' s pardon , ' said the chemist , who was a tall , thin , yellow-visaged man , ' but I hope this court will excuse my attendance. ' ' On what grounds , <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> .
1	When it became quite dark , and they returned home , the young lady would sit down to the piano , and play some pleasant air , or sing , in a low and gentle voice , some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear .
1	If I do my duty , I do what I ought , and do no more than all the rest. ' <NAME> any misgiving of which she was hardly conscious : any misgiving that had sprung into an indistinct and undefined existence since that recent night when she had gone down to her father ' s room : that <NAME> ' s accidental interest in her , and early knowledge of her , might have involved him in that powerful displeasure and dislike ?
1	That purpose , providently to detach herself in the beginning from all the clankings of their chain that were to come , and to shelter herself with the fiction of her innocent belief in their mutual affection , and their adaptation to each other .
1	They received an early visit from <NAME> , who led that extensive department of life in the <NAME> that winter ; and the skilful manner in which she and <NAME> fenced with one another on the occasion , almost made her quiet sister wink , like the glittering of small-swords .
1	' Now , ' said <NAME> , gasping no less from excitement than from the expenditure of so much energy , ' come on -- both of you -- both of you ! ' With this liberal invitation the worthy gentleman communicated a revolving motion to his clenched fists , by way of appalling his antagonists with a display of science .
1	" My dear boy , " said <NAME> , " I am harder with myself when I do anything that gives you pain .
1	The visitor offered his hand .
1	' Let me get at him , <NAME> , ' cried <NAME> , as he rushed at the ill- starred youth .
1	When they had got through such studies as they had in hand , they stood leaning on the window-sill , and looking down upon the patch of garden .
1	said the people , turning to look after her as she rushed away .
1	What was the end of it ?
1	The <NAME> touched him on the arm , and pointed to his younger self , intent upon his reading .
1	My aunt was as happy as I was , in the arrangement made for me ; and we went down to the drawing-room again , well pleased and gratified .
1	' There was something behind the door , <NAME> , which perwented our getting it open , for ever so long , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> .
1	" <NAME> ? " " Something that crossed me ? " " I am conscious of nothing ; there can be nothing here .
1	A desolate air of utter and complete loneliness fell upon him , like a visible shade .
1	The housemaids had been bribed with various fragments of riband , and sundry pairs of shoes more or less down at heel , to make no mention of crumbs in the beds ; the airiest costumes had been worn on these festive occasions ; and the daring <NAME> had even surprised the company with a sprightly solo on the comb-and-curlpaper , until suffocated in her own pillow by two flowing-haired executioners .
1	If my daughter flies in my face , surely my husband may .
1	Several swaggering sinners had written their own biographies in the same strain ; it always appearing from the lessons of those very boastful persons , that you were to do good , not because it <NAME> good , but because you were to make a good thing of it .
1	' They can ' t be very heavy. ' ' The weight o ' the pair , mum , ' said <NAME> , eyeing them with the look of a man who was calculating within half an ounce or so , ' would be a trifle under that of <NAME> Cromwell. ' <NAME> was very much surprised that the man should be so accurately acquainted with the weight of one whom she had read of in books as having lived considerably before their time , but speedily forgot the subject in the joy of hearing that they were to go forward in the caravan , for which she thanked its lady with unaffected earnestness .
1	They had no doubt that <NAME> would " do something " for me ; their doubts related to the form that something would take .
1	I gave them an undertaking on which they sent down your discharge ; it ' s very awkward , my dear <NAME> ; what will you do ?
1	Containing the whole Science of Government 11 .
1	The <NAME> were a very high family , and a very large family .
1	Volumes could not have said more .
1	But I should feel it much more , if I didn ' t know it to be a tie between me and father. -- <NAME> !
1	' There ' s the likeness of a man being hung , and smoking the while , chalked outside the door. ' Guided by this direction , <NAME> proceeded slowly along the gallery until he encountered the ' portrait of a gentleman , ' above described , upon whose countenance he tapped , with the knuckle of his forefinger -- gently at first , and then audibly .
1	The <NAME> stopped at a certain warehouse door , and asked <NAME> if he knew it .
1	' Then what did you say " nothing " for , sir ? ' In default of a better answer to this question , the little boy screwed a couple of knuckles into each of his eyes and began to cry , wherefore Mr Squeers knocked him off the trunk with a blow on one side of the face , and knocked him on again with a blow on the other .
1	For nearly a whole week , the <NAME> , & c. , is in course of removal .
1	' I ' m a intimate friend of his and his Uncle ' s .
1	'Will you disclose the whole ? '
1	" He would n't keep out of <NAME> , and I suppose he 's over head and ears in debt .
1	The last time I was in the <NAME> , a civil able-bodied person in a white apron pounced out upon me from a doorway , and whispering the word ' Marriage-licence ' in my ear , was with great difficulty prevented from taking me up in his arms and lifting me into a proctor ' s .
1	is the likeness gone , and is it my gal -- only my gal -- that ' s to change so ! ' ' We shall all change , mother , in our turn , ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> home directly , you cruel boy !
1	He had taken it up , and was stooping to work again , when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress .
1	" I 'm very glad to hear it . "
1	In this frame of mind ( expressed , when she had become too resigned for speech , by nods of the head , upliftings of the eyes , and little beginnings of groans , converted , as they attracted attention , into short coughs ) , Mrs. <NAME> remained until <NAME> and <NAME> returned with the object of their solicitude ; when , having by this time asserted her own importance , and becoming besides interested in the trials of one so young and beautiful , she not only displayed the utmost zeal and solicitude , but took great credit to herself for recommending the course of procedure which her son had adopted : frequently declaring , with an expressive look , that it was very fortunate things were AS they were : and hinting , that but for great encouragement and wisdom on her own part , they never could have been brought to that pass .
1	As <NAME> did happen to labour under the slight imputation of having bruised three or four boys to death already , it occurred to him that the board had , perhaps , in some unaccountable freak , taken it into their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their proceedings .
1	I look along the road before me , where the distance already shortens and the journey 's end is growing visible ; and true and good above the dead sea of the Chancery suit and all the ashy fruit it cast ashore , I think I see my darling .
1	<NAME> ' t give it to him .
1	Here and there a flight of broad stone cellar-steps appears , and a painted lamp directs you to the <NAME> , or Ten-Pin alley ; Ten-Pins being a game of mingled chance and skill , invented when the legislature passed an act forbidding Nine-Pins .
1	<NAME> giv ' herself a deal o ' trouble with me afore I left ( for I am almost awful dull ) , as I should view it in this light , and , viewing it in this light , as I should so put it .
1	' Did you ever see a ghost ? ' was the sullen retort .
1	Supposing then , for instance -- any unlikely thing will do for a supposition -- that you and your mother were to have a serious quarrel. ' ' My dear <NAME> , ' interposed Mrs. <NAME> , laughing good-naturedly , ' suggest some other supposition !
1	The Secretary learns , too , that confidence between man and wife would seem to obtain but rarely when virtue is in distress , so numerous are the wives who take up their pens to ask Mr Boffin for money without the knowledge of their devoted husbands , who would never permit it ; while , on the other hand , so numerous are the husbands who take up their pens to ask Mr Boffin for money without the knowledge of their devoted wives , who would instantly go out of their senses if they had the least suspicion of the circumstance .
1	I know what that is .
1	It was a dark winter day , and what with the shadows within , and what with the shadows without , he could but dimly discern the others who were brought there to have their arms bound .
1	Is the moment come ? " " Yes. " She kisses his lips ; he kisses hers ; they solemnly bless each other .
1	Will you come and see her ? " The answers to this question were various and contradictory .
1	Are you , or are you not , a particular friend of the defendant ' s ? ' ' I was just about to say , that -- ' ' Will you , or will you not , answer my question , <NAME> ? ' If you don ' t answer the question , you ' ll be committed , <NAME> , ' interposed the little judge , looking over his note-book .
1	' What can we do , Trotwood ? ' said <NAME> .
1	Mr <NAME> smiled again , as he remarked to himself ' Those kings and queens were always wishing for children. ' It occurring to him , perhaps , that if they had been <NAME> , their wishes might have tended in the opposite direction .
1	<NAME> as my inward hurry was , and wonderful the force of the pictures that rushed by me instead of thoughts , I could yet clearly understand that , unless he had resolved that I was within a few moments of surely perishing out of all human knowledge , he would never have told me what he had told .
1	Submitting , however , with a good grace to the caution that we had shown to be so necessary , he contented himself with sitting down among us in his lightest spirits and talking as if his one unvarying purpose in life from childhood had been that one which now held possession of him .
1	The whole place seemed restless and troubled ; and the people were crowding and flitting to and fro , like the shadows in an uneasy dream .
1	She flies in a passion , and breaks his pipe ; he steps out , and gets another .
1	What is before you , is a fight with the world ; and the sooner you begin it , the better. ' I think it occurred to me that I had already begun it , in my poor way : but it occurs to me now , whether or no .
1	It would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions ; but in my dazed , not to say distracted , state , it took so long , that I did not get out to further them until two or three in the afternoon .
1	By-and-by , she said , breaking a long and patient silence : ' I beg your pardon , sir , but I am used to find Mr Riah at this time , and so I generally come at this time .
1	When he had achieved this rush of vivacity and condescension , his <NAME> composed himself into the picture after <NAME> , and made a third cow in the group .
1	Ve-ry strong influence , is it not ?
1	" 'Enter not into judgment with thy servant , <NAME> , for in thy sight -- ' " Shall I ever forget the rapid beating at my heart , occasioned by the look I met as I stood up !
1	At length they being among the trees , Mr <NAME> stopped short , and said : ' Mr Clennam , will you do me the favour to look at this man ?
1	Upon this , the pursuers took counsel together , and , coming so near the truth as to arrive at the conclusion that <NAME> and <NAME> , with <NAME> for their instrument , were negotiating for the recovery of some of the stolen papers which would not bear the light , and might possibly explain the hints relative to <NAME> which <NAME> had overheard , resolved that <NAME> should be taken into custody before she had parted with them : and <NAME> too , if anything suspicious could be attached to him .
1	Dear me , that 's not a common name , <NAME> , is it ?
1	It never is , to obstinate and sullen natures ; for they struggle hard to be such .
1	By Heaven I will , if I hang on to the foot-board. ' ' You shall be horsewhipped if you do , ' returned <NAME> .
1	Slowly and peacefully , the father sank into the grave , and , soon after , the sharer of all his cares and troubles followed him to a place of rest .
1	Then you ' ll memorialise that Department ( according to regular forms which you ' ll find out ) for leave to memorialise this Department .
1	Nevertheless , it was not easy , with the face of his beloved wife fresh before him , to compose his mind to what it must bear .
1	My back was turned towards the distant Hulks as I walked on , and , though I could see the old lights away on the spits of sand , I saw them over my shoulder .
1	<NAME> Leicester sits like a statue , gazing at the cruel finger that is probing the life-blood of his heart .
1	I am afraid I was in a tremulous state for a minute or so , though I did my best to disguise it .
1	' And that is just what I mean ; that is just how it was with us , ' said <NAME> .
1	' Very sad , is it not ? ' returned <NAME> .
1	But , he had never seen his friend in his present aspect : he had never at all known him in his present character .
1	Let him remember it in that room , years to come .
1	The coach is gone , but the street is steep , and narrow , and blocked up , and <NAME> can see it at a stand-still in the distance , she is sure .
1	All day , I have had him near me. ' ' What can I do ? ' cried <NAME> , shuddering at these words .
1	" Will you tell me who denounced him ? " " It is against rule , " answered the first ; " but you can ask Him of <NAME> here. " The <NAME> turned his eyes upon that man .
1	<NAME> ! ' at intervals all day , and ' Lock ho !
1	He appeared to have settled into his original foundation , like a building ; and I must confess that my faith in his ever Moving , was not much greater than if he had been a building .
1	It is not so unlike the Court of Chancery but that we may pass from the one scene to the other , as the crow flies .
1	<NAME> , <NAME> , please , forgive me quite ! ' Half laughing at him and half crying to him , <NAME> besought him in the prettiest manner ; in a manner so engaging and so playful and so natural , that her cherubic parent made a coaxing face as if she had never grown up , and said , ' What a silly little Mouse it is ! ' ' But you do forgive me that , and everything else ; don ' t you , <NAME> ? ' ' Yes , my dearest. ' ' And you don ' t feel solitary or neglected , going away by yourself ; do you , <NAME> ? ' ' Lord bless you !
1	Until then , good-bye. ' As <NAME> said this , he got into the coach which had by this time arrived , followed by the tipstaff .
1	Even when , at last , I had knocked , and was waiting at the door , I had some flurried thought of asking if that were <NAME> ' s ( in imitation of poor <NAME> ) , begging pardon , and retreating .
1	Often after dark , one other figure walked alone before the <NAME> ' s house .
1	But I didn ' t , Mr Boffin , and I fell into it. ' Without moving eye or finger , Mr <NAME> gave another nod , and placidly repeated , ' Quite so , Venus. ' ' Not that I was ever hearty in it , sir , ' the penitent anatomist went on , ' or that I ever viewed myself with anything but reproach for having turned out of the paths of science into the paths of -- ' he was going to say ' villany , ' but , unwilling to press too hard upon himself , substituted with great emphasis -- ' Weggery. ' Placid and whimsical of look as ever , Mr <NAME> answered : ' <NAME> so , Venus. ' ' And now , sir , ' said <NAME> , ' having prepared your mind in the rough , I will articulate the details. ' With which brief professional exordium , he entered on the history of the friendly move , and truly recounted it .
1	' O you cruel godmother ! ' She shook that emphatic little forefinger of hers in his face at parting , as earnestly and reproachfully as she had ever shaken it at her grim old child at home .
1	' Them things as is always a-goin ' up and down , in the city. ' ' Omnibuses ? ' suggested <NAME> .
1	You 've hit the right nail upon the head , and are as safe here as you could be .
1	But she seemed to be a good sort of fellow , and showed a high regard for the <NAME> .
1	' However , ' said <NAME> , appearing to pluck up his spirits , ' we ' ll hope it ' s not so bad as that comes to .
1	' It ' s a stupid name , ' she said , shaking her curls for a moment .
1	And often and often of a night , he used to forget all his troubles in wondering whether the <NAME> would let the lady go on with the story , or would have her head cut off before it was finished. ' ' And your father was always kind ?
1	I didn ' t call too loud .
1	I felt very ignorant , but what could I do ?
1	There 's no time to lose . '
1	' This is not all of ' em , even as we already know ' em , ' said <NAME> , with many nods of hidden meaning .
1	At intervals , along the town , and even a little way out upon the road , I saw more : but at length only the bleak night and the open country were around me , and the ashes of my youthful friendship .
1	I ' m a going to seek my niece through the wureld .
1	The man in uniform whom he had sent to fetch this equipage then handed him up a dark lantern at his request , and when he had given a few directions to the driver , we rattled away .
1	Thus , they crossed the bridge , from the <NAME> to the Surrey shore , when the woman , apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the foot-passengers , turned back .
1	" They would n't have nothink to say to me if I wos to go to a nice innocent place fur to live .
1	I was regularly turned on my back when I found him taken up by your establishment , I do assure you . "
1	What did he earn by it ?
1	I do <NAME> forget , though I do not read it as he did .
1	Let us say no more upon the subject ; it ' s a very painful one to me .
1	But the scientific gentleman could not rest under the idea of the ingenious treatise he had projected being lost to the world , which must inevitably be the case if the speculation of the ingenious <NAME> were not stifled in its birth .
1	'And his master , too , I think you said , <NAME> ? '
1	Welcome to this stricken breast ! ' She felt the words , although she could not utter them , and held him in her pure embrace .
1	Around and around the house the leaves fall thick , but never fast , for they come circling down with a dead lightness that is sombre and slow .
1	The reflections of Mrs. Nickleby were of the proudest and most complacent kind ; and under the influence of her very agreeable delusion she straightway sat down and indited a long letter to <NAME> , in which she expressed her entire approval of the admirable choice she had made , and extolled <NAME> to the skies ; asserting , for the more complete satisfaction of her daughter ' s feelings , that he was precisely the individual whom she ( Mrs. Nickleby ) would have chosen for her son-in-law , if she had had the picking and choosing from all mankind .
1	' We shall be very slow to-day , dear , ' she said , as they toiled painfully through the streets ; ' my feet are sore , and I have pains in all my limbs from the wet of yesterday .
1	' " You a miserable man ! " said the goblin , in a tone of excessive contempt .
1	Happily for me , I am so much engaged that I have no time to think about it .
1	What is the meaning of it , <NAME> ? ' added <NAME> , in a threatening , and a louder tone .
1	" Have you many pupils , Mr .
1	And there are the office lads in their first surtouts , who feel a befitting contempt for boys at day-schools , club as they go home at night , for saveloys and porter , and think there ' s nothing like ' life. ' There are varieties of the genus , too numerous to recapitulate , but however numerous they may be , they are all to be seen , at certain regulated business hours , hurrying to and from the places we have just mentioned .
1	I ' ll open the door directly , if you ' ll wait an instant. ' The gentlemen entreated him not to hurry himself ; and , to beguile the interval , had a fencing bout with their walking-sticks on the very small landing-place : to the unspeakable discomposure of all the other lodgers downstairs .
1	As we were going along , she asked me what he had said ; and I told her he had said it was all right .
1	' Come here , you sir , ' said the dwarf .
1	What have paupers to do with soul or spirit ?
1	She said she had a headache ; headaches don ' t occasion red eyes .
1	' Emily , my girl , ' said <NAME> reproachfully , ' I detest meanness and deceit ; this is unjustifiable and indelicate in the highest degree .
1	He thinks he has awakened his friend .
1	Alive to every sound , in his anxious and expectant state , <NAME> hurried downstairs , and , uttering a cry of joyful surprise , dragged the welcome visitor into the passage and up the stairs , and said not a word until he had him safe in his own garret and the door was shut behind them , when he mixed a great mug-full of gin-and-water , and holding it to <NAME> ' s mouth , as one might hold a bowl of medicine to the lips of a refractory child , commanded him to drain it to the last drop .
1	The miserable stations by the railway side , the great wild wood-yards , whence the engine is supplied with fuel ; the negro children rolling on the ground before the cabin doors , with dogs and pigs ; the biped beasts of burden slinking past : gloom and dejection are upon them all .
1	so-ho-then ! " the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it -- like an unusually emphatic horse , denying that the coach could be got up the hill .
1	" I do n't even know which ; but as I understand the way in which my dear <NAME> ( always remarkable for her practical good sense and clearness ) puts this case , I should imagine it was chiefly a question of money , do you know ? "
1	The probability of his ever doing so , appeared to me , when I saw him , to be very small .
1	<NAME> would bark and caper round us , and go on before , and look back on the landing , breathing short , to see that we were coming .
1	' Depend upon it , it comes of thinking and dwelling on that dark spot. ' ' Yes ; but why didn ' t it come before ? ' asked <NAME> .
1	I know that , but for the mercy of <NAME> , I might easily have been , for any care that was taken of me , a little robber or a little vagabond .
1	As <NAME> appears , <NAME> hastens towards her , to bid her farewell .
1	Had I given <NAME> no reason to doubt my constancy , and to think that in prosperity I should grow cold to him and cast him off ?
1	said <NAME> , with a sigh .
1	<NAME> Leicester receives the gout as a troublesome demon , but still a demon of the patrician order .
1	The little spot made them the more beautiful .
1	All the love and duty I could ever have rendered to him is transferred to you . "
1	' So much the worse , ' returned <NAME> ; ' for they ' ll have had all the advantage of the moonlight to get the start of us , and we shall lose it .
1	Then came the tea and coffee ; and then , the ball .
1	" Do n't recall her to herself , " he said , softly , to the latter , " she is better so .
1	' <NAME> delighted too , I should say , from the manner in which he ' s looking this way. ' Here <NAME> ( previously instructed for the purpose ) interposed her many curls and whispered her sister to observe how jealous Mr <NAME> was .
1	<NAME> ' t come back next day ; didn ' t come back next week ; missis had bills printed , sayin ' that , if he ' d come back , he should be forgiven everythin ' ( which was very liberal , seein ' that he hadn ' t done nothin ' at all ) ; the canals was dragged , and for two months arterwards , wenever a body turned up , it was carried , as a reg ' lar thing , straight off to the sassage shop .
1	Having held the first bottle up to the light , and shaken it well to test its excellence , <NAME> placed them both on top of a chest of drawers ; folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped ; put it carefully in his pocket ; and took up his hat , as if to go .
1	His hat was off , before he opened the door ; his comforter too .
1	' Hi ! ' cried the woman , raising a cracked voice .
1	' Nobody would , nobody could , you know .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , breaking off , has made a noiseless descent upon mademoiselle and laid his heavy hand upon her shoulder .
1	She simpered a little , affected extreme vexation and hesitation , and at last arrived at the conclusion that she supposed she must go .
1	But he kept up , nevertheless , and , with his head drooping languidly on his breast , went stumbling onward , he knew not whither .
1	' <NAME> Mr Gills to come here. ' Mr Perch was too deferential to express surprise or recognition of the figure in the corner : and <NAME> appeared immediately .
1	It ' s one or the other. ' ' Don ' t distress yourself by worrying your mind about it , ' he returned , with infinite forbearance .
1	" Do n't you be afraid of that .
1	<NAME> ! ' Then there came a turnip , then a potato , and then an egg ; with a few other little tokens of the playful disposition of the many-headed .
1	' You have no reason to suppose that they have run away from anywhere without paying the rates and taxes due , I hope ? ' <NAME> , with a look of some contempt , was about to enter a general protest against the payment of rates or taxes , under any circumstances , when he was checked by a timely whisper from <NAME> , and several frowns and winks from Mrs. K. , which providentially stopped him .
1	'The boy next , ' said <NAME> .
1	The more they let out , the more you keep in. ' ' I don ' t object , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , with an internal chuckle , ' to being understood , though I object to being questioned .
1	I observed that the latter always spoke of himself indefinitely , as ' a man ' , and seldom or never in the first person singular .
1	I am always wrong when you are in question .
1	'Now , ' muttered the Jew , as he knocked at the door , 'if there is any deep play here , I shall have it out of you , my girl , cunning as you are . '
1	' You mustn ' t expect , ' Mr <NAME> pursued , ' that I ' m a-going to settle money on you , if you leave us like this , because I am not .
1	' A very good fellow indeed ! ' returned <NAME> .
1	The house stands , large and weather-proof , in the long dull street ; but it is a ruin , and the rats fly from it .
1	' Dear , dear , ' said <NAME> , taking up the defence , ' what is the use of asking all that now , especially when you know you had set your covetous old heart on a richer son-in-law , and are so wild and fierce besides , that everybody is afraid of you , except me ?
1	The shop was close and hot .
1	I have done what I thowt should be done , but I never looked fur any good to come of my stan ' ning where I do .
1	When we repeated , with some surprise , " The sheep ? "
1	The world did have it that she showed a passion for attending my sales , when they took place on half holidays , or in vacation time .
1	' What would it be right to do ? ' ' I think , ' said <NAME> , ' that the honourable course to take , would be to write to those two ladies .
1	After <NAME> was restored , we still had to break it to the other eight ; and it produced various effects upon them of a most pathetic nature .
1	Away , with a shriek , and a roar , and a rattle , from the town , burrowing among the dwellings of men and making the streets hum , flashing out into the meadows for a moment , mining in through the damp earth , booming on in darkness and heavy air , bursting out again into the sunny day so bright and wide ; away , with a shriek , and a roar , and a rattle , through the fields , through the woods , through the corn , through the hay , through the chalk , through the mould , through the clay , through the rock , among objects close at hand and almost in the grasp , ever flying from the traveller , and a deceitful distance ever moving slowly within him : like as in the track of the remorseless monster , <NAME> !
1	We are not likely to meet often , for some time to come ; but I shall be a good correspondent of <NAME> ' s , and we shall frequently hear of one another that way. ' We were now within the little courtyard of the <NAME> ' s cottage .
1	And with that , he darted in again with one jerk and clapped the little door to , like a figure in a <NAME> clock when the hour strikes .
1	<NAME> was a capital way of raising his spirits , and putting him quite at his ease .
1	Beholding him in the trim described at the conclusion of the last chapter , he stood aghast in wonder and consternation .
1	<NAME> strike you dead on the spot , if ever you split in any way sumever !
1	' It isn ' t funny at all , ' repeated <NAME> .
1	This slight , small , patient figure , neatly dressed in homely stuffs , and indicating nothing but the dull , household virtues , that have so little in common with the received idea of heroism and greatness , unless , indeed , any ray of them should shine through the lives of the great ones of the earth , when it becomes a constellation and is tracked in <NAME> straightway -- this slight , small , patient figure , leaning on the man still young but worn and grey , is she , his sister , who , of all the world , went over to him in his shame and put her hand in his , and with a sweet composure and determination , led him hopefully upon his barren way .
1	Have you any fresh <NAME> for my daughter , sir ? ' <NAME> understood the tone of triumph in which this interrogatory was put ; but remembering the necessity of supporting his assumed character , produced a scrap of paper purporting to contain a list of some subjects for drawings which his employer desired to have executed ; and with which he had prepared himself in case of any such contingency .
1	' Is there anything else you wish to say to me , dear father ? ' ' No , no .
1	Perhaps you would n't mind <NAME> 's coming in , <NAME> ? "
1	" <NAME> is _not _wholesome , <NAME> , " says the doctor , wery fierce .
1	When he reached home Mrs. Maylie was sitting in the little parlour .
1	I could not wonder at any one loving her .
1	' Anybody else , <NAME> ? ' he said , without looking up , and turning over the leaves .
1	She was busily engaged in the little offices of the table .
1	All I mean goes beyond words , as I hope you understand and believe .
1	You had better call us thieves , <NAME> ; or perhaps You would like to assault one of _us_ .
1	Bear with a wretch , <NAME> , bear with a wretch , ma ' am , who feels the noble sacrifices you make for him , but is goaded almost to madness , ' Mr <NAME> slapped his forehead , ' when he thinks of competing with the rich and influential. ' ' When you have to compete with the rich and influential , it will probably be mentioned to you , ' said <NAME> , ' in good time .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , I hope I see you well , and -- if I may umbly express myself so -- friendly towards them as is ever your friends , whether or not .
1	I say nothing of what may be called the domestic noises of the ship : such as the breaking of glass and crockery , the tumbling down of stewards , the gambols , overhead , of loose casks and truant dozens of bottled porter , and the very remarkable and far from exhilarating sounds raised in their various state-rooms by the seventy passengers who were too ill to get up to breakfast .
1	You have been in every prospect I have ever seen since , -- on the river , on the sails of the ships , on the marshes , in the clouds , in the light , in the darkness , in the wind , in the woods , in the sea , in the streets .
1	The newspaper-reading turnkey has told them all .
1	I should not have the courage to mention this to any one but you .
1	And wot other man can say the same , <NAME> ? ' ' Vell , there ' s somethin ' in that , ' said <NAME> .
1	' It really , ' said <NAME> , suddenly , taking a letter out of his pocket , and giving it to me , ' put <NAME> quite out of my head ! ' The letter ( <NAME> never missed any possible opportunity of writing a letter ) was addressed to me , ' By the kindness of T. Traddles , <NAME> , of the <NAME> Temple. ' It ran thus : -- ' You may possibly not be unprepared to receive the intimation that something has turned up .
1	' It may seem wery strange talkin ' to me about these here affairs , miss , ' said <NAME> , with great vehemence ; ' but all I can say is , that I ' m not only ready but villin ' to do anythin ' as ' ll make matters agreeable ; and if chuckin ' either o ' them sawboneses out o ' winder ' ull do it , I ' m the man. ' As <NAME> said this , he tucked up his wristbands , at the imminent hazard of falling off the wall in so doing , to intimate his readiness to set to work immediately .
1	Her gentle ringing at the bell was responded to by a dolorous-looking woman , of light complexion , with raised eyebrows , and head drooping on one side , who curtseyed at sight of her , and conducted her across the garden to the house .
1	Reflects Mrs Veneering ; fair , aquiline-nosed and fingered , not so much light hair as she might have , gorgeous in raiment and jewels , enthusiastic , propitiatory , conscious that a corner of her husband ' s veil is over herself .
1	Before I leave this place , <NAME> shall hear me . '
1	' It ' s our parrot , this is. ' ' Mr <NAME> ' s parrot , <NAME> ? ' ' Will you hold your tongue , <NAME> ? ' returned the goaded Grinder .
1	I shall never allow people to talk before me about wastefulness and profligacy , and so forth , in connexion with that life , any more. ' ' And you will be right , ' said Mrs. Steerforth .
1	A certain idle carelessness and recklessness of consistency soon comes of it .
1	They and the accounts were all found correct , and the books and the papers resumed their places in the bag .
1	In that intent <NAME> will persevere , as his duty is .
1	Of courthe you do ; I needn ' t athk .
1	It is for his good .
1	<NAME> enough to be hith mother .
1	I fully expected to find a Constable in the kitchen , waiting to take me up .
1	She looked from him to <NAME> , and her features softened .
1	She stops him as he is moving out of the room by asking , " This is the notice I was to receive ?
1	It was when they turned into the welcome shade of the cool old hall , that <NAME> observed a great change to have come over the <NAME> ; as if the golden arm uplifted there , had struck him a poisoned blow .
1	None of these sports or exercises being pursued in <NAME> 's Shooting <NAME> to-night , which is so devoid of company that a little grotesque man with a large head has it all to himself and lies asleep upon the floor .
1	I was told by your guardian that you discontinued it under the shock that we have all felt so acutely .
1	' And warn ' t there no honest man to pick it up ?
1	Instead of returning my ' Good morning ' with his usual affability , he looked at me in a distant , ceremonious manner , and coldly requested me to accompany him to a certain coffee-house , which , in those days , had a door opening into the <NAME> , just within the little archway in <NAME> <NAME> ' s <NAME> .
1	' When will <NAME> be back , sir ? ' inquired <NAME> .
1	They see my <NAME> 's face .
1	All this time , <NAME> never raised her eyes , unless to glance towards her mother when that lady ' s fervent spirit shone forth in words .
1	After a moment ' s hesitation , the young man stretched out his to meet it ; <NAME> clutched his fingers in a grip that for the moment stopped the current of the blood within them , and pressing his other hand upon his lip and frowning towards the unsuspicious <NAME> , released them and sat down .
1	Then he slowly broke silence , and slowly said : ' What -- the -- Dev-il is this fellow about this morning ? ' ' Now , look here , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , with the meanest of twinkles in his meanest of eyes : which were too near together , by the way : ' look here , <NAME> ; I am very well aware that I didn ' t show to advantage last night , and that you and your wife -- who , I consider , is a very clever woman and an agreeable woman -- did .
1	' But nature will smile though priests may frown , and next day the sun shone brightly , and on the next , and the next again .
1	It will be of no use your rubbing yourselves ; you won ' t rub the marks out that I shall give you .
1	Besides , it is a violation of our agreement .
1	' I have a duty to discharge ; and , either here , or in the room from which we have just now come , at whatever risk or hazard to <NAME> , I must beseech you to contemplate again the fearful course to which you have been impelled. ' ' What course is this you speak of , and impelled by whom , sir ? ' demanded the young lady , with an effort to speak proudly .
1	' For I aint , you must know , ' said <NAME> , ' much of a hand at reading writing-hand , though I can read my Bible and most print .
1	If you want information regarding your uncle Provis , you had much better come and tell no one , and lose no time .
1	But if she knew I was ill , she must have pitied me , even there ; for she was very ill herself before she died .
1	From this employment she suddenly desisted , and said to <NAME> , much to my confusion : ' Who ' s your friend ? ' ' Mr .
1	He flies on these occasions like an angel or a bird .
1	A second and a third bowl were ordered in ; and when <NAME> awoke next morning , there was not a symptom of rheumatism about him ; which proves , as <NAME> very justly observed , that there is nothing like hot punch in such cases ; and that if ever hot punch did fail to act as a preventive , it was merely because the patient fell into the vulgar error of not taking enough of it .
1	If I had taken ten times as many glasses of wine as I had , I should have known that he never had stood in that relation towards me , and should in my heart of hearts have repudiated the idea .
1	' Impossible to imagine , ' said <NAME> .
1	If you haven ' t got the one thing , why have you got the other ?
1	It would be best to hide this coin , and never produce it unless their case was absolutely desperate , and no other resource was left them .
1	If he be seeking his own star as he methodically turns and turns upon the leads , it should be but a pale one to be so rustily represented below .
1	' I _have_ an idea ! ' They complied ; <NAME> none the less readily , for being all abroad ; and <NAME> , seated in the centre , with his hands upon his knees , thus stated his idea , with his usual manner of having got the statement by heart .
1	There ' s not a woman alive , that could tell me such a thing to my face -- to my own face. ' <NAME> stroked his chin , as he said this , and glanced complacently at an opposite mirror .
1	" To bless and receive me , " groaned my mother , " it is far too late .
1	So now , half-waking and all-winking , he may recall the house full of company , the coach-houses full of vehicles , the stables full of horses , and the out-buildings full of attendants upon horses , until he is undecided about the present and comes forth to see how it is .
1	' Of all the men I know , you are the best adapted , by nature and by position , for society .
1	But I may be pardoned , if on such a theme as the general character of the <NAME> people , and the general character of their social system , as presented to a stranger ' s eyes , I desire to express my own opinions in a few words , before I bring these volumes to a close .
1	An amazing boy to learn , blessed with a good memory , and a ready understanding , and moreover with a good voice and ear for psalm-singing , in which he is the best among us .
1	<NAME> and he did not see this poor life of his from the same point of view .
1	Said <NAME> convulsively wrestles with one of his many Gods or <NAME> , perhaps , and snarls horribly .
1	But he had a bold spirit , and he ran a little wild and went for a soldier .
1	It was an oblong pile of barrack building , partitioned into squalid houses standing back to back , so that there were no back rooms ; environed by a narrow paved yard , hemmed in by high walls duly spiked at top .
1	I am rough , sir , ' said <NAME> , ' I am as rough as a <NAME> ; but no one , unless , mayhap , it is a woman , can know , I think , what our little Em ' ly is to me .
1	He never knocked like that .
1	But , yes , I know I may .
1	' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , in a monotonous forced way , ' is active in the business , <NAME> .
1	And I have got it ! "
1	I came down of my own accord .
1	Her mother watching her , and not him , remained silent ; until her kindling glance subsided , and she drew a long breath , as if in the relief of his being gone .
1	Yes , <NAME> , ' says you , " here <NAME> shook his head and hand at me , " 'he knows my total deficiency of common human gratitoode .
1	But the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the hue-and-cry .
1	Whereas now I do declare to you that he becomes to me the embodiment of the suit ; that in place of its being an abstraction , it is <NAME> ; that the more I suffer , the more indignant I am with him ; that every new delay and every new disappointment is only a new injury from <NAME> 's hand . "
1	<NAME> or no message , I am going to see them tomorrow. ' ' Then I will tell them so. ' He lingered a moment , as though to give her the opportunity of prolonging the conversation if she wished .
1	very true , so they must ; very proper indeed ! ' rejoined <NAME> with that sort of half-sigh , which , accompanied by two or three slight nods of the head , is pity ' s small change in general society ; ' and that ' s what I very often tell my brother , when our servants go away ill , one after another , and he thinks the back-kitchen ' s rather too damp for ' em to sleep in .
1	Though I am in these present quarters through no immediately preceding fault of mine , I can very well understand that if I had n't gone into the vagabond way in my youth , this would n't have happened .
1	Unmoved , unchanged ! ' This , by the way , was a very remarkable circumstance , miniatures being liable to so many changes of expression -- ' Oh , <NAME> !
1	I must beg you to take this back , <NAME> Weller. ' Wery well , ' said <NAME> , with a discontented look .
1	' Not as you are carrying it , ' said <NAME> .
1	And it has been ascertained that when her slumber is broken , and is much disturbed by dreams , she expresses her thoughts in an irregular and confused manner on her fingers : just as we should murmur and mutter them indistinctly , in the like circumstances .
1	<NAME> should have induced ME to touch it ! )
1	In this way they travelled on until near midnight , when they stopped to supper , for which meal the single gentleman ordered everything eatable that the house contained ; and because <NAME> ' s mother didn ' t eat everything at once , and eat it all , he took it into his head that she must be ill. ' You ' re faint , ' said the single gentleman , who did nothing himself but walk about the room .
1	I doubt whether two young birds could have known less about keeping house , than I and my pretty <NAME> did .
1	' You are innocent of any part in it , we thoroughly believe , -- we know. ' ' Oh , I might have been much the better for her , if I had had a better heart ! ' exclaimed the girl , with most forlorn regret ; ' for she was always good to me !
1	<NAME> <NAME> and brother <NAME> entered the counting-house together ; but <NAME> , without looking round , impatiently waved his hand as a caution that profound silence must be observed , and followed the nib of the inexperienced pen with strained and eager eyes .
1	It was twelve o'clock before we could obtain possession of the room , and the clearance it required then was so discouraging that <NAME> , who was almost tired out , sat down in the middle of the dust and cried .
1	Here ' s <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> .
1	I came upon the amiable creature -- if you ' ll imagine my feelings , <NAME> and <NAME> -- in the act of making his will. ' Her daughter looked round from the window quickly .
1	The rippling of the river seemed to cause a correspondent stir in his uneasy reflections .
1	In town or country , wet or dry , hot or cold , <NAME> suffers .
1	HE was not altered , but he was surprised to see how altered I was and appeared quite pleased .
1	Mr Merdle is a most extensive merchant , his transactions are on the vastest scale , his wealth and influence are very great , but even he -- Bird , be quiet ! ' The parrot had shrieked another shriek ; and it filled up the sentence so expressively that <NAME> was under no necessity to end it .
1	In face , watchful behind a blind ; habitually not uncensorious and contemptuous perhaps .
1	He was a little bright creature with a rather large head , but a delicate face and a sweet voice , and there was a perfect charm in him .
1	His picture , dark and gloomy , earnestly speechless on the wall , with the eyes intently looking at his son as they had looked when life departed from them , seemed to urge him awfully to the task he had attempted ; but as to any yielding on the part of his mother , he had now no hope , and as to any other means of setting his distrust at rest , he had abandoned hope a long time .
1	She ' ll work at them clothes , as must be made ; and I hope her troubles will begin to seem longer ago than they was , wen she finds herself once more by her rough but loving uncle. ' My aunt nodded confirmation of this hope , and imparted great satisfaction to <NAME> .
1	A fourth is building , and will soon be opened .
1	Sauntering or sitting about , in every possible attitude of listless idleness , were a great number of debtors , the major part of whom were waiting in prison until their day of ' going up ' before the <NAME> should arrive ; while others had been remanded for various terms , which they were idling away as they best could .
1	There were occasions , however , when Mr Boffin , seeking a brief refuge from the blandishments of fashion , would present himself at the Bower after dark , to anticipate the next sallying forth of <NAME> , and would there , on the old settle , pursue the downward fortunes of those enervated and corrupted masters of the world who were by this time on their last legs .
1	What you have overcome in yourself , can you not overcome in him ?
1	<NAME> <NAME> was of her opinion .
1	what dreadful pain it is !
1	" Can it be true , " said <NAME> , in a low voice , looking down at his wife as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair : " what he has said of Ma'amselle Manette ? " " As he has said it , " returned madame , lifting her eyebrows a little , " it is probably false .
1	I have seen two of them safely out of bed .
1	I mean , Mrs. Bagnet , there he was , dying without ever having been taught much more than to know his right hand from his left .
1	' There are shades in all good pictures , but there are lights too , if we choose to contemplate them , ' said the gentleman with the merry face .
1	Soon as I come out of the Mill to-night , I hastened to hear what was said of Stephen—for I know wi ' pride he will come back to shame it ! —and then I went again to seek <NAME> , and I found him , and I told him every word I knew ; and he believed no word I said , and brought me here. ' ' So far , that ' s true enough , ' assented <NAME> , with his hands in his pockets and his hat on .
1	It is just half a year since I first saw this delicate morsel , and , oh dear , what a delicate morsel it is !
1	It was nothing that the decree bore date since his return to <NAME> .
1	We found my aunt alone , in a state of some excitement .
1	and then they can take it out and give it to him , and then all be happy ! ' The interruption was seasonable , for the bell had nearly rung itself out .
1	' Now , ' was his debate with himself ' shall I foller you on , or shall I let you loose for this once , and go a fishing ? ' The debate continuing , he followed , as a precautionary measure in any case , and got him again in sight .
1	I shall transact the business : you will transact the pleasure .
1	His table is covered with thick piles of papers ; and I say , as I look around me : ' If <NAME> were your clerk , now , <NAME> , she would have enough to do ! ' ' You may say that , my dear Copperfield !
1	I might only weaken what is ill enough said as it is .
1	If you ' re going there , look into the theatre , and see how that ' ll tell. ' <NAME> promised to do so , if he could , and drawing a chair near the fire , fell into conversation with the manager at once .
1	Not for her life , not for her life !
1	When it was dark , and he sat before the coffee-room fire , awaiting his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast , his mind was busily digging , digging , digging , in the live red coals .
1	<NAME> has eaten no dinner , but has twice or thrice poured out water with a steady hand and drunk it .
1	' Fine doings in a person ' s own house ! ' ' Mrs .
1	The little parlour-maid came out , with the key in her hand ; and looking earnestly at me as she unlocked the gate , said : ' I beg your pardon , sir .
1	What have you been doing ? ' ' Nothing , ' replied <NAME> , ' but looking forward to your coming back. ' ' And talking to Mr Lightwood , ' said <NAME> , turning to him with a smile .
1	Upon my word I am , though I wasn ' t acquainted with the party .
1	" But then you 've got to be a scholar. " By this time we had come to the house , where I found his room to be one just within the side-door , with a little window in it looking on the courtyard .
1	At last , and while she had been away from home , this family had taken it ; and it was repaired and newly painted ; and there were birds and flowers about it ; and it looked very different from its old self .
1	Though there <NAME> unintentionally threw him out by faltering , ' Oh , is it indeed ?
1	However striking such a contrast as this may be to lookers-on , none ever feel it with half the keenness or acuteness of perfection with which it strikes to the very soul of him whose inferiority it marks .
1	' <NAME> is with his sister now ! ' It was the conception of an inspired moment , and she shot off with her utmost swiftness to work it out .
1	By this time they had visited the family on several occasions , and had always observed that even a passing allusion to Mr <NAME> when he was not among them , brought back the cloud which had obscured Mr <NAME> ' s sunshine on the morning of the chance encounter at the <NAME> .
1	' Tis a muddle , and that ' s aw. ' ' Always a muddle ? ' said <NAME> , with another gentle touch upon his arm , as if to recall him out of the thoughtfulness , in which he was biting the long ends of his loose neckerchief as he walked along .
1	In the interest of seeing her , ever drawing , with no hand to stay her , nearer and nearer to the bottom of this new <NAME> ' s Staircase .
1	Transcribed from the 1913 Chapman & <NAME> , Ltd. edition by <NAME> , email ccx074 @ pglaf.org [ Picture : Emigrants ] * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * IT is nearly eight years since this book was first published .
1	' You have had no former cause of complaint on the sentimental score , <NAME> , and you will have none in future .
1	As he did so , hat in hand , <NAME> whispered : ' He killed the dog. ' ' <NAME> know it ? ' Little <NAME> whispered .
1	That my own artless <NAME> is changed to me !
1	These measures , advisable to be taken in any case , <NAME> took in the hope of his coming to himself .
1	' I screamed rather than talked , for I felt tumultuous passions eddying through my veins , and the old spirits whispering and taunting me to tear his heart out .
1	The old woman then produced some wretched substitutes from the bottom of the heap of rags , which she turned up for that purpose ; together with a girl ' s cloak , quite worn out and very old ; and the crushed remains of a bonnet that had probably been picked up from some ditch or dunghill .
1	' You don ' t much mind how you sleep , I suppose , sir ? ' No , indeed , ' replied <NAME> , ' I am not particular. ' ' That ' s lucky , ' said Mrs. Squeers .
1	' You think this thumped head of mine is excited ? ' <NAME> went on , with a high look ; ' not so , believe me .
1	Go away ! ' Dear Mr Clennam , As I said in my last that it was best for nobody to write to me , and as my sending you another little letter can therefore give you no other trouble than the trouble of reading it ( perhaps you may not find leisure for even that , though I hope you will some day ) , I am now going to devote an hour to writing to you again .
1	It wanted but a very slight circumstance to kindle his wrath against <NAME> .
1	what was that , which sent the blood tingling to his heart , and deprived him of his voice , and of power to move !
1	" 'Presents her compliments to Mr .
1	'No , not at all , ' rejoined <NAME> .
1	As fate would have it , Mrs. <NAME> chanced to bring in , at this moment , a small parcel of books , which <NAME> had that morning purchased of the identical bookstall-keeper , who has already figured in this history ; having laid them on the table , she prepared to leave the room .
1	I meant that , I am sure , as much as I still mean it .
1	In one line by itself was an announcement of the first night of a new melodrama ; in another line by itself was an announcement of the last six nights of an old one ; a third line was devoted to the re-engagement of the unrivalled <NAME> Knife-swallower , who had kindly suffered himself to be prevailed upon to forego his country engagements for one week longer ; a fourth line announced that <NAME> , having recovered from his late severe indisposition , would have the honour of appearing that evening ; a fifth line said that there were ' <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> ! ' every night ; a sixth , that that was positively the last appearance of <NAME> of <NAME> .
1	Having a decided objection to his master ' s being there at all , <NAME> appeared to consider it a high moral duty not to appear too much pleased with anything that was done , said , suggested , or proposed .
1	What did you do then ?
1	No effort had been made to clean the room -- it seemed in its nature almost hopeless of being clean ; but the small waxen form from which so much solemnity diffused itself had been composed afresh , and washed , and neatly dressed in some fragments of white linen ; and on my handkerchief , which still covered the poor baby , a little bunch of sweet herbs had been laid by the same rough , scarred hands , so lightly , so tenderly !
1	' You ' re wery right , old friend , ' said <NAME> ; ' I _do_ mean arternoon .
1	There was <NAME> junior , also from the <NAME> Office , leaving the Tonnage of the country , which he was somehow supposed to take under his protection , to look after itself , and , sooth to say , not at all impairing the efficiency of its protection by leaving it alone .
1	" If it is not being troublesome , " said we .
1	My partner. ' Saying something apologetically as he crossed the hall , to the effect that at that time of night they were not in the habit of receiving any one , and were always shut up , Mr <NAME> led the way into his own office , which presented a sufficiently business-like appearance .
1	To be sure , the better and profounder part of her character was not within his scope of perception ; for in natures , as in seas , depth answers unto depth ; but he soon began to read the rest with a student ' s eye .
1	If I hadn ' t been upon my guard , I am convinced she would have had my blood. ' ' I think the better of her for it , ' said I , indignantly .
1	' My friend and partner , Mr Venus , gives me to understand , ' remarked that man of might , addressing him , ' that you are aware of our power over you .
1	Of whom ? ' ' Of any one you have lately seen and made angry. ' He snapped his fingers and laughed .
1	Never , never ! ' One minute we are here ' -- holding his tumbler before his eyes -- ' the next we are there ' -- gulping down its contents , and striking himself emphatically a little below the chest -- ' in the silent tomb .
1	They were in three parties ; of whom the first , as the most numerous and important , was the slowest , and had been overtaken by one of the others on the way up .
1	' Oh , you prodigal old son !
1	<NAME> was as easy as ever ; but perhaps , as she sat with her eyes cast down , it might have been rather more perceptible that his attention was concentrated upon her for certain moments , than its concentration upon any subject for any short time ever was , elsewhere .
1	" Yet , <NAME> , " said I , looking round , " I miss something , surely , that I am accustomed to ? "
1	' I always like to hear a good argument , ' continued the bagman , ' a sharp one , like this : it ' s very improving ; but this little argument about women brought to my mind a story I have heard an old uncle of mine tell , the recollection of which , just now , made me say there were rummer things than women to be met with , sometimes. ' ' I should like to hear that same story , ' said the red-faced man with the cigar .
1	To think that I should see him at last , and you should be able to know that I have told you the truth ! '
1	<NAME> , do go away , for I am afraid of you .
1	that has it , ' replied <NAME> , ' and ready iced too .
1	<NAME> , what will it be ? "
1	' Upon my soul and body ! ' said Mr Toots , taking his seat beside her .
1	As if it wasn ' t meat and drink to you ! ' At these latter words the girl shivered again , and for a moment paused in her rowing , seeming to turn deadly faint .
1	Mrs <NAME> crossed the hall , feeling its pavement cold to her stockingless feet , and peeped in between the rusty hinges on the door , which stood a little open .
1	Little <NAME> , with a piercing cry , held her back .
1	He stared at her with a fearful look , and after a while his lips began to form some words , though no sound proceeded from them .
1	But even the <NAME> emigrated from <NAME> ; our country is not unknown to <NAME> , the apostle of <NAME> , or to his benighted disciples ; I have beheld religious scenes myself in some of our populous towns which can hardly be surpassed by an <NAME> camp-meeting ; and I am not aware that any instance of superstitious imposture on the one hand , and superstitious credulity on the other , has had its origin in the <NAME> , which we can not more than parallel by the precedents of Mrs. Southcote , <NAME> the rabbit-breeder , or even <NAME> of <NAME> : which latter case arose , some time after the dark ages had passed away .
1	Could it be , she asked herself with starting tears , that her own dear mother had been made unhappy by such treatment , and had pined away and died ?
1	' I ' m sure I heard you say as much , my dear , ' retorted <NAME> in his cold sarcastic manner .
1	I beg and pray that I may stay with you !
1	The strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place , and <NAME> went .
1	Then I told how that I was on my way to seek my niece , and they told me what manner of gentlefolks was in the house , and I waited to see any as seemed like her , going in or out .
1	Comes here every Sunday when they are at home. ' ' An artist , I infer from what he says ? ' ' A sort of a one , ' said <NAME> , in a surly tone .
1	After holding her to his breast with a passionate cry , he took up his bundle and darted out at the door , with an arm across his eyes .
1	I had no idea how he employed his time in the interval , beyond a general knowledge that he was very popular in the place , and had twenty means of actively diverting himself where another man might not have found one .
1	And my child is a troublesome bad child , and costs me a world of scolding .
1	It would have been better , under any circumstances , to have gone on !
1	' Have you no feeling , that you keep her out in the cruel streets at such a time as this ?
1	" I have never borne to look upon them since , and now I blame myself for my weakness .
1	The <NAME> stopped beside one little knot of business men .
1	Do I care for this girl , except as your friend ?
1	At our own door , I found little <NAME> coming home from a little party escorted by her little lover ; and I envied her little lover , in spite of his being subject to <NAME> .
1	I think she gave it him .
1	It seemed to be all old nooks and corners ; and in every nook and corner there was some queer little table , or cupboard , or bookcase , or seat , or something or other , that made me think there was not such another good corner in the room ; until I looked at the next one , and found it equal to it , if not better .
1	Get up , and sit in your chair .
1	Again and again he listened for the sound of wheels behind .
1	' Why are you tearing about the streets , ' said <NAME> , ' in this improper manner ? ' ' I was—I was run after , sir , ' the girl panted , ' and I wanted to get away. ' ' Run after ? ' repeated <NAME> .
1	There is the desolation of my heart and my soul .
1	' My love , ' said <NAME> , ' you professed yourself very fond of <NAME> Fitz-Marshall .
1	In her furred travelling-dress , <NAME> seemed more delicately beautiful than she had ever seemed yet , even in my eyes .
1	" What ' s your motive ? " ' ' Exactly. ' ' Motive , ' said <NAME> , ' good .
1	In the waste-yard outside , the steam from the escape pipe , the litter of barrels and old iron , the shining heaps of coals , the ashes everywhere , were shrouded in a veil of mist and rain .
1	I examined the place , and the body , and the papers , and everything .
1	<NAME> , eh ? ' <NAME> took out his pocketbook and made a note of it .
1	I noticed that after the funeral <NAME> changed his clothes so far , as to make a compromise between his Sunday dress and working dress ; in which the dear fellow looked natural , and like the Man he was .
1	' And why not ? ' retorted <NAME> .
1	' What will you take to go out ? ' I beg your pardon , ' replied <NAME> .
1	This attack , my dear Mortimer ; this murder -- ' His friend leaned over him with renewed attention , saying : ' You and I suspect some one. ' ' More than suspect .
1	She steeped a piece of linen in a basin , into which she poured some liquid from a bottle , and laid it with a gentle hand upon the sore .
1	' What should you say this was ? ' demanded Mr Swiveller .
1	We were very gay and sociable , and I asked him , in the course of conversation , what he was ?
1	I ' m going to paint her gravely , one of these days , if she ' s good. ' The air of leisurely patronage and indifference with which this is said , as the speaker throws himself back in a chair and clasps his hands at the back of his head , as a rest for it , is very exasperating to the excitable and excited Neville .
1	I don ' t appear in the business , neither do you .
1	<NAME> Guppy sitting on the window-sill , nodding his head and balancing all these possibilities in his mind , continues thoughtfully to tap it , and clasp it , and measure it with his hand , until he hastily draws his hand away .
1	She felt it with a mother 's anguish to be a move in the <NAME> direction , well knowing that <NAME> had that general impression of an aptitude for any art to which smoke and a tall chimney might be considered essential .
1	But I should say their cook at the <NAME> wanted a little looking after .
1	And I observed , with great surprise , that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he were lost in amazement .
1	They know what a clever madman I have been , and they are proud to have me here , to show .
1	It has not done me much good. ' ' Nothing -- whatever it is -- seems to have done anybody much good who comes here , ' she returned in all simplicity ; ' but I want to learn just the same. ' ' I am afraid you are so weak , you see , ' the milliner objected .
1	At length that low roar of many voices ran through the crowd which usually announces the arrival of whatever they have been waiting for .
1	' Perhaps you gentlemen might like a bottle ? ' The answer being By all means , <NAME> received his instructions from Mr Inspector , and departed in a becoming state of alacrity engendered by reverence for the majesty of the law .
1	I felt that no one -- mother , sister , wife -- could honour him more than I. I did , indeed !
1	Ladies who have a passion for attending lectures are to be found among all classes and all conditions .
1	After a little hesitation he opened the window , and demanded who it was .
1	She had no time to lose , but must get ready at once .
1	They change with the wandering fancy ; assume the semblance of things left far away ; put on the well-remembered aspect of favourite places dearly loved ; and even people them with shadows .
1	" This is a sorrowful case , " said my guardian after asking him a question or two and touching him and examining his eyes .
1	This person , " the other bearer , " we engaged in the street outside for a pint of beer .
1	'Am I to go with you ? '
1	Now , you know the pains and penalties you are liable to , and so I need not dilate upon them , but I have a proposal to make to you .
1	The rooks were sailing about the cathedral towers ; and the towers themselves , overlooking many a long unaltered mile of the rich country and its pleasant streams , were cutting the bright morning air , as if there were no such thing as change on earth .
1	" How long have you known it ? "
1	" Never mind what I make it , my friend , " observed <NAME> , with a knowing and contradictory toss of his head .
1	The old gentleman having exhausted his powers of persuasion , alighted to lead him ; whereupon the pony , perhaps because he held this to be a sufficient concession , perhaps because he happened to catch sight of the other brass-plate , or perhaps because he was in a spiteful humour , darted off with the old lady and stopped at the right house , leaving the old gentleman to come panting on behind .
1	<NAME> thinks half so bad of me as my own father does .
1	The boy sprung up , stroked his face with his hand , and threw his wasted arms round his neck , crying out that he was his dear kind friend .
1	away at a gallop over the black landscape ; dust and dirt flying like spray , the smoking horses snorting and plunging as if each of them were ridden by a demon , away in a frantic triumph on the dark road -- whither ?
1	Mrs Sparkler , looking at herself in her mourning , was even tired of that view : though , naturally , not so tired of that as of the other two .
1	Not within my hearing , that is to say . "
1	After which the six-footer comes into action and is much admired .
1	First to wake them , and next to tell them , all so wild and breathless as she was , what had brought her there , were difficulties ; but they no sooner understood her than their spirits were on fire like hers .
1	She clung round my neck , calling me by every dear name she could think of and saying what should she do without me !
1	In reply to this incoherent questioning , the old man informed the deeply affected sister that <NAME> had been taken ill in the office , and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to have been committed by another boy , not in custody ; and that the prosecutor had carried him away , in an insensible condition , to his own residence : of and concerning which , all the informant knew was , that it was somewhere in <NAME> , he having heard that word mentioned in the directions to the coachman .
1	But he had his reward .
1	' <NAME> ' t tell me you did .
1	" -- Had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good many people go , not always in gratification of their own inclinations , and not quite irrespective of the government expense -- " In watching his face , I made quite a firework of the <NAME> 's sausage , and greatly discomposed both my own attention and <NAME> 's ; for which I apologized .
1	" Grey-headed , " as he said , " and fast growing greyer. " But generous , and frank , and good , I am sure. ' ' And only seen once , <NAME> ? ' ' In this room only once , ' said his sister , with the slightest and most transient glow upon her cheek ; ' but when here , he entreated me to suffer him to see me once a week as he passed by , in token of our being well , and continuing to need nothing at his hands .
1	At length , not coming out of her distraught state by degrees , but in an instant , <NAME> said , " Let me see you two play cards ; why have you not begun ? " With that , we returned to her room , and sat down as before ; I was beggared , as before ; and again , as before , <NAME> watched us all the time , directed my attention to <NAME> 's beauty , and made me notice it the more by trying her jewels on <NAME> 's breast and hair .
1	' All night long , ' pursued the other , hurriedly , ' I had dreams of him -- and yet I didn ' t sleep -- in his blood .
1	She bent over him softly , kissed him , and came to the table .
1	It ' s here and there , and -- and , in short , it ' s as good as nowhere , ' said the old man , looking in bewilderment about him .
1	You a hold upon me !
1	Therefore , after vainly endeavouring to convince his reason by shakes , pokes , bawlings-out , and similar applications to his head , she led him into the air , and tried another method ; which was manifested to the marriage party by a quick succession of sharp sounds , resembling applause , and subsequently , by their seeing <NAME> in contact with the coolest paving-stone in the court , greatly flushed , and loudly lamenting .
1	' -- To be crammed , sir , ' repeated <NAME> .
1	'Ca n't I be supposed to feel -- _I_ as brought him up porochially -- when I see him a-setting here among ladies and gentlemen of the very affablest description !
1	<NAME> , who had been asleep too , staggered up at the noise I made , and in an instant I saw his jackknife shining in his hand .
1	What is there that any woman couldn ' t do , that she shouldn ' t do -- especially on the subject of another woman ' s good looks ? ' I really thought it was all over with <NAME> , after he had uttered this libellous pleasantry .
1	Others had sold their clothes to raise the passage-money , and had hardly rags to cover them ; others had no food , and lived upon the charity of the rest : and one man , it was discovered nearly at the end of the voyage , not before—for he kept his secret close , and did not court compassion—had had no sustenance whatever but the bones and scraps of fat he took from the plates used in the after-cabin dinner , when they were put out to be washed .
1	I didn ' t mean any harm indeed , upon my word I didn ' t , ' cried the small servant , struggling like a much larger one .
1	But he was very penitent indeed , and in a peculiar way -- not in the lump , but by instalments .
1	In some old time -- for even change was old in that old place -- a wooden partition had been constructed in one part of the chamber to form a sleeping-closet , into which the light was admitted at the same period by a rude window , or rather niche , cut in the solid wall .
1	Outer doors of chambers are shut up by the score , messages and parcels are to be left at the <NAME> 's Lodge by the bushel .
1	' May I be allowed , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , turning his white teeth on Mrs <NAME> like a light -- ' a lady of your excellent sense and quick feeling will give me credit , for good reason , I am sure -- to address what I have to say , to Mrs Dombey , and to leave her to impart it to you who are her best and dearest friend -- next to Mr Dombey ? ' Mrs <NAME> would have retired , but <NAME> stopped her .
1	That from what has been stated to me , sir , I assert that you were by no means justified in attempting to force your sister ' s inclinations as you did , and that you should rather have endeavoured by your kindness and forbearance to have supplied the place of other nearer relations whom she had never known , from a child .
1	' And it shows what notice father takes , though at his time of life , that he says to me this afternoon , which <NAME> <NAME> knows I neither make it up nor any ways enlarge , " Mary , it ' s much to be rejoiced in that <NAME> is not on the spot to behold it. " Those were father ' s words .
1	He had resumed his listening attitude , and looked intently at his questioner while the demand was made ; but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it , and then he only muttered that he was an old man -- an old man -- and so , dropping into a whisper , was silent again .
1	Still , " returned the gentleman , " I wish I could say they were not . "
1	Therefore , when the breakfast was done and cleared away , and he and the Doctor were left together , <NAME> said , feelingly : " My dear <NAME> , I am anxious to have your opinion , in confidence , on a very curious case in which I am deeply interested ; that is to say , it is very curious to me ; perhaps , to your better information it may be less so. " Glancing at his hands , which were discoloured by his late work , the <NAME> looked troubled , and listened attentively .
1	Falling asleep , and leaving great blocks of building materials dangling in the air ; waking again , to resume work and get them into their places .
1	But he watched her too ; and he saw that this indication of a knowledge on his part , of something that had passed between herself and her husband , rankled and smarted in her haughty breast , like a poisoned arrow .
1	But he is denounced -- and gravely -- by the <NAME> and <NAME> .
1	There was a bell on board ; and as the ship rolled and dashed , like a desperate creature driven mad , now showing us the whole sweep of her deck , as she turned on her beam-ends towards the shore , now nothing but her keel , as she sprung wildly over and turned towards the sea , the bell rang ; and its sound , the knell of those unhappy men , was borne towards us on the wind .
1	<NAME> -- very queer ! ' After pondering deeply and with a face of exceeding wisdom for some time , Mr <NAME> drank some more of the beer , and summoning a small boy who had been watching his proceedings , poured forth the few remaining drops as a libation on the gravel , and bade him carry the empty vessel to the bar with his compliments , and above all things to lead a sober and temperate life , and abstain from all intoxicating and exciting liquors .
1	It is accomplished at last , and he proceeds alone in quest of his adviser .
1	' Yes , ma ' am , ' replied <NAME> , colouring deeply , for the young ladies had collected about her , and she was the centre on which all eyes were fixed .
1	But bearing in mind that them were which I meantersay of a stunning and outdacious sort , -- alluding to them which bordered on weal-cutlets and dog-fighting , -- a sincere well-wisher would adwise , <NAME> , their being dropped into your meditations , when you go upstairs to bed .
1	And what ' s this with a clarionet ?
1	' Will she call me " <NAME> " ? ' cried <NAME> .
1	" And now undo my bundle , <NAME> , " said the first woman .
1	' Not if your wish is gratified , ' replied <NAME> .
1	<NAME> ' t he smell of spirits , <NAME> ? ' ' Horrid , your Wash-up , ' replied <NAME> , who had a vague impression that there was a smell of rum somewhere .
1	' <NAME> ' s to the brim too .
1	Mr <NAME> was well to do , and stood very high in Mr Podsnap ' s opinion .
1	You have been in every line I have ever read since I first came here , the rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then .
1	On the brow of <NAME> , <NAME> and his brother <NAME> had set some marks , as on a tree that was to come down in good time -- remorseless twins they are for striding through their human forests , notching as they go -- while the countenance of <NAME> was crossed with a thousand little creases , which the same deceitful Time would take delight in smoothing out and wearing away with the flat part of his scythe , as a preparation of the surface for his deeper operations .
1	' I ask you again , ' thundered the doctor , 'are you , on your solemn oaths , able to identify that boy ? '
1	' And as a matter of form , which will be agreeable to your own feelings , before we go out ( for I ' ll walk with you part of the way , though my leg gives under me with weariness ) , let ' s have a look at the stock in trade. ' Mr <NAME> produced it , and it was perfectly correct ; Mr Venus undertook to produce it again in the morning , and to keep tryst with Mr Wegg on <NAME> ' s doorstep as the clock struck ten .
1	' Yes , I did , Sir. ' ' What do you think of it , <NAME> ? ' ' Think of it , <NAME> ? ' ' Yes .
1	Otherwise the staid old house was , as to its cleanliness and order , still just as it had been when I first saw it .
1	' Remember my words , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' and be thankful that <NAME> is not too fond of you .
1	After a short absence ( during which he could be heard to speak in a softened soothing tone ) he returned , bearing in his hand a lamp .
1	'You will see them directly , and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and well . '
1	I knew as well , when I saw my mother ' s head lean down upon his shoulder , and her arm touch his neck -- I knew as well that he could mould her pliant nature into any form he chose , as I know , now , that he did it .
1	thinks the trooper as he follows .
1	I am already quite an old bachelor. " <NAME> looked down at her child , and put its little hand to her lips , and then put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it into mine .
1	' He was only called the other day .
1	Does he see a ghost , or hear an organ ?
1	' Are you going home ? ' he said .
1	I came to think that the <NAME> was walled up before me , that the energy and action of my life were at an end , that I never could find any refuge but in the grave .
1	She began with sorrowful unwillingness to acknowledge to herself that she was not strong enough to keep off the fear that no space in the life of man could overcome that quarter of a century behind the prison bars .
1	M ' Choakumchild reported that she had a very dense head for figures ; that , once possessed with a general idea of the globe , she took the smallest conceivable interest in its exact measurements ; that she was extremely slow in the acquisition of dates , unless some pitiful incident happened to be connected therewith ; that she would burst into tears on being required ( by the mental process ) immediately to name the cost of two hundred and forty-seven muslin caps at fourteen-pence halfpenny ; that she was as low down , in the school , as low could be ; that after eight weeks of induction into the elements of <NAME> , she had only yesterday been set right by a prattler three feet high , for returning to the question , ' What is the first principle of this science ? ' the absurd answer , ' To do unto others as I would that they should do unto me. ' <NAME> observed , shaking his head , that all this was very bad ; that it showed the necessity of infinite grinding at the mill of knowledge , as per system , schedule , blue book , report , and tabular statements A to <NAME> ; and that <NAME> ' must be kept to it. ' So <NAME> was kept to it , and became low-spirited , but no wiser .
1	It was upon this occasion that <NAME> , seated on the top of his throne in full council , rose , in the exuberance of his feelings , and commanded the lord chief justice to order in the richest wines and the court minstrels -- an act of graciousness which has been , through the ignorance of traditionary historians , attributed to King Cole , in those celebrated lines in which his Majesty is represented as Calling for his pipe , and calling for his pot , And calling for his fiddlers three .
1	Gradually , he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent suffering alone imparts ; that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain to wake from .
1	That 's very pleasant , you know !
1	But I want to keep you in attendance .
1	It was all the same to him .
1	' A pet name , sir , ' he explained again .
1	Every feeling of sympathy for her forlorn condition , and of admiration for her heroism and fortitude , aggravated the indignation which shook him in every limb , and swelled his heart almost to bursting .
1	But try over and over again , nevertheless .
1	As <NAME> walked on , and the voice drew nearer , he found it proceeded from a small boy , who was hurrying along , to join one of the little parties in the old street , and who , partly to keep himself company , and partly to prepare himself for the occasion , was shouting out the song at the highest pitch of his lungs .
1	Transportation or the gallows for anybody who shall touch the property ! "
1	<NAME> and red-eyed , his hopes plainly had deserted him , his sanguine mood was gone , and all his worst misgivings had come back .
1	' If I felt less , I could do more .
1	" This has been without prejudice ? "
1	Because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful to him , and a station that was distasteful to him , and had left his country -- he submitted before the word emigrant in the present acceptation by the <NAME> was in use -- to live by his own industry in <NAME> , rather than on the industry of the overladen people of <NAME> .
1	cried the new comer , breathless with haste .
1	' I want to speak to you , who spoke to me this morning , ' said <NAME> , pointing out with his finger the man whom he addressed .
1	' This is <NAME> , sir. ' ' I came , ' said <NAME> , rising , ' to beg the favour of a little conversation with you on the subject of the <NAME> family. ' Plornish became suspicious .
1	This the <NAME> , in a moment of uncommon conviviality , had confided to <NAME> and his Uncle , between the repetitions of lovely Peg , on the night when <NAME> the broker was paid out .
1	They are generally of opinion that it will be shorn of some of its emoluments , and made uncomfortable by newly-devised checks and restrictions ; and those who are beyond all hope of it are quite sure they would rather not have it , and don ' t at all envy the person for whom it may prove to be reserved .
1	Judge for yourself whether any other admirer shall love you and live , whose life is in my hand. ' ' What do you mean , sir ? ' ' I mean to show you how mad my love is .
1	Whatever he may think of it , he ought certainly to know it. " Would you mind coming into the carriage ? ' Mr <NAME> answered , ' Not at all , ' and took his seat at <NAME> ' s side .
1	<NAME> must be careful. ' ' How do you mean ? ' inquired <NAME> .
1	At length , the <NAME> clock chiming one quarter , with a rapid turn he hurries in .
1	<NAME> <NAME> might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence of happiness into the short space of eight weeks ; but the sigh -- there was a vast deal of meaning in the sigh .
1	So do I. I take it that my business in the social system is to be agreeable ; I take it that everybody 's business in the social system is to be agreeable .
1	The fact is , he had been originally jobbed out by the day , and he never quite got over his old habits .
1	Another pause of oblivion , and he awoke in the sombre morning , unconscious where he was or what had happened , until it flashed upon his mind , " this is the day of my death ! " Thus , had he come through the hours , to the day when the fifty-two heads were to fall .
1	I have taken to the sofa with my staylace cut , and have lain there hours insensible , with my head over the side , and my hair all down , and my feet I do n't know where -- " ( " Much higher than your head , my love , " said Mr .
1	But now he was ill at ease about her .
1	<NAME> <NAME> has received him there these several evenings past to know whether he has anything to report .
1	I opened my eyes in the night , and I saw , in the great chair at the bedside , <NAME> .
1	As she neared it , she turned , and withdrew her eyes from my face .
1	-- do n't be ashamed still to confide in me , for there will be nothing monstrous or uncommon in it .
1	" What ' s that ? " he said to me .
1	It is naturally painful to us ; for we can ' t like you , you know , <NAME> , as well as we could wish. ' She touched the child upon a tender point .
1	I canna be expecten to ' t .
1	It is in <NAME> , but not of it .
1	He has a most romantic heart , Mrs. Nickleby , as indeed -- hem -- as indeed all our family have , and the disappointment was a dreadful blow .
1	" Yes , yes , " says the good old gentleman , reverting to his lesson of wisdom .
1	It was a fine morning , and it occurred to <NAME> that a pint of porter in the open air would lighten his next quarter of an hour or so , as well as any little amusement in which he could indulge .
1	There were dull pigs too , turning up the ground in search of dainty food , and grunting their monotonous grumblings as they prowled about , or crossed each other in their quest ; plump pigeons skimming round the roof or strutting on the eaves ; and ducks and geese , far more graceful in their own conceit , waddling awkwardly about the edges of the pond or sailing glibly on its surface .
1	' That , ' replied <NAME> , ' that , I think , can be got over. ' ' But the salary is so small , and it is such a long way off , uncle ! ' faltered <NAME> .
1	What IS the move , <NAME> ? ' ' Are you almost ready for breakfast , <NAME> ? ' ' You can pour it out .
1	There ! ' Here <NAME> burst into tears .
1	We expressed our acknowledgments and sat down behind the door , where there was a lame invalid of a sofa .
1	The man against the child , for a bag of gold ! '
1	replied the voice of the <NAME> , through the key-hole .
1	Sometimes I hope , my dear , and sometimes I -- do n't quite despair , but nearly .
1	' This here little Em ' ly of ours , ' said <NAME> , ' has been , in our house , what I suppose ( I ' m a ignorant man , but that ' s my belief ) no one but a little bright-eyed creetur can be in a house .
1	Her fears for <NAME> would have been more powerful inducements to recoil while there was yet time ; but she had stipulated that her secret should be rigidly kept , she had dropped no clue which could lead to his discovery , she had refused , even for his sake , a refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses her -- and what more could she do !
1	<NAME> go on to something else besides our having no nonsense about us. ' ' Yes , my love , ' said Mr Sparkler .
1	Remembering the old man ' s curious manner , and the farewell he had taken of him ; unaccountably fervent at the time , but quite intelligible now : a terrible apprehension strengthened on the <NAME> , that , overpowered by his anxieties and regrets for <NAME> , he had been driven to commit suicide .
1	' If you ' re afraid of the fox , ' said <NAME> , ' you may dismiss all present expectations of seeing that animal .
1	Almost as dull as the infernal old jail .
1	Without mentioning any names or going into any details , I gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybody -- <NAME> , <NAME> , or <NAME> -- being about the chambers , or about the immediate neighborhood , he had better get <NAME> , <NAME> , or <NAME> out of the way while you were out of the way. " " He would be greatly puzzled what to do ? " " He was puzzled what to do ; not the less , because I gave him my opinion that it was not safe to try to get <NAME> , <NAME> , or <NAME> too far out of the way at present .
1	All the better for her !
1	Besides , <NAME> , I 'm here , because I 've meant it by you , years and years .
1	' And what about the cash , my existence ' s jewel ? ' said <NAME> , when these endearments ceased .
1	I would n't go free , now , if you was to fall down on your knees and ask me .
1	He will write to her every alternate day , and tell her all his adventures .
1	The coach was in the yard , shining very much all over , but without any horses to it as yet ; and it looked in that state as if nothing was more unlikely than its ever going to <NAME> .
1	Do you take any interest in writing people , or in painting or sculpturing people , or in acting people , or in anything of that sort ? ' Possibly the patient answered yes , and mentioned somebody , of whom <NAME> had no more personal knowledge than of Ptolemy the <NAME> .
1	I try it with these details , and I see them all , in this my cell in the <NAME> , near the close of the tenth year of my captivity , as I saw them all that night .
1	' We meet and part to-night , ' she said .
1	It is a great privilege .
1	<NAME> suspicion may exist without that connexion . "
1	At that moment , <NAME> ( of course , the woman with the apron ) dropped the candlestick she held , and cried out , ' There !
1	After that , I observed that <NAME> and <NAME> , who had hitherto been very distant , entered into a defensive alliance against us , the common enemy , and exchanged a mysterious dialogue across the table for our defeat and overthrow .
1	' Who is that ? ' ' Only me , sir , ' replied the voice .
1	These motions , although unquestionably of the greatest assistance to original composition , retard in some degree the progress of the writer ; and <NAME> had unconsciously been a full hour and a half writing words in small text , smearing out wrong letters with his little finger , and putting in new ones which required going over very often to render them visible through the old blots , when he was roused by the opening of the door and the entrance of his parent .
1	Then , I got up and partly dressed , and sat at the window to take a last look out , and in taking it fell asleep .
1	And here it may be observed , that <NAME> was not , in the ordinary sense of the word , a young man of high spirit .
1	My convict never looked at me , except that once .
1	<NAME> , love , I am telling <NAME> that he never saw you abroad. ' ' No such luck , sir , ' said <NAME> .
1	Notwithstanding that its walls were blotched , as if missionary maps were bursting out of them to impart geographical knowledge ; notwithstanding that its weird furniture was forlornly faded and musty , and that the prevailing <NAME> odour of bilge water and an ebb tide on a weedy shore was very strong ; the place was better within , than it promised .
1	' You have delivered the little parcel I gave you for your old landlord , <NAME> ? ' ' I have , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> .
1	Taking the furniture with them , of course ?
1	My fellow-citizen here would have it forty-two ; ten more heads are worth having .
1	I ' m not indeed , ' said <NAME> .
1	' No , thank you , ' said Mr Merdle , ' I don ' t feel inclined for it .
1	How they came there , or how long they had been there , <NAME> didn ' t know ; but when he saw them , he sat up in bed , and answered all the <NAME> ' s questions at full length , and whispered to him that <NAME> was not to know anything about it , if he pleased , and that he had set his mind upon her coming to the party .
1	All his widowed mother could spare had been spent in qualifying him for his profession .
1	I shall accompany you. ' ' You ! ' said <NAME> .
1	' And how do YOU like the law ? ' ' A -- not particularly , ' returned <NAME> .
1	But you have given me such a specimen of both , that I should be a fit subject for both if I remained silent respecting them .
1	Chokings and nervous jerkings , however , are nothing new to me when I think with anxiety of those I love .
1	" So you kept him after all ? "
1	This sum , Mr Clennam would be happy to learn , he had , through the promptitude of several friends who had a lively confidence in his probity , already raised , with the exception of a trifling balance of one pound seventeen and fourpence ; the loan of which balance , for the period of one month , would be fraught with the usual beneficent consequences .
1	<NAME> , if you wish to be carried downstairs -- " " In a moment , my dear friend , in a moment .
1	Squeers , ' said the waiter , looking in at this juncture ; ' here ' s a gentleman asking for you at the bar. ' ' Show the gentleman in , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , in a soft voice .
1	' How dare you presume to speak to me , sir -- to address me -- to come into my presence ? ' ' You look prettier in a passion , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , stooping down , the better to see her face .
1	The new flower sprang from the deep-planted and long-cherished root , she knew .
1	Suppose my conscience -- ' ' And we know what a conscience it is , my soul .
1	At last I ran away myself , whenever I saw an emissary of the police approaching with some new intelligence ; and lived a stealthy life until he was tried and ordered to be transported .
1	I had not meant that , and was rather taken by surprise .
1	Seven-and-sixpence to me , old Isaac .
1	<NAME> person singular , I do not care ; second person singular , thou dost not care ; third person singular , she does not care , ' returned <NAME> .
1	So , with people lounging and lying wherever shade was , with but little hum of tongues or barking of dogs , with occasional jangling of discordant church bells and rattling of vicious drums , <NAME> , a fact to be strongly smelt and tasted , lay broiling in the sun one day .
1	Mr <NAME> ' s cook , who generally takes the lead in society , has said , it is impossible to settle down after this , and why not go , in a party , to the play ?
1	Now it has been one of my duties of late to pay Flite a certain weekly allowance , deducting from it the amount of her weekly rent , which I have paid ( in consequence of instructions I have received ) to Krook himself , regularly in her presence .
1	<NAME> , <NAME> , aw a muddle !
1	As I serve my gun that day , I resolve , when the place shall fall , to examine that cell .
1	Apart from the realities of this most picturesque city , there are associations clustering about it which would make a desert rich in interest .
1	I saw her , not a minute before you came up , pass in at that door. ' The old man looked at him attentively .
1	She died when I was born .
1	I didn ' t dare to warn him , and advise him ; but if I had seen direct cause , I would have shown him my example .
1	There was the widow before him , bouncing bodily here and there , with unwonted vigour ; and <NAME> hopping about , with a face expressive of the most intense solemnity , dancing ( as a good many people do ) as if a quadrille were not a thing to be laughed at , but a severe trial to the feelings , which it requires inflexible resolution to encounter .
1	' Perhaps a little damp and ague-ish ? ' said <NAME> .
1	The two days became three , and the three days became four .
1	With that hospitable invitation , the <NAME> said ' Good day ! ' and walked out and shut the door ; leaving Mr Carker still reclining against the chimney-piece .
1	<NAME> <NAME> then seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony ; and all three were quickly inside the house .
1	The old gentleman paused ; <NAME> was biting his lips , with his eyes fixed upon the floor ; seeing this , he immediately resumed : 'The end of a year found him contracted , solemnly contracted , to that daughter ; the object of the first , true , ardent , only passion of a guileless girl . '
1	<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , what you 've trusted to me I 'll go through with .
1	She derives so much satisfaction from the pursuit , that she enters on it regularly from that time ; and brings daily in her little basket , various choice condiments selected from the scanty stores of the deceased owner of the powdered head and pigtail .
1	We must both die ; we are both connected with the dead already , each by a little child .
1	Near London. ' ' Mine , perhaps you recollect , ' said <NAME> , with a serious look , ' lives down in <NAME> -- one of ten .
1	' By-the-bye , I HAVE thought of somebody too .
1	Devise your own means of putting him out of my way , and execute them .
1	Let some one hold him back .
1	' Because his brother was a little eccentric -- though he is not half so eccentric as a good many people -- he didn ' t like to have him visible about his house , and sent him away to some private asylum-place : though he had been left to his particular care by their deceased father , who thought him almost a natural .
1	<NAME> was very glad to see me , and told me that the house had not been like itself since I had left it .
1	I am far from feeling convinced now , however differently I might have felt only this time yesterday , that I am fit for the trust you repose in me ; that I know how to respond to the appeal you have come home to make to me ; that I have the right instinct—supposing it for the moment to be some quality of that nature—how to help you , and to set you right , my child. ' She had turned upon her pillow , and lay with her face upon her arm , so that he could not see it .
1	You must follow him , Sam. ' ' <NAME> ' nly , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> .
1	Tied up all day with his disciplined show upon him , subdued to the performance of his routine of educational tricks , encircled by a gabbling crowd , he broke loose at night like an ill-tamed wild animal .
1	There was a flowery carpet on the floor ; but , instead of reaching to the fireside , its glowing vegetation stopped short at <NAME> ' s footstool , and gave place to a region of sand and sawdust .
1	' To pursue HIS way in quiet ! ' ' You will scarcely remain in my house , I presume , sir , against my will , ' said <NAME> ; ' or you can scarcely hope to make an impression upon a man who closes his ears to all that you can say , and is firmly and resolutely determined not to hear you. ' ' Mr .
1	'Forgive me for saying so , but I wish you had . '
1	<NAME> <NAME> had great experience in hackney cabs , and her starting in one was generally a work of time , as she was systematic in the preparatory arrangements .
1	The bell was ringing , and the <NAME> was a Serpent of many coils , and the <NAME> was getting ready .
1	" Oh , that 's not quite the worst of it , <NAME> dear ! "
1	Very faint and giddy. ' ' Are you in pain , dear mother ? ' ' I think there ' s a pain somewhere in the room , ' said Mrs. Gradgrind , ' but I couldn ' t positively say that I have got it. ' After this strange speech , she lay silent for some time .
1	Before the door , were three tall poplar trees , which made it very dark within ; and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail .
1	But I do not believe this .
1	Unless it was , I might not be bold enough to say it .
1	Mrs. Perkins , who has not been for some weeks on speaking terms with Mrs. Piper in consequence for an unpleasantness originating in young <NAME> ' having " fetched " young Piper " a crack , " renews her friendly intercourse on this auspicious occasion .
1	By degrees , old <NAME> , thus familiarized with the idea of his son 's marriage , had worked up his parental feelings to the height of contemplating that event as being near at hand and had given his gracious consent to the young couple commencing housekeeping at the academy in <NAME> Street when they would .
1	Yours have been of a much slighter kind , spread over a much shorter time .
1	Or she might be as ugly as she was rich , without any fear of losing me .
1	' You know all now , ' she said , raising her eyes to <NAME> ' s .
1	' Now , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , reappearing in the kitchen with some remains of a blush , ' you and <NAME> think magnificent me fit for nothing , but I intend to prove the contrary .
1	" It MUST be very good of Mrs. Jellyby to take such pains about a scheme for the benefit of natives -- and yet -- <NAME> and the housekeeping ! "
1	Every time this door was opened to let a party out , the next party made a violent rush to get in ; and , as in addition to the numerous dialogues which passed between the gentlemen who were waiting to see the judge , a variety of personal squabbles ensued between the greater part of those who had seen him , there was as much noise as could well be raised in an apartment of such confined dimensions .
1	<NAME> , ' said <NAME> to his old acquaintance , the hard-headed gentleman , ' a glass of wine ? ' ' With great satisfaction , <NAME> , ' replied the hard-headed gentleman solemnly .
1	Here , take hold of my hand , <NAME> .
1	Did they not , sir ? ' ' <NAME> , I don ' t know that they did , ' said Mr Boffin , curtly .
1	Hold the light. ' Mr Venus takes from a corner by his chair , the bones of a leg and foot , beautifully pure , and put together with exquisite neatness .
1	We asked him if he knew what was doing in it .
1	And he was so modest , too .
1	There was encouragement in seeing a ray of light from within , stealing through the dark stern doorway , and falling in a thread upon the marble floor .
1	Mrs <NAME> listened attentively , until she had finished .
1	' There was a criminal called <NAME> -- a girl still , but deserted and an outcast .
1	<NAME> ' t mention it , but it ' s the most extraordinary accidental likeness you ever saw -- her very portrait , sir ! ' By this time it was past eleven o ' clock ; and <NAME> ' s sister declaring that she ought to have been at home a full hour ago , a coach was procured , into which she was handed with great ceremony by brother Ned , while brother <NAME> imparted the fullest directions to the coachman , and besides paying the man a shilling over and above his fare , in order that he might take the utmost care of the lady , all but choked him with a glass of spirits of uncommon strength , and then nearly knocked all the breath out of his body in his energetic endeavours to knock it in again .
1	I call upon you , sir , therefore , to pint out the good .
1	' I have no brother , ' replied <NAME> .
1	'You should , lady , and I know you will , ' rejoined the girl , rising .
1	I trace the same current now , flowing through all his quiet and unobtrusive proceedings. -- I am about to sign my name , you observe , at the foot of the articles which Mr Chuckster will witness ; and placing my finger upon this blue wafer with the vandyked corners , I am constrained to remark in a distinct tone of voice -- don ' t be alarmed , ma ' am , it is merely a form of law -- that I deliver this , as my act and deed .
1	I can ' t do that , for I am a poor , timid , nervous creature .
1	I am not much used to parties ; but this is one of business , and such fooleries are an important part of it sometimes .
1	Upon this doubtful ground , lived Mrs. Wititterly , and at Mrs. Wititterly ' s door <NAME> knocked with trembling hand .
1	<NAME> to the bottom of the river rather than the surface , by reason of the slime and ooze with which it was covered , and its sodden state , this boat and the two figures in it obviously were doing something that they often did , and were seeking what they often sought .
1	In what , Mrs. Snagsby does not with particularity express , but she knows that <NAME> was <NAME> 's son , " as well as if a trumpet had spoken it , " and she followed <NAME> when he went on his last visit to the boy , and if he was not his son why did he go ?
1	The house is such a ruin that the rats have fled , and there is not one left .
1	<NAME> , steady. ' <NAME> planted himself into his own corner , as firmly as he could ; and on whirled the chaise faster than ever .
1	What is there in all this ?
1	The elder <NAME> shook his head , as he replied with a sigh , ' I ' ve done it once too often , <NAME> ; I ' ve done it once too often .
1	My poor , proud friends , have looked on and approved ; and every tie between us has been deadened in my breast .
1	But even <NAME> , with her loving face -- and if it had seemed innocent and trusting when I first saw it in that memorable November fog , how much more did it seem now when I knew her innocent and trusting heart -- even <NAME> shook her head at this and looked serious .
1	" You work hard , madame , " said a man near her .
1	If he comes back , and leaves the boy behind him ; if he gets off free , and dead or alive , fails to restore him to me ; murder him yourself if you would have him escape <NAME> .
1	Let it lie there , let it lie .
1	Now , there is a <NAME> urn erected in the centre of a lonely field ; now there is a woman weeping at a tomb ; now a very commonplace old gentleman in a white waistcoat , with a thumb thrust into each arm-hole of his coat ; now a student poring on a book ; now a crouching negro ; now , a horse , a dog , a cannon , an armed man ; a hunch-back throwing off his cloak and stepping forth into the light .
1	" The man who wrote this article , " he observes by way of preface , nodding at the fire as if he were nodding down at the man from a mount , " has a well-balanced mind . "
1	<NAME> name ? " " John. " " <NAME> , " repeated madame , after murmuring it once to herself .
1	I had thought about that , while we had been there side by side .
1	This eminent gentleman and Mr Merdle , seated diverse ways and with ruminating aspects on a yellow ottoman in the light of the fire , holding no verbal communication with each other , bore a strong general resemblance to the two cows in the <NAME> picture over against them .
1	An exploratory blackbeetle now and then was found immovable upon the stairs , or in an upper room , as wondering how he got there .
1	You didn ' t tell me , <NAME> , my dear , ' added Mrs. Nickleby , turning round with an air of less reserve than she had before assumed , ' what your friend ' s name is. ' ' His name , mother , ' replied <NAME> , ' is Smike. ' The effect of this communication was by no means anticipated ; but the name was no sooner pronounced , than Mrs. <NAME> dropped upon a chair , and burst into a fit of crying .
1	The <NAME> ! ' ' I am sure I am very much obliged , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> faintly , ' and take it very kind that you should remember my little ones. ' At the same time a vision of <NAME> as a <NAME> , with his very small legs encased in the serviceable clothing described by <NAME> , swam before <NAME> ' s eyes , and made them water .
1	You are engaged at three o'clock ; you are going to see the batch of to-day executed. -- You ? " The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer , who hurriedly replied in the affirmative : seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent of Republicans , and that he would be in effect the most desolate of Republicans , if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national barber .
1	Really when he used to come in of an evening , and ask <NAME> in his meek voice how she was , and then sit down with his head against the wall , and make no attempt to say anything more , I liked him very much .
1	All this , doubtless , he knew thoroughly , and had , in his cunning , considered well .
1	' The old story ; always thinking , and never doing .
1	' <NAME> ' t distress yourself on that account , ' said <NAME> ; ' if he had one grain of the delicacy of feeling which distinguishes you , humble as your station is , I should have some hopes of him. ' Job Trotter bowed low ; and in spite of <NAME> ' s previous remonstrance , the tears again rose to his eyes .
1	' My dear Ma , I particularise eight. ' ' The exact size of the table and the room , my dear. ' So it was settled that way : and when <NAME> called with his mother upon <NAME> , to arrange for the reception of <NAME> at the <NAME> ' <NAME> , the two other invitations having reference to that establishment were proffered and accepted .
1	<NAME> <NAME> adopted <NAME> as his son .
1	He refolds it and lays it in his desk with a countenance as unperturbable as death .
1	They had gone rustling away as if their little dresses were made of autumn-leaves : and they came rustling back , in like manner .
1	Upon that the <NAME> stopped to notice and admire them ; remembered with amazement that he had seen and spoken to them at his friend <NAME> ' s in <NAME> ' s <NAME> ; opined that <NAME> was a devilish fine fellow , and his own little friend ; inquired if he remembered <NAME> B. the <NAME> ; and finally , with a sudden recollection of the conventionalities of life , turned and apologised to Mr Dombey .
1	What do you see in me that causes you to -- ha -- concentrate your solicitude on me in that -- hum -- very particular manner ? ' ' I did not know it , father ; I beg your pardon .
1	The pastry-cook is hard at work in the funereal room in <NAME> , and the very tall young men are busy looking on .
1	The second letter , at that moment in <NAME> ' s breast-pocket , particularly remembered him by name .
1	I believe I was kept at home for that purpose .
1	I applied the key on hearing this and opened the door .
1	' I said to <NAME> ( not that it was necessary , for she would have thought it all for herself ) , we are practical people , my dear , and we know her story ; we see in this unhappy girl some reflection of what was raging in her mother ' s heart before ever such a creature as this poor thing was in the world ; we ' ll gloss her temper over , <NAME> , we won ' t notice it at present , my dear , we ' ll take advantage of some better disposition in her another time .
1	But , <NAME> mistaken on a point that has caused me more smart in my breast than a flight of savages ' arrows could have done !
1	' This is the hend , is it , of all my bearing with her deceitfulness , her lowness , her falseness , her laying herself out to catch the admiration of vulgar minds , in a way which made me blush for my -- for my -- ' ' Gender , ' suggested <NAME> , regarding the spectators with a malevolent eye -- literally A malevolent eye .
1	At the same time I know , as all men do or should , that the subject of <NAME> is one of the highest importance to any community ; and that in her sweeping reform and bright example to other countries on this head , <NAME> has shown great wisdom , great benevolence , and exalted policy .
1	" But your father and me were partners , <NAME> , " says the old gentleman , " and when I am gone , you and <NAME> will have all there is .
1	If he had retorted or openly exasperated me , it would have been a relief and a justification ; but he had put me on a slow fire , on which I lay tormented half the night .
1	And how can I pay ?
1	We danced for an hour with great gravity , the melancholy child doing wonders with his lower extremities , in which there appeared to be some sense of enjoyment though it never rose above his waist .
1	With the view of seeing if this were so , and , in any case , of bidding him good night , if he were yet sitting among his books , I turned back , and going softly across the hall , and gently opening the door , looked in .
1	" What are you talking of ? "
1	'You 're a-going to accommodate us , and wot 's to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so , in return ? '
1	And so quick were my thoughts , that I saw myself despised by unborn generations , -- <NAME> 's children , and their children , -- while the wretch 's words were yet on his lips .
1	If any true friend and well-wisher could make you a bankrupt , you would be a <NAME> ; but as a man of property you are a Demon ! ' After despatching this second bolt with a still greater expenditure of force , <NAME> laughed and cried still more .
1	What is this ? ' ' <NAME> , <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> timidly ; sensible of having approached the presence with too much familiarity .
1	I wish I was dead .
1	I was a boyish husband as to years .
1	Whether him as I have spoke so much of , chanced to see ' em going theer , or whether ( which is most like , to my thinking ) he had heerd it from the woman , I doen ' t greatly ask myself .
1	Though sometimes even they depart from me before a dread that arises when I look at <NAME> . "
1	I have understood that it was , to the last , her proudest boast , that she never had been on the water in her life , except upon a bridge ; and that over her tea ( to which she was extremely partial ) she , to the last , expressed her indignation at the impiety of mariners and others , who had the presumption to go ' meandering ' about the world .
1	' Ha ! ' said the <NAME> , leaning back in his chair with his hand in his breast .
1	Several players were stationed , to ' look out , ' in different parts of the field , and each fixed himself into the proper attitude by placing one hand on each knee , and stooping very much as if he were ' making a back ' for some beginner at leap-frog .
1	The Crisis of the <NAME> and its Result There are not many men who lie abed too late , or oversleep themselves , on their wedding morning .
1	Being compelled to emerge into the main road , his ill fortune brought him at last where a small party of boys , headed by a ferocious young butcher , were lying in wait for any means of pleasurable excitement that might happen .
1	In case you was to think it , ' said Mr Boffin , with a look of peculiar shrewdness , ' so honourably independent in you as to make it a relief to your mind , to make that furniture over to me in the light of a set-off against the quarter ' s rent , why ease your mind , ease your mind .
1	' " <NAME> much better , " he said at length , " to shun all such thoughts and chances , and , in the peaceful shelter of the church , devote your lives to Heaven !
1	That can scarcely be a high state of moral feeling which imagines a gentleman of repute and station , likely to be corrupted , in the discharge of his duty , by the present of a snuff-box , or a richly-mounted sword , or an <NAME> shawl ; and surely the Nation who reposes confidence in her appointed servants , is likely to be better served , than she who makes them the subject of such very mean and paltry suspicions .
1	' Humph ! ' she said , running her eyes over the child ' s slight figure , ' I don ' t see anything else -- except the shoes .
1	The way was purposely confused , no doubt .
1	It was a kind of festive occasion , and the parties were attired accordingly .
1	Having made sure of his watching me , I tempt him on , all over <NAME> .
1	<NAME> waited some little while before he spoke again .
1	I have had enough of arguing to last one man his life . "
1	When he had kept it so a little while , he said , drawing it back : " Is Lucie the topic ? " " She is. " " It is hard for me to speak of her at any time .
1	I am never mealy with ' em .
1	There was a scream as of an individual -- not a rook -- in corporal anguish .
1	I do not go with Mrs. Jellyby in her treatment of her young family .
1	But please to drive on -- quick , please !
1	However , that ' s neither here nor there , just now .
1	They went a little apart from the knot of people who had congregated about the coach , and fell upon each other ' s neck , and sobbed , and wept with joy .
1	'That 's the second , ' observed the woman with much deliberation .
1	The voice of the submissive man who had spoken , was flat and tame in its extreme submission .
1	' Left the house early this morning , without the slightest previous communication with me , ' replied <NAME> .
1	Is that so much that he deserves this praise ? "
1	Do you know what that tune is , Mr .
1	' It is , I suppose , that you have not heard a word of my complaint. ' ' Your complaint , <NAME> ? ' said Mr Merdle .
1	' But I am to give it to himself , if you please. ' The excessive audacity of this retort so overpowered Mr Chuckster , and so moved his tender regard for his friend ' s honour , that he declared , if he were not restrained by official considerations , he must certainly have annihilated <NAME> upon the spot ; a resentment of the affront which he did consider , under the extraordinary circumstances of aggravation attending it , could but have met with the proper sanction and approval of a jury of <NAME> , who , he had no doubt , would have returned a verdict of justifiable Homicide , coupled with a high testimony to the morals and character of the <NAME> .
1	' About how long might it take you now , at a average rate of going , to be a Judge ? ' asked Mr Boffin , after surveying his small stature in silence .
1	And directed by my own hand , Number nine <NAME> Place ! ' exclaimed old Sol .
1	And I do not consider , I will not consider , I can not consider , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , with a most extensive stock on hand of honour and morality , ' that I _should_ be scrupulously true , if I allowed names to be mentioned under this roof , that are unfortunately—most unfortunately—no doubt of that—connected with his. ' <NAME> knuckled his forehead again , and again begged pardon .
1	Good-humoured looking on the whole , but implacable-looking , too ; evidently a man of a strong resolution and a set purpose ; a man not desirable to be met , rushing down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side , for nothing would turn the man .
1	<NAME> ' t that your opinion ? ' ' Quite ! ' replied the Secretary ; and so withdrew .
1	This gained upon me as we went along ; so that the nearer we drew , the more familiar the objects became that we passed , the more excited I was to get there , and to run into her arms .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , whom I can not report as prepossessing in appearance , and whose manner was grim , listened to the proceedings , as part of woman 's wrongs , with a disdainful face .
1	'Coals , candles , and house-rent free , ' said <NAME> .
1	Mrs Clennam still sat intent .
1	( More blushes in the bean-stalk country ! )
1	She was in town , but not at home , having gone to <NAME> directly after breakfast on some Borrioboolan business , arising out of a society called the <NAME> <NAME> .
1	Being out of breath when she came up with it , she was unable to make him hear .
1	' Say you haven ' t , Mr Riah. ' ' Sir , I have , ' replied the old man in a low voice .
1	The same that I expect . "
1	He might have begun in secret to despair of ever winning that gentleman ' s favour , and might have thought that he was now and then disposed to put a slight upon him , which was hardly just .
1	And seven o ' clock in the evening finds him trotting out into <NAME> , to trot to the corner and save a sixpence in coach-hire .
1	' Poor little thing , ' said <NAME> ; ' she has been dreaming , I daresay. ' Dreaming , perhaps , of loving tones for ever silent , of loving eyes for ever closed , of loving arms again wound round her , and relaxing in that dream within the dam which no tongue can relate .
1	The pleasantest part of the occasion by far , to <NAME> , was the painfullest .
1	' I ought to know this writing .
1	And suppose I said to that venerable earl , " My Lord , I am here before your lordship , presented by your lordship ' s near kinsman , my friend upon my left , to indicate that programme ; " what would his lordship answer ?
1	She felt so afraid of her husband , that being on the staircase , she had not the power to retreat to her room ( which she might easily have done before he had fastened the door ) , but stood there staring .
1	' Ay , ay ! ' cried the boy , in the same tone .
1	Her cutting , gentlemen , was simplicity itself .
1	To say of a man so severely and strictly self-repressed that he is triumphant would be to do him as great an injustice as to suppose him troubled with love or sentiment or any romantic weakness .
1	Never had visitors a more hospitable reception .
1	' Now , <NAME> , ' said he , ' now , woman , what are you doing ?
1	They were much soiled , but otherwise unhurt .
1	Then he took notice of my watch , and asked me what _that_ cost , and whether it was a <NAME> watch , and where I got it , and how I got it , and whether I bought it or had it given me , and how it went , and where the key-hole was , and when I wound it , every night or every morning , and whether I ever forgot to wind it at all , and if I did , what then ?
1	<NAME> had a composite meal to make , of chops , and porter , and tea ; and indignantly pretended to prepare it for herself , though her sister did all that in quiet reality .
1	I had no claim , and I finally resolved , and ever afterwards abided by the resolution , that my heart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to establish one .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , with his mouth open , looking for somebody to speak next .
1	A great wind rises , and the summer is gone in a moment .
1	' Yes , <NAME> , ' resumed <NAME> , ' it is. ' Here , bending towards <NAME> , he whispered in a deep , hollow voice , ' A Buff ball , <NAME> , will take place in <NAME> to-morrow evening. ' ' God bless me ! ' exclaimed <NAME> .
1	" I want , " said <NAME> , who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker , " to let in a little more light here .
1	For a moment it had a suspicious look of suicide , arranged to counterfeit accident .
1	' If so be , ' said the <NAME> to Mr Toots , with not a little shame and hesitation , ' as you ' ll excuse my doing of it , brother. ' ' Captain Gills , ' returned Mr Toots , ' whatever you do , is satisfactory to me. ' The <NAME> thanked him heartily , and promising to come back in less than five minutes , went out in quest of the person who had entrusted Mr Toots with this mysterious message .
1	He has the faded appearance of a gentleman in embarrassed circumstances ; even his light whiskers droop with something of a shabby air .
1	Bother your misfortunes , " cried Mrs. Bagnet , " if they do n't make you more reasonable than that comes to .
1	' <NAME> , I can not bear to see you so , and think that I have been the cause .
1	He needed no second entreaty ; and she prepared her father ' s bed , and begged him to lie down .
1	' It was pretty far in the night , ' said <NAME> , ' when she asked me for some drink ; and when she had taken it , gave me such a patient smile , the dear ! -- so beautiful !
1	I tried to show her how I had hoped I had come into the better knowledge of myself and of her ; how I had resigned myself to what that better knowledge brought ; and how I had come there , even that day , in my fidelity to this .
1	' Mrs Quilp. ' ' Yes , <NAME> , ' said the timid sufferer .
1	Very thoughtful of you ! ' Mrs. Sparsit ' s <NAME> nose underwent a slight expansion of the nostrils , and her black eyebrows contracted as she took a sip of tea .
1	<NAME> , though we are stranger to each other than we have been , that I am unchanged to you within .
1	<NAME> was there , and had his usual effect upon me .
1	The church itself was not more quiet .
1	) ; teeming ideas of <NAME> , as a place of past and present mystery , romance , abundance , want , beauty , ugliness , fair country gardens , and foul street gutters ; all confused together , -- made the room dimmer than it was in <NAME> Dorrit ' s eyes , as they timidly saw it from the door .
1	He drew my hand through his arm and we went away to look for <NAME> .
1	But I sat wondering and waiting in <NAME> 's close room , until I really could not bear the two casts on the shelf above <NAME> 's chair , and got up and went out .
1	But <NAME> ' s aunts soon agreed to regard my aunt as an eccentric and somewhat masculine lady , with a strong understanding ; and although my aunt occasionally ruffled the feathers of <NAME> ' s aunts , by expressing heretical opinions on various points of ceremony , she loved me too well not to sacrifice some of her little peculiarities to the general harmony .
1	<NAME> is not a whit the more endurable because some hearts are to be found which can partially resist its hardening influences ; nor can the indignant tide of honest wrath stand still , because in its onward course it overwhelms a few who are comparatively innocent , among a host of guilty .
1	<NAME> ' s <NAME> is the name Mrs <NAME> christened it when we come into it as a property .
1	' Oh , that ' s the ' rig ' nal , is it ? ' said <NAME> .
1	' I knew it ! ' cried the single gentleman , letting down one of the front glasses .
1	Mr and <NAME> on occasions of ceremony faced each other in the centre of the board , and thus the parallel still held ; for , it always happened that the more <NAME> was pulled out , the further he found himself from the center , and nearer to the sideboard at one end of the room , or the window-curtains at the other .
1	' Temporaries carries it all before ' em here , I find , but though there ' s a excellent party-wall between this house and the next , I mayn ' t exactly like to go to it , <NAME> , notwithstanding ! ' these Adventures Though the offices of <NAME> and <NAME> were within the liberties of the <NAME> of <NAME> , and within hearing of <NAME> , when their clashing voices were not drowned by the uproar in the streets , yet were there hints of adventurous and romantic story to be observed in some of the adjacent objects .
1	This time she really is going to speak to him .
1	It shall be a parlour-curtain lecture .
1	I have my faults , sir , ' said Mr Chuckster -- ' <NAME> , no , ' interposed Mr Swiveller .
1	For the most part <NAME> notices things in general , with a face as unchanging as the great mourning ring on his little finger or the brooch , composed of not much diamond and a good deal of setting , which he wears in his shirt .
1	There will be a day of reckoning sooner or later , and it will be a heavy one for you if they are wronged. ' <NAME> did not allow a muscle of his face to indicate that he heard one word of this parting address .
1	<NAME> , with such power of movement as he has , arranges himself a little to receive him .
1	The worst has happened ; and the <NAME> has fallen , never to be built up any more. ' ' And Mr Dombey , is he personally ruined ? ' ' Ruined. ' ' Will he have no private fortune left ?
1	' I knew it , <NAME> , ' he said , looking round with an air of melancholy triumph , ' that society has been too much for her .
1	Mr F. ' s Aunt holding out like a grim fortress , and <NAME> becoming in need of refreshment , a messenger was despatched to the hotel for the tumbler already glanced at , which was afterwards replenished .
1	" I do n't know , my <NAME> ; I can scarcely hope so .
1	' I am almost afraid to disturb him , ' said the child timidly .
1	' What a timid little goose our Amy is !
1	' Yes , here he is , flesh and blood , flesh and blood. ' ' Vary little flesh , ' said <NAME> .
1	' Poor , poor Walter ! ' sighed <NAME> .
1	But she never explained it ; and it had , in consequence , the charm of mystery , in addition to the advantage of the sharpest expression .
1	The information we got on these heads from the carpenter , who had charge of these people , was often of the strangest kind .
1	I ' ll drink her health again , and her father ' s , and her mother ' s ; and to all her sisters and brothers -- the glorious family of the <NAME> -- all the <NAME> in one glass -- down with it to the dregs ! ' ' Well , ' said <NAME> , stopping short in the act of raising the glass to his lips and looking at the dwarf in a species of stupor as he flourished his arms and legs about : ' you ' re a jolly fellow , but of all the jolly fellows I ever saw or heard of , you have the queerest and most extraordinary way with you , upon my life you have. ' This candid declaration tended rather to increase than restrain Mr Quilp ' s eccentricities , and <NAME> , astonished to see him in such a roystering vein , and drinking not a little himself , for company -- began imperceptibly to become more companionable and confiding , so that , being judiciously led on by Mr Quilp , he grew at last very confiding indeed .
1	He acquiescing , we followed at a distance : never losing sight of her , but never caring to come very near , as she frequently looked about .
1	<NAME> said she did n't know ; perhaps they were designed for teachers , perhaps for the stage .
1	" The shrieks and the cries were audible there , though subdued by the distance .
1	' It ' ull hold him easy , vith his hat and shoes on , and breathe through the legs , vich his holler .
1	You see , it had been sunk there by the man as wore it , and I got it up. ' ' How do you know it was sunk by the man who wore it ? ' asked <NAME> .
1	Perhaps his mother now occupied a poorer seat , or possibly she had grown infirm and could not reach the church alone .
1	Whosoever has observed that sedate and clerical bird , the rook , may perhaps have noticed that when he wings his way homeward towards nightfall , in a sedate and clerical company , two rooks will suddenly detach themselves from the rest , will retrace their flight for some distance , and will there poise and linger ; conveying to mere men the fancy that it is of some occult importance to the body politic , that this artful couple should pretend to have renounced connection with it .
1	' Immediately I see that Innocent in the <NAME> , <NAME> , I burst out laughing first , and then I choked. ' <NAME> involuntarily proceeded to do the like again on the spot .
1	'And to-morrow two months it was done ! '
1	' With eyes bent upon the ground , then , or only raised enough to prevent his stumbling over such obstacles as lay in his way , the religious man moved slowly forward until he reached a small postern in the wall of the sisters ' orchard , through which he passed , closing it behind him .
1	' That won ' t do , ' returned the lady .
1	The first effects of the latter was the strange delusion , founded upon a well-known medical theory , strongly contended for by some , and as strongly contested by others , that an hereditary madness existed in his family .
1	Through all these meditations which every day of his life crowded about her , he thought of her otherwise in the old way .
1	<NAME> <NAME> was on the point of replying to the question , and reciting <NAME> ' s name and honourable distinctions at full length , when the sprightly <NAME> , with a view of rousing his friend to a sense of his situation , inflicted a startling pinch upon the fleshly part of his arm , which caused him to jump up with a shriek .
1	' In pumping water out of the <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> .
1	'What 's the matter with the -- eh ? -- Why -- Brittles -- look here -- do n't you know ? '
1	Exactly my own views , Mr Boffin. ' Here <NAME> rose , and balancing himself on his wooden leg , fluttered over his prey with extended hand .
1	Will you say that you have not the inclination ? ' ' I will say what presents itself to me , and not what presents itself to you. ' ' Say it then .
1	Do you know it was some time before I recovered the conduct of that alarming lady , on the night of your birth , <NAME> ? ' I told him that I was going down to my aunt , the <NAME> of that night , early in the morning ; and that she was one of the most tender-hearted and excellent of women , as he would know full well if he knew her better .
1	For it was a reg ' lar good secret , that was ! ' cried <NAME> , hugging herself .
1	' Go on , sir , go on .
1	" To-night , " said the man , putting the pipe in his mouth .
1	Nothing being said on the other side , he had to begin again , and began with new embarrassment .
1	There were two men of secret appearance lounging in <NAME> , and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the pavement as they talked together , one of whom said to the other when they first passed me , that " Jaggers would do it if it was to be done. " There was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner , and one of the women was crying on her dirty shawl , and the other comforted her by saying , as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders , " <NAME> is for him , 'Melia , and what more could you have ? " There was a red-eyed little Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering there , in company with a second little Jew whom he sent upon an errand ; and while the messenger was gone , I remarked this Jew , who was of a highly excitable temperament , performing a jig of anxiety under a lamp-post and accompanying himself , in a kind of frenzy , with the words , " O Jaggerth , <NAME> , <NAME> !
1	he thinks , with a pitying sadness .
1	She was away before it welled up in her mind , away , swift and true , yet steady above all -- for without steadiness it could never be done -- to the landing-place under the willow-tree , where she also had seen the boat lying moored among the stakes .
1	' Now , ' said <NAME> , ' speak up ! ' After the four days he had passed , this address fell rudely and discordantly on <NAME> ' s ear .
1	Because he felt any new compunction towards it ?
1	I can do more good with it , perhaps , than you can. ' ' Just the wery thing , to be sure , ' said <NAME> , brightening up ; ' o ' course you can , sir. ' ' Say no more about it , ' said <NAME> , locking the pocket-book in his desk ; ' I am heartily obliged to you , my good friend .
1	Ah Kit , my dear fellow , gentleman in my profession have such painful duties to perform sometimes , that you needn ' t envy us -- you needn ' t indeed ! ' ' I don ' t , sir , ' said <NAME> , ' though it isn ' t for the like of me to judge. ' ' Our only consolation , <NAME> , ' pursued the lawyer , looking at him in a sort of pensive abstraction , ' is , that although we can not turn away the wind , we can soften it ; we can temper it , if I may say so , to the shorn lambs. ' ' Shorn indeed ! ' thought <NAME> .
1	She has lots of expensive knowledge , sir , political and otherwise .
1	Here is a poor lad who has never felt a parent ' s care , who has scarcely known anything all his life but suffering and sorrow , presented to a man who he is told is his father , and whose first act is to signify his intention of putting an end to his short term of happiness , of consigning him to his old fate , and taking him from the only friend he has ever had -- which is yourself .
1	I should have been happy to have made <NAME> a prominent consideration , too , if the case had admitted of it ; but unfortunately it does not . "
1	I know I might keep it off if I only tried hard enough , and sometimes I do try hard enough , and at other times I don ' t and won ' t .
1	" I suppose it 's chops at the <NAME> 's Arms . "
1	Inquiring for the object of his solicitude , he learnt that he had timed his visit well ; for Mr Squeers was , in fact , at that moment waiting for a hackney coach he had ordered , and in which he purposed proceeding to his week ' s retirement , like a gentleman .
1	I have a business charge to acquit myself of .
1	I may be mistaken -- nothing is more likely -- but Mr <NAME> , ' proceeded <NAME> , majestically waving her gloves , ' appears to me to be seated in a first-class equipage .
1	In the distance one way , <NAME> showed as a black mist ; in another distance hills began to rise ; in a third , there was a faint change in the light of the horizon where it shone upon the far-off sea .
1	Again -- these three white little loaves are for <NAME> .
1	'Oh , come in with you ! '
1	' You have a bad father , have you ? ' ' <NAME> , <NAME> ! ' returned <NAME> , amazed .
1	' I ' m sure I never deserved it from him , no , nor from you .
1	But in the morning it is whispered among the household that he was heard to go upstairs in the dead night , and that he stayed there -- in the room -- until the sun was shining .
1	' Hear , hear , ' assented <NAME> ' s client .
1	When <NAME> has a matter of this pressing interest under his consideration , the fat forefinger seems to rise , to the dignity of a familiar demon .
1	But , now , the chambers were cold and gloomy , and when she left her own little room to while away the tedious hours , and sat in one of them , she was still and motionless as their inanimate occupants , and had no heart to startle the echoes -- hoarse from their long silence -- with her voice .
1	He had witnessed many such removals , and always with pain , though he knew that they departed for their own good .
1	The old lady is not seventy-three now , my dear Sir. ' The little man paused , and took a pinch of snuff .
1	Why , good people , when he comes smoothly spinning through the <NAME> to-night , like a slow-going benevolent Humming-Top , and when you come about him with your complaints of the Grubber , you don ' t know what a cheat the Proprietor is !
1	' Well , ' said <NAME> , ' what do you think ? ' ' Oh , <NAME> , ' said Mrs. <NAME> , trembling with agitation , ' you ' re very kind , sir. ' ' It ' ll save you a good deal of trouble , won ' t it ? ' said <NAME> .
1	Mr Dombey is a white-haired gentleman , whose face bears heavy marks of care and suffering ; but they are traces of a storm that has passed on for ever , and left a clear evening in its track .
1	Nearly all the inmates of the prison had assembled to witness its removal ; they fell back on either side when the widower appeared ; he walked hurriedly forward , and stationed himself , alone , in a little railed area close to the lodge gate , from whence the crowd , with an instinctive feeling of delicacy , had retired .
1	They all four gathered socially about the little table , and took tea under that young lady ' s active superintendence ; and the presence of <NAME> in the back parlour , brightened the <NAME> frigate on the wall .
1	This is by no means a disparagement to his character ; for many official personages , who are held in high respect and admiration , are the victims of similar infirmities .
1	Permit me , sir -- if you hold the card a little slanting , this way , you catch the light upon the up-stroke .
1	They were not a handsome family ; they were not well dressed ; their shoes were far from being water-proof ; their clothes were scanty ; and <NAME> might have known , and very likely did , the inside of a pawnbroker 's .
1	' Do you know , ' said he , after a pause , during which they walked on side by side , ' that I believe I could tell you your name , if I tried ? ' ' Prove your opinion , ' was the answer , accompanied with a stop and a stare .
1	' Morfin ' s here , ' he answered , looking up with his widest and almost sudden smile ; ' humming musical recollections -- of his last night ' s quartette party , I suppose -- through the walls between us , and driving me half mad .
1	Mr Dorrit will allow me to withdraw. ' ' Hum .
1	It is to be hoped it enjoyed itself ; for Mr Merdle ' s own share of the repast might have been paid for with eighteenpence .
1	I am not speaking of myself , <NAME> , but of her mother , and of her .
1	But she was a good plain sample of a nature that is ever , in the mass , better , truer , higher , nobler , quicker to feel , and much more constant to retain , all tenderness and pity , self-denial and devotion , than the nature of men .
1	" All things have worked together as they have fallen out .
1	This very exacting member of the fold appeared to be endowed with a sixth sense , in regard of knowing when the <NAME> Milvey least desired her company , and with promptitude appearing in his little hall .
1	You were the first to mention her name .
1	The light in the passage was obscured for a moment , and my aunt came out .
1	'Your having interfered in this dear boy 's behalf before , ' said <NAME> ; 'your coming here , at so great a risk , to tell me what you have heard ; your manner , which convinces me of the truth of what you say ; your evident contrition , and sense of shame ; all lead me to believe that you might yet be reclaimed .
1	She must be well brought up , and well guarded from reposing any foolish confidences where they are not deserved .
1	<NAME> , she even went so far as to hint , obscurely , at an attachment entertained for her daughter by the son of an old neighbour of theirs , one <NAME> ( a young gentleman who might have been , at that time , four years old , or thereabouts ) , and to represent it , indeed , as almost a settled thing between the families -- only waiting for her daughter ' s final decision , to come off with the sanction of the church , and to the unspeakable happiness and content of all parties .
1	And I know too , that , bating a certain tacit avoidance of any allusion to to-morrow ; such as may be supposed to prevail between delicate-minded turnkeys , and a sensitive prisoner who is to be hanged next morning ; we got on very well , and , all things considered , were merry enough .
1	I was not crying at anything in particular that I know of ; but somehow it made me cry , to see old friends .
1	I am bearded and bullied by a shop-boy , and she beseeches him to pity me and remember I am ill ! ' He fell into a paroxysm of his disorder , so violent that for a few moments <NAME> was alarmed for his life ; but finding that he began to recover , he withdrew , after signifying by a gesture to the young lady that he had something important to communicate , and would wait for her outside the room .
1	' Look at him , ' cries <NAME> , stretching out his hand admiringly and tenderly , though rallyingly too .
1	A field of outsiders are always going in to bowl at the <NAME> , and we block the balls. ' <NAME> asked what became of the bowlers ?
1	Mr Dombey would be delighted to leave <NAME> in such admirable guardianship .
1	I have not , ' said <NAME> , noticing his hesitation , and speaking with embarrassment himself : ' I have not told him anything about our last conversation , Mr Carker ; not even him , believe me .
1	A Doctor ? " " Yes. " " With a daughter ? " " Yes. " " Yes , " said the <NAME> .
1	It will have gone down in another hour. ' ' It will be rather unpleasant going at this rate in the dark , won ' t it ? ' inquired <NAME> .
1	I thought it had the most dismal trees in it , and the most dismal sparrows , and the most dismal cats , and the most dismal houses ( in number half a dozen or so ) , that I had ever seen .
1	' <NAME> , ass , traitor ! ' ' Drat the man ! ' cried the nurse , looking angrily around .
1	There has been rain this afternoon , and a wintry shudder goes among the little pools on the cracked , uneven flag-stones , and through the giant elm-trees as they shed a gust of tears .
1	It lay heavier on my breast than if I had been a most atrocious criminal , I dare say .
1	It was natural that , in the midst of her affliction , she should often revert to that sweet young lady of whom she had only caught a hasty glance , but whose sympathy , expressed in one slight brief action , dwelt in her memory like the kindnesses of years .
1	Mr Wegg opens the gate , descries a sort of brown paper truncheon under Mr <NAME> ' s arm , and remarks , in a dry tone : ' Oh !
1	" I am quite indebted to you for the trouble you have taken already . "
1	This time , as before , <NAME> turned back along with him .
1	And yet <NAME> was not weeping upon the body , but was scolding violently upon her chair ; and all this amidst a clamour of tongues perfectly deafening , and which really appeared to have driven the unfortunate footman to the utmost verge of distraction .
1	Soon after his arrival he languidly wrote to his brother , the honourable and jocular member , that the <NAME> were ' great fun ; ' and further , that the female Bounderby , instead of being the Gorgon he had expected , was young , and remarkably pretty .
1	All men who know that there are laws against instructing slaves , of which the pains and penalties greatly exceed in their amount the fines imposed on those who maim and torture them , must be prepared to find their faces very low in the scale of intellectual expression .
1	" Go on , if you please , " said I .
1	The same face : the very same .
1	We agreed that he was either prevented from coming or that he had come and gone away , and <NAME> proposed to walk home with me .
1	' Excuse me , dear <NAME> , ' said the poor lady , giving me her hand , ' but I am not strong ; and the removal of the late misunderstanding between <NAME> and myself was at first too much for me. ' ' Is this all your family , ma ' am ? ' said my aunt .
1	He looked at the pretty figure bending down over the paper and saying , ' Where am I to go , pa ?
1	They ' re wittles and drink to me -- lodging , wife , and children -- reading , writing , and <NAME> -- snuff , tobacker , and sleep. ' ' That ain ' t a sort of man to see sitting behind a coach-box , is it though ? ' said <NAME> in my ear , as he handled the reins .
1	There was a christening party at the largest coffin-maker ' s and a funeral hatchment had stopped some great improvements in the bravest mansion .
1	I traced his progress downwards , step by step , until at last he reached that excess of destitution from which he never rose again .
1	When I went upstairs to bed , our house being small and this young woman 's ears sharp , I stuffed the sheet into Mrs. <NAME> 's mouth that she should n't say a word of surprise and told her all about it .
1	But it has not been quite so often remarked that this power ( fallible , like every other human attribute ) is for the most part absolutely incapable of self-revision ; and that when it has delivered an adverse opinion which by all human lights is subsequently proved to have failed , it is undistinguishable from prejudice , in respect of its determination not to be corrected .
1	' Well then , ' said <NAME> , with a sigh , ' as I know what such a metal will do at such a temperature , and such a body under such a pressure , so I may know ( if I will only consider ) , how these great lords and gentlemen will certainly deal with such a matter as mine .
1	Now this watch was a special favourite with <NAME> , having been carried about , beneath the shadow of his waistcoat , for a greater number of years than we feel called upon to state at present .
1	Train up a Ghost -- child , I mean -- ' Any further reflections on this fruitful theme were abruptly cut short by the arrival of <NAME> and <NAME> ; in the hurry of receiving whom , Mrs. Nickleby speedily lost sight of everything else .
1	And it ' s quiet , and pleasant , and airy. ' ' And she always has the use of this room for visitors , ' said the person of the house , screwing up one of her little bony fists , like an opera-glass , and looking through it , with her eyes and her chin in that quaint accordance .
1	I couldn ' t think of your not being here to receive Mr Clennam , my dear , especially this afternoon .
1	' What else do you suppose I think I am made for ?
1	' Of all the king ' s knights he ' s the flower , And he ' s always gay ! ' With this adaptation of the <NAME> to himself , he stalked out of the room closely followed by <NAME> , whom perhaps he had pressed into his service because he tolerably well knew it would not be easy to get rid of him .
1	' I ' m not going to sleep in the fresh air ; no , nor I ' m not going into the country either .
1	But I do n't know that I am in love with him -- yet . "
1	Is not your sorrow mine ?
1	In the agonies of composition , the elderly gentleman looked sometimes at the carpet , sometimes at the ceiling , and sometimes at the wall ; and when neither carpet , ceiling , nor wall afforded the requisite degree of inspiration , he looked out of the window .
1	' Then , as we understand each other , ' said <NAME> , ' will you allow me to ask you whether you consider me a highly virtuous , exemplary , and well-conducted man in private life ; and whether , as a person whose business it is to take charge of youth , you place the strongest confidence in my unimpeachable integrity , liberality , religious principles , and ability ? ' ' Certainly I do , ' replied the father-in-law , reciprocating the schoolmaster ' s grin .
1	The room door of the one-pair back , bore inscribed in legible characters the imposing words , ' Mr .
1	Dressing myself as quietly as I could , and leaving <NAME> to look after my aunt , I tumbled head foremost into it , and then went for a walk to <NAME> .
1	<NAME> <NAME> ' s a little restless in his sleep .
1	' But I would have you know , <NAME> , ' resumed the governess in a tone of increased severity , ' that you can not be permitted -- if it be only for the sake of preserving a proper example and decorum in this establishment -- that you can not be permitted , and that you shall not be permitted , to fly in the face of your superiors in this exceedingly gross manner .
1	' Be careful , sir , ' said <NAME> , looking steadily at him .
1	I alluded to the advantages I had derived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society , and I confessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them , and that he might have done better without me and my expectations .
1	And dear me , it ' s a long time ago , now , ain ' t it ?
1	To which the bird of prey slowly rejoined , ' And what might YOUR name be , now ? ' ' This is my friend , ' Mortimer <NAME> interposed ; ' Mr <NAME> Wrayburn. ' ' Mr <NAME> , is it ?
1	And he never did well in the streets , he never did well out of sight .
1	' The <NAME> , with an agitation she could not repress , hastily tore off the <NAME> and broke the scented seal .
1	They 're only jealous , <NAME> , because he wo n't give it to them . '
1	' And I consider that the poetry brings us both in , in a beautiful manner. ' The effect of the poem on the Secretary being evidently to astonish him , Mr <NAME> was confirmed in his high opinion of it , and was greatly pleased .
1	' For rest and relief. ' She glanced round the sombre room , and appeared from the motion of her lips to repeat the words to herself , as calling it to witness how little of either it afforded her .
1	I told you , you could n't tire me , you know .
1	If they had known about us , you might have felt yourself called upon to conciliate them .
1	Let me look at you .
1	He is what they call a barrister , with nothing to do .
1	I have done a similar thing myself , in construction , often .
1	Even you are a courtier , or think it necessary to become one to me ! "
1	Possibly you have heard of me. " " My wife came to your house to reclaim her father ?
1	I ' ll make him a true prophet , for it shall surely come. ' ' Are you at home ? ' asked <NAME> , suddenly popping in his head .
1	Should I sleep at night in one of those wooden bins , with the other luggage , and wash myself at the pump in the yard in the morning ; or should I be turned out every night , and expected to come again to be left till called for , when the office opened next day ?
1	These stairs are a part of the bridge ; they consist of three flights .
1	I had long tasks every day to do with <NAME> ; but I did them , there being no Mr. and <NAME> here , and got through them without disgrace .
1	Do not be afraid to imagine it , or to say what it would be. ' He looked steadfastly at <NAME> , and , so looking at him , seemed to change into a very old haggard man .
1	Here , we found a gentleman with one eye , in a velveteen suit and knee-breeches , who wiped his nose with his sleeve on being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper .
1	Ma ' amselle was a little slow to observe it , as though she were not yet well accustomed to the <NAME> tongue .
1	But it ' s very near the sea .
1	<NAME> comes up to make herself useful , and falls to work immediately .
1	Respecting his legs now -- ? ' ' <NAME> , certainly , ' said <NAME> .
1	'Well , I suppose it is , ' growled <NAME> .
1	You may file a strong man 's heart away for a good many years , but it will tell all of a sudden at last . "
1	The amiable face with which he said it , I think I shall never forget .
1	' Whatever you want most , if I could be that .
1	We went back next day to my aunt ' s house -- not to mine -- and when she and I sat alone , as of old , before going to bed , she said : ' <NAME> , do you really wish to know what I have had upon my mind lately ? ' ' Indeed I do , aunt .
1	But , the theatres were all well filled , and the people poured cheerfully out as he passed , and went chatting home .
1	He charged her with it in no measured terms ; and was so urgent with his daughter to go round to the <NAME> and entreat him to turn her out , that she was never reproduced after the first failure .
1	His hair still hung in curls about his face , and his eyes were very bright ; but their light was of <NAME> , not earth .
1	Taking the table to represent the path of virtue , I am justified in stating that during the whole time of the <NAME> 's reading , <NAME> 's arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled to it by <NAME> .
1	The fact is , you ain ' t enough here , <NAME> .
1	If I might embrace him once !
1	A half-formed , wholly unexpressed suspicion tossed in it , now heaving itself up , and now sinking into the deep ; now gaining palpability , and now losing it .
1	Recent occurrences to which he need not more particularly allude , but which have not been altogether without notice in some Sunday Papers , and in a daily paper which he need not name ( here every other member of the company names it in an audible murmur ) , have caused him to reflect ; and he feels that for him and <NAME> to have any personal differences at such a moment , would be for ever to deny that good feeling in the general cause , for which he has reason to think and hope that the gentlemen in <NAME> ' s <NAME> have always been distinguished .
1	Mr Toots , like the leal and trusty soul he was , stopped the cabriolet in a twinkling , and told <NAME> of his commission , at which she cried more than before .
1	Those Saturdays were <NAME> for at least two little Christians among all the Jews , and did the holy <NAME> work of strengthening and knitting up a brother ' s and a sister ' s love .
1	However , as Mrs. Chillip says , sir , they undergo a continual punishment ; for they are turned inward , to feed upon their own hearts , and their own hearts are very bad feeding .
1	<NAME> will turn you , won ' t it ?
1	The smell of sawdust , beer , tobacco-smoke , and spirits is inseparable in his vocation from death in its most awful shapes .
1	You confuse me , and how can I transact business if I am confused ?
1	' But what makes you say this along of <NAME> , father ? ' asked his wife , anxiously .
1	" Now you know me. " ' With these words the apparition turned towards the baron , as if composing himself for a talk -- and , what was very remarkable , was , that he threw his cloak aside , and displaying a stake , which was run through the centre of his body , pulled it out with a jerk , and laid it on the table , as composedly as if it had been a walking-stick .
1	In saying what he said then , he never looked at her ; but looked at it and wrenched at it .
1	' Well , then , draw that little table into this window , and let me get out of hearing of those prosy politics. ' ' Jane , ' said <NAME> , to the servant who brought in candles , ' go down into the office , and bring me up the file of the <NAME> for eighteen hundred and twenty-six .
1	The agitation and the indignation from which I have recently suffered have been too much for me .
1	I felicitate you on your admiration. ' ' I neither know nor ask , ' said <NAME> , ' of whom you speak. ' ' Della bella <NAME> , sir , as they say in <NAME> .
1	I am not quite sure , because the wolf and you change forms .
1	To set this point at rest , for once and for ever , we hasten to undeceive them , and stride to its commencement .
1	<NAME> as the young man was of all wrong , every artful insinuation stung , every well-considered sarcasm cut him to the quick ; and when <NAME> noted his pale face and quivering lip , he hugged himself to mark how well he had chosen the taunts best calculated to strike deep into a young and ardent spirit .
1	'We shall see , ' returned the old gentleman with a searching glance .
1	Those are the lights of <NAME> . '
1	Nor were the two last-named gentlemen as much edified as they might have been by the moving passages narrated .
1	' Has the post come in ? ' ' No. ' ' Any other letters ? ' ' One. ' Newman eyed him closely , and laid it on the desk .
1	' Good heavens , it is principally because I AM among friends that my state of mind is what it is .
1	'There 's a bolt at the top , you wo n't be able to reach , ' interposed Toby .
1	It should be devoted to what promises a better return , and should be used where she has a larger stake .
1	" This other gentleman is in the preaching line , I think ? "
1	I was pretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts , but as I was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the <NAME> , -- not to say for other waters , -- I at once engaged to place myself under the tuition of the winner of a prize-wherry who plied at our stairs , and to whom I was introduced by my new allies .
1	I lie in a shady place like this and think of adventurous spirits going to the <NAME> or penetrating to the heart of the <NAME> with admiration .
1	and all the gravestones in the churchyard -- it was a large churchyard that they were in -- looking on like ghosts in white , while the church tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant .
1	" Because I thought there war n't enough of you , perhaps ? "
1	' Exceedingly kind notes , proposing that you should visit them for change of scene .
1	<NAME> bowed again and sat down ; his father looking round , he continued -- ' The gov ' nor , sir , has drawn out five hundred and thirty pound. ' ' Reduced counsels , ' interposed <NAME> , senior , in an undertone .
1	<NAME> <NAME> ! -- On Tuesday last , at <NAME> ' s , <NAME> , by the <NAME> Reverend the <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> , of <NAME> , <NAME> , to <NAME> , only daughter of the late <NAME> , <NAME> , of <NAME> .
1	If people hurried to the windows , Mr <NAME> pitched the temple , and hastily unfurling the drapery and concealing <NAME> therewith , flourished hysterically on the pipes and performed an air .
1	These were fitted into a large window until that time bare of ornament ; and when the sun shone brightly , as she had so well loved to see it , the familiar patterns were reflected in their original colours , and throwing a stream of brilliant light upon the pavement , fell warmly on the name of <NAME> .
1	I was certain of it .
1	After the adjournment , <NAME> stepped up to <NAME> , and requested him to retract , which he refused to do , repeating the offensive words .
1	' He isn ' t , ' said <NAME> indignantly .
1	It may be near , it may be distant ; while the road lasts , nothing turns me . "
1	She acknowledged their homage by bending her head , and giving them a quick look .
1	' And you have heard , no doubt , my darling pet , ' said <NAME> , detaining her hand , ' that your Papa , whom we all perfectly adore and dote upon , is to be married to my dearest Edith this day week. ' ' I knew it would be very soon , ' returned <NAME> , ' but not exactly when. ' ' My darling <NAME> , ' urged her mother , gaily , ' is it possible you have not told <NAME> ? ' ' Why should I tell <NAME> ? ' she returned , so suddenly and harshly , that Florence could scarcely believe it was the same voice .
1	'And this man that 's to be his master -- you , sir -- you 'll treat him well , and feed him , and do all that sort of thing , will you ? '
1	And it was he , without doubt , who scratched a calendar on this stone .
1	If he says , 'Skimpole , join the dance ! '
1	And another thing , my dear .
1	Under cover of the darkness he followed out of the room , followed down the stairs , followed down the court , followed out into the streets .
1	' Is it ? ' said <NAME> .
1	Deputy ' s the nighest name to indict me by : but yer wouldn ' t catch me pleading to that , neither. ' ' Deputy be it always , then .
1	I shall wait for some encouragement and hope .
1	He wrung his hand , only adding , ' Blind leaders of the blind , <NAME> !
1	That ' s flat. ' So saying , <NAME> slipped into a tall empty closet which opened with two half doors , and shut himself up ; intending to slip out directly <NAME> was safe inside his own room .
1	Not many ; but though they would appear nothing , if I thought of other things , they seem a long , long time , when I think of him .
1	The fault is mine , and only mine .
1	Never ! ' ' Unnecessary to pursue the subject , ' returned <NAME> , ' and would not have mentioned it on any account except as supposing it a favourable and only letter of introduction but as to being fact no doubt whatever and you may set your mind at rest for the very dress I have on now can prove it and sweetly made though there is no denying that it would tell better on a better figure for my own is much too fat though how to bring it down I know not , pray excuse me I am roving off again. ' Mr <NAME> backed to his chair in a stony way , and seated himself , as <NAME> gave him a softening look and played with her parasol .
1	<NAME> , Mrs. Smithie , and the <NAME> , ' was the next announcement .
1	When I saw him going downstairs early in the morning ( for , thank <NAME> !
1	I 'm very glad to hear it , " said <NAME> 's nephew , " because I have n't great faith in these young housekeepers .
1	' You ' re to wait , if you please , ' said the tailor ' s daughter , after a short period of absence , during which the clinking in the back-room had ceased , and been succeeded by whispering -- ' She won ' t be long. ' As she spoke , she pulled up the window-blind , and having by this means ( as she thought ) diverted <NAME> ' s attention from the room to the street , caught up some articles which were airing on the fender , and had very much the appearance of stockings , and darted off .
1	' It is not anybody who has been here before , ' said <NAME> , ' for he is tumbling up every stair .
1	Such <NAME> as he and Ma make of themselves ! "
1	Now , as they went along , <NAME> reflected , that I might , after all , have been brought there on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to <NAME> 's safety , and , bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be mischievous , left his guide and <NAME> on the edge of the quarry , and went on by himself , and stole round the house two or three times , endeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within .
1	And I am glad of another thing , and that is , that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it and always so far deserving it .
1	This observation must be limited exclusively to his daughter .
1	Thus the whelp had gone out of the circle before the people moved .
1	inquired the man with the keys .
1	' And whatever we are to say to you , sir , ' exclaimed Mrs. <NAME> , addressing young <NAME> ' s deliverer , ' I am sure I don ' t know. ' ' You need say nothing at all , ' replied <NAME> .
1	For then you know , <NAME> , you would always have the horse and cart to bring you over to see me , and could come for nothing , and be sure of coming. ' ' The sense of the dear ! ' cried <NAME> .
1	He ' s a pleasant wretch , but he wants principle. ' ' What were you doing for <NAME> ? ' asked <NAME> .
1	<NAME> <NAME> laughed ; and having given it a squeeze , tossed it up and let it go .
1	<NAME> <NAME> ran hastily upstairs , and with a trembling hand opened the bag .
1	He knew in his cups three distinct stages of intoxication , -- the dignified -- the quarrelsome -- the amorous .
1	It would have been flat heresy to do so .
1	The savings upon that annuity , and some other items to your credit , all duly carried to account , with vouchers , will place you in possession of a lump-sum of money , rather exceeding <NAME> .
1	It would keep him in town a good deal , and he preferred the country .
1	The post of honour and the post of shame , the general ' s station and the drummer ' s , a peer ' s statue in Westminster Abbey and a seaman ' s hammock in the bosom of the deep , the mitre and the workhouse , the woolsack and the gallows , the throne and the guillotine -- the travellers to all are on the great high road , but it has wonderful divergencies , and only Time shall show us whither each traveller is bound .
1	How every circumstance of her short , eventful life , came thronging into her mind , as they travelled on !
1	I hardly know how to say it .
1	So , I hope you like my feeling independent ; if you don ' t , I can ' t help it .
1	But anything like the utter dreariness and desolation that met my eyes when I literally ' tumbled up ' on deck at noon , I never saw .
1	Slowly , at last , he moved his eyes from my face , as if he were waking from a vision , and cast them round the room .
1	Say what you mean. ' ' Merely , my dear fellow , that I have the honour and pleasure of a speaking acquaintance with such a Patriarch as you describe , and that I address him as Mr Aaron , because it appears to me <NAME> , expressive , appropriate , and complimentary .
1	" Why , <NAME> , " says she -- and she coom a deal closer and squeedged a deal harder than she ' d deane afore -- " dost thou think it ' s nat ' ral noo , that having such a proper mun as thou to keep company wi ' , I ' d ever tak ' opp wi ' such a leetle scanty whipper-snapper as yon ? " she says .
1	" Home , for good and all .
1	I liked him no better than at first , and had the same uneasy jealousy of him ; but if I had any reason for it beyond a child ' s instinctive dislike , and a general idea that <NAME> and I could make much of my mother without any help , it certainly was not THE reason that I might have found if I had been older .
1	" Why , then , it is that you will marry some one very rich and very worthy , much older -- five and twenty years , perhaps -- than yourself .
1	It is quite still and silent .
1	<NAME> Inspector Bucket of the <NAME> has not yet struck his great blow , as just now chronicled , but is yet refreshing himself with sleep preparatory to his field-day , when through the night and along the freezing wintry roads a chaise and pair comes out of <NAME> , making its way towards <NAME> .
1	Why , his father ' s my friend ; he ' s to come back to me directly , he is .
1	To have , as I may say , all friends round <NAME> ' s at once , is a treat unlooked for !
1	I found the <NAME> in possession of the intelligence , and I found that it made a great change in the <NAME> 's demeanour .
1	This some one was the dolls ' dressmaker , with a little basket on her arm , and her crutch stick in her hand .
1	Who was his friend with him ?
1	Why it may be his <NAME> one of these days , in part .
1	Had he looked with greater interest and with a father ' s eye , he might have read in her keen glance the impulses and fears that made her waver ; the passionate desire to run clinging to him , crying , as she hid her face in his embrace , ' Oh father , try to love me !
1	'Ceptin <NAME> ; he 's had a drop. " All this time ( still with both hands taking great care of the bird's-nest ) , <NAME> was rolling his eyes round and round the room , and round and round the flowered pattern of my dressing-gown .
1	<NAME> ourselves. " " Is there ? " asked madame , vacantly .
1	' <NAME> ' t you have it of that chap that took hold of me by the chin !
1	For the first time in his life he had done an underhanded action , and he had done wrong .
1	Mrs. Chadband , more than ready , so advances as to jostle her husband into the background and confronts <NAME> with a hard , frowning smile .
1	I had known many of the grown people before and almost all the children , but now the very steeple began to wear a familiar and affectionate look .
1	The turnkey looked as if he thought the request a strange one and rather out of the common way , but nevertheless he laid down his paper , and coming round where <NAME> ' s mother stood , took the basket from her , and after inspecting its contents , handed it to <NAME> , and went back to his place .
1	Dilating and dilating since the sun went down last night , it has gradually swelled until it fills every void in the place .
1	I 'll never go another step in opposition to it .
1	It was like passing from death to life ; it was drawing nearer Heaven .
1	This cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar , only not so light .
1	When she had done that , she left me to go to bed in the dark , locked the door on the outside , put the key in her pocket again , and kept me locked up till she come down in the morning -- very early I can tell you -- and let me out .
1	' Haha ! ' he cried , lifting his eyebrows , folding his arms , and leaning back in his chair .
1	He rejected the angel , and took up with the tormenting spirit crouching in his bosom .
1	If ever my darling were fonder of me at one time than another in all our intercourse , she was surely fondest of me that night .
1	Dear Mr Fledgeby , do sit down. ' Dear Mr <NAME> did sit down , and satisfied himself ( or , judging from the expression of his countenance , <NAME> himself ) that nothing new had occurred in the way of whisker-sprout since he came round the corner from the <NAME> .
1	Not the faintest rustle broke the profound tranquillity of the solemn scene .
1	' Why , if they weren ' t a going to meet somewhere , I suppose they might as well have stayed at home , mightn ' t they , <NAME> ? ' returned the unwilling Grinder .
1	On the contrary , they are most acceptable .
1	<NAME> <NAME> is then presented with his meed of acknowledgment by the husband of his lovely and accomplished relative , and <NAME> and <NAME> retire , leaving that husband to the world again , and to ponder at leisure on their representation of its state of mind concerning his affairs , and on its just and reasonable expectations .
1	They were in a book , and it happened to be in the next room -- our sitting-room , dividing <NAME> 's chamber from mine .
1	<NAME> withdrew his head , but thrust it in again .
1	I belong to a profession in which that luxury is sometimes denied us. ' <NAME> replied , with acknowledgments , that he only hoped he did what was right , and what showed how entirely he was devoted to <NAME> .
1	If I live , you ' ll find me out. ' ' I shall find out that my husband has a mine of purpose and energy , and will turn it to the best account ? ' ' I hope so , dearest <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , wistfully , and yet somewhat whimsically .
1	' I suppose it is , now you mention it .
1	At the moment , the bell rang loudly in the hall .
1	Pity there was not a word of truth in that superstition about bodies bleeding when touched by the hand of the right person ; you never got a sign out of bodies .
1	And how , until the present hour , when authorities mighty in the <NAME> and learned in the law declared their successful labours ended , they had confided in no other human being .
1	As no one present takes any especial interest in <NAME> 's dreams , the probability is not pursued .
1	He saw her bosom throb , and saw her face flush and turn white .
1	That blow , unless there is a full retraction on the part of <NAME> , <NAME> is ready to justify. ' ' There is no more to be said , ' returned the other , ' but to settle the hour and the place of meeting .
1	What can you possibly want to know of circuses then ?
1	' Declines to marry ? ' another guesses .
1	<NAME> , with her brother 's wink , shakes her head and purses up her mouth into no without saying it .
1	Dear me , sir , why did n't you send your young man round for me ?
1	Something is wrong somewhere , but what something , what may come of it , to whom , when , and from which unthought of and unheard of quarter is the puzzle of his life .
1	Between the room and the men there were strong points of general resemblance .
1	The audience were much edified by this passage of words ; and Mr Podsnap , feeling that he was in rather remarkable force to-day , became smiling and conversational .
1	But his name is <NAME> . "
1	Over the young ladies , I see a Missis .
1	Their goings-on had been going on for some time .
1	<NAME> ! ' They pressed forward to see ; but one among them thrusting the others aside with a loud exclamation , drew a clasp-knife from his pocket , and dashing into the room , cut down the body .
1	At length , he stopped in front of one , more humble in appearance and more dirty than any he had yet seen ; and , having crossed over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement , graciously announced his intention of putting up there , for the night .
1	<NAME> hesitated for a moment , thinking that one or other of them would notice it ; but finding that neither did , he stopped , came back , picked it up , and laid it himself on Mr <NAME> ' s desk .
1	' I can ' t keep her avay from me .
1	said <NAME> , apparently refreshed .
1	' I were very patient wi ' her .
1	' Can I speak to <NAME> , sir ? ' replied <NAME> from the outside .
1	Here is a long passage -- what an enormous perspective I make of it ! -- leading from <NAME> ' s kitchen to the front door .
1	It is so dark that nothing can be made out in it , over a little counter , but another tallow candle in another old tin candlestick , close to the face of a man stooping low in a chair .
1	' That is as much as to say that you had rather not accept the place , and that you consider fifteen shillings a week too little , ' said Mr Gregsbury , ringing .
1	' There ' s no more to tell , <NAME> .
1	" Since you want to know what we know , " says she , " I 'll tell you .
1	Say that again , will you ? ' He was always wide awake , like the enchanted bride who drove her husband frantic ; always restless ; always thirsting for answers ; perpetually seeking and never finding .
1	She will never believe it of him , but he has cut away and left her. ' ' Pray , ' said <NAME> , ' why will she never believe it of him ? ' ' Because those two were one .
1	The other commodities were addressed to the general public ; but they were never offered by the vendors to Mr Dombey .
1	' " Oh ! " said the unhappy <NAME> , clasping his hands , and mournfully raising his eyes towards the sky , " would that my wanderings might end here !
1	Kiss me , <NAME> , as a promise that you will be reconciled to <NAME> -- to my dearest husband -- to the father of the little child who taught me to come back , <NAME> taught me to come back ! ' As she clung closer to him , in another burst of tears , he kissed her on her lips , and , lifting up his eyes , said , ' Oh my God , forgive me , for I need it very much ! ' With that he dropped his head again , lamenting over and caressing her , and there was not a sound in all the house for a long , long time ; they remaining clasped in one another ' s arms , in the glorious sunshine that had crept in with <NAME> .
1	If you 'll only let me cry a little longer .
1	Mr <NAME> was slinking about the hearthrug , waiting to welcome <NAME> .
1	'Him that I told the young lady of before . '
1	She could have choked in right good earnest , at the thought of being so humbled .
1	And this , ' hinted Mr Venus , delicately , ' being the very next time , you know , sir -- ' -- ' Why , therefore you suppose he ' ll turn to at the grindstone , eh , <NAME> ? ' said Mr Boffin .
1	Now , whether she became my lodger , <NAME> , with any deliberate intention then of doing this deed and blinding me , I give no opinion on ; but she lived in my house in that capacity at the time that she was hovering about the chambers of the deceased <NAME> with a view to a wrangle , and likewise persecuting and half frightening the life out of an unfortunate stationer . "
1	<NAME> , compelling the attendance of the waitress with one hitch of his eyelash , instantly replies as follows : " Four veals and hams is three , and four potatoes is three and four , and one summer cabbage is three and six , and three marrows is four and six , and six breads is five , and three Cheshires is five and three , and four half-pints of half-and-half is six and three , and four small rums is eight and three , and three Pollys is eight and six .
1	<NAME> dear ! ' <NAME> stood for a moment , immovable .
1	' If he ' s gone and made off any how <NAME> , it ' s enough to make me give way in a different manner .
1	I think you must have remarked that I could not forbear a tribute to those charms when I put up the steps of the 'ackney-coach .
1	People mutht be amuthed , <NAME> , thomehow , ' continued <NAME> , rendered more pursy than ever , by so much talking ; ' they can ' t be alwayth a working , nor yet they can ' t be alwayth a learning .
1	' To our house , where you came this morning .
1	Before he had got through the first two or three lines he began to open his eyes very wide and to frown most horribly , the next two or three caused him to scratch his head in an uncommonly vicious manner , and when he came to the conclusion he gave a long dismal whistle indicative of surprise and dismay .
1	' I ha never thowt yet , missus , ' said <NAME> , ' o ' askin thy name. ' The old lady announced herself as ' Mrs .
1	" He ( pointing to the young gentleman in sky-blue ) is the only son of the powerful <NAME> of Filletoville. " ' " Well then , my dear , I ' m afraid he ' ll never come to the title , " said my uncle , looking coolly at the young gentleman as he stood fixed up against the wall , in the cockchafer fashion that I have described .
1	' I thought it possible , ' resumed the other , ' that you might have been advised from <NAME> -- ' ' We have had no advice from <NAME> respecting anybody of the name of <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
1	It is growing late , and I have to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this .
1	There is positively a mania among some of them for sending it to England. " " That has a bad look , " said <NAME> -- " A bad look , you say , my dear <NAME> ?
1	for shame ! ' <NAME> brightened up and smiled .
1	Consternation was in every face .
1	Is that all you say ?
1	No difference in this respect between the base metals and the precious .
1	And she gets on so placidly. ' ' Oh , ' returned <NAME> , with contemptuous patronage , ' she ' s a regular girl .
1	Without saying a word , she walked up with a cordial face , shook hands with him , and patted him on the arm .
1	A liar too , ' he added , in a lower voice as he drew closer to me , ' who knows how dear she is to me , and seeks to wound me even there , because there is a stranger nearby. ' ' Strangers are nothing to me , grandfather , ' said the young fellow catching at the word , ' nor I to them , I hope .
1	' And it is in this dark dingy place of captivity , poor dear , that you pass all the hours of your life when you are not at home ? ' ' Not at home , or not on the road there , or on the road here , my love .
1	<NAME> , exulting in the long-looked-for event , jingled and jingled the heavy gold watch-chain that depended from below his trim blue coat , whereof the buttons sparkled phosphorescently in the feeble rays of the distant fire .
1	The waiter returned , and ushered three gentlemen into the room .
1	Being somewhat negligently braced , however , and , moreover , but imperfectly buttoned , they fell in a series of not the most graceful folds over a pair of shoes sufficiently down at heel to display a pair of very soiled white stockings .
1	" You with an old father , and you with pleasant and playful ways ? " " Well ! " returned <NAME> .
1	Perhaps you have often thought the same .
1	Do n't think me hard with you , my dear , but as soon as ever you feel equal to it , get your shoes on and be ready . "
1	His cunning was fresh with the day , and his qualms were gone with the night -- in which particulars it is not improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the <NAME> of <NAME> , that fine morning .
1	Accordingly , when she had gained her bedchamber , bolted herself in , and began to meditate on the scene she had just witnessed , the most terrific pictures of slaughter and destruction presented themselves to her imagination ; among which , a full-length portrait of <NAME> borne home by four men , with the embellishment of a whole barrelful of bullets in his left side , was among the very least .
1	Go up stairs and get me my bonnet and shawl .
1	Slowly and thoughtfully , <NAME> ' s eyes turned from the door by which <NAME> had gone out , to <NAME> , rising from the carpet .
1	Every time I wrote to you. ' The <NAME> took off his glazed hat , hung it on his hook , and smoothing his hair from behind with his hand , sat gazing at the group around him : a perfect image of wondering resignation .
1	There are engagements to be met , this week , which would bring the catastrophe before many days were over , even if I would postpone it for a single day by going on for that space , secretly knowing what I know .
1	" It is the law. " " It 's hard in the law to spile a man , I think .
1	' They hear of poor Jews often , and are very good to them. ' ' Bother that ! ' returned <NAME> .
1	And now , ' said <NAME> , with a real and genuine earnestness shining through the levity of his manner and his slipshod speech , ' I do conjure my relative , not to stop half way , but to set right , as far as she can , whatever she has done wrong -- not for the honour of her family , not for her own fame , not for any of those considerations which unfortunate circumstances have induced her to regard as hollow , and in point of fact , as approaching to humbug -- but because it is wrong , and not right. ' <NAME> ' s legs consented to take him away after this ; and leaving them alone together , he shut the door .
1	' Ah , to be sure ! ' returned the Patriarch .
1	And so , like the country mouse in the second year of a famine , come to see the town mouse , and timidly threading his way to the town-mouse ' s lodging through a city of cats , this old man passes in the streets .
1	' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , beckoning me aside into a window .
1	' Indeed , indeed , it is ! ' ' That ' s well ! -- and the waking -- ' faltered the old man .
1	" Doctor Manette at home ? " Expected home .
1	And yet I am rash to say so .
1	I ' ll bet that I ' d find her if she was above ground , I would , as quick as anybody , master .
1	But , less inexorable than iron , steel , and brass , it brought its varying seasons even into that wilderness of smoke and brick , and made the only stand that ever _was_ made in the place against its direful uniformity .
1	' There the ith , <NAME> , ' he said , sweeping her with a professional glance as if she were being adjusted in her seat , ' and the ' ll do you juthtithe .
1	" I have achieved that reputation , I suppose . "
1	But even if there was nothing else in it to be sorry for and ashamed of , it is such a bad return to you -- ' ' Hush ! ' said <NAME> , smiling and touching her lips with his hand .
1	Book the Second -- the <NAME> Thread I .
1	The dolls ' dressmaker looked on until he rolled himself into a corner with his <NAME> slippers uppermost , and then , resolving in the first place to address her ministration to the salt and snuff , gave him more water and slapped his back .
1	'Let me say a prayer .
1	' <NAME> ' s in this , I see , <NAME> ? ' he said to Mr Abel Garland .
1	I should like a glass of water .
1	' Yes , I know I am wrong , ' she pleaded timidly , ' don ' t think any worse of me ; it has grown up with me here. ' The prison , which could spoil so many things , had tainted <NAME> ' s mind no more than this .
1	They may have been realised , or they may not have been realised -- ' ' Let us say , then , may not have been realised , ' observed Mr Meagles .
1	Why is Mrs. <NAME> so earnestly entreated not to agitate herself about this warming-pan , unless ( as is no doubt the case ) it is a mere cover for hidden fire -- a mere substitute for some endearing word or promise , agreeably to a preconcerted system of correspondence , artfully contrived by <NAME> with a view to his contemplated desertion , and which I am not in a condition to explain ?
1	<NAME> let the weedur send her lattle boy to yan o ' our school-measthers , while there ' s a harse to hoold in a ' <NAME> , or a gootther to lie asleep in .
1	' Won ' t you say , some of us ? ' ' Meaning , ' returned the little creature , ' every one of you , but you .
1	She , who coils her fascinations round me like a pure angelic rattlesnake !
1	' Come ! ' said the <NAME> , nudging him with his elbow , ' now ' s your time !
1	' <NAME> ' t cry , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , in a transport of enthusiasm .
1	' Till it poured down like rain , ' said <NAME> .
1	' Yes , ' replied <NAME> , ' and a regular expedition we ' ll make of it .
1	Probably to assure herself that it is not the assent of a mere automaton , she reverses the form of her next sentence .
1	But looking at the old man as he stood quiet with his head bowed and his eyes cast down , he felt that to relinquish an inch of his baldness , an inch of his grey hair , an inch of his coat-skirt , an inch of his hat-brim , an inch of his walking-staff , would be to relinquish hundreds of pounds .
1	<NAME> , they know me at the stage-door I suppose .
1	' Very good , ' responded <NAME> , ' question anything you like when it ' s your turn to speak , but don ' t interrupt me. ' ' I beg your pardon , ' said <NAME> .
1	It was exactly reproduced in the dress he now wore .
1	" A bad un , I 'll be bound , " said Mrs. Joe triumphantly , " or he would n't have given it to the boy !
1	If I had been her secretary , steward , half-brother , poor relation , -- if I had been a younger brother of her appointed husband , -- I could not have seemed to myself further from my hopes when I was nearest to her .
1	But you are a young gentleman , <NAME> , and my adwice to you is , to cheer up , sir , to keep a good heart , and to know your own walue .
1	Regularly every Sunday , morning and afternoon , she occupied the same seat with the boy at her side ; and though they were both poorly dressed -- much more so than many of their neighbours who were in a lower station -- they were always neat and clean .
1	I wish to hear you state it to me , father. ' Strange to relate , <NAME> was not so collected at this moment as his daughter was .
1	' Do you know -- what ' s a-name -- Doctors ' Commons ? ' ' Yes , Sir. ' ' Where is it ? ' ' <NAME> ' s <NAME> , <NAME> ; low archway on the carriage side , bookseller ' s at one corner , hotel on the other , and two porters in the middle as touts for licences. ' ' Touts for licences ! ' said the gentleman .
1	' The <NAME> was very good to me .
1	The gate at which they had entered , was softly unfastened and opened by <NAME> ; merely exchanging a nod with their mysterious acquaintance , the married couple emerged into the wet and darkness outside .
1	He lived at the last house in Bleeding Heart Yard , and his name was over a little gateway .
1	However , ' said <NAME> , relapsing into the cheerful , chattering tone , which was habitual to her , ' I have said my say , and a very long say it is , and a very wrong say too , I shouldn ' t wonder at all .
1	It would be mean to suspect him .
1	My narrative finished , and their questions exhausted , I then produced <NAME> 's authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for <NAME> .
1	Noticing him at his distance , she turns an inquiring look on the other Mercury who has brought her home .
1	" 'How has this been done , monsieur ? '
1	I knew this meant , in our local dialect , like two young thrushes , and received it as a compliment .
1	she ' s more fashionable. ' But between <NAME> and <NAME> there was this one difference , among many others , that <NAME> was in no danger of being captivated by <NAME> .
1	My mother deferred to her very much -- more than usual , it occurred to me -- and we were all three excellent friends ; still we were different from what we used to be , and were not so comfortable among ourselves .
1	The door yielded to the pressure , and they passed in together .
1	Love at first sight is a trite expression quite sufficiently discussed ; enough that in certain smouldering natures like this man ' s , that passion leaps into a blaze , and makes such head as fire does in a rage of wind , when other passions , but for its mastery , could be held in chains .
1	Indeed ! ' ' Yes , ' pursued my aunt , ' and he has done a pretty piece of business .
1	Finally , I went out into the air , with a dim perception that there was something unwonted in the conduct of the sunshine , and found that I had slumberously got to the turnpike without having taken any account of the road .
1	) , I shall away betimes tomorrow morning .
1	And after observing that the teachers were of a class and character well suited to the spirit of the place , I took leave of the infants with a lighter heart than ever I have taken leave of pauper infants yet .
1	' <NAME> ' at all , <NAME> , ' replied his attendant .
1	Then <NAME> unlocked the door and picked up my sister , who had dropped insensible at the window ( but who had seen the fight first , I think ) , and who was carried into the house and laid down , and who was recommended to revive , and would do nothing but struggle and clench her hands in <NAME> 's hair .
1	Very little of the beef was done either ; and the ham ( which was also from the German-sausage shop round the corner ) was in a similar predicament .
1	' A new boy , young gentlemen , ' said the <NAME> ; ' Trotwood Copperfield. ' One <NAME> , who was the head-boy , then stepped out of his place and welcomed me .
1	WHY should the <NAME> have refused the note ?
1	exclaims <NAME> , clapping her hands after a twentieth repetition of this remark .
1	And this from which we run away , striking out the light and overturning one another into the street , is all that represents him .
1	The way to <NAME> ' s destination led them past the door , and they were going straight towards it .
1	The gentleman who was spreading the marmalade returned , without looking up from that occupation , ' What did he call the <NAME> ? ' ' Called him Lovely , ' said the other gentleman .
1	' To be sure , I opened the packet. ' ' And read it ? ' said the old man .
1	I find myself suddenly checked and stopped short , in the execution of my design , by a mystery which I can not penetrate .
1	Something to this general purpose I made out , but I was thrown into such a tumult of alarm , and hurry and distress , that in spite of every effort I could make to subdue my agitation , I did not seem , to myself , fully to recover my right mind until hours had passed .
1	' Sam ! ' cried <NAME> , calling after him , ' <NAME> !
1	On his way down , he overtook , in one of the passages , a stranger genteelly dressed in black , who was also moving towards the dining-room .
1	Go straight to the school , and say that you and I agreed upon it -- that we can ' t overcome father ' s opposition -- that father will never trouble them , but will never take you back .
1	Well ; all sorts of humbugs profess morality .
1	' And I never , ' added <NAME> , ' was more delighted in my life than to observe last night , my dear , that your good sense had already told you this. ' With which sentiment , and various hints of the pleasure she derived from the knowledge that her daughter inherited so large an instalment of her own excellent sense and discretion ( to nearly the full measure of which she might hope , with care , to succeed in time ) , Mrs. <NAME> concluded a very long and rather illegible letter .
1	The means of happiness are on the cards and the dice .
1	One of his eyes ( perhaps the eye that used to peep through the keyhole ) was also weak , and looked larger than the other , as if it couldn ' t collect itself .
1	His coat was ever so sleek , and his complexion so clear , that the prince resolved to essay the purifying qualities of the same water that his friend resorted to .
1	I had had the key that was found , made long before .
1	' No less a person , I assure you , ' said the <NAME> of the <NAME> .
1	'Give her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> ; 'and you slap her hands , <NAME> , while <NAME> undoes the petticuts . '
1	If there 's any stuff in the world that I hate and detest , it 's the stuff he and Ma talk .
1	As he bent forward , to be nearer , with the utmost show of delicacy and respect , and with his teeth persuasively arrayed , in a self-depreciating smile , she felt as if she could have struck him dead .
1	And thus I slowly lose them .
1	asked <NAME> , in the same hollow whisper ; 'No sick wretch or idiot in some other bed ?
1	' You ' re a good fellow , <NAME> , ' said the host , grasping his hand .
1	' Everything was done for the best , my dear <NAME> ; everything was done for the kindest and best , we know .
1	What is their unanimous declaration ?
1	I deserve a bow now and then .
1	Do you see ? ' ' I understand , ' said <NAME> .
1	Once more I say , time presses .
1	Is it possible ! ' cried <NAME> , ' that anyone of my own sex can have sat by , and not have seen the misery these men have caused me ?
1	' Pretty well. ' ' And yet , ' said I , ' I get so miserable and worried , and am so unsteady and irresolute in my power of assuring myself , that I know I must want -- shall I call it -- reliance , of some kind ? ' ' Call it so , if you will , ' said <NAME> .
1	Do you know , that I observe a great change in one of this family -- a very extraordinary change ? ' ' In whom ? ' asked <NAME> , anxiously .
1	' Then he has done nothing .
1	As the tow-rope was slackened by a turn of the stream and dipped into the water , such a confusion stole into her mind that she thought she saw the forms of her dead children and dead grandchildren peopling the barge , and waving their hands to her in solemn measure ; then , as the rope tightened and came up , dropping diamonds , it seemed to vibrate into two parallel ropes and strike her , with a twang , though it was far off .
1	It comprised several thousand men ; the members of various ' <NAME> Auxiliary Temperance Societies ; ' and was marshalled by officers on horseback , who cantered briskly up and down the line , with scarves and ribbons of bright colours fluttering out behind them gaily .
1	So having warned him out of <NAME> , I made an afternoon of it to warn him to keep out of it now he WAS away , and go farther from it , and maintain a bright look-out that I did n't catch him coming back again . "
1	" Not to be always selfish , talking of my son , who has gone to seek his fortune and to find a wife -- when do you mean to seek <NAME> fortune and to find a husband , <NAME> ?
1	" Your early recollection , my dear , will supply the gloomy medium through which all this was seen and expressed by the writer , and the distorted religion which clouded her mind with impressions of the need there was for the child to expiate an offence of which she was quite innocent .
1	By and by she tries again .
1	Now , what do you say ? ' ' I say , ' returned Mr Boffin , leaning forward in alarmed appeal , with his hands on his knees , ' that I am sure I don ' t want to trifle .
1	" How de do , gentlemen , how de do !
1	As this change stole on <NAME> , once like sunshine in the <NAME> ' s house , the <NAME> became older in appearance , and more grave ; but the sweetness of his temper , the placid kindness of his manner , and his benevolent solicitude for her , if they were capable of any increase , were increased .
1	' There ' s a footstep ! ' exclaims <NAME> .
1	Will he be <NAME> , or <NAME> , or <NAME> , or <NAME> , or what will he be ? " And now when I look at him ; a precious , unconscious , helpless infant , with no use in his little arms but to tear his little cap , and no use in his little legs but to kick his little self -- when I see him a lying on his mother ' s lap , cooing and cooing , and , in his innocent state , almost a choking hisself with his little fist -- when I see him such a infant as he is , and think that that uncle <NAME> , as was once a-going to be so fond of him , has withdrawed himself away , such a feeling of wengeance comes over me as no language can depicter , and I feel as if even that holy babe was a telling me to hate him. ' This affecting picture moved Mrs. Kenwigs deeply .
1	' Landless. ' ' Tick that off , ' said <NAME> , taking another trot , and then coming back .
1	Their undisguised intimacy , and the character I now know <NAME> to bear , made that not at all adventurous .
1	When I awoke , the wind had risen , and the sign of the house ( the Ship ) was creaking and banging about , with noises that startled me .
1	No one knows how ' tis .
1	Now , <NAME> , I have done with stipulations. " Though he called me <NAME> , and began rather to make up to me , he still could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion ; and even now he occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me while he spoke , as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to my disparagement , if he only chose to mention them .
1	<NAME> <NAME> got it ? " " Yes , sir , " said both the men together .
1	Showing , among a Variety of pleasant Matters , how majestic and impartial <NAME> was ; and how <NAME> returned <NAME> ' s <NAME> as heavily as it came- -With another Matter , which will be found in its Place 26 .
1	<NAME> Bitherstone formerly of ours .
1	I strongly suspect him of having had a hand in spiriting away Lizzie. ' ' Everything , ' returned <NAME> impatiently , ' seems , by a fatality , to bring us round to <NAME> .
1	All the Pickwickians were in most blooming array ; and there was a terrific roaring on the grass in front of the house , occasioned by all the men , boys , and hobbledehoys attached to the farm , each of whom had got a white bow in his button-hole , and all of whom were cheering with might and main ; being incited thereto , and stimulated therein by the precept and example of <NAME> , who had managed to become mighty popular already , and was as much at home as if he had been born on the land .
1	You don ' t consider them intrusive I hope ? ' said the Secretary with deference .
1	To hope to do what I seek to do , I must be what I have been so long .
1	For some years he continued a deadly foe to <NAME> , protesting that he had a better opinion of him when he was supposed to have stolen the five-pound note , than when he was shown to be perfectly free of the crime ; inasmuch as his guilt would have had in it something daring and bold , whereas his innocence was but another proof of a sneaking and crafty disposition .
1	If you let your hand tremble so , we can never get away from them , but if you ' re only quiet now , we shall do so , easily. ' ' How ? ' muttered the old man .
1	The gradual change from land to water , on the approach to <NAME> Cuttle ' s lodgings , was curious .
1	The second officer , who had attended to it closely , then copied it out and called in another man in uniform ( there were several in an outer room ) , who took it up and went away with it .
1	<NAME> , I will -- no matter , I will do my utmost possible in all things .
1	But to be sure that was a sight behind the scenes , which nobody saw , and which nobody was meant to see .
1	' <NAME> ' t be alarmed , ' said <NAME> , coming from his easel behind the door .
1	He had left a letter at the <NAME> addressed to his physician , and his physician had got the letter , and the letter would be produced at the <NAME> on the morrow , and it would fall like a thunderbolt upon the multitude he had deluded .
1	We thank you with all our hearts , and all our love and duty .
1	I ' m an old man to begin. ' Pushing up his spectacles again ( for they were useless any longer to conceal his emotion ) , he covered his face with his hand , and sobbed aloud , and his tears fell down upon his coffee-coloured waistcoat .
1	" At a rough kind of fellow -- a sort of human hedgehog rolled up , " said <NAME> , " who is a baker in this neighbourhood and from whom we borrowed a couple of arm-chairs .
1	Let us advance by steps .
1	You can hold a knife to that black eye , as you run along .
1	My unhappy mother told me that in my illness she had been nearly frantic .
1	' I think there ' s something , ' said <NAME> , turning as pale as he could turn .
1	<NAME> ' t frown , <NAME> , don ' t frown ; I say , between you and I , _we_ know it .
1	" Quite strong enough for that , miss ! "
1	How they had employed <NAME> as their sole clerk and agent , seeing to whom he was devoted .
1	Make the most of it and think yourself lucky , but don ' t think after that to come over <NAME> with your pardners .
1	The Jew then , taking leave of his affectionate friend , returned homeward , attended by <NAME> and the boys : <NAME> , meanwhile , flinging himself on the bed , and composing himself to sleep away the time until the young lady 's return .
1	' Nor want anything , ' cried the boy .
1	I have had enough of that , and I ai n't going to have any more .
1	Some of these knights had their own weapons , helmets , coats of mail , hanging upon the walls hard by , and dangling from rusty hooks .
1	And I recollect two bursting to the opposite side of the parlour , while she was hugging me .
1	By <NAME> , I wish it was the case with us ! ' ' Why ? ' ' Because if it was , I ' d take the lead with you , <NAME> , and be as wise as <NAME> , dull Care !
1	If a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape , and he stood amongst them , there is something that would tell me how to point him out .
1	<NAME> was a sight wondrous to behold , and full of matter , when , jauntily waving his double eye-glass by its ribbon , and jauntily drooping to an <NAME> , he , in the most accidental manner ever seen , found himself at Mr Merdle ' s shoulder , and embraced that opportunity of mentioning a little point to him , on which he particularly wished to be guided by the light of his practical knowledge .
1	' What do you call this , sir ? ' demanded the schoolmaster , administering a cut with the cane to expedite the reply .
1	I wo n't squeeze you tighter than I can help .
1	<NAME> , I beg your pardon , sir !
1	Now , <NAME> , try once more , and don ' t be stupid. ' I obey the first clause of the injunction by trying once more , but am not so successful with the second , for I am very stupid .
1	So , he had been honourably dismissed to " the office " to begin the world again .
1	' Come there ! ' Mrs <NAME> was proud of the title <NAME> , which she regarded as signifying : not so much <NAME> of the house , as <NAME> of the <NAME> tongue .
1	I have been a determined character in later life , and I suppose I was then .
1	The light about the head is shining on me as I go ! ' The golden ripple on the wall came back again , and nothing else stirred in the room .
1	And thus for a fortnight matters went on .
1	' I ' m not a going to hurt you .
1	And as I felt that it came quicker , and as I felt that he saw that it came quicker , I felt that I had less chance than ever of getting anything out of him .
1	" Why , my <NAME> has been but poorly , ma'am , since she was last here -- I do n't mean with the family , ma'am , but when she was here as a bird of passage like .
1	" <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> and <NAME> .
1	I only ask you , my second mother , to consider .
1	You are one of us , as I may say. " I accepted the offer .
1	In fact , there was a story current among us ( I have no idea , and never had , on what authority , but I have believed it for so many years that I feel quite certain it is true ) , that on a frosty day , one winter-time , he actually did bestow his gaiters on a beggar-woman , who occasioned some scandal in the neighbourhood by exhibiting a fine infant from door to door , wrapped in those garments , which were universally recognized , being as well known in the vicinity as the <NAME> .
1	For some time , he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be relieved or disappointed by the intelligence ; but at length he breathed more freely ; and withdrawing his eyes , observed that it was no great matter .
1	' If he dares to refuse me a separation , I ' ll have one in law -- I can -- and I hope this will be a warning to all girls who have seen this disgraceful exhibition. ' Miss Knag , who was unquestionably the oldest girl in company , said with great solemnity , that it would be a warning to <NAME> , and so did the young ladies generally , with the exception of one or two who appeared to entertain some doubts whether such whispers could do wrong .
1	' But she is quite safe. ' ' Ha ! ' cried <NAME> , twitching a pinch of snuff out of her box , as spitefully as if she were in the very act of wrenching off the small servant ' s nose ; ' she shall be safe enough from this time , I warrant you. ' ' I hope so , ' replied the Notary .
1	There an ' t better land in the country than this perwerse lad grazed on , and yet he goes and catches cold and indigestion and what not , and then his friends brings a lawsuit against ME !
1	' I tossed off the clothes , ' said <NAME> , throwing away the table-cloth , and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid , 'got softly out of bed ; drew on a pair of -- ' 'Ladies present , <NAME> , ' murmured the tinker . '
1	I ought to have more fortitude and self-command than that .
1	No more to-night , and good-night ! ' With that he kissed her hand , and , passing out to the door where her brother stood awaiting his coming , put him cheerfully aside when he essayed to speak ; told him that , as they would see each other soon and often , he might speak at another time , if he would , but there was no leisure for it then ; and went away at a round pace , in order that no word of gratitude might follow him .
1	I ' ll think well of it. ' Their walk was almost a silent one afterwards , until it ended at the school-house .
1	You have n't got no occasion to be up to it .
1	" I pouring out of window !
1	His heart beat quickly when he bethought himself of this ; and he half resolved to turn back .
1	Of all the world , unchanged .
1	Mr Carker turning a corner , on the instant , looked back , and bowed , and disappeared , as if he rode off to the churchyard straight , to do it .
1	" You have n't looked in at all ? "
1	Secondly , to pay the rent -- here it is .
1	' But you don ' t know , ' said I , ' that <NAME> was charitable to her , with <NAME> ' s help , long before she fled from home .
1	' Stay here the while , all !
1	To wander to and fro all day , and see the cataracts from all points of view ; to stand upon the edge of the great Horse-Shoe Fall , marking the hurried water gathering strength as it approached the verge , yet seeming , too , to pause before it shot into the gulf below ; to gaze from the river ' s level up at the torrent as it came streaming down ; to climb the neighbouring heights and watch it through the trees , and see the wreathing water in the rapids hurrying on to take its fearful plunge ; to linger in the shadow of the solemn rocks three miles below ; watching the river as , stirred by no visible cause , it heaved and eddied and awoke the echoes , being troubled yet , far down beneath the surface , by its giant leap ; to have <NAME> before me , lighted by the sun and by the moon , red in the day ' s decline , and grey as evening slowly fell upon it ; to look upon it every day , and wake up in the night and hear its ceaseless voice : this was enough .
1	The <NAME> disappears , and in a few moments returns .
1	At this humorous feat he laughed outright .
1	<NAME> <NAME> was giving it , with all due secrecy and circumspection .
1	I am changed , even in the little time since you last saw me. ' ' Go thy ways with him , <NAME> , ' cried the sexton , ' and Heaven be with ye both ! ' ' I am quite ready , ' said the old man , meekly .
1	I suppose we had some notion that this was to end in marriage .
1	' Get me a coach. ' ' A coach !
1	Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were lighted , they fared forth on this duty , and made and brought home such purchases as were needful .
1	' If you will have it so , or must have it so , ' replies <NAME> , ' I ' ll not leave you here .
1	No one can assist you ; you are to work it out for yourselves .
1	' It ' s new to you , I believe ? ' said this <NAME> , when <NAME> had extolled the place .
1	And betwixt ourselves , ' sinking his voice lower yet , ' that woman ' s name ain ' t <NAME> neither , though she has a world of merits. ' <NAME> ruffled his hair again , with both hands , as a further preparation for what he was going to say , and went on , with a hand upon each of his knees : ' There was a certain person as had know ' d our Em ' ly , from the time when her father was drownded ; as had seen her constant ; when a babby , when a young gal , when a woman .
1	My dearest girl , dearer to me than anything in life , if you are unhappy , let me share your unhappiness .
1	' That wouldn ' t serve me. ' ' Wouldn ' t it ? ' said <NAME> .
1	' Did you expect to see me return as youthful as I went away , mother ? ' she said at length , turning her eyes upon the old woman .
1	' The horse-road ? ' ' Here ' s a smart lad for you ! ' cried the Captain eyeing him sternly , ' as don ' t know his own native alphabet !
1	The grass was long ; but it was trodden down nowhere , save where their own feet had crushed it .
1	As she could not explain , however , she bowed her head and thanked him ; and again she thought that the dull home , free from such embarrassments , and such reminders of her sorrow , was her natural and best retreat .
1	A small bare cell , into which the light enters through a high chink in the wall .
1	cried my guardian , quite triumphant .
1	' That there knife -- ' ' Stop , ' said the man , composedly .
1	' Mrs Blimber , ' said Mr Toots , ' allow me to present my wife. ' Mrs Blimber was delighted to receive her .
1	He was ' only a plasterer , ' Little <NAME> said , as a caution to him not to form high social expectations of <NAME> .
1	<NAME> rose the sun next morning , from his absence in strange countries and up rose <NAME> with it to receive the <NAME> , who was already at the door : having turned out earlier than was necessary , in order to get under weigh while <NAME> was still slumbering .
1	This young gentleman has to accomplish a destiny .
1	And at seven o ' clock P.M. <NAME> and his friends , and <NAME> and his wife , respectively retired to their private sitting-rooms at the <NAME> , opposite the <NAME> , <NAME> , where the waiters , from their costume , might be mistaken for Westminster boys , only they destroy the illusion by behaving themselves much better .
1	On the sideboard a variety of miscellaneous articles were huddled together , the most conspicuous of which were some very cloudy fish-sauce cruets , a couple of driving-boxes , two or three whips , and as many travelling shawls , a tray of knives and forks , and the mustard .
1	That , it was certain the prisoner had , for longer than that , been in the habit of passing and repassing between <NAME> and <NAME> , on secret business of which he could give no honest account .
1	On being asked what motive could possibly prompt him to make this strange demand , he answered that he had an irresistible propensity to get drunk ; that he was constantly indulging it , to his great misery and ruin ; that he had no power of resistance ; that he wished to be put beyond the reach of temptation ; and that he could think of no better way than this .
1	On my knees , I am certain , in my heart and soul I am certain , nothing !
1	I hope that when I have the pleasure of seeing you , next , this passing cloud will have given place to sunshine .
1	He paused to look at her , and , still holding her hand , said : ' <NAME> , I have not considered it essential to ask you one question , because the possibility implied in it appeared to me to be too remote .
1	So I went there to thank her. ' ' <NAME> , ' said her young mistress , putting her hand up over her shoulder that the other might take it , ' <NAME> almost frightened me when we parted , and I scarcely like to think of her just now as having been so near me without my knowing it .
1	" Well , well , " said my guardian , comforting him ; " well , well , well , dear boy ! "
1	Wake up , some of you ! "
1	I shall come to you again in your regular order , " returned Mrs. Pardiggle with demonstrative cheerfulness .
1	I do ; I say again , I do .
1	A broad , fine , honest sun lighted up the green pastures and dimpled water with the semblance of summer , while it left the travellers all the invigorating freshness of that early time of year .
1	<NAME> ha ! ' <NAME> gave a satisfactory account of all the little household at <NAME> .
1	For these particulars or generalities concerning <NAME> , Mr <NAME> was indebted in the course of the day to his own eyes and to Mrs Affery ' s tongue .
1	' You may go. ' The waiter complied , wondering much who the gentleman could be , and what he wanted ; the little old gentleman , waiting till he was out of sight , tapped at the door .
1	" The airs the fellow gives himself ! "
1	<NAME> & <NAME> for the plaintiff , Aug. 28 , 1827. " All regular , <NAME> ; perfectly. ' <NAME> coughed and looked at <NAME> , who said ' Perfectly , ' also .
1	' Good gracious , <NAME> , -- I should say Mr Clennam , far more proper -- the climb we have had to get up here and how ever to get down again without a fire-escape and Mr F. ' s Aunt slipping through the steps and bruised all over and you in the machinery and foundry way too only think , and never told us ! ' Thus , <NAME> , out of breath .
1	' What did you wish to know next , <NAME> ? ' ' What became of <NAME> ?
1	I have been wretched , too .
1	After this , he smoked four pipes successively in the little parlour by himself , and was discovered chuckling , at the expiration of as many hours .
1	' It ' s almost enough to make us get married after all , isn ' t it ? ' said <NAME> .
1	' I shall feel proud of your acquaintance , <NAME> , ' said the little doctor .
1	Mr <NAME> looked at him , at his sister , at the walls , at the ceiling , at the floor -- everywhere but at <NAME> , who stood quite stupefied and motionless .
1	It ' s only necessary to consider his history here , ' said <NAME> , ' to know that. ' ' He ' s a monster of meanness ! ' said my aunt .
1	He stumbles down the stairs and presently comes back , shading a flaring taper with his hand .
1	But his father -- and his uncle -- were the most profligate coachmen that ever sat upon a box . "
1	' I have been afraid to go near it ; for I am not often down in that part of the church , and do not know the ground. ' ' Come down with me , ' said the old man .
1	<NAME> of vich , they retires from the world , and shuts themselves up in pikes ; partly with the view of being solitary , and partly to rewenge themselves on mankind by takin ' tolls. ' ' Dear me , ' said <NAME> , ' I never knew that before. ' ' Fact , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> ; ' if they was gen ' l ' m ' n , you ' d call ' em misanthropes , but as it is , they only takes to pike-keepin ' . ' With such conversation , possessing the inestimable charm of blending amusement with instruction , did <NAME> beguile the tediousness of the journey , during the greater part of the day .
1	Oliver availed himself of the kind permission , and fell to the floor in a fainting fit .
1	' It may be my long absence and inexperience that lead me to the conclusion ; but if plain speakers are scarce in this part of the world , I fancy plain dealers are still scarcer .
1	How should you like to grow up a clever man , and write books , eh ? '
1	' Does she sing at all ? ' I asked .
1	' A nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy ! '
1	It was a curious place : a large wall , with a gate in the middle , and a gas-light burning inside .
1	" 'Marquis , ' said the boy , turned to him with his eyes opened wide , and his right hand raised , 'in the days when all these things are to be answered for , I summon you and yours , to the last of your bad race , to answer for them .
1	He frightened every one away from him when he was alive , to profit us when he was dead !
1	'Not at all , my dear , ' said <NAME> humbly .
1	The bank had foreclosed a mortgage effected on the property thus pleasantly situated , by one of the <NAME> magnates , who , in his determination to make a shorter cut than usual to an enormous fortune , overspeculated himself by about two hundred thousand pounds .
1	Having abundance of time for his usual methodical toilette , <NAME> presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual white linen , and with his usual neat leg .
1	I wanted to persuade <NAME> to come and see <NAME> , but on my proposing it she ran off to her own room and locked herself in ; so I went to Traddles without her , and walked away with him on air .
1	' Your mother will be fit to jump out of her skin , my boy , when she hears of this , ' said <NAME> to his son .
1	'You can do nothing to help me .
1	As he could not move a hand , he could make no sign of distress ; but , through this close watching ( if through no secret sympathy or power ) the little creature attained an understanding of him that <NAME> did not possess .
1	This was the state of matters , on the afternoon of , what I may be excused for calling , that eventful and important Friday .
1	' May I ask , ' said I , ' without any hazard of repeating the mistake , how my old friends <NAME> and <NAME> are ? ' ' Miss Wickfield , ' said <NAME> , now turning red , ' is , as she always is , a pattern , and a bright example .
1	<NAME> things than the <NAME> had at that time to contend with , would have yielded before his persevering purpose .
1	This deed was done last night at ten o'clock .
1	' They are a depraved , worthless set .
1	One lacquey carried the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence ; a second , milled and frothed the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function ; a third , presented the favoured napkin ; a fourth ( he of the two gold watches ) , poured the chocolate out .
1	' But having had the honour of making that gentleman ' s acquaintance at the hotel at <NAME> , where we and much good company met some time ago , and having had the honour of exchanging company and conversation with that gentleman on several subsequent excursions , I can hear nothing -- no , not even from one of your appearance and station , sir -- detrimental to that gentleman. ' ' You are in no danger , sir , of hearing any such thing from me .
1	Here , <NAME> coughed impatiently ; which appeared to afford <NAME> the most exquisite delight .
1	I have set these people by the ears , and made two new enemies , where , <NAME> knows , I needed none .
1	' All I will add is , <NAME> forbid that I should touch my Uncle ' s possessions , <NAME> !
1	Upon the latter , sits a man of sixty ; reading .
1	From this day , <NAME> was seldom left alone ; but was placed in almost constant communication with the two boys , who played the old game with the Jew every day : whether for their own improvement or <NAME> 's , <NAME> best knew .
1	He darted onward -- straight , headlong -- dashing through brier and brake , and leaping gate and fence as madly as his dog , who careered with loud and sounding bark before him .
1	He cast back a dark look , and a threatening motion of the hand , towards the spot where he had left the bolder villain ; and went on his way : busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment , which he wrenched tightly in his grasp , as though there were a hated enemy crushed with every motion of his fingers .
1	You are not to pocket other people 's pounds , shillings , and pence and escape scot-free . "
1	' Well , <NAME> ? ' ' Mr Headstone coming home , ma ' am. ' In about a minute , <NAME> again hailed .
1	' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , with such a sudden accession of violence that <NAME> started in his boots , ' I throw you off for ever , miss .
1	Why , if it had been -- a smothering instead of a wedding , ' Mrs <NAME> cast about in her mind with great pains for this form of expression , ' I couldn ' t have said a word upon it , against them two clever ones. ' ' In good faith , I believe so. ' ' And so you may , Arthur. ' ' Affery , what girl was that in my mother ' s room just now ? ' ' <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> in a rather sharp key .
1	You have pawned your wardrobe. ' ' Everything -- <NAME> ' s too -- all shirts gone -- never mind -- saves washing .
1	' I beg your pardon , <NAME> ; but have you ever done this sort of thing in your time ? ' said <NAME> .
1	For it is past your usual time , and will soon be late , and the way is long , and there is much company out of doors to-night. ' She accepted the support he offered her , and they slowly passed out of the churchyard .
1	He found a contest still always going on in his breast between his promise to keep <NAME> in none but good aspects before the mind of Mr Meagles , and his enforced observation of <NAME> in aspects that had no good in them .
1	When he put his lips to hers , besides , he took himself into custody by the wrists , and backed himself among the ottomans and chairs and tables as if he were his own Police officer , saying to himself , ' Now , none of that !
1	If it had ever been meant to be lived in , I might have thought it small , or inconvenient , or lonely ; but never having been designed for any such use , it became a perfect abode .
1	' Favourites ? ' repeated <NAME> , with the veins in his forehead swelling quickly .
1	Could you give me any account of her whatever ? ' ' None , ' returned the Patriarch , shaking his big head with his utmost benevolence .
1	' And now , <NAME> , ' pursued <NAME> , ' I ' ll make a confession to you .
1	Still , nobody appeared , to claim the dusty youngster from <NAME> , <NAME> .
1	' I should hope so , ' returned Mr Toots .
1	One gentleman who stood among this group , appeared to take upon himself the functions of a master of the ceremonies .
1	As to all the rest—What will be , will be .
1	' What do you mean , boy ? ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> ' t agitate yourself , Louisa. ' ' It ' s very foolish of me , ' said <NAME> , sitting down , and taking out her pocket-handkerchief , ' but he ' s -- he ' s such a perfect Dombey ! ' Mr <NAME> coughed .
1	" My dear ma'am , " returns <NAME> , moving across the small apartment , " the humble individual who now addresses you received that young lady in <NAME> when she first came here from the establishment to which you have alluded .
1	Both she and her brother , as they walked all together through the ancient streets , took great delight in what he pointed out of the <NAME> and the <NAME> ruin , and wondered—so his notes ran on—much as if they were beautiful barbaric captives brought from some wild tropical dominion .
1	At this point , the <NAME> , with a show of being very particular with a view to proceedings to be had thereafter , desired the jailer to communicate 'the names of them two files as was on the bench . '
1	' Go away , and shut the door .
1	It was evident , however , that the only intellectual exercise was that of imitation and memory .
1	As I had a sorrowful wish to see the old place once more , before it was locked up , I engaged to meet them there in the evening .
1	Give me a sign that you attend to me. ' She slightly and constrainedly moves her hand .
1	It was not lost upon <NAME> , who delighted in torturing him , or indeed anybody else , when he could .
1	<NAME> ' s mother , drying her eyes ( and moistening them , poor soul , more than she dried them ) , now took from the ground a small basket , and submissively addressed herself to the turnkey , saying , would he please to listen to her for a minute ?
1	I told him that he was more like himself in those latter words than in anything he had said yet .
1	They hurried away , through several streets , without stopping or speaking .
1	Oh , <NAME> ! ' cried <NAME> , putting her hands before her face , as her tears started on it , ' I almost feel as if I had been papa ' s enemy , instead of his loving child .
1	Our customers over there , seem not to be able to confide their property to us fast enough .
1	I was disagreeable too , <NAME> ; we were all of us disagreeable together .
1	Thank you , <NAME> , I do n't know but what I WILL take a marrow pudding . "
1	At first they were faintly discernible in the mist , and above them the later stars still glimmered .
1	What was all this though -- even all this -- to the extraordinary dissipation that ensued , when <NAME> , walking into an oyster-shop as bold as if he lived there , and not so much as looking at the counter or the man behind it , led his party into a box -- a private box , fitted up with red curtains , white table-cloth , and cruet-stand complete -- and ordered a fierce gentleman with whiskers , who acted as waiter and called him , him Christopher <NAME> , ' sir , ' to bring three dozen of his largest-sized oysters , and to look sharp about it !
1	Like the <NAME> of questionable jollity in the song , They cared for <NAME> , no not they , and <NAME> cared for them .
1	While these occurrences were in progress , <NAME> made the discovery that <NAME> had a fascinating influence over her .
1	She will repeat it , in character , <NAME> , to-morrow morning. ' ' In character ! ' ' As <NAME> .
1	Having darkened the window , and straightened the pieces of carpet on the floor , the <NAME> surveyed these preparations with great delight , and descended to the little parlour again , to bring <NAME> to her bower .
1	<NAME> <NAME> sat in the workhouse parlour , with his eyes moodily fixed on the cheerless grate , whence , as it was summer time , no brighter gleam proceeded , than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun , which were sent back from its cold and shining surface .
1	So far as my small maid is concerned , I might suppose time to have stood for seven years as still as the mill did half an hour ago , since little Emma , <NAME> 's sister , is exactly what <NAME> used to be .
1	An elderly lady , though not very far advanced in years , with a proud carriage and a handsome face , was in the doorway as we alighted ; and greeting <NAME> as ' My dearest <NAME> , ' folded him in her arms .
1	' And where did you leave <NAME> , reverend sir ? ' <NAME> had left him at <NAME> .
1	His chair was opposite to the window , and he had taken his soup , and was raising his glass of <NAME> to his lips , when he put it down .
1	<NAME> take it away. " I had never been struck at so keenly , for my thanklessness to <NAME> , as through the brazen impostor Pumblechook .
1	Seized with an augmented terror of myself which turned me cold , I ran from myself and everything , retraced the way by which I had come , and never paused until I had gained the lodge-gate , and the park lay sullen and black behind me .
1	It was you , was it ? ' ' Me ! ' returned <NAME> , in a loud tone .
1	' The fact is , I was ruined by having money left me. ' ' Come , come , ' said <NAME> , ' that von ' t do .
1	Surely this is the heaviest of the three. ' ' You ' ll find ' em much of a muchness , I expect , ' says <NAME> .
1	And then they fell to shaking hands most heartily again .
1	Now , you ' re all of you to drink the health of your best friend <NAME> , and wish him health and long life and many happy returns of this day , both for his own sake and that of your old masters , who consider him an inestimable treasure .
1	' The pang , ' said <NAME> , ' of consigning a child , even to you , my dear <NAME> , is one of the most excruciating imaginable , and combined with a naturally delicate constitution , and the extreme stupidity of the pastry-cook who has undertaken the breakfast , is almost too much for my poor strength .
1	And <NAME> , " says <NAME> , opening his arms , " here 's children too !
1	In the capital of the <NAME> ' s name and dignity , such a child was merely a piece of base coin that couldn ' t be invested -- a bad Boy -- nothing more .
1	I am invested with no authority for diverging from them .
1	My speculations were speedily set at rest , however , for as soon as we had dined , there came rumbling up the street , shaking its sides like a corpulent giant , a kind of barge on wheels .
1	I swear it before the God that saw it !
1	' You ' re coming to yourself again now. ' ' -- As a matter of business , ' pursued <NAME> , speaking slowly and firmly , as a man who has made up his mind to say no more , ' because I thought she might make some impression on the silly youth you have taken in hand and are lending good help to ruin , I knew -- knowing him -- that it would be long before he outraged her girl ' s feelings , and that unless he offended by mere puppyism and emptiness , he would , with a little management , respect the sex and conduct even of his usurer ' s niece .
1	Perhaps with an eye to first impressions , Mr <NAME> was very carefully and trimly dressed , that morning .
1	It brought a vague expression of dissatisfaction into Mr <NAME> ' s face ; but the door being opened , it was quickly gone .
1	But my understanding for all this was gone .
1	Is it not a fact , <NAME> , that you have just now been unable to command your feelings even before me , whose eyes you had so completely closed ? ' ' I have made no complaint , ' sobbed <NAME> .
1	There ' s a Mausoleum down at my place , in the park , but I ' m afraid it ' s in bad repair , and , in point of fact , in a devil of a state .
1	It had no set beginning , as <NAME> , or <NAME> , or <NAME> , or <NAME> , but ran thus : -- " I am to come to <NAME> the day after to-morrow by the midday coach .
1	We changed again , and yet again , and it was now too late and too far to go back , and I went on .
1	With these words , he took a thick stick from <NAME> 's hands , who , having delivered another to <NAME> , busied himself in fastening on <NAME> 's cape .
1	I was on the wrong side of the post .
1	said <NAME> , clapping him on the shoulder with an air of protection that had something serious in it , though he laughed .
1	Having dismissed his attendant , and seen the box safely deposited in the coach-office , he looked into the coffee-room in search of <NAME> .
1	'If your inclinations chime with your sense of duty -- ' <NAME> began .
1	He rarely joined them on the Saturdays now .
1	But I held to it , and the harder it was , the stronger I held , for I was determined , and my mind firm made up .
1	It arrested his attention , and he sat pausing over it , until he took off the rusty colourless wisp that he wore round his throat , and substituted the red neckerchief , leaving the long ends flowing .
1	I felt as if I had been living in a palace of cards , which had tumbled down , leaving only <NAME> and me among the ruins ; I felt as if some grim enchanter had drawn a magic circle round the innocent goddess of my heart , which nothing indeed but those same strong pinions , capable of carrying so many people over so much , would enable me to enter !
1	<NAME> <NAME> was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but <NAME> .
1	I suppose I expressed it , somehow ; for after she had looked at me attentively for a little while , she appeared to understand , and replied in a low tone : ' I know you will do as I ask you , if I tell you I am very earnest in it .
1	' Not at all so. ' ' She is a tiresome creature , ' said <NAME> , pouting .
1	He does not know it ; we must go to him from here , to tell him of it .
1	' You have got good measure , <NAME> ; but the price is not so bad. -- And you , ' said <NAME> , turning to the other visitor , ' do you buy anything here , miss ? ' ' <NAME> , sir. ' ' Nor sell anything neither , miss ? ' ' <NAME> , sir. ' Looking askew at the questioner , <NAME> stole her hand up to her friend ' s , and drew her friend down , so that she bent beside her on her knee .
1	Now , brother Ned , my dear fellow , I ' m ready .
1	' You have purposely cast a dreadful suspicion upon my mother ' s house .
1	Do you believe there is any chance of her consent , to balance against the outrage it would be to her ( loving dear old lady ! )
1	First , not a word more from you about the past .
1	said the board , looking very knowing ; 'we are the fellows to set this to rights ; we 'll stop it all , in no time . '
1	I am almost sure he will grant it now , if I ask him .
1	His features were contracted into a perpetual smile ; and his teeth were in such perfect order that it was difficult at a small distance to tell the real from the false .
1	It appeared to be something droll , for occasionally there was a laugh and a cry of " Silence ! "
1	I hope I may not be so unlucky as to make you think I mean to offend you again , for I never have meant to offend you yet , when I say I don ' t understand it. ' ' Sir , ' said <NAME> , ' will you have the perfidy to deny that you know and long have known that I felt towards <NAME> , call it not the presumption of love , but adoration and sacrifice ? ' ' Indeed , <NAME> , I will not have any perfidy if I know it ; why you should suspect me of it I am at a loss to think .
1	' Do you mean that a prisoner forgives his prison ? ' said she , slowly and with emphasis .
1	Every possible inquiry was made , and every place was searched .
1	I am the Relieving Officer appointed by eternal ordinance to do my work ; I am not held in estimation according as I shirk it .
1	My Lady , with a disdainful gesture of the hand that holds the screen , assures him of his being worth no complaint from her .
1	He tried to shut it out , but it would stream in .
1	' But we must think of dear Pa , ' said <NAME> ; ' I haven ' t told dear Pa ; let us speak to Pa. ' Upon which they turned to do so .
1	I do n't care for what you say at all .
1	' Yes , ' said <NAME> ; ' but that ' s nothin ' if we could find out the young ' ooman ; ' and here <NAME> , with many digressions upon the personal beauty of <NAME> , and the unspeakable tortures he had experienced since he last saw her , gave a faithful account of <NAME> ' s present predicament .
1	He was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it , to appreciate it comfortably I thought , or to have anybody to dine with him , without making a chop with his jaws at the visitor .
1	" Much obliged to you , ma'am ! "
1	On a table by the window in <NAME> , we set out the work <NAME> procured for him -- which was to make , I forget how many copies of a legal document about some right of way -- and on another table we spread the last unfinished original of the great Memorial .
1	A little later on in the dinner , <NAME> reviewed the sermon with some severity , and intimated -- in the usual hypothetical case of the Church being " thrown open " -- what kind of sermon he would have given them .
1	There is no other message to send , I thank you , dear papa , that it would be at all agreeable to you to take. ' They parted in an outer drawing-room , where only Mr <NAME> waited on his lady , and dutifully bided his time for shaking hands .
1	Well , " returned <NAME> , going on again , and lifting off his hat to give his spikes free play , " he 's a tradesman. " " What 's his goods , father ? " asked the brisk Young <NAME> .
1	But having risked discovery by venturing here at all , I should have been glad to track some part of the way. ' With which singular words he abandoned his search , came up out of <NAME> , and took the way past <NAME> .
1	Do I know , without being very wise , where you would like to go , direct from these walls and from this room ? ' ' You do , ' returned <NAME> .
1	The visit did not originate with him. ' ' He had some conversation with the poor man .
1	It struck me as being not at all like the manner or appearance of a man who had advanced in life by the usual road of years , cares , and experiences .
1	With all those yearnings , and gushings , and impulsive throbbings that we have implanted in our souls , and which are so very charming , why are we not more natural ? ' Mr <NAME> said it was very true , very true .
1	They suggested one distinct idea to her , for she said with her placid smile , and shaking her head , " My good <NAME> , at half the cost , this weak child might have been equipped for <NAME> ! "
1	I am quite sure , if you will let me say so , that the object of your choice would greatly prefer to follow your fortunes far and wide , however moderate or poor , and see you happy , doing your duty and pursuing your chosen way , than to have the hope of being , or even to be , very rich with you ( if such a thing were possible ) at the cost of dragging years of procrastination and anxiety and of your indifference to other aims .
1	Mr Toots and his wife had , in fact , just arrived there ; having been at the <NAME> ' s to seek him , and having there obtained the address .
1	' When are you at home ? ' ' When you like. ' ' Breakfast-time ? ' said <NAME> , in her abruptest and shortest manner .
1	I have , in my possession , in his hand and pocket-book , several similar imitations of <NAME> ' s signature , here and there defaced by fire , but legible to anyone .
1	<NAME> as it is in a large city to avoid the suspicion of being watched , when the mind is conscious of danger in that regard , I could not persuade myself that any of the people within sight cared about my movements .
1	One said she lived in the <NAME> , and had singed her whiskers by doing so ; another , that she was made fast to the great buoy outside the harbour , and could only be visited at half-tide ; a third , that she was locked up in <NAME> jail for child-stealing ; a fourth , that she was seen to mount a broom in the last high wind , and make direct for <NAME> .
1	I don ' t mind telling you , <NAME> , although I ' m dreadful jealous by nature -- horrid -- that the lady is in this house. ' Here <NAME> took off his spectacles , on purpose to wink , and then put them on again .
1	She never left him all that night .
1	It is a pleasant thing to reflect that one did one ' s duty by him. ' <NAME> smiled , as if he meant anything but smiling , and looked round at the strangers present .
1	Do not keep me here , but let me go at once .
1	' <NAME> and unreservedly no ? ' ' Yes. ' ' Fledgeby , my hand. ' Mr <NAME> took it , saying , ' And if we ever find out who did this , we ' ll mark that person .
1	He did everything for me except the household work , for which he had engaged a very decent woman , after paying off the laundress on his first arrival .
1	I never thought of it , before or afterwards .
1	' Would you have any objection to write down to <NAME> , and ask this favour of <NAME> ?
1	Let me whisper in your ear . '
1	" You are the fellow we want , " said <NAME> , in his ear ; " you make these fools believe that it will last for ever .
1	<NAME> , seated at an open window with her arm upon its cushioned ledge and looking out at the evening shadows falling on the park , has seemed to attend since the lawyer 's name was mentioned .
1	I had barely time to get down again before the coach started , and I could hardly see the family for the handkerchiefs they waved .
1	'Bill , ' cried the girl , striving to lay her head upon his breast , 'the gentleman and that dear lady , told me to-night of a home in some foreign country where I could end my days in solitude and peace .
1	There was a beautiful propriety in that .
1	Further , he became particular in his attentions to the ladies ; and dancing with <NAME> , whispered to her -- whispered to her ! -- though not so softly but that <NAME> heard him say this remarkable poetry , ' Had I a heart for falsehood framed , I ne ' er could injure You ! ' This , <NAME> heard him repeat to four young ladies , in succession .
1	She was an old lady in a large cap , with rather a red nose and rather an unsteady eye , but smiling all over .
1	How much ? ' He turned upon her suddenly with a menacing gesture of the weighted hand that clenched the money , as if he were going to strike her with it .
1	God bless you , dear Mr Clennam .
1	' Never ! ' <NAME> confirmed the assertion with an oath , and then laughed again , when of course the boy ( who thought his companion one of the most dashing fellows alive ) laughed also .
1	With this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered away .
1	A tributary stream of confusion , moreover , poured in from an adjoining bedroom , where Mr F. ' s <NAME> appeared , from the sound of her voice , to be in a horizontal posture , awaiting her breakfast ; and from which bower that inexorable lady snapped off short taunts , whenever she could get a hearing , as , ' <NAME> ' t believe it ' s his doing ! ' and ' He needn ' t take no credit to himself for it ! ' and ' It ' ll be long enough , I expect , afore he ' ll give up any of his own money ! ' all designed to disparage <NAME> ' s share in the discovery , and to relieve those inveterate feelings with which Mr F. ' s <NAME> regarded him .
1	That hope deferred , which , ( as the <NAME> very correctly tells us , Mr Dombey would have added in a patronising way ; for his highest distinct idea even of <NAME> , if examined , would have been found to be ; that as forming part of a general whole , of which <NAME> and <NAME> formed another part , it was therefore to be commended and upheld ) maketh the heart sick .
1	What would you have me do , my Life ? " " I would ask you , dearest , to be very generous with him always , and very lenient on his faults when he is not by .
1	Wretched marriages don ' t come of such things , in our degree ; only wretchedness and ruin .
1	Oh , pray see if he is hurt. ' ' He is not , I assure you , ' replied <NAME> , handling the object of his surprise , after this appeal , with sudden tenderness and respect .
1	' He sleeps sound , ' he said within himself ; ' yet he ' s that up to me and that noticing of me that my getting out of my chair may wake him , when a rattling peal won ' t ; let alone my touching of him. ' He very cautiously rose to his feet .
1	I say , he struck me .
1	' Then the sooner you go the better. ' With these instructions , <NAME> placed a sum of money in the hands of his faithful servitor , and ordered him to start for <NAME> immediately , in pursuit of the fugitive .
1	Although <NAME> said this with sufficient ill-humour , he did not seem to feel himself quite at liberty to remain silent ; for , after stretching himself very often , and declaring with a shiver that it was ' infernal cold , ' he made an experiment at the breakfast-table , and proving more successful in it than his less-seasoned friend , remained there .
1	' <NAME> said I wasn ' t to , because people wouldn ' t believe the attendance was good if they saw how small I was first. ' ' Well , but they ' ll see how small you are afterwards , won ' t they ? ' said <NAME> .
1	'It 's a nasty trade , ' said <NAME> , when <NAME> had again stated his wish .
1	I ' ve never took charity yet , nor yet has any one belonging to me .
1	<NAME> played the piano to him , sat by him , and worked and talked , and played some games at dominoes with me .
1	' Nor pass it over to me ? ' ' That would be the same thing .
1	Is there any other order , sir , that I can take a note of , besides this little matter of Mr <NAME> ? ' ' None , ' replied the dwarf , seizing the saucepan .
1	" And oh , miss , " says <NAME> , clapping her hands , with the tears starting down her dimpled cheeks , " <NAME> 's at school , if you please , and learning so good !
1	Why , he ' s an uglier-looking thief than can be seen anywhere for a penny .
1	By degrees I learnt , and chiefly from <NAME> , that <NAME> had been educated at <NAME> and at <NAME> , where he had distinguished himself ; but that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocket very early in life , he had impaired his prospects and taken up the calling of a Grinder .
1	They may be of the same blood , but , believe me , they are not of the same nature. " Still looking at me keenly , <NAME> repeated , -- " What do you want for them ? " " I am not so cunning , you see , " I said , in answer , conscious that I reddened a little , " as that I could hide from you , even if I desired , that I do want something .
1	In an official manager of these displays much celebrated for his platform tactics , <NAME> recognised ( in a suit of black ) the counterpart of a deceased benefactor of his species , an eminent public character , once known to fame as Frosty-faced Fogo , who in days of yore superintended the formation of the magic circle with the ropes and stakes .
1	<NAME> ' s story having got abroad , raised him up a host of friends , and many offers of provision for his future life .
1	' It ' s a dreadful trial to a father ' s feelin ' s , that ' ere , <NAME> -- ' ' Nonsense , ' said <NAME> .
1	' That woman , <NAME> , ' said the Major , ' is , in her way , a Lucifer .
1	' That ' s a dreadful fellow. ' ' The alligator , sir ? ' said <NAME> .
1	But , this was not the change on the village , and on many a village like it .
1	When he had gone a little way , he looked back .
1	After that I occupied myself in making our room a little tidy and in coaxing a very cross fire that had been lighted to burn , which at last it did , quite brightly .
1	Has he been here , <NAME> ? ' ' Here , in this room .
1	' <NAME> , you sir ! ' said <NAME> , for the third time .
1	In their orderly and punctual progress they brought round <NAME> and twilight .
1	' I dare say my birds sing better than other birds , and my flowers smell better than other flowers .
1	So sunken and suppressed it was , that it was like a voice underground .
1	Can I ever forget ? ' ' As you were then , my sister , I have often thought since , you have ever been to me .
1	All <NAME> ' s interest is to stick well to the story he has told ; and all his risk is , to depart from it in the least .
1	To have committed no fault , and yet to be so entirely alone in the world ; to be separated from the only persons he loved , and to be proscribed like a criminal , when six months ago he had been surrounded by every comfort , and looked up to , as the chief hope of his family -- this was hard to bear .
1	It is divided into boxes , for the solitary confinement of travellers , and is furnished with a clock , a looking-glass , and a live waiter , which latter article is kept in a small kennel for washing glasses , in a corner of the apartment .
1	His eyes are then fixed upon her , she knows , though her own see nothing but the grass .
1	' I thought it wouldn ' t be long , ' said <NAME> , jumping up and producing a little basket from under the seat ; ' put what you haven ' t had time to eat , in here , boys !
1	' I made an observation to my friend , sir , ' replied <NAME> , always ready to enter into conversation .
1	'Do not think of that .
1	He lowered it , and passed a remark on the next change of the moon .
1	But I -- but I wish you had not watched me. ' He understood the emotion with which she said it , to arise in her father ' s behalf ; and he respected it , and was silent .
1	" Why , my dear Minerva , " answered <NAME> with his old gay laugh , " it is neither a rural nor a cheerful place ; and when the sun shines here , you may lay a pretty heavy wager that it is shining brightly in an open spot .
1	<NAME> will see to your accommodation .
1	I just makes out to cry , " I know you now !
1	' Only myself , ' he assented with a sigh .
1	' Are my feathers so very much rumpled ? ' said <NAME> , coolly going up to the looking-glass .
1	This is the young lady .
1	' Now , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , calmly feeling for his whisker , ' it won ' t do .
1	It seems to me , at this hour , that I have never seen such sunlight as on those bright April afternoons ; that I have never seen such a sunny little figure as I used to see , sitting in the doorway of the old boat ; that I have never beheld such sky , such water , such glorified ships sailing away into golden air .
1	<NAME> and grind , fag and grind , turn the wheel , turn the wheel !
1	" Ay ! " returned the sergeant , " two .
1	On a healthy autumn day , the <NAME> prisoner , weak but otherwise restored , sat listening to a voice that read to him .
1	He has a yellow look in the spectral darkness of a candle that has guttered down until the whole length of its wick ( still burning ) has doubled over and left a tower of winding-sheet above it .
1	I have always read something of her poor mother ' s story , in her character ; and so I tell it you tonight , when we three are again together , after such great changes .
1	' No orders has come in for any friend o ' yourn. ' ' I mean my live friend there. ' ' O !
1	Does our fiendish contemporary wince ?
1	' " Under favour , <NAME> , " replied the horror-stricken sexton , " I don ' t think they can , <NAME> ; they don ' t know me , <NAME> ; I don ' t think the gentlemen have ever seen me , Sir. " ' " Oh , yes , they have , " replied the goblin ; " we know the man with the sulky face and grim scowl , that came down the street to-night , throwing his evil looks at the children , and grasping his burying-spade the tighter .
1	' Ride on ! ' I noticed , I remember , as he paused , looking at me with his handsome head a little thrown back , and his glass raised in his hand , that , though the freshness of the sea-wind was on his face , and it was ruddy , there were traces in it , made since I last saw it , as if he had applied himself to some habitual strain of the fervent energy which , when roused , was so passionately roused within him .
1	It so fell out , that Mrs. Squeers ' s journey , to some distance , to fetch three new boys , and dun the relations of two old ones for the balance of a small account , was fixed that very afternoon , for the next day but one ; and on the next day but one , Mrs. Squeers got up outside the coach , as it stopped to change at <NAME> , taking with her a small bundle containing something in a bottle , and some sandwiches , and carrying besides a large white top-coat to wear in the night-time ; with which baggage she went her way .
1	Played a match once -- single wicket- -friend the colonel -- <NAME> -- who should get the greatest number of runs. -- Won the toss -- first innings -- seven o ' clock A.M. -- six natives to look out -- went in ; kept in -- heat intense -- natives all fainted -- taken away -- fresh half-dozen ordered -- fainted also -- <NAME> bowling -- supported by two natives -- couldn ' t bowl me out -- fainted too -- cleared away the colonel -- wouldn ' t give in -- faithful attendant -- <NAME> -- last man left -- sun so hot , bat in blisters , ball scorched brown -- five hundred and seventy runs -- rather exhausted -- <NAME> mustered up last remaining strength -- bowled me out -- had a bath , and went out to dinner. ' ' And what became of what ' s-his-name , <NAME> ? ' inquired an old gentleman .
1	we are a growing too outrageous ! ' ' <NAME> thinks well of Mrs Pipchin , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , ' and has a right to choose his housekeeper , you know .
1	' It would be better for yourself , and all of us , if you WERE mercenary , <NAME> -- I mean , if you were more discreet and less influenced by all this youthful nonsense .
1	says <NAME> , biting his thumb with the appetite of vexation .
1	<NAME> <NAME> rubs his head with the key while she entertains herself with a sarcastic laugh .
1	I have thought of that , many times since , to be sure ! ' She folded her arms tightly on her breast , and laughed in a tone that made the howl of the old woman musical .
1	There ' s not a <NAME> in this town , sir , man , woman , or child , but has one ultimate object in life .
1	And so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him , and where she now stood looking at him , with hands which at first had been only raised in frightened compassion , if not even to keep him off and shut out the sight of him , but which were now extending towards him , trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young breast , and love it back to life and hope -- so exactly was the expression repeated ( though in stronger characters ) on her fair young face , that it looked as though it had passed like a moving light , from him to her .
1	One observes my Lord with his white hair , standing , hat in hand , to help my Lady to and from the carriage .
1	<NAME> <NAME> shakes his head .
1	When they had both accosted it , and spoken many kind words , <NAME> turned back one last time with her hand stretched out , saying , ' Good-bye , good <NAME> !
1	I should like to see it .
1	I dare say she ' ll manage to do it. ' ' Probably , ' said <NAME> .
1	' The tiny woman ? ' ' Ah ! ' ' I don ' t know , ' said <NAME> .
1	Mr Baptist , as a grateful little fellow in a position of trust , was among the workmen , and had done as much towards the cheering as a mere foreigner could .
1	Now , my uncle was never a fast thinker , and if he had thought all these things , I am quite certain it would have taken him till full half-past two o ' clock at the very least .
1	' Not on no account , ' replied <NAME> .
1	said <NAME> , involuntarily falling from her strange companion .
1	No speck , nor spot , nor spatter soiled the purity of any of <NAME> ' s household gods , large , small , or middle-sized .
1	And then repeated aloud in a tone of astonishment : ' see me righted , sir ? ' ' Ay , ay ! ' said Mr Boffin .
1	We all sat down to a comfortable breakfast in the cabin below , where there was no more hurry or confusion than at such a meal in <NAME> , and where there was certainly greater politeness exhibited than at most of our stage-coach banquets .
1	Mr Dombey having recovered from his surprise , not to say his alarm ( for it was the very first occasion on which the child had ever broached the subject of his mother to him , though he had had him sitting by his side , in this same manner , evening after evening ) , expounded to him how that money , though a very potent spirit , never to be disparaged on any account whatever , could not keep people alive whose time was come to die ; and how that we must all die , unfortunately , even in the <NAME> , though we were never so rich .
1	But here again they were disappointed , for the gate was closed , and some fierce dogs , barking at their approach , obliged them to retreat .
1	How well I recollect the kind of day it was !
1	I recollect one young fellow -- a tinker , I suppose , from his wallet and brazier -- who had a woman with him , and who faced about and stared at me thus ; and then roared to me in such a tremendous voice to come back , that I halted and looked round .
1	' Have you any intention of going away again ? ' <NAME> asked me , as I was standing by .
1	Everybody else said the same , and they must be allowed to have been competent judges , because they had just had dinner ; and , with the dessert upon the table , were clustered round the fire , by lamplight .
1	I had seen <NAME> frequently .
1	' Nothing the matter , ' replied <NAME> .
1	And thus poor <NAME> sickened and grew worse , and fell into heavy danger of death , and lay severely ill for many a long round of day and night .
1	Get along with you , my woman , ' he added in her ear , ' get along with you , while you know you ' re Affery , and before you ' re shaken to yeast. ' Mistress Affery , sensible of the danger in which her identity stood , relinquished the tea-pot as her husband seized it , put her apron over her head , and in a twinkling vanished .
1	He walks up and down the car , and in and out of it , as his fancy dictates ; leans against the door with his hands in his pockets and stares at you , if you chance to be a stranger ; or enters into conversation with the passengers about him .
1	' Then , ' said <NAME> , producing a small document from his pocket and unfolding it very slowly , ' this is a writ of execution , and if it ' s not conwenient to settle we ' ll go over the house at wunst , please , and take the inwentory. ' Poor Madame Mantalini wrung her hands for grief , and rung the bell for her husband ; which done , she fell into a chair and a fainting fit , simultaneously .
1	Refreshment -- a -- underneath this roof -- particularly punch -- would -- a -- choke me -- unless -- I had -- previously -- choked the eyes -- out of the head -- a -- of -- interminable cheat , and liar -- HEEP !
1	As to this , his natural and not to be alienated inheritance , the messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the King , the first Minister of <NAME> , or the richest merchant in <NAME> .
1	The fright and abhorrence that <NAME> smoothed out of her strong face as she ended this diversion , showed how seriously she had meant it .
1	But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone , <NAME> !
1	" Or I 'll have your heart and liver out. " He tilted me again .
1	To me , the remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and painful. " " But you said to me , " returned <NAME> , very earnestly , " 'God bless you , God forgive you ! '
1	Now , besides very many babies just able to walk , there happened to be in <NAME> a considerable population of babies who had been walking against time towards the infinite world , twenty , thirty , forty , fifty years and more .
1	The mere sight of <NAME> in the street one day , at a considerable distance , so overpowered her milky nature , that she was fain to seek immediate refuge in a pastrycook ' s , and there , in a musty little back room usually devoted to the consumption of soups , and pervaded by an ox-tail atmosphere , relieve her feelings by weeping plentifully .
1	I opened the door ; and at first looked down , to my amazement , on nothing but a great umbrella that appeared to be walking about of itself .
1	<NAME> there no stranger with him ? ' ' I ' ll take my world-without-end everlasting <NAME> that you warn ' t with him , ' answered <NAME> .
1	Those who are habituated to the -- ha -- <NAME> , are pleased to call me its father .
1	' -- ' <NAME> , ain ' t ? ' With a stupid stare .
1	The <NAME> was not troubled with the faintest idea of any difficulty in retaining <NAME> , or of any responsibility thereby incurred .
1	' There , <NAME> , ' said my mother , changing her tone , ' don ' t let us fall out with one another , for I couldn ' t bear it .
1	' <NAME> and <NAME> , ' cried the gentleman in black , calling on the case , which stood first on the list .
1	He , a broken , bankrupt , sick , dishonoured prisoner .
1	Before we had taken many paces down the street beyond it , the noise of the city seemed to melt , as if by magic , into a softened distance .
1	<NAME> <NAME> died point blank at him ; and when the two guards came in to take the body off after a very hard death , it was seen to open its eyes and glance at the <NAME> manager .
1	The pointer always came that way , with a view to the <NAME> , where a sporting taste ( originating generally in bets of new hats ) is much in vogue .
1	The abode of Mrs <NAME> was not easy to find , lying in such complicated back settlements of muddy Brentford that they left their equipage at the sign of the <NAME> , and went in search of it on foot .
1	" Disguise from you is impossible .
1	I was greatly dejected and distressed , but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way .
1	His recollections were few enough , but they were all of one kind -- all connected with the poverty and misery of his parents .
1	' Nor I neither , ' said <NAME> .
1	' The tale told itself at once : some scattered garments lay on the beach ; a human head was just visible above the waves at a little distance from the shore ; and an old man , wringing his hands in agony , was running to and fro , shrieking for assistance .
1	<NAME> had only to remember that her star of promise was clouded in the general gloom that hung upon the house , and to weep and be resigned .
1	<NAME> hung upon the eyelids of the child so long , that , when she awoke , <NAME> was already decorated with her large bonnet , and actively engaged in preparing breakfast .
1	' I imagined all this when he was a boy .
1	Mrs <NAME> received him with great distinction ; the bosom was in admirable preservation , and on the best terms with itself ; the dinner was very choice ; and the company was very select .
1	His soul is a great deal too large for his frame .
1	' If I were not a married man myself , I should be disposed to envy you , you dog. ' Thus expressing himself , the little lawyer gave <NAME> a poke in the chest , which that gentleman reciprocated ; after which they both laughed very loudly , but not so loudly as <NAME> , who had just relieved his feelings by kissing the pretty housemaid under cover of the cupboard door .
1	Rising softly , for my charge lay fast asleep , I looked out of the window .
1	' How do you mean ? ' rejoined <NAME> .
1	He suffered himself to be led to the table , where , after having been introduced to the company in due form , he was accommodated with a seat near the chairman and called for a glass of his favourite beverage .
1	It seemed to escape his consideration that Mrs. Skimpole and the daughters remained behind to encounter the baker , but this was so old a story to all of them that it had become a matter of course .
1	Why , _the_ mill -- the mill as takes up so little room that it 'll work inside a Stone Jug ; and always goes better when the wind 's low with people , than when it 's high ; acos then they ca n't get workmen .
1	<NAME> , without being quite enthusiastic on the subject , replied that he was glad of any opportunity , however slight , to oblige Mr Carker , whose wish on such a point was a command : and that the wooden Midshipman would consider himself happy to receive in his berth any visitor of Mr <NAME> ' s selecting .
1	<NAME> , my love , you are by far the best loved of the three ; I have had you principally in my mind -- whatever I have done for your sake , my dear child , I have done freely and without murmuring. ' Only the wisdom that holds the clue to all hearts and all mysteries , can surely know to what extent a man , especially a man brought down as this man had been , can impose upon himself .
1	I made it in a moment .
1	' Mr Dorrit will pardon me , ' said <NAME> , ' if I remark that this is not a time or place for the pursuit of the present conversation .
1	making her eyes very large .
1	' Made to do ? ' returned the <NAME> , administering more punishment , ' what do you take me for ? ' And was then turned over on its back in <NAME> ' s lap , and smothered with kisses .
1	<NAME> , swift-responsive , appears , receives instructions whom to produce , skims away , produces the aforesaid , and departs .
1	<NAME> lives -- that is to say , <NAME> has not yet died -- in a ruinous place known to the like of him by the name of Tom-all-Alone 's .
1	That morning ' s breakfast passed heavily off .
1	I begged <NAME> , in conclusion , to understand that my help must always be rendered without <NAME> 's knowledge or suspicion , and that there was no one else in the world with whom I could advise .
1	'Let 's have a glim , ' said <NAME> , 'or we shall go breaking our necks , or treading on the dog .
1	'If they have -- I do not know how they can , but if they have -- any reference to me , ' said <NAME> , 'pray let me hear them at some other time .
1	She clung to him as she should have clung to some far better nature that day , and was a little shaken in her reserved composure for the first time .
1	said this worthy , nodding to the Jew .
1	She dreamed of seeking her father in wildernesses , of following his track up fearful heights , and down into deep mines and caverns ; of being charged with something that would release him from extraordinary suffering -- she knew not what , or why -- yet never being able to attain the goal and set him free .
1	Far from it. ' ' Six children , sir ? ' exclaimed <NAME> .
1	<NAME> ! ' ' What are you doing ? ' said <NAME> , seizing him by the arm .
1	It will do you good. ' <NAME> hesitated ; but , yielding to his curiosity , rose .
1	" Why , " said <NAME> , " to tell the truth , <NAME> , this view of the matter had not occurred to me until Mrs. <NAME> mentioned it .
1	In a wild incautious way I hurried there , and there -- with the horror of the death I had escaped , before my eyes in its most appalling shape , added to the inconceivable horror tormenting me at that time when the poisonous stuff was strongest on me -- I perceived that <NAME> had been murdered by some unknown hands for the money for which he would have murdered me , and that probably we had both been shot into the river from the same dark place into the same dark tide , when the stream ran deep and strong .
1	My father is <NAME> 's cousin ; not that that implies familiar intercourse between them , for he is a bad courtier and will not propitiate her. " <NAME> had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking .
1	I wouldn ' t be taken upon that. ' ' Why not ? ' asked <NAME> .
1	I should break through the wall to come to you .
1	Her absence in his altered fortunes made it , and him in it , so very desolate and so much in need of such a face of love and truth , that he turned against the wall to weep , sobbing out , as his heart relieved itself , ' O my Little Dorrit ! ' The day was sunny , and the <NAME> , with the hot noon striking upon it , was unwontedly quiet .
1	But she 's alive , and I know her . "
1	' <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> , with dignity .
1	Let this intercede for me .
1	Commission to the extent of two and ninepence in a fortnight can not , however limited our ideas , be considered remunerative. ' We were all agreed upon that .
1	With the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the shutters , <NAME> arose , and again unbarred the door .
1	As the heat of the glowing day when they had stopped to drink at the streams of melted ice and snow , was changed to the searching cold of the frosty rarefied night air at a great height , so the fresh beauty of the lower journey had yielded to barrenness and desolation .
1	I do n't attach any value to money .
1	" What does <NAME> mean ? "
1	No such artificial means would bring sleep to his eyes .
1	As to <NAME> , she had become the victim of an insatiate mania for what she called ' going into society ; ' and would have gone into it head-foremost fifty times between sunset and sunrise , if so many opportunities had been at her disposal .
1	I regularly take walks outside <NAME> ' s house in the evening , though it cuts me to the heart to see the officers go in , or to hear them up in the drawing-room , where the eldest Miss <NAME> plays the harp .
1	For a moment it was a strange face , and then it was all the faces. ' ' And then it was gone ? ' ' Yes ; and then it was gone. ' ' Where were you then , old lady ? ' ' Here , at the chest .
1	said my guardian with his good-humoured smile .
1	" Now , I wonder who it can be about ? "
1	Say no more , <NAME> , say no more , my child .
1	We stand around the grave .
1	' Of course , my dear <NAME> ; of course .
1	' <NAME> , I have forgotten this gentleman ' s name. ' <NAME> bends over her , and calls to her , ' Mr .
1	To one who had been tossing on a restless bed so long , even these few green leaves and this tranquil light , although it languished among chimneys and house-tops , were pleasant things .
1	Breathing more freely in a little while , he sat down at the table , and listened again until the clock struck Two .
1	Why , when these fellows of our acquaintance drink and you drink with them , the more talkative they get , the more silent you get .
1	The upshot of which , was , to smash this witness like a crockery vessel , and shiver his part of the case to useless lumber .
1	Now , it is incumbent upon all people in an exalted position , but it is particularly so on this family , for reasons which I -- ha -- will not dwell upon , to make themselves respected .
1	' My opinion is -- no will. ' It appeared a wonderful thing to me , but it turned out that there was no will .
1	' Upon my word , my dear , when there are so many pleasanter things to think of , I should be a goose if I did , ' said <NAME> .
1	But neither ever broached the theme .
1	As they walked on in silence , he could not but see how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the streets .
1	He was so good as to make an appointment for to-night , when you would be at home. ' A dark gentleman .
1	' Mr Wegg , ' said <NAME> , ' as I did name to you , I think , on a former occasion , if not on former occasions -- ' ' On former occasions , ' interrupted <NAME> .
1	I ' ll be judged by the gentleman himself .
1	When a man rides an amiable hobby that shies at nothing and kicks nobody , it is only agreeable to find him riding it with a humorous sense of the droll side of the creature .
1	" A perfect fleet , " said he .
1	' Dis-gusting ! ' ejaculated both the young ladies .
1	For , sailors to be got the better of , were essential to <NAME> ' s <NAME> .
1	To all this Clennam merely replied that , granting the whole protest , nothing in it lessened the force , or could lessen the force , of the voluntary and public exoneration of his partner .
1	In respect of <NAME> ' s <NAME> , the <NAME> ' s parental and admiration knew no change .
1	He was an inquisitive fellow , and sometimes when she had quite forgotten him in gazing at the prison roof and grates , and in lifting her heart up to her husband , she would come to herself to find him looking at her , with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work .
1	And now he ' s to bring home a new mistress , a baby-faced chit of a girl !
1	<NAME> <NAME> to see <NAME> Rosa. ' This is the announcement of the parlour-maid in chief .
1	She dismissed the messenger to his own devices , and rode away to her old home .
1	But she was not to be so easily left .
1	Then , she would draw in her head to look round the room and see that everything was in its place and hadn ' t moved ; and looking out into the street again , would perhaps see a man passing with a coffin on his back , and two or three others silently following him to a house where somebody lay dead ; which made her shudder and think of such things until they suggested afresh the old man ' s altered face and manner , and a new train of fears and speculations .
1	But , gentlemen of <NAME> , is it in cricket alone that your fellow-townsmen stand pre- eminent ?
1	' So he went , ' said the gentleman with the gun-barrel , who was an extremely deliberate speaker , ' down to his cousin ' s place , and took the Dog with him by rail .
1	It was a nice sickly season just at this time .
1	I was very much concerned for his misfortunes , and felt that any recognition short of ninepence would be mere brutality and hardness of heart .
1	Above all , I sincerely believe that the public institutions and charities of this capital of <NAME> are as nearly perfect , as the most considerate wisdom , benevolence , and humanity , can make them .
1	All the time , our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled .
1	with a flourish of the arm , and a flush of the face , they were swept away .
1	' I hope there is ! ' replied Kate .
1	<NAME> income twenty pounds , annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six , result misery .
1	I have not the honour of Mrs <NAME> ' s good opinion .
1	They were still fishing perseveringly , when he peeped in at the gate for the second time ; but , now they seemed to have got a bite .
1	He was , at first , somewhat disconcerted to meet us two together ; but quickly decided what to do , and came up to me .
1	But the duties and responsibilities make the recompense small , and they are so very heavy that I fear to undertake them. ' ' Do you decline to undertake them , sir ? ' inquired <NAME> , with his hand on the bell-rope .
1	The panic-stricken men pointed to where such articles were kept ; the murderer , hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord , hurried up to the house-top .
1	All I was going to say was , that I hold myself under an obligation to the coincidence , that ' s all. ' ' Oh !
1	In the yard , was <NAME> making a new epitaph for himself , on the occasion of his dying of a broken heart .
1	You told me last night of a friend you had ? ' His name was <NAME> , <NAME> said .
1	The Jew grinned ; and , making a low obeisance to <NAME> , took him by the hand , and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance .
1	<NAME> <NAME> follows her as she flies down the hill , and waves his glazed hat as a general signal , which may attract the right coach and which may not .
1	But although she would gladly have given him her hand and thanked him for what he had said at their last meeting , it was always a relief to find , when they came nearer to each other , that the person who approached was not he , but a stranger ; for even if she had not dreaded the effect which the sight of him might have wrought upon her fellow-traveller , she felt that to bid farewell to anybody now , and most of all to him who had been so faithful and so true , was more than she could bear .
1	' I can ' t , I daren ' t. ' ' Help !
1	As she was observed at this time to direct baleful glances towards the <NAME> , it has been supposed that this admirably consistent female intended by ' him , ' <NAME> .
1	But supposing he is a free black , and has no owner , it may naturally be presumed that he is done again , and again , and again .
1	But as it is , I made up my mind to call , especially as I am not likely to see you again the next time you come to town . "
1	said I , knowing how it pleased her to have her confidence received with an appearance of interest .
1	What between the buryin ground , the grocer ' s , the waggon-stables , and the paunch trade , the <NAME> flies gets very large .
1	When he came to bid us good-bye , he brought his mother with him for the first time .
1	In time my eyes gradually shut up ; and , from seeming to hear the clergyman singing a drowsy song in the heat , I hear nothing , until I fall off the seat with a crash , and am taken out , more dead than alive , by <NAME> .
1	They were coming back , even poorer than they went .
1	Being engaged in the adjustment of some accounts -- an occupation to which the silence and solitude of his retreat were very favourable -- he had not strayed from his den for two whole days .
1	YOU want more painstaking and search-making !
1	Having communicated this piece of information , apparently more for the purpose of discharging his bosom of an important fact , than with any specific view of enlightening <NAME> , the guide , having at length reached another gallery , led the way into a small passage at the extreme end , opened a door , and disclosed an apartment of an appearance by no means inviting , containing eight or nine iron bedsteads .
1	Pretty Nell ! ' Mr <NAME> looked , as he was , all open-mouthed astonishment .
1	And who among the company at <NAME> 's reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our Lord , could possibly doubt , that a system rooted in a frizzled hangman , powdered , gold-laced , pumped , and white-silk stockinged , would see the very stars out !
1	They were always 'My husband , my father , and my brother !
1	And now come here , and I 'll show you how to take the marks out of the handkerchiefs . '
1	<NAME> , without pausing , laid his hand upon his shoulder , and laughingly and lightly went on : ' <NAME> , I don ' t like to dispel your generous visions , and I would give any money ( if I had any ) , to live in such a rose-coloured mist .
1	He might be deemed eligible by you and might be disposed to respond to this proposal .
1	Is it , " says <NAME> , glancing over the table , " from bread in various forms , from butter which is churned from the milk which is yielded unto us by the cow , from the eggs which are laid by the fowl , from ham , from tongue , from sausage , and from such like ?
1	They were polite , but pale ; and spoke low ; and they were so depressed in their spirits , that in comparison with the general tone of that company , <NAME> was a perfect <NAME> , or complete <NAME> Book. ' And yet he had a sense of injury upon him , too , had <NAME> .
1	Remember how poor we are. ' Mrs. <NAME> shook her head , and said , through her tears , that poverty was not a crime .
1	" You are one of those , <NAME> , " said I , " who make the most of every chance .
1	There were so many of them , that although <NAME> put one hand under the bottom book and his other hand and his chin on the top book , and hugged them all closely , the middle book slipped out before he reached the door , and then they all tumbled down on the floor .
1	The more my aunt looked at him , the more he reproached her ; for she had lately taken to spectacles , and for some inscrutable reason he considered the glasses personal .
1	' Ay , ' rejoined <NAME> , taking his arm .
1	The time was once when men as knowing as <NAME> would walk on turret-tops in the starlight and look up into the sky to read their fortunes there .
1	He was a chance acquaintance , made abroad. ' ' A chance acquaintance made abroad ! ' she repeated .
1	Tried to nudge you , but you wouldn ' t .
1	Both times at night , when I was going back .
1	Only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering , or we shall be taken for madmen . '
1	' And the man as puts me in , ' ull never let me out till you go yourself. ' ' Bless my heart and soul ! ' ejaculated <NAME> .
1	They were all occupied with the poor girl , and I heard <NAME> directing them and speaking to her often .
1	Now attend a moment ! ' said the old man .
1	Here was a gentleman of a great , not to say a grand , address , accustomed to rank and dignity , really setting a fine example how to behave to a Mayor .
1	Is it coming on you , <NAME> ?
1	said the Jew , scowling fiercely on the boy .
1	That 's a very good card .
1	It was not that the wind swept all the brawlers into places of shelter , as it had swept the hail still lingering in heaps wherever there was refuge for it ; but that it seemed as if the streets were absorbed by the sky , and the night were all in the air .
1	She was out of breath -- for Mr Dombey , full of great thoughts , had walked fast -- and she croaked hoarsely as she waited for the opening of the door .
1	' Now you may mizzle , jemmy ( as we say at <NAME> ) , and if <NAME> will take the chair I ' ll operate on him. ' ' What do you say , <NAME> ? ' inquired <NAME> , laughing , and resigning his seat .
1	Nicholas could not help suspecting that , for some reason or other , he was sent out of the way on purpose , and that the young lady was there in his absence .
1	<NAME> ! ' prevented his relapse into a doze .
1	Almost as she stopped , the two figures stopped ; and that one which to <NAME> ' s thinking was like a distorted shadow of her mother , spoke to the other , earnestly , and with a pointing hand towards them .
1	Her boy may have learnt no better !
1	There were hyacinths there , this last spring , blossoming , in -- but you ' ll laugh at that , of course. ' ' At what ? ' ' At their blossoming in old blacking-bottles , ' said <NAME> .
1	They have long , gaunt legs , too , and such peaked snouts , that if one of them could be persuaded to sit for his profile , nobody would recognise it for a pig ' s likeness .
1	' The consequences may be dreadful , ' said <NAME> .
1	The lady was upon a journey all alone , strange as we might think it , and could she rest herself where you 're a setten for a hour or so .
1	( In this he was very warmly supported by Mr and <NAME> . )
1	But she was too high !
1	I do what I can for them. ' ' You do what you can for them ! ' repeated <NAME> , walking her on very fast .
1	It ' s a delightful book , and all true and real -- that ' s the best of it -- true as the <NAME> of <NAME> , and real as its gold and silver .
1	' I ' ll go to him. ' Goes out straightway , and , leisurely leaning his arms on the open window of a cab in waiting , looks in at Mr Dolls : who has brought his own atmosphere with him , and would seem from its odour to have brought it , for convenience of carriage , in a rum-cask .
1	He stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk , who , cold as he was , was warmer than <NAME> ; for he returned them cordially .
1	She stopped at the corner , and putting her hand in his , wished him good night .
1	<NAME> and glad as <NAME> truly was , that her young mistress should be advanced towards her proper place in the scene of her old neglect , and that she should have her father ' s handsome wife for her companion and protectress , she could not relinquish any part of her own dominion to the handsome wife , without a grudge and a vague feeling of ill-will , for which she did not fail to find a disinterested justification in her sharp perception of the pride and passion of the lady ' s character .
1	As a vast fire will fill the air to a great distance with its roar , so the sacred flame which the mighty <NAME> had fanned caused the air to resound more and more with the name of <NAME> .
1	You will wear the green velvet jacket ? ' ' No , no , ' replied <NAME> .
1	what shall I do ! ' thinks <NAME> , clasping her hands .
1	In a similar anticipation of life afloat , and in the <NAME> , <NAME> , instead of helping Mrs. Micawber and his eldest son and daughter to punch , in wine-glasses , which he might easily have done , for there was a shelf-full in the room , served it out to them in a series of villainous little tin pots ; and I never saw him enjoy anything so much as drinking out of his own particular pint pot , and putting it in his pocket at the close of the evening .
1	' As if , with my head in its present throbbing state , you couldn ' t go and look at the shells and minerals and things provided for you , instead of circuses ! ' said Mrs. Gradgrind .
1	It would be impossible to save the family credit for a day .
1	You have always ( as I have informed Mrs General ) been my favourite child ; I have always made you a -- hum -- a friend and companion ; in return , I beg -- I -- ha -- I _do_ beg , that you accommodate yourself better to -- hum -- circumstances , and dutifully do what becomes your -- your station. ' Mr <NAME> was even a little more fragmentary than usual , being excited on the subject and anxious to make himself particularly emphatic .
1	His lonely daughter , bereft of her final hope and reliance , appealed to them both too strongly .
1	I do not say that anything is to be done .
1	Will you take no counsel with me ?
1	Her worthy lord stretched his neck and eyes until she had crossed the yard , and then , not at all sorry to have had this opportunity of carrying his point , and asserting the sanctity of his castle , fell into an immoderate fit of laughter , and laid himself down to sleep again .
1	Why I KNOW of fifteen and sixpence that came to <NAME> one night last month , to see me dance the <NAME> Fling ; and what ' s the consequence ?
1	I vent all the vay down to the <NAME> o ' <NAME> , arter you , last night. ' ' Did you see the <NAME> o ' <NAME> , <NAME> ? ' inquired <NAME> , with a sigh .
1	It ' s of no use cross-examining my eyes , ' cried <NAME> , winking and rubbing them , ' they stick to their first account , and will .
1	We felt our inexperience , and were unable to help ourselves .
1	About what ? ' ' You must remember , my dear , that whenever I have said anything , on any subject , I have never heard the last of it : and consequently , that I have long left off saying anything. ' ' I can hear you , mother. ' But , it was only by dint of bending down to her ear , and at the same time attentively watching the lips as they moved , that she could link such faint and broken sounds into any chain of connexion .
1	' Why , gentlemen , if I were to indicate such a programme to any class of society , I say it would be received with derision , would be pointed at by the finger of scorn .
1	' Mr Dombey , to a man in your position from a man in mine , there is no show of subservience compatible with the transaction of business between us , that I should think sufficient .
1	Mrs <NAME> coughed as before , and drew lines on the carpet with the ivory end of her parasol .
1	' Dear Fanny , what is the matter ?
1	It hears , my dear child , all sorts of shocking things .
1	You ' re an active woman at that time , and if you want to get that paper , you can get it .
1	It was right that all that had sustained me should give way at once and that I should die of terror and my conscience .
1	A great white cap , with a quantity of opaque frilling that was always flapping about , apologised for <NAME> ' s baldness , and made it so very difficult for her old black bonnet to retain its place upon her head , that it held on round her neck like a gipsy ' s baby .
1	said <NAME> , feeling in his breast with a look of alarm .
1	He was the first to speak , and he spoke thus : ' Yes .
1	The house was so still that I heard the girl ' s light step upstairs .
1	He stood at the window , looking over the prison-parapet with its grim spiked border , and breathed a benediction through the summer haze towards the distant land where she was rich and prosperous .
1	Even when we were groping among <NAME> 's stock of boots for our hats , I felt that the right twin was on his way back ; and we had not gone half a dozen yards down <NAME> in the <NAME> direction , before I found that I was walking arm in arm with the right twin , and that the wrong twin had evaporated into the evening air .
1	I ' ve giv ' notice of the circumstarnce to the police , and the police have took possession of it .
1	All the ladies in the prison had got hold of the news , and were in the yard .
1	Two gaolers , who had been standing there , went out , and the prisoner was brought in , and put to the bar .
1	' Much more than for any other .
1	When we rejoined him in the drawing-room he said he would give us a little ballad which had come into his head " apropos of our young friend , " and he sang one about a peasant boy , " Thrown on the wide world , doomed to wander and roam , <NAME> of his parents , bereft of a home . "
1	' And here ' s the sunny place on the white wall where they one day measured one another .
1	When they entered together , the shadow of the night of the return again darkened Mr <NAME> ' s face .
1	I find a woman. ' The colour overspread her face .
1	She tore along the narrow pavement : elbowing the passengers from side to side ; and darting almost under the horses ' heads , crossed crowded streets , where clusters of persons were eagerly watching their opportunity to do the like .
1	There are many instances on record , of men who have chosen , or have been condemned , to lives of perfect solitude , but I scarcely remember one , even among sages of strong and vigorous intellect , where its effect has not become apparent , in some disordered train of thought , or some gloomy hallucination .
1	Then kindness requires that I should n't go near them -- and I wo n't . "
1	I mention the conquest in good time because I apprehend your scheme to be more important to you than your vanity. ' There was a mirror on the wall before them , and her eyes just caught him smirking in it .
1	There was a stage , that evening , when she spoke collectedly of what had happened , though with a certain terrible vivacity .
1	' Off with you ! ' The boys applied whip and spur , the waiters shouted , the hostlers cheered , and away they went , fast and furiously .
1	<NAME> is devoted to him .
1	' <NAME> , ' said the lady , hurriedly , and looking into her face with great earnestness .
1	I am so sorry for it , I am so unwilling to believe it , I have tried so earnestly not to see it , that it is very hard to tell , even to you .
1	' You have said more than enough to him on business , before now .
1	' You are the dolls ' dressmaker ? ' ' I am the dolls ' dressmaker , sir. ' ' <NAME> ' s friend ? ' ' Yes , sir , ' replied <NAME> , instantly on the defensive .
1	They did not so engross his attention , but that he saw , with gratitude , how the elder Mr Chivery kept the Lodge clear of prisoners ; how he signed to some , with his keys , not to come in , how he nudged others with his elbows to go out , and how he made his misery as easy to him as he could .
1	Kiss me , Floy. ' He had even a dislike , at such times , to the company of <NAME> , and was well pleased when she strolled away , as she generally did , to pick up shells and acquaintances .
1	Did you ever breed any Suffolk Punches yourself , sir ? ' ' N-no , ' I said , ' not exactly. ' ' Here ' s a gen ' lm ' n behind me , I ' ll pound it , ' said <NAME> , ' as has bred ' em by wholesale. ' The gentleman spoken of was a gentleman with a very unpromising squint , and a prominent chin , who had a tall white hat on with a narrow flat brim , and whose close-fitting drab trousers seemed to button all the way up outside his legs from his boots to his hips .
1	Evidently in observance of their nightly custom , she put some bread before herself , and touched his glass with her lips ; but <NAME> saw she was troubled and took nothing .
1	It might cut somebody , by accident .
1	" As to <NAME> , " who , I may mention , found the wind much given , during this period , to stick in the east ; " As to <NAME> , " <NAME> would say to me , " he is the finest fellow in the world , Esther !
1	You asked me if I could have perfect faith in you , and I said yes , and I meant it. ' It did not escape <NAME> ' s notice that he began to look triumphant .
1	If I was to try -- no matter whether on myself , on somebody else , or both -- any genteel mystifications , I should probably not succeed in them. ' ' <NAME> , ' returned the <NAME> , with an affable smile , but with the bloom on her cheeks standing out a little more vividly than usual as the neighbouring surface became paler , ' probably not. ' ' Therefore , my good madam , ' said Mr Meagles , at great pains to restrain himself , ' I hope I may , without offence , ask to have no such mystification played off upon me. ' ' Mama Meagles , ' observed <NAME> , ' your good man is incomprehensible. ' Her turning to that worthy lady was an artifice to bring her into the discussion , quarrel with her , and vanquish her .
1	We , who have no such optical powers , are better pleased to take our last parting look at the visionary companions of many solitary hours , when the brief sunshine of the world is blazing full upon them .
1	By the light of the fire he can be seen looking towards the moonlight .
1	<NAME> looked after him , but neither moved nor spoke for some time : when he broke what almost seemed the silence of stupefaction , by a scornful laugh .
1	<NAME> taught her , nobody stepped forward to help her , nobody cared for her. ' ' Nobody ! ' echoed the mother , pointing to herself , and striking her breast .
1	We may go. " But , the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it -- not visible and presented , but indistinct and withheld -- to alarm <NAME> into saying , as she laid her appealing hand on <NAME> 's dress : " You will be good to my poor husband .
1	As <NAME> received these confidences , and as he watched the face of his friend now sixty-two years of age , a misgiving arose within him that such dread experiences would revive the old danger .
1	Partly in remembrance of that , and partly in the hope of making money someday by the scheme , I took advantage of my position about you , and possessed myself of a hold upon you , which you would give half of all you have to know , and never can know but through me .
1	Is it your pleasure to take <NAME> ? ' ' Ah ! ' said Mr Boffin .
1	Not being able quite to make up his mind about it , he consulted the <NAME> -- without taking that gentleman into his confidence ; merely informing him that a friend in <NAME> had written to him ( Mr Toots ) for his opinion on such a question .
1	' There may be , in the coffee-room. ' MAY BE .
1	'What business is it of yours ? '
1	The tail of <NAME> 's eye becomes conscious of the head of Mrs. Snagsby looking in at the shop-door to know what he means by deserting his tea .
1	I have only just come to a decision to take one .
1	" This , " said <NAME> , " is my Beauty daughter , <NAME> -- plays and sings odds and ends like her father .
1	' <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> , clearing his throat , and warming with the punch and with the fire .
1	The fellow sends a most abandoned villain with one eye to construct a gateway .
1	Was it outside the house at present ockypied , to its disgrace , by that minion of fortune and worm of the hour , ' said <NAME> , falling back upon his strongest terms of reprobation , and slapping the counter , ' that I , <NAME> , five hundred times the man he ever was , sat in all weathers , waiting for a errand or a customer ?
1	I trust , sir , that I have never pointed the noble instrument which is placed in my hands , against the sacred bosom of private life , or the tender breast of individual reputation ; I trust , sir , that I have devoted my energies to -- to endeavours -- humble they may be , humble I know they are -- to instil those principles of -- which -- are -- ' Here the editor of the <NAME> , appearing to ramble , <NAME> came to his relief , and said -- ' Certainly. ' ' And what , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> -- ' what , <NAME> , let me ask you as an impartial man , is the state of the public mind in <NAME> , with reference to my contest with the _Independent_ ? ' ' Greatly excited , no doubt , ' interposed <NAME> , with a look of slyness which was very likely accidental .
1	" I declare to you , <NAME> , that with anything short of this case that I have , I would as soon have hoped to root up by means of my own strength and my own hands the oldest tree on this estate as to shake your hold upon <NAME> and <NAME> 's trust and confidence in you .
1	' Not to any stranger , ma ' am , ' said the good lady ; ' but she has been a companion to me for some years .
1	'There now , <NAME> , ' remonstrated <NAME> , eagerly catching at the word .
1	At first , none but the surgeon went close to it .
1	'He is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart , ' said <NAME> , colouring ; 'and that <NAME> which has thought fit to try him beyond his years , has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days six times over . '
1	He held her , almost as if she were sanctified to him by death , and kissed her , once , almost as he might have kissed the dead .
1	' Now let us see , ' said <NAME> .
1	Every question told. " " I always am sound ; am I not ? " " I do n't gainsay it .
1	He looked at the work upon the table , and praised the industry and speed of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls .
1	I had seen tears in her eyes when I had brought new honours home from school , and I had seen them there when we last spoke about her father , and I had seen her turn her gentle head aside when we took leave of one another ; but I had never seen her grieve like this .
1	<NAME> and hours , days and nights , he remained in this same condition .
1	He is my only relation in the world , <NAME> , and unless you plead for me , I fear I have lost even him .
1	<NAME> and I do not forget our duty -- what is my duty is <NAME> 's , as we have often said together -- and with your approval and consent , father , we will devote ourselves to making your life agreeable . "
1	' Is there nothing I can do ? ' asked <NAME> .
1	<NAME> was very full of it ; and said , that , picturing himself with such a home , and <NAME> waiting and preparing for him , he could think of nothing wanting to complete his bliss .
1	' He ' ll do , ' said <NAME> , ' though it ain ' t what I call him. ' The servant inquired if they had any appointment ?
1	If in my knowledge of THE secret I do what I can to spare an innocent girl ( especially , remembering your own reference to her when you told my story to the assembled guests at <NAME> ) from the taint of my impending shame , I act upon a resolution I have taken .
1	The <NAME> boys , as may be readily supposed , have very much the advantage of the others in point of personal appearance .
1	' On my Me -- on my fallen life ! ' returned the other , in the same low voice , but with a deeper stress on his words than he had yet seemed capable of giving them .
1	His being my lawyer , and his being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence .
1	God send that old nursery tales were true , and that gypsies stole such children by the score !
1	A murmur of voices had been audible on the outside , and , at the moment of our entrance , a clapping of hands : which latter noise , I was surprised to see , proceeded from the generally disconsolate Mrs. Gummidge .
1	And I tell you another thing , <NAME> , " says <NAME> , who has suddenly lowered his voice and become familiar again , " he 's an extraordinary old chap -- always rummaging among a litter of papers and grubbing away at teaching himself to read and write , without getting on a bit , as it seems to me .
1	When we had exhausted the subject of the stars , or rather when I had exhausted the mental faculties of <NAME> , little Em ' ly and I made a cloak of an old wrapper , and sat under it for the rest of the journey .
1	inquired <NAME> , with well-timed jocularity .
1	But do not hide from me ; do not steal away alone ; let me keep beside you .
1	Of her outward appearance I know no more than that she was like her mother .
1	He was a morose , savage-hearted , bad man ; idle and dissolute in his habits ; cruel and ferocious in his disposition .
1	But that ain ' t much to me , for I don ' t think I shall stop with him long. ' ' Not stop in your place , <NAME> ! ' cried his mother ; while Mr <NAME> opened his eyes .
1	Sitting beside him , I made a pretence of working for my dear , as he had always been used to joke about my being busy .
1	' Did I indeed , sir ? ' said <NAME> .
1	You see I know enough to know much more with very little help .
1	We may never meet again. ' ' In our course through life we shall meet the people who are coming to meet _us_ , from many strange places and by many strange roads , ' was the composed reply ; ' and what it is set to us to do to them , and what it is set to them to do to us , will all be done. ' There was something in the manner of these words that jarred upon <NAME> ' s ear .
1	' That ' s the ticket , sir. ' Very much perplexed by this summary disposition of this person , <NAME> walked back into the prison , revolving in his mind what he had better do .
1	<NAME> <NAME> also came to speak to us and did the honours of the place in much the same way , with the bland modesty of a proprietor .
1	I am much better here , ' said <NAME> , faintly .
1	She was afraid to look at him much , after the offence he had taken ; but she noticed two occasions in the course of his meal , when he all of a sudden looked at her , and looked about him , as if the association were so strong that he needed assurance from his sense of sight that they were not in the old prison-room .
1	' Keep your mouth shut ! -- I want to know , you sir , whether you charge that there crime on <NAME> ? ' ' If you ever do know , you won ' t know now. ' ' Perhaps you done it yourself ? ' said <NAME> , with a threatening action .
1	If a girl , doll or no doll , swoons within a yard or two of a man 's nose , he can see it without a perspective-glass .
1	The decent hair-guard that went round his neck and took care of his decent silver watch was an object of envy to her .
1	It ' s HIS daughter , is it ? ' Naturally as this was said , it was not said so naturally but that a kindred spirit like old <NAME> might have discerned a design upon the part of <NAME> to lead him on to much more explicit statements and explanations than he would have volunteered , or that <NAME> could in all likelihood have obtained by any other means .
1	I knew he always read at that hour , and as I drew near I saw the light shining out into the passage from his reading-lamp .
1	The cheering thought that he was labouring on where <NAME> had just toiled before him , would , of itself , have been a stimulant to <NAME> in the perpetual resumption of his studies ; but coupled with the actual lightening of his load , consequent on this assistance , it saved him , possibly , from sinking underneath the burden which the fair <NAME> piled upon his back .
1	He had been overthrown into gutters ; bespattered with mud ; violently flattened against posts .
1	Now , the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon anything but impulse all through his life , and it was no bad compliment to the nature of the impulses which governed him , that so far from being involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes , he had the warmest respect and esteem of all who knew him .
1	There were no conspicuous people in it , trading far and wide on rotten banks of religion , patriotism , virtue , honour .
1	Many ears and eyes were busy with a vision of the matter of these placards , among turning spindles , rattling looms , and whirling wheels , for hours afterwards ; and when the <NAME> cleared out again into the streets , there were still as many readers as before .
1	When he did throw his head back , and take it off quick , I had a horrible fear , I confess , of seeing him meet the fate of the lamented <NAME> , and fall lifeless on the carpet .
1	He 's a thief , a liar , a devil , all that 's bad , from this night forth .
1	Always think of me as quite an old man .
1	It glides over the park after the moving shadows of the clouds , and chases them , and never catches them , all day .
1	' If I ask advice of any one else , it ' s only letting in another person to be bought out , and then I shall be ruined that way , and might as well have given up the property and gone slap to the workhouse .
1	I may be slow , but I am precious sure. ' Not a syllable of this reflection shaped itself in any scrap of Mr Fledgeby ' s breath , lest it should tend to put his servant ' s price up .
1	In the evening , he found the dinner-table laid for four , but they sat down only three .
1	When all was still , at a late hour , poor crazed <NAME> came weeping to me and told me she had given her birds their liberty .
1	I was lying on the sofa , with a book and a wine-glass , at about that time , when the door opened , and a gentleman in a stiff cravat , within a year or two on either side of thirty , entered , in his hat and gloves ; walked up to the looking-glass ; arranged his hair ; took off his gloves ; slowly produced a measure from the uttermost depths of his coat-pocket ; and requested me , in a languid tone , to ' unfix ' my straps .
1	' Similarly , ' resumes <NAME> , ' I have observations as I can offer upon certain points and parties ; but I make no objections , Mr Venus .
1	It ' s some time since I was articled , but the payment of that hundred pounds was a great pull .
1	A four-oared galley hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an ugly circumstance that I could not get rid of .
1	' I beg your pardon , <NAME> ' am ? ' said Mr Boffin , coming to a stop .
1	<NAME> , hi ! ' <NAME> once more , savagely .
1	We must , in a measure , assist to turn them up .
1	I have been superseded as to some slight intentions I had , and I may say that I have now to begin life. ' Not very well knowing how to get rid of this applicant , and feeling the more embarrassed because his manner and appearance claimed a delicacy in which the worthy Mr <NAME> feared he himself might be deficient , that gentleman glanced into the mouldy little plantation or cat-preserve , of <NAME> ' s <NAME> , as it was that day , in search of a suggestion .
1	With me to manage the property , and my wife to manage the people -- Whew ! ' Again shaking her head , she returned : ' They will never quarrel with the girl .
1	" I do n't know , " he said as he looked at me , " what it is that sets me off again -- but -- bosh !
1	We came to a wharf , paved with uplifted faces ; got alongside , and were made fast , after some shouting and straining of cables ; darted , a score of us along the gangway , almost as soon as it was thrust out to meet us , and before it had reached the ship—and leaped upon the firm glad earth again !
1	' Sir ! ' ' <NAME> , I am your humble servant , ' said Mr Quilp , to whom the monosyllable was addressed .
1	' I did , ' said the son ; and he proceeded to relate , in as few words as possible , how he had fallen a ready dupe to the stratagems of <NAME> .
1	<NAME> , what views _have_ you set up as mine ? ' ' Here is a man—and a young man , ' said <NAME> , as if that made the matter infinitely worse , and he could have easily borne the loss of an old one , ' swept off the face of the earth by a deed of violence .
1	That individual is in legal possession of the premises , under a distress for rent .
1	' I don ' t defend myself , <NAME> , ' said the penitent <NAME> ; ' but the fellow has such a queer way with him and is such an artful dog , that first of all he set me upon thinking whether there was any harm in telling him , and while I was thinking , screwed it out of me .
1	They told me he was there .
1	I think <NAME> did too ; I think he darkened the room for that reason .
1	In fact , mother , I ca n't bear it ; I ca n't make up my mind to it .
1	Father , he did gain it .
1	He had nearly got downstairs , when he stopped , and drew the key from his pocket .
1	But , imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of wrong , and an inveterate hatred of a class , opportunity had developed her into a tigress .
1	What was , was all summed up in this : that she was lost , and he bowed down with sorrow and remorse .
1	Accordingly , <NAME> , as the man who has the greatest reputation to sustain , becomes the interpreter of the general instinct .
1	The venerable cathedral towers , and the old jackdaws and rooks whose airy voices made them more retired than perfect silence would have done ; the battered gateways , one stuck full with statues , long thrown down , and crumbled away , like the reverential pilgrims who had gazed upon them ; the still nooks , where the ivied growth of centuries crept over gabled ends and ruined walls ; the ancient houses , the pastoral landscape of field , orchard , and garden ; everywhere -- on everything -- I felt the same serener air , the same calm , thoughtful , softening spirit .
1	" See ! " returned the mender of roads , with extended finger .
1	She ran in , and was running out again when she saw me .
1	<NAME> remember what I said to you .
1	But the sad scene she had witnessed , was not without its lesson of content and gratitude ; of content with the lot which left her health and freedom ; and gratitude that she was spared to the one relative and friend she loved , and to live and move in a beautiful world , when so many young creatures -- as young and full of hope as she -- were stricken down and gathered to their graves .
1	We both grub on in a muddle .
1	' To make his fortune , ' Mr <NAME> repeated , in the same dumb manner .
1	Upon these were laid knives and forks for six or eight people .
1	I should have continued to avoid you , in pursuance of the same set purpose , for a short time longer , if we had not met now .
1	Towards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant , and then brought them back again to the candle ; which with a long-burnt wick drooping almost double , and hot grease falling down in clots upon the table , plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere .
1	<NAME> ' t let him come up till I ' ve got away .
1	Should I do it if I did not ? ' ' Are we to be estranged , <NAME> ? ' asked <NAME> , gazing at her like one frightened .
1	I ' ll get some cushions out of the church , and you and your friend shall lie down before the fire .
1	It then becomes apparent that the woman has taken possession of this knife , for safety ' s sake ; for , she too starting up , and restraining and expostulating with him , the knife is visible in her dress , not in his , when they drowsily drop back , side by side .
1	Mr Headstone , I don ' t say what you have got upon your conscience , for I don ' t know .
1	Here , a chaos of carts , overthrown and jumbled together , lay topsy-turvy at the bottom of a steep unnatural hill ; there , confused treasures of iron soaked and rusted in something that had accidentally become a pond .
1	" I thought you seemed as if you did n't like them ? " " I ca n't pretend that I do like them , and I suppose you do n't particularly .
1	Upon my word and honour , <NAME> , I don ' t know anything more about it .
1	' Ah ! ' said <NAME> , taking up her curls , and running them over his hand like water , ' here ' s another orphan , you see , sir .
1	' We ' ll go together , ' repeated <NAME> .
1	She is exceedingly courteous , you perceive , ' on this hint she bowed condescendingly , ' and will permit me to have the pleasure of introducing you : a gentleman from <NAME> , <NAME> ' am : newly arrived from <NAME> , after a very tempestuous passage : <NAME> , —the lady of the house ! ' We exchanged the most dignified salutations with profound gravity and respect , and so went on .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , quiet and unmoved , as a man of so much respectability ought to be , takes off his close black gloves as if he were skinning his hands , lifts off his tight hat as if he were scalping himself , and sits down at his desk .
1	When I first had the happiness of looking upon you , it was one fifteen , and had stood at that figure for a lengthened period .
1	When I looked down at the trampers whom we passed , and saw that well-remembered style of face turned up , I felt as if the tinker ' s blackened hand were in the bosom of my shirt again .
1	" I hope he did n't die of anything catching ?
1	' I have been telling <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , as the majestic lady came stalking up , ' that I have become , by a curious chance , Mr <NAME> ' s Secretary or man of business. ' ' I have not , ' returned <NAME> , waving her gloves in her chronic state of dignity , and vague ill-usage , ' the honour of any intimate acquaintance with Mr Boffin , and it is not for me to congratulate that gentleman on the acquisition he has made. ' ' A poor one enough , ' said <NAME> .
1	I had first seen him when I sent for him to lay this place waste for me ; having read of him in the newspapers , before I and the world parted .
1	For , <NAME> often stops short at itself and dies with the doer of it ; but <NAME> , never .
1	' Did you ever hear of the great commercial house of <NAME> & <NAME> ?
1	' I found out an <NAME> gen ' leman as was in authority , ' said <NAME> , ' and told him I was a-going to seek my niece .
1	He would shriek for help on the most improper occasions , -- as when we had a little dinner-party , or a few friends in the evening , -- and would come tumbling out of the kitchen , with iron missiles flying after him .
1	We went as quietly as we could , but four of us made some noise on the aged boards , and when we came to the second story we found we had disturbed a man who was standing there looking out of his room .
1	I could eat nothing and could not sleep , and I grew so nervous under those delays and the slow pace at which we travelled that I had an unreasonable desire upon me to get out and walk .
1	In the first place—it may be from some imperfect development of my organ of veneration—I do not remember having ever fainted away , or having even been moved to tears of joyful pride , at sight of any legislative body .
1	Behold me here to prevent it ! ' ' <NAME> is coming here ? ' said <NAME> , with a smile .
1	' You ' ll lose it again , if you don ' t take care. ' So just to prevent his losing it again , she put it on for him .
1	Nor are they desirous to prolong their visit , packing the few movables with all possible speed and never speaking above a whisper .
1	And what that deep red light in the opposite direction ?
1	He had all the cares of the world on his head in three months .
1	" My Lady is too high in position , too handsome , too accomplished , too superior in most respects to the best of those by whom she is surrounded , not to have her enemies and traducers , I dare say .
1	He was dressed in decent black , a little rusty , and had the appearance of a sagacious master in some handicraft .
1	' He ' s a bad ' un , ' said <NAME> , wiping his eyes ; ' a very bad ' un , is schoolmeasther. ' ' I can ' t bear the sight of him , <NAME> , ' said his wife .
1	'Especially , when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping with him , that 's arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts , and is too modest to want to be presented to the <NAME> on his return , ' added <NAME> .
1	' I ' m astonished at that , <NAME> , you being usually so quick !
1	' What is your great mode of smoothing and managing , <NAME> ?
1	And I only wish , with all my heart and soul , that any one of us came out of this matter half as well as he does. ' So saying , <NAME> walked out of the room , leaving <NAME> and <NAME> in most unpleasant astonishment .
1	' Why , no , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> ; ' as I dined in the coffee-room , and shall go to bed soon , it is hardly worth while .
1	For I will not , I will not , I won ' t , I won ' t , I won ' t ! ' ' <NAME> , my dear , ' said <NAME> , ' consider your child. ' ' Yes , ' shrieked Mrs. <NAME> , ' I will consider my child !
1	" My friends , " says he , " what is this which we now behold as being spread before us ?
1	' " First , " ' said <NAME> , ' " When <NAME> ' s faculties and memory for business became , through causes into which it is not necessary or expedient for me to enter , weakened and confused , -- HEEP -- designedly perplexed and complicated the whole of the official transactions .
1	As he is going to do so again , he happens to look at his coat-sleeve .
1	" What have I to do with that , or what have you ?
1	I have observed his face to be not the face of a true friend of the <NAME> .
1	Having given this pledge , which was rather a bold one , and not particularly easy of redemption , <NAME> lost no time in sallying forth , and taking measures for its immediate fulfilment .
1	" But that is a long time .
1	" Let us never be blind , " said <NAME> , " to her faults of temper , but it is to be hoped she meant well. " At about this time , I began to observe that he was getting flushed in the face ; as to myself , I felt all face , steeped in wine and smarting .
1	As often as I raised my eyes from what I was about , I met hers .
1	The water in the professional pipkin having been made to boil , in course of time , by various little shovelfuls of coal , which <NAME> took out of a practicable window-seat , labelled ' <NAME> , ' <NAME> adulterated his brandy ; and the conversation was becoming general , when it was interrupted by the entrance into the shop of a boy , in a sober gray livery and a gold- laced hat , with a small covered basket under his arm , whom <NAME> immediately hailed with , ' <NAME> , you vagabond , come here. ' The boy presented himself accordingly .
1	To begin with , <NAME> is the lady you had the parley with at what ' s-his-name place. ' ' Martigny , ' interposed <NAME> with an air of infinite languor .
1	' He wouldn ' t blow up alone .
1	All times will be alike to me. ' He listened to the man ' s retreating footsteps until the sound had passed , and then , gazing up into the sky , saw , or thought he saw , the same black cloud that had seemed to follow him home , and which now appeared to hover directly above the house .
1	I fancy his figure before me now , standing near her sofa , with his rough cap in his hand , and the blue eyes of my child-wife raised , with a timid wonder , to his face .
1	It had been matter of conversation with <NAME> when she was last in town , and this visit was the result .
1	'It is , ' replied <NAME> , 'that you must endeavour to forget me ; not as your old and dearly-attached companion , for that would wound me deeply ; but , as the object of your love .
1	This gentleman had been discovered on reference to the Court Guide , and being then and there present , swore that the snuff-box was his , and that he had missed it on the previous day , the moment he had disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to .
1	' I have now , my dear , ' he added , blurring out ' Will ' with his pencil , ' discharged myself of what is doubtless a formal duty in this case , but still a duty in such a case .
1	' You are always kind-hearted , and anxious to help the oppressed , my dear mother , ' said <NAME> , ' so you will be favourably disposed towards him , I know. ' ' I am sure , my dear <NAME> , ' replied Mrs. Nickleby , looking very hard at her new friend , and bending to him with something more of majesty than the occasion seemed to require : ' I am sure any friend of yours has , as indeed he naturally ought to have , and must have , of course , you know , a great claim upon me , and of course , it is a very great pleasure to me to be introduced to anybody you take an interest in .
1	' What a jolly old Jack it is ! ' cries the young fellow , with a clap of his hands .
1	I should lose almost all the value that I put upon the little learning I have , which is all owing to him , and which I conquered the difficulties of , that he might not think it thrown away upon me .
1	Now , if you will fetch any authorised neighbouring somebody to do it in return for my opening the door , I ' ll open the door .
1	' That is because you are good ; not because I am !
1	If you had come as a common beggar , I might have thrown a sixpence to you in remembrance of the clever knave you used to be ; but since you try to palm these stale tricks upon one you might have known better , I ' ll not part with a halfpenny -- nor would I to save you from rotting .
1	It was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more , and it was not disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognized and stared after .
1	Sometimes there is n't any milk , and sometimes the cat drinks it .
1	It is my intention , my dear Copperfield , to educate my son for the <NAME> ; I will not deny that I should be happy , on his account , to attain to eminence. ' ' For the <NAME> ? ' said I , still pondering , between whiles , on <NAME> .
1	' I shall never , <NAME> , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ' revert to the period when <NAME> was in difficulties , without thinking of you .
1	That it is in the stare of the pictures .
1	' Hope so ! ' echoed the dwarf , approaching close to his ear ; ' neighbour , I would I knew in what good investment all these supplies are sunk .
1	' Is it not likely that it should be ?
1	The images of Mrs. Squeers , my daughter , and my son <NAME> , all short of vittles , is perpetually before me ; every other consideration melts away and vanishes , in front of these ; the only number in all arithmetic that I know of , as a husband and a father , is number one , under this here most fatal go ! ' <NAME> long <NAME> might have declaimed , or how stormy a discussion his declamation might have led to , nobody knows .
1	' In the meanness of your nature you revile me with the meanness of my birth .
1	Towards which , what ' s your views , old lady ? ' Mrs Boffin , a smiling creature , broad of figure and simple of nature , with her hands folded in her lap , and with buxom creases in her throat , proceeded to expound her views .
1	He patiently awaits an explicit answer ; and <NAME> , more baffled by his patience than by anything else , at last desperately whispers a name in his ear .
1	It is not that I can do her any good , or render her any real service ; but she is so attached to me that my visit will have as much effect on her , as if I could do both .
1	<NAME> was sitting on a certain time by his window , with her work-basket between her and her old attendant , who was still her faithful companion .
1	" Well , " I returned , glad for once to get the better of him in cross-examination , " I do not know , for I have not made up my mind. " " You are going to dine ? " said <NAME> .
1	You have no idea how the <NAME> of the country ( overlook the <NAME> nature of the phrase , and don ' t be bored by it ) tends to being left alone .
1	The <NAME> , and other distinguished gentlemen crowded to render homage to the <NAME> Clubber ; and <NAME> stood bolt upright , and looked majestically over his black kerchief at the assembled company .
1	" I beg your pardon , <NAME> Jaggers. " " Halloa ! " said he , facing round , " what 's the matter ? " " I wish to be quite right , <NAME> , and to keep to your directions ; so I thought I had better ask .
1	But the melted snow had found its way into the carriage , and I had got out two or three times when a fallen horse was plunging and had to be got up , and the wet had penetrated my dress .
1	But it was in vain for the kind Captain to make such preparations for <NAME> , who sorely tried to do some honour to them , but could touch nothing , and could only weep and weep again .
1	' Now , young man , ' said the porter .
1	<NAME> looked about him for the <NAME> , and saw it not .
1	' This is a dry game .
1	What is that ? ' returns <NAME> .
1	I turned cold all over sometimes , for I could see myself as I was then , coming in at the very same door. ' ' As you were then , ' repeated <NAME> , with assumed carelessness ; ' how was that ? ' ' Such a little creature , ' said <NAME> , ' that they might have had pity and mercy upon me , only to remember it. ' ' You didn ' t find your way there , alone ! ' remarked <NAME> .
1	' He was there once before , ' said my aunt presently .
1	M. R. F. , who is a much younger cavalier than I , and a professed admirer of beauty , was so affable as to remark the other day ( he paid us a visit of two days up the river there , and much objected to the accommodation of the hotel ) , that <NAME> ought to have her portrait painted .
1	It then occurred to me as possible that the man might have slipped into my rooms ; so , lighting my candle at the watchman 's , and leaving him standing at the door , I examined them carefully , including the room in which my dreaded guest lay asleep .
1	This last manifestation as by far the most alarming , by reason of its threatening his prolonged stay on the premises , necessitated vigorous measures .
1	I should n't be at all surprised -- mark what I say ! -- if he got <NAME> a better situation . "
1	' <NAME> , ' returned my aunt gravely , ' I can ' t say .
1	Knowing that your clear head would propose that alternative , I have gone over the calculations in my mind ; and I find that to compound a felony , even on very high terms indeed , would not be as safe and good for me as my improved prospects in the Bank. ' ' Bitzer , ' said <NAME> , stretching out his hands as though he would have said , <NAME> how miserable I am !
1	' In the river , ' somebody rejoins .
1	<NAME> ' ee ! ' ' Mrs Meagles and your daughter -- ? ' ' <NAME> as well as possible , ' said Mr Meagles .
1	'By all means , ' observed <NAME> , with great alacrity .
1	laughed the same woman , when old <NAME> , producing a flannel bag with money in it , told out their several gains upon the ground .
1	I see he is listening , but can ' t hear .
1	<NAME> was in attendance , and loitered about until the expected train came in .
1	Theerfur ' tan ' t my intentions to moor <NAME> ' long with them , but to find a <NAME> ' fur her wheer she can fisherate for herself. ' ( A <NAME> ' signifies , in that dialect , a home , and to fisherate is to provide . )
1	' How very odd you are to-day , my dear !
1	" That 's very like <NAME> , " says <NAME> .
1	And <NAME> , the audacious creature who presumed , even in the dimmest and remotest distance of her imagination , to conjure up the degrading picture , ' I am a ' most inclined , ' said <NAME> , bursting with the fulness of her anger and the weakness of her means of revenge , ' to turn atheist when I think of it ! ' But instead of adopting this course of retaliation , <NAME> , on second thoughts , brought out the suspicious bottle , and ordering glasses to be set forth upon her favourite drum , and sinking into a chair behind it , called her satellites about her , and to them several times recounted , word for word , the affronts she had received .
1	' Well , ' returned Mr Boffin , ' if I am , that ' s my business .
1	' As to our being a pack of thieves , <NAME> , ' said the man , as he spat out some blood , and wiped more from his face ; ' you know better than that at midday .
1	Mrs Meagles , the blithest and busiest of mothers , went about singing and cheering everybody ; but she , honest soul , had her flights into store rooms , where she would cry until her eyes were red , and would then come out , attributing that appearance to pickled onions and pepper , and singing clearer than ever .
1	How could it be otherwise ?
1	And he did it ; yes , he did !
1	<NAME> <NAME> ( of <NAME> Salem-House <NAME> , <NAME> ) presided , and on his right sat the distinguished guest .
1	" Why , what do you mean ? "
1	It is not usual to cancel articles for any such reason .
1	But it took a bit of time to get it well round , the change come so oncommon plump ; did n't it ? " Somehow , I was not best pleased with <NAME> 's being so mightily secure of me .
1	He put on his hat and walked quickly down the garden , determined to investigate the matter to the very bottom .
1	You ' re quite right to mention it. ' ' I beg your pardon , <NAME> , ' faltered <NAME> , ' but we go out quite plenty Sir , thank you. ' ' What would you have then ? ' asked Mr Dombey .
1	Among the loungers under the <NAME> 's archway happened to be <NAME> 's Boy , -- true to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he had no business , -- and <NAME> 's boy had seen me passing from <NAME> 's in the direction of my dining-place .
1	To hear him laugh and see the broad good nature of his face then , one might have supposed that he had not a care in the world , or a dispute , or a dislike , but that his whole existence was a summer joke .
1	I say " ever since , " as if I had been here a week .
1	How much have I to be thankful for , in <NAME> ' s kind intention to give me my articles , which would otherwise not lay within the umble means of mother and self ! ' ' Then , when your articled time is over , you ' ll be a regular lawyer , I suppose ? ' said I .
1	I have no lover , of course .
1	Fifty thousand lairs surrounded him where people lived so unwholesomely that fair water put into their crowded rooms on Saturday night , would be corrupt on Sunday morning ; albeit my lord , their county member , was amazed that they failed to sleep in company with their butcher ' s meat .
1	' He is only glad to see me .
1	He was so lavish of this condescension , that he not only bowed to her , in a particular manner , on several occasions , but even entrusted such stately recognitions of her to his sister as ' pray tell your friend , <NAME> , that she is very good , ' or ' mention to <NAME> , <NAME> , that I am obliged to her ; ' specialities which made a deep impression on the lady thus distinguished .
1	Mr <NAME> said , or rather twitched out of himself in small pieces by the shirt-collar , that <NAME> having completely used up her place in the country , and also her house at <NAME> , and being , of course , unable , don ' t you see , to remain in <NAME> when there wasn ' t a soul there , and not feeling herself this year quite up to visiting about at people ' s places , had resolved to have a touch at <NAME> , where a woman like herself , with a proverbially fine appearance , and with no nonsense about her , couldn ' t fail to be a great acquisition .
1	<NAME> was thinking , with a sneer upon his lips , on the altered manner of <NAME> that day , and how soon their fellowship in a bad design had lowered his pride and established a familiarity between them , when his attentive ear caught the rustling of a female dress upon the stairs , and the footstep of a man .
1	' This fellow -- I grieve to say my brother ' s son : a reprobate and profligate , stained with every mean and selfish crime -- this fellow , coming here today to disturb a solemn ceremony , and knowing that the consequence of his presenting himself in another man ' s house at such a time , and persisting in remaining there , must be his being kicked into the streets and dragged through them like the vagabond he is -- this fellow , mark you , brings with him his sister as a protection , thinking we would not expose a silly girl to the degradation and indignity which is no novelty to him ; and , even after I have warned her of what must ensue , he still keeps her by him , as you see , and clings to her apron-strings like a cowardly boy to his mother ' s .
1	No matter that it was utterly irreconcilable with the nature of things and course of events that the wretched honourable gentleman could possibly produce a Precedent for this -- <NAME> would nevertheless thank the honourable gentleman for that ironical cheer , and would close with him upon that issue , and would tell him to his teeth that there Was NO Precedent for this .
1	Not long before , I had read in the newspapers , how a gentleman unknown had come to the <NAME> in the night , and had gone to bed , and had destroyed himself , and had been found in the morning weltering in blood .
1	<NAME> , thrusting Mr Flintwinch aside , proceeded straight up-stairs .
1	He returned to where he had stood before -- advanced a pace -- another -- another still .
1	<NAME> , astonishment , indignation , and a storm of passions , rushed through the listener ' s heart , as the plot was laid bare .
1	I needn ' t tell you , <NAME> , that I am under great obligations to Mr Headstone , and that I am very anxious for Mr Headstone to succeed in all he undertakes .
1	' Why this is indeed a joy I had not looked for ! ' said Mrs. Crummles , when <NAME> was presented .
1	If this be real , and her allotted time be not yet come , wake , <NAME> , wake !
1	' You won ' t see such boys as those very often , I think , ' said Mr Crummles .
1	There was not much to amuse in the room ; of which the most attractive feature was , a half-length portrait in oil , of <NAME> , whom the artist had depicted scratching his head in an easy manner , and thus displaying to advantage a diamond ring , the gift of <NAME> before her marriage .
1	" Talk of the angels , " says <NAME> .
1	Not caring to go too near the door , until the appointed time , <NAME> crouched into an angle of the wall , and awaited its arrival .
1	said the girl , with an expression of pleasure at his return .
1	At those times I used to think , how should I ever tell the two remaining babies that the baby who had learned of her faithful heart to be a mother to them in their need was dead !
1	There was duty to be done , and it was done , but not harshly .
1	' Stay a moment , <NAME> ; stay another moment .
1	' Are you sure it is ? ' ' Of course I am ! ' ' I have forgotten , ' said <NAME> , still turning the button round and round , ' what relation <NAME> is to you , you dear bad boy. ' ' No blood-relation , ' I replied ; ' but we were brought up together , like brother and sister. ' ' I wonder why you ever fell in love with me ? ' said <NAME> , beginning on another button of my coat .
1	I actually thought more than once that he ' d have sunk under ' em ; I did , indeed. ' Here <NAME> shook his head and paused ; on which , the elder <NAME> , nudging his neighbour , as begging him to mark the attorney ' s high connections , asked whether the duties in question produced any permanent ill effects on the constitution of his noble friend .
1	When the <NAME> had finished her toasting , she spread a clean cloth on a tray , and brought him some crisp slices and a great basin of weak tea , with which ( she said ) the doctor had left word he might refresh himself when he awoke .
1	' What ' s the matter , ma ' am ? ' said <NAME> ; ' you don ' t see a Fire , do you ? ' ' Oh dear no , sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit , ' I was thinking of the dew. ' ' What have you got to do with the dew , ma ' am ? ' said <NAME> .
1	The performance seemed a little long to <NAME> and <NAME> , particularly when it stopped to afford the Clown an opportunity of telling <NAME> ( who said ' Indeed , sir ! ' to all his observations in the calmest way , and with his eye on the house ) about two legs sitting on three legs looking at one leg , when in came four legs , and laid hold of one leg , and up got two legs , caught hold of three legs , and threw ' em at four legs , who ran away with one leg .
1	Something of distrust lingered about him still ; for he would often come , even in the dark evenings , and call in a timid voice outside the door to know if she were safe within ; and being answered yes , and bade to enter , would take his station on a low stool at her feet , and sit there patiently until they came to seek , and take him home .
1	' You know what I mean , do you , <NAME> ? ' inquired <NAME> , looking hard at him , through the spectacles .
1	I ' m glad he has lost his mistress .
1	<NAME> steam , tide , wind , and horses , all abate their speed , to linger on such happiness ?
1	He has had a fever .
1	But , perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in <NAME> 's <NAME> were principally occupied with the cares of other people ; and perhaps second-hand cares , like second-hand clothes , come easily off and on .
1	I calculate you ' ll have got through that case of the corporation , Judge , by this time , now ?
1	To return to the letter .
1	<NAME> ' t tell me that that handsome child has been in the habit of prowling about as she ' s done these last two or three days .
1	Each doing what she suggested , there was no want of assistance .
1	" <NAME> , my dear , " she would say , and always with some emotion , for with her lofty pedigree she had a very affectionate heart , " was descended from a great <NAME> family , the <NAME> of <NAME> .
1	" Sir , I have told you why .
1	This being purely a labour of love , <NAME> readily complied , and leaving the room for the purpose , almost immediately returned , supporting a sleek personage with an oily face , who , bursting from him , and giving to view the form and face of <NAME> , made straight up to <NAME> , and tucking that poor fellow ' s head under his arm in a most uncouth and awkward embrace , elevated his broad-brimmed hat at arm ' s length in the air as a token of devout thanksgiving , exclaiming , meanwhile , ' How little did I think of this here joyful meeting , when I saw him last !
1	When he looked out from his shelter in the distance , and saw that I waved my hat to him to come up , he rejoined me , and there we waited ; sometimes lying on the bank , wrapped in our coats , and sometimes moving about to warm ourselves , until we saw our boat coming round .
1	' The friendliness of this gentleman , ' said <NAME> to my aunt , ' if you will allow me , ma ' am , to cull a figure of speech from the vocabulary of our coarser national sports -- floors me .
1	' I don ' t like it , Mr Venus .
1	Do you recollect him ? ' No .
1	They were very fond of one another : that was certain .
1	<NAME> , my boy ! ' He was so perfectly satisfied both with his quotation and his reference to it , that he could not help repeating the words again in a low voice , and saying he had forgotten ' em these forty year .
1	There must be many ways of doing it .
1	Be good enough to pinch him , sir -- in the leg , if you please ; nothing else wakes him -- thank you .
1	It at once reduced <NAME> to begging , as a special favour , to be allowed to say what Mrs. <NAME> was most curious to hear .
1	and gave my little basket of housekeeping keys such a shake that they sounded like little bells and rang me hopefully to bed .
1	" I am to remain on this gaudy platform on which my miserable deception has been so long acted , and it is to fall beneath me when you give the signal ? "
1	' I never threshed a boy in a hackney coach before , ' said <NAME> , when he stopped to rest .
1	<NAME> , who would not have smiled for the world , replied composedly : ' But you are a very good penman , sir .
1	Other men 's fathers may have died of the rheumatism or may have taken base contagion from the tainted blood of the sick vulgar , but the <NAME> family have communicated something exclusive even to the levelling process of dying by dying of their own family gout .
1	The person on the sofa , who appeared to have a cold in his head , gave such a very loud snort that he startled me .
1	If I were but legally executor of <NAME> ' s will !
1	And as to the brim of his hat , it ' s narrow .
1	That 's my mother. " " Oh ! " said he , coming back .
1	He seems fully determined to drop down ; don ' t he ? ' Mr <NAME> opined that such was clearly his intention .
1	As this passage does not occupy more than twelve or thirteen hours , we arranged to go ashore that night : not coveting the distinction of sleeping in a state-room , when it was possible to sleep anywhere else .
1	He was not improved in habits , or in looks , or in manner ; but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity about him , which was new to the observation of <NAME> .
1	Give me your hand , <NAME> , give me your hand. ' <NAME> gave it ; but Mr <NAME> had driven his heart out of it , and nothing could change his face now , from its white , shocked look .
1	' About getting that customer that we paid the ten shillings in the pound to the bill- discounter for , on your account -- to get him out of the <NAME> , you know -- about getting him to Demerara. ' ' Oh , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> hastily .
1	And now the bell -- the bell she had so often heard , by night and day , and listened to with solemn pleasure almost as a living voice -- rung its remorseless toll , for her , so young , so beautiful , so good .
1	I see one thing , " said <NAME> .
1	" You will excuse me , <NAME> , " observes <NAME> .
1	But she 's patienter than others would be , and is clever too , and always willing , up to the full mark of her strength and over .
1	After darkly looking at his leg and me several times , he came closer to my tombstone , took me by both arms , and tilted me back as far as he could hold me ; so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine , and mine looked most helplessly up into his .
1	My Lady merely waves her off with indifference , saying , " There , there , child !
1	With a good deal more of that sort , which I wondered how they knew .
1	<NAME> <NAME> then once again dropped off to sleep , with a confused consciousness that <NAME> was still engaged in relating a long story , the chief point of which appeared to be that , on some occasion particularly stated and set forth , he had ' done ' a bill and a gentleman at the same time .
1	' I am not complaining , ' he returned , ' I am only stating the case .
1	'If he had , ' said <NAME> , 'the dog 'ud want to lead us away to where he did it .
1	He sat quietly looking at her ; but , with these appendages partially revealing themselves , and with a quantity of bristling oakum-coloured head and whisker , he had a formidable appearance .
1	' This is very kind of you , <NAME> ' r <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
1	' It ' s below stairs , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , and he ran down after it .
1	It passed rapidly , as may be supposed , to one entranced as I was ; and yet it gave me so many occasions for knowing <NAME> better , and admiring him more in a thousand respects , that at its close I seemed to have been with him for a much longer time .
1	<NAME> , the adult pupils were taught to read ( if they could learn ) out of the <NAME> Testament ; and by dint of stumbling over the syllables and keeping their bewildered eyes on the particular syllables coming round to their turn , were as absolutely ignorant of the sublime history , as if they had never seen or heard of it .
1	When it got so high , it got the upper hand of me , but this is how I always know there 's a eight in it . "
1	Everybody stares to see me using my own ; and two or three gentlemen are strongly disposed to banter me on my prejudices , but don ' t .
1	But at that instant the conversation , whatever it was , which had been carrying on near this fire was resumed , and the tones of the voice that spoke -- she could not distinguish words -- sounded as familiar to her as her own .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , satisfied , expresses high approval and awaits her coming at the door .
1	" If , sir , " she begins , " in my knowledge of my secret -- " But he interrupts her .
1	' In such good spirits ! ' said <NAME> .
1	As haggard and as shabby , as if , for want of custom , it had itself taken to drinking , and had gone the way all drunkards go , and was very near the end of it .
1	I thought of it much afterwards .
1	<NAME> ! ' The form moved , rose , advanced , and dropped upon its knees at his feet .
1	And as the boy hurried away with his hand to his head , singing quite a different sort of tune , <NAME> chuckled very heartily to himself , and entered the churchyard , locking the gate behind him .
1	You will have to get the better of that objection , <NAME> , and to accustom yourself to it very probably on many similar occasions ; unless you adopt the remedy which is in your own hands , of giving me no cause of complaint .
1	All others he was willing to forget .
1	' Ma , ' interposed the young lady , ' I must say I think it would be much better if you would keep to the point , and not hold forth about people ' s flying into people ' s faces , which is nothing more nor less than impossible nonsense. ' ' How ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , knitting her dark brows .
1	" Dear boy , " he said , as I sat down by his bed : " I thought you was late .
1	<NAME> <NAME> was suspected , with three companions .
1	I know she ' s a naughty , mischief-making old thing !
1	<NAME> of what must separate me , through the whole remainder of my life , from purity and innocence -- from you , of all the earth .
1	You don ' t come in here , ' said <NAME> ' s better-half , interposing her person , which was a robust one , in the doorway .
1	If the mistress put such a construction upon the behaviour of her new friends , what could the companion urge against them ?
1	' Take that hat up again. ' But this Sam flatly and positively refused to do ; and , after he had been severely reprimanded by his master , the officer , being in a hurry , condescended to pick it up himself , venting a great variety of threats against <NAME> meanwhile , which that gentleman received with perfect composure , merely observing that if <NAME> would have the goodness to put his hat on again , he would knock it into the latter end of next week .
1	Mellers it , is the word I should employ , Mr Boffin. ' His wooden conceit and craft kept exact pace with the delighted expectation of his victim .
1	' I said that it was better as it is ! ' she whispers , as she holds me in her arms .
1	He wants the stick , now and then : it 'll do him good ; and his board need n't come very expensive , for he has n't been overfed since he was born .
1	Very often afterwards , in the midst of their talk , he would break off , to try to understand what it was that the waves were always saying ; and would rise up in his couch to look towards that invisible region , far away .
1	I beg your pardon , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , rushing up to him , ' but I ' m happy to say it ' s all right , <NAME> .
1	It ' s the parting from her old playfellow and friend -- her favourite cousin -- that has done this .
1	Would you recommend his being spoken to , or his being left alone ?
1	said I , with my eyes filling fast ; but I thought they might , when it was not for myself .
1	At first I was painfully awake and vainly tried to lose myself , with my eyes closed , among the scenes of the day .
1	" You will not be late ? " " I shall be there before the commencement. " " And before the tumbrils arrive .
1	' We hadn ' t any thoughts of having a gentleman with us , sir , until you were kind enough to suggest it , and our accommodation ' s not extensive .
1	I knew it to be <NAME> 's file , and I knew that he knew my convict , the moment I saw the instrument .
1	And they were married with the sun shining on them through the painted figure of Our Saviour on the window .
1	' Oh ! ' said <NAME> , catching him a smart box on the ear .
1	The board being now clear of the more substantial articles of food , and punch , wine , and spirits being placed upon it and handed about , the guests , who had been previously conversing in little groups of three or four , gradually fell off into a dead silence , while the majority of those present glanced from time to time at <NAME> , and the bolder spirits did not even hesitate to strike the table with their knuckles , and plainly intimate their expectations , by uttering such encouragements as ' Now , <NAME> , ' ' Wake up , <NAME> , ' ' All charged , sir , and waiting for a toast , ' and so forth .
1	I have seen him so terrify a client or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket-handkerchief as if he were immediately going to blow his nose , and then pausing , as if he knew he should not have time to do it before such client or witness committed himself , that the <NAME> has followed directly , quite as a matter of course .
1	So I wagged , and hid myself , and that began it. ' ' And you mean to tell me , ' said Mr Carker , taking him by the throat again , holding him out at arm ' s-length , and surveying him in silence for some moments , ' that you want a place , do you ? ' ' I should be thankful to be tried , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , faintly .
1	It being now the afternoon in the—College—of which you are the eminent head , the young ladies might gain nothing , except in name , by having the rest of the day allowed them .
1	These were proud times for Mrs Nickleby ; never was anybody half so discreet and sage as she , or half so mysterious withal ; and never were there such cunning generalship , and such unfathomable designs , as she brought to bear upon <NAME> , with the view of ascertaining whether her suspicions were well founded : and if so , of tantalising him into taking her into his confidence and throwing himself upon her merciful consideration .
1	A lady of your sense and strength of character will be prepared for my now declaring it void and taking my own course . "
1	I did lose money before , certainly , but it doesn ' t quite follow that he took it .
1	I was fluttered by her being unexpectedly so near ( she was almost within speaking distance before I knew her ) and would have risen to continue my walk .
1	' I saw nothing of him , ' answered <NAME> ; ' but I saw that dear old soul <NAME> Linkinwater. ' ' Taking his evening walk , and coming on to rest here , before he turns back to the city , I ' ll be bound ! ' said Mrs. Nickleby .
1	She was followed by the whelp .
1	She walked among ' em with my child , minding only her ; and brought her safe out , in the dead of the night , from that black pit of ruin !
1	' Eh ? ' cried the old man , surveying him from head to foot .
1	They said no more , but sat apart ; the mother communing with her money ; the daughter with her thoughts ; the glance of each , shining in the gloom of the feebly lighted room .
1	This young man , besides having a great deal to say for himself about <NAME> and a project of his for teaching the coffee colonists to teach the natives to turn piano-forte legs and establish an export trade , delighted in drawing Mrs. Jellyby out by saying , " I believe now , Mrs. Jellyby , you have received as many as from one hundred and fifty to two hundred letters respecting <NAME> in a single day , have you not ? "
1	' <NAME> ? ' ' No -- the other gentleman. ' <NAME> ? ' ' Yes , sir. ' ' Poor Quanko -- never recovered it -- bowled on , on my account -- bowled off , on his own -- died , sir. ' Here the stranger buried his countenance in a brown jug , but whether to hide his emotion or imbibe its contents , we can not distinctly affirm .
1	How irrevocable would have been his knowledge of it , if he had remained with me but another hour !
1	' Mr <NAME> , ' said the boy , ' I want a word with you .
1	' Your lovely woman was told her fortune to night on her way home .
1	I have seen at my mother ' s -- Mrs Clennam in the city -- a young woman working at her needle , whom I have only heard addressed or spoken of as <NAME> .
1	And what ' s this straggling about in an idle sort of a way ?
1	How few of <NAME> 's faces are left alone to gladden us with their beauty !
1	It was far otherwise with little <NAME> .
1	' One who brings you news , was the answer , in a woman ' s voice .
1	And , although I trembled for the agony it might one day be to him to have his strong assurance shivered at a blow , there was something so religious in it , so affectingly expressive of its anchor being in the purest depths of his fine nature , that the respect and honour in which I held him were exalted every day .
1	And by this time the cherubic parent was so fearful of surprise , that , but for the two wooden legs on which <NAME> and <NAME> was reassuringly mounted , his conscience might have introduced , in the person of that pensioner , his own stately lady disguised , arrived at <NAME> in a car and griffins , like the spiteful Fairy at the christenings of the <NAME> , to do something dreadful to the marriage service .
1	" Pray think , once more , <NAME> , " said I .
1	It was the man ; the man he had followed in company with the girl , and whom he had overheard talking to <NAME> .
1	The time was , sir , when my dear brother Ned and I were two poor simple-hearted boys , wandering , almost barefoot , to seek our fortunes : are we changed in anything but years and worldly circumstances since that time ?
1	It was a by-street , and there was nobody about , or in the few wretched shops they passed .
1	' <NAME> surveyed the rooms he passed through , on his way downstairs , with the scrutinising eye of a landlord ; thinking it not impossible , that before long , they and their contents would be his property .
1	' <NAME> mun , matter eneaf for one neight , ' replied the guard ; ' dang the wall-eyed bay , he ' s gane mad wi ' glory I think , carse t ' coorch is over .
1	You will go , wo n't you ? "
1	Is it not enough that I should have suffered as I have , night and day ; that I should almost have sunk in my own estimation from very shame of having been brought into contact with such people ; but must I also be exposed to this unjust and most unfounded charge ! ' ' You will have the goodness to recollect , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' that when you use such terms as " unjust " , and " unfounded " , you charge me , in effect , with stating that which is untrue. ' ' I do , ' said <NAME> with honest indignation .
1	exclaimed the doctor , aghast in his turn .
1	' No harm in that sir , ' rejoined <NAME> , applying his eye to the other sleeve , and speaking in the voice of one who was contemplating an immense extent of prospect .
1	Away they dash and rattle through the streets ; and as they pass along , a thousand heads are turned to look at them , and a thousand sober moralists revenge themselves for not being married too , that morning , by reflecting that these people little think such happiness can ' t last .
1	Each of you will do what is best for the other , if not what is best for yourselves . "
1	" No objection. " I thanked him and ran home again , and there I found that <NAME> had already locked the front door and vacated the state parlor , and was seated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee , gazing intently at the burning coals .
1	The tone of the best society in this city , is like that of <NAME> ; here and there , it may be , with a greater infusion of the mercantile spirit , but generally polished and refined , and always most hospitable .
1	' By <NAME> , <NAME> , ' cried the Major , ' there ' s a lady in the case. ' ' Indeed , I begin to believe there really is , ' returned <NAME> ; ' I thought you might be jesting when you seemed to hint at it ; for I know you military men ' -- The <NAME> gave the horse ' s cough , and shook his head and shoulders , as much as to say , ' Well !
1	But she gave us her blessing , and the assurance of her lasting friendship , and spoke to us , generally , as became a Voice from the Cloister .
1	Externally , <NAME> showed no signs of being mellowed by these glowing vintages .
1	<NAME> , <NAME> , I have ruined <NAME> !
1	That is what it means .
1	Matters having reached this point , Mr <NAME> explained , and the virtuous feelings of his son being thereby calmed , they shook hands , and harmony reigned again .
1	In this self-imposed retirement , the <NAME> passed whole days and weeks without interchanging a word with anyone but Rob the <NAME> , whom he esteemed as a pattern of disinterested attachment and fidelity .
1	It was like asking , as a favour , to be sentenced to transportation from <NAME> .
1	Neither of the two observed that in the course of these walks , they attracted the attention of a working man who was standing near the engine , and who touched his hat every time they passed ; for Mr Dombey habitually looked over the vulgar herd , not at them ; and the Major was looking , at the time , into the core of one of his stories .
1	You charge again ' me that <NAME> got lost sight of , and was no more thought of .
1	<NAME> , fact , fact , everywhere in the material aspect of the town ; fact , fact , fact , everywhere in the immaterial .
1	' They are sitting up beyond their usual hour , I suppose .
1	She has not money , you have not youth .
1	' <NAME> , <NAME> ; it ' s near <NAME> ' s , and handy for me , you know .
1	On one of the back benches , remote in the subdued light and the strangeness of the place , sat the villainous whelp , sulky to the last , whom he had the misery to call his son .
1	She shared it with him ; and lingering on without pain , but without hope , her life ebbed slowly away .
1	I am not sure but that at first he was inclined to think it rather a moody scheme , and one that might do a brooding mind harm .
1	' My dear ' ; and he stopped and turned to me : ' would you like to see your -- ' ' No , father , ' <NAME> interposed .
1	Being besought to go to him and dress the wound , the <NAME> had passed out at the same gate , and had found him in the arms of a company of <NAME> , who were seated on the bodies of their victims .
1	You go and tramp , ' he ses .
1	But <NAME> asked , for me , whether he lived there , and they said he did .
1	returned <NAME> , opening her eyes .
1	" I think you have got the ague , " said I .
1	And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you , and for giving me your advice ; you know the young lady better than I do ; you were right , it never would have done. " <NAME> was so taken aback , that he looked quite stupidly at <NAME> shouldering him towards the door , with an appearance of showering generosity , forbearance , and goodwill , on his erring head .
1	Not less so , when she added : ' Even now , I see _you_ shrink from me , as if I had been cruel. ' Little Dorrit could not gainsay it .
1	Such an honour and pleasure -- it ' s both , <NAME> ' s mother , it ' s both -- is not to be forgotten so soon .
1	It was a prison for men .
1	It was ten o ' clock when I went out .
1	If I once shook the foundations of the sacred confidence and usage , in virtue of which it was given to me , it was lost , and could never be recovered .
1	' Nothing for me , sir , thank you , ' anxiously undrawing the strings of the little bag ; ' but if , while you stay here , you could be so kind as to teach my sister cheap -- ' ' My child , I ' ll teach her for nothing , ' said the dancing-master , shutting up the bag .
1	That he is killed ? ' ' He is dead , then ! ' exclaimed <NAME> .
1	<NAME> was the convincing reasoning of <NAME> ; and influenced by such arguments did <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> engage to array themselves in costumes which his taste and experience induced him to recommend as admirably suited to the occasion .
1	" And , " he says , " when your fellow-men is up , be it their lives or be it their watches , sharp is ever the word with you .
1	If the result should be -- ha -- mutually satisfactory , I might afterwards engage him to try his hand upon my family. ' The exquisitely bold and original thought presented itself to Mr Sparkler , that there was an opening here for saying there were some of the family ( emphasising ' some ' in a marked manner ) to whom no painter could render justice .
1	Mr Blandois , not at all put out by this omission on the part of the correspondents of the house of <NAME> and Co. , took his pocket-book from his breast-pocket , selected a letter from that receptacle , and handed it to Mr Flintwinch .
1	! ' ' Nonsense ! ' said <NAME> , turning back again .
1	The business will get rather complicated if I ' ve many more customers .
1	The unwelcome visitors advanced into the middle of the room .
1	There would be more of an adventurous spirit in it , and consequently more of a certain sort of poetry . "
1	Little <NAME> was a leading and a constant subject : for the circumstances of his life , united to those of her own story , presented the little creature to him as the only person between whom and himself there were ties of innocent reliance on one hand , and affectionate protection on the other ; ties of compassion , respect , unselfish interest , gratitude , and pity .
1	I have never had any such thing. " In another moment we were in the brewery , so long disused , and she pointed to the high gallery where I had seen her going out on that same first day , and told me she remembered to have been up there , and to have seen me standing scared below .
1	" In fact , <NAME> , " proceeds <NAME> , " it is not holding up a good model for imitation to ask the officer any such questions as you have put to him .
1	A happy New Year to all the world .
1	And I did so , on the supposition that you could not fail to be highly proud of it. ' Now , there are these two curious touches of human nature working the secret springs of this dialogue .
1	' You have seen me , young lady , ' repeated <NAME> , as she did not answer , ' once before. ' <NAME> coughed again .
1	Now I think of it , the gentleman who brought us to your house . "
1	That ' s an under-handed mind , sir. ' ' Do you say there ' s something against him ? ' <NAME> asks .
1	He makes so much of you , that it ' s my opinion you think you ' ve only to call your Pussys by the dozen , to make ' em come. ' ' You forget , Mrs. Tope , ' <NAME> interposes , taking his place at the table with a genial smile , ' and so do you , <NAME> , that <NAME> and <NAME> are words prohibited here by common consent and express agreement .
1	That made me think of all my past life ; and that brought me , as it ought to have done before , into a better condition .
1	If I am to remain and hold up my head , I must be scratched .
1	The way -- now you won ' t ask any more , you know ? ' said <NAME> , turning his eyes , which were now fast getting drowsy and stupid , upon her .
1	How could they be near us , and be green and fresh ?
1	I said to <NAME> , meanwhile , that even if <NAME> were recognized and taken , in spite of himself , I should be wretched as the cause , however innocently .
1	So quietly did the mowing of the old scythe go on , that fully three months had passed unnoticed since the two <NAME> brothers had been laid in one tomb in the strangers ' cemetery at <NAME> .
1	I prepared <NAME> for <NAME> ' s arrival and it was not long before he came .
1	' Your master is morally bound—and ought to be legally , under ruinous penalties—to provide for the comfort of his fellow-man. ' The driver instituted , with the palms of his hands , a superficial perquisition into the state of his skeleton ; which seemed to make him anxious .
1	' You have been recently married , ma ' am ? ' ' I have , ' replied <NAME> , in a scarcely audible tone , laying aside her work , and becoming greatly agitated as a thought , that had occurred to her before , struck more forcibly upon her mind .
1	And now I tell you , once and away , <NAME> , that <NAME> , commonly called <NAME> , his hand and no other , done the deed , on his own confession to me .
1	" He appears to be an excellent master , " I observed .
1	It would suit ( he considers ) a young bride , to perfection ; especially if of a rather diminutive style of beauty .
1	All this intelligence I dutifully imparted to my aunt , only reserving to myself the mention of little Em ' ly , to whom I instinctively felt that she would not very tenderly incline .
1	He looked dejectedly round , and slunk away ; and , as he reached the door , the titterings of the paupers broke into a shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight .
1	' To carry out an idea , ' repeated <NAME> ; ' and that ' s the great convenience of living in a thoroughfare like the <NAME> .
1	I had no right , I knew very well , to be uncomfortable because she confided in me , and I felt it was unreasonable ; still , with all I could do , I could not quite help it .
1	My dear Clennam , I thoroughly confide in you ; you have it in your power to be quite as useful to me as I have , or have had , it in my power to be useful to you ; your old place awaits you , and wants you very much ; there is nothing to detain you here one half-hour longer. ' There was silence , which was not broken until <NAME> had stood for some time at the window with his back towards them , and until his little wife that was to be had gone to him and stayed by him .
1	I knew I had an artful customer to deal with and that proof would be very difficult ; and I laid a trap for her -- such a trap as I never laid yet , and such a venture as I never made yet .
1	' Now , it ' s a remarkable fact , sir , that it cut that man deeper , to know that his daughter knew of his being goosed , than to go through with it. ' ' Good ! ' interrupted <NAME> .
1	What answer do you make ? ' ' Sir , ' he rejoined , with an occasional separation and reunion of those delicate tips , ' my answer must be qualified ; because , to betray <NAME> ' s confidence to his mother , and to betray it to you , are two different actions .
1	" Did n't I tell you , " said the other convict then , " that he would murder me , if he could ? " And any one could see that he shook with fear , and that there broke out upon his lips curious white flakes , like thin snow .
1	' Confound you , what do you mean ? ' said the stout man rising a little , and supporting himself on his elbow .
1	At last it falls ; and then a dumb old woman lies upon the bed , and she is crooked and shrunk up , and half of her is dead .
1	But not as she did .
1	Following it at a respectful distance , <NAME> passed into the bed-chamber , where a fire had been sometime lighted , and was burning briskly .
1	He must have given him the slip somehow , or he would n't be so easy . '
1	It led to my remarking , with more zeal than discretion , that it came with a bad grace from him , to whom <NAME> had lent money in my presence but a week or so before .
1	As to me , I sat on his left hand , and the rest were grouped about us , on the nearest beds and on the floor .
1	Still you see , as far as it goes , a pair of pigeons are portable property all the same. " With that , he looked back , and nodded at this dead plant , and then cast his eyes about him in walking out of the yard , as if he were considering what other pot would go best in its place .
1	I have a right to complain of it as almost a breach of confidence .
1	But the figure that he seeks is not among them .
1	I am obliged to you , Carker. ' Mr <NAME> bent his head slowly , and very softly rubbed his hands , as if he were afraid by any action to disturb the current of Mr <NAME> ' s confidence .
1	Not that that is much though , I am sure .
1	And if they forgot me , I should never know it , ' replied <NAME> .
1	He thought besides , ' This is a very odd beginning .
1	Ever so fur as I went , ever so fur the mountains seemed to shift away from me .
1	If I have not ( Macbeth-like ) broken up the feast with most admired disorder , Daisy. ' ' But where are they all , I wonder ! ' said I .
1	' What I particularly request <NAME> to be careful of , is , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ' that he does not , my dear <NAME> , in applying himself to this subordinate branch of the law , place it out of his power to rise , ultimately , to the top of the tree .
1	There ' s many of them , I ' m sure , that would be the better for it. ' ' Thank you , <NAME> .
1	He sat up in bed and listened .
1	' How are you , <NAME> ? ' said he .
1	' You are Mr <NAME> , the new schoolmaster ? ' he said , greeting <NAME> ' s kind friend .
1	and I should like to leave a small balance in his favour , to be settled when he can .
1	The <NAME> , left to himself , resumed his perusal of the news as if nothing unusual or unexpected had taken place , and went reading on with the greatest assiduity .
1	You couldn ' t expect that , could you , <NAME> ' am ? ' ' Oh !
1	I congratulated her ( as she addressed herself to me ) upon this fortunate addition to her income and wished her a long continuance of it .
1	An unhealthy-looking boy , with warts all over his hands , stepped from his place to the master ' s desk , and raised his eyes imploringly to <NAME> ' s face ; his own , quite white from the rapid beating of his heart .
1	' Do you know nothing of a woman ' s anger ? ' ' You have a saucy tongue , <NAME> , ' said Mr Dombey .
1	I should have liked to know her .
1	Nobody accepting the challenge , and his pipe being by this time smoked out , he proceeded to amuse himself by sketching a ground-plan of <NAME> on the table with the piece of chalk which had served him in lieu of counters ; whistling , meantime , with peculiar shrillness .
1	Imagine a human face upon the vessel ' s prow , with fifteen thousand Samsons in one bent upon driving her back , and hitting her exactly between the eyes whenever she attempts to advance an inch .
1	He thought of it , felt how easy it would be to do , and longed to do it ; but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the spectre at his side .
1	'Has it long gone the half-hour ? '
1	' Supposing we should decide , on to-morrow ' s inquiries , to send <NAME> down to <NAME> to this lady , who would go with him ? ' inquired Mr Dombey , after some reflection .
1	She sat at the window , when the sun began to sink behind the smoke ; she sat there , when the smoke was burning red , when the colour faded from it , when darkness seemed to rise slowly out of the ground , and creep upward , upward , up to the house-tops , up the church steeple , up to the summits of the factory chimneys , up to the sky .
1	But , then twisting himself suddenly round upon him , he found his look unchanged .
1	The vendor observing this , increased in loquacity .
1	You must accommodate the visit to the demands upon my time .
1	' Are you there , <NAME> ? ' said her brother , looking in at the door .
1	What I say is , I must come off clear and full or not at all .
1	' He ' s in a cab , sir , at the door .
1	The host smiled , disappeared , and shortly afterwards returned with a steaming jorum : of which , the first gulp brought the water into <NAME> 's eyes .
1	I am not sure that it may not be worth while , before long , to take credit with the stranger , <NAME> , by discovering your designs upon the child ; but for the present we ' ll remain the best friends in the world , with your good leave. ' Pursuing these thoughts , and gasping as he went along , after his own peculiar fashion , Mr Quilp once more crossed the <NAME> , and shut himself up in his <NAME> ' s <NAME> , which , by reason of its newly-erected chimney depositing the smoke inside the room and carrying none of it off , was not quite so agreeable as more fastidious people might have desired .
1	' I really , ' said Mr Toots , ' in this house , where whatever was done to me in the way of -- of any mental confusion sometimes -- which is of no consequence and I impute to nobody -- I was always treated like one of <NAME> ' s family , and had a desk to myself for a considerable period -- can -- not -- allow -- my friend <NAME> to be -- ' Mrs <NAME> suggested ' married. ' ' It may not be inappropriate to the occasion , or altogether uninteresting , ' said Mr Toots with a delighted face , ' to observe that my wife is a most extraordinary woman , and would do this much better than myself -- allow my friend <NAME> to be married -- especially to -- ' <NAME> suggested ' to <NAME> Blimber. ' ' To Mrs Feeder , my love ! ' said Mr Toots , in a subdued tone of private discussion : " ' whom God hath joined , " you know , " let no man " -- don ' t you know ?
1	Dear me , where is she ? ' ' <NAME> , my dear ! ' cried <NAME> , ' where are you ?
1	Mrs Chivery , speaking as a mother and not as a diplomatist , had then , from a different point of view , desired her husband to recollect that their <NAME> had never been strong , and that his love had fretted and worrited him enough as it was , without his being driven to do himself a mischief , as nobody couldn ' t say he wouldn ' t be if he was crossed .
1	<NAME> started at the word of command , and before a gun was fired he had reached the lake .
1	He took his usual poor eighteenpennyworth of food in his usual indigestive way , and had as little to say for himself as ever a wonderful man had .
1	An Appearance in the <NAME> 29 .
1	Lastly , <NAME> was a prey to such slow musical madness , that when , in course of time , she had taken off her white muslin scarf , folded it up , and buried it , a sulky man who had been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the front row of the gallery , growled , " Now the baby 's put to bed let 's have supper ! " <NAME> , to say the least of it , was out of keeping .
1	<NAME> ' ll remember like a good soul , won ' t ye , that the market price is dreffle high just now ?
1	Say what it is , only say what it is. ' ' My dearest <NAME> , nothing .
1	I never thought this of him. " " My husband , it is so .
1	" That 's the whole of it . "
1	' All right , ' was the reply .
1	<NAME> remains to be said to him from me , after what I have said for good and all , to-night. ' ' And this girl , ' cried the boy , contemptuously throwing her off again , ' calls herself a sister ! ' ' Charley , dear , that is the second time that you have almost struck me .
1	The fly-drivers , among whom I inquired next , were equally jocose and equally disrespectful ; and the shopkeepers , not liking my appearance , generally replied , without hearing what I had to say , that they had got nothing for me .
1	It was <NAME> , and I had to stir the pudding for next day , with a copper-stick , from seven to eight by the <NAME> clock .
1	I could only hope to do so by chance. ' ' I think , <NAME> ' r <NAME> , I know wheer to look. ' ' It is dark .
1	When the <NAME> had considered it a little while , she said to the tiny woman , And you keep watch over this every day ?
1	I HAD one , but what he may think about it at the present time I can ' t say .
1	There -- <NAME> -- sounds well , I think , sir. ' ' Very , ' said <NAME> .
1	My father ' s not in the way , and won ' t be in the way to-day , ' said <NAME> .
1	She is rather long , notwithstanding ; but by and by I hear a rustling at the door , and someone taps .
1	Nor did he remove his hand into its former posture , but kept it in the same warning attitude until he had finished the paragraph , when he paused for a few seconds , with a smile upon his face , as who should say ' this editor is a comical blade -- a funny dog , ' and then asked her what she wanted .
1	He was about two or three and fifty , and a trifle below the middle size ; he wore a white neckerchief with long ends , and a suit of scholastic black ; but his coat sleeves being a great deal too long , and his trousers a great deal too short , he appeared ill at ease in his clothes , and as if he were in a perpetual state of astonishment at finding himself so respectable .
1	' <NAME> for ever ! ' roared the honest and independent .
1	' He ' s certain not to be back this week , and it ' s a chance whether he will be next ; for when <NAME> once gets out of town , he ' s never in a hurry to come back again. ' ' Out of town ! ' said <NAME> ; ' dear me , how unfortunate ! ' ' <NAME> ' t go away , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' I ' ve got a letter for you. ' The stranger , seeming to hesitate , once more looked towards the ground , and the clerk winked slyly at <NAME> , as if to intimate that some exquisite piece of humour was going forward , though what it was <NAME> could not for the life of him divine .
1	The two caps , reflected on the window-blind , were the respective head- dresses of a couple of Mrs. <NAME> ' s most particular acquaintance , who had just stepped in , to have a quiet cup of tea , and a little warm supper of a couple of sets of pettitoes and some toasted cheese .
1	That what the <NAME> had to do , was to stick on to the national ship as long as they could .
1	Mr <NAME> has seen him for some days past , and a very clever man I believe him to be .
1	To know something of the life of one in whom I felt such interest ; to see her in the street , to pass the house in which she lived , to meet her sometimes in her walks , to hope that a day might come when I might be in a condition to tell her of my love , this was the utmost extent of my thoughts .
1	<NAME> and blest the morning that should rise on such a night : for men , delayed no more by stumbling-blocks of their own making , which are but specks of dust upon the path between them and eternity , would then apply themselves , like creatures of one common origin , owing one duty to the Father of one family , and tending to one common end , to make the world a better place !
1	There was a little mound of damped ashes on the top of the fire , and another little mound swept together under the grate , as there had been night and day for fifteen years .
1	Worn out as she was , and fatigued in mind and body , she sat up alone , counting the minutes , until he returned -- penniless , broken-spirited , and wretched , but still hotly bent upon his infatuation .
1	Hundreds of People The quiet lodgings of <NAME> were in a quiet street-corner not far from Soho-square .
1	He conversed with the great <NAME> on that relaxation of the throat with which young curates were too frequently afflicted , and on the means of lessening the great prevalence of that disorder in the church .
1	' I should give her , ' said the doctor at length , ' a tea-spoonful , every now and then , of hot brandy and water. ' ' Why , that ' s exactly what we ' ve done , sir ! ' said the delighted landlady .
1	' My dear , I haven ' t one ! ' ' Not one ? ' ' Well !
1	<NAME> 's nephew revelled in another laugh , and as it was impossible to keep the infection off ; though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar ; his example was unanimously followed .
1	Tell me more of your history .
1	With an old sheepskin knapsack at his back , and a rough , unbarked stick cut out of some wood in his hand ; miry , footsore , his shoes and gaiters trodden out , his hair and beard untrimmed ; the cloak he carried over his shoulder , and the clothes he wore , sodden with wet ; limping along in pain and difficulty ; he looked as if the clouds were hurrying from him , as if the wail of the wind and the shuddering of the grass were directed against him , as if the low mysterious plashing of the water murmured at him , as if the fitful autumn night were disturbed by him .
1	'That 's the boy , is it ? '
1	The Jew shook his head , and was about to reply , when the stranger , interrupting him , motioned to the house , before which they had by this time arrived : remarking , that he had better say what he had got to say , under cover : for his blood was chilled with standing about so long , and the wind blew through him .
1	On my return downstairs , I felt that Mrs. <NAME> looked down upon me rather for being so frivolous , and I was sorry for it , though at the same time I knew that I had no higher pretensions .
1	So we took our departure after a very loving farewell between <NAME> and her betrothed , and during our walk she was so happy and so full of old <NAME> 's praises that I would not have said a word in his disparagement for any consideration .
1	I sat down and said after a little effort to be as calm as I ought to be , " One of my earliest remembrances , guardian , is of these words : 'Your mother , <NAME> , is your disgrace , and you were hers .
1	' Eh ! ' said <NAME> , with a look of virtuous surprise .
1	" Now , mistress , " says the lawyer , tapping the key hastily upon the chimney-piece .
1	But it succeeded , and she asked , after a silence : ' Is he married ? ' ' <NAME> , deary , ' said the mother .
1	Here , the party straightway retired to rest ; the refreshment of sleep being necessary after so long a journey ; and here they met again about noon , to a substantial breakfast , spread by direction of <NAME> , in a small private room upstairs commanding an uninterrupted view of the stables .
1	Should possibilities be worse to bear than certainties ?
1	' An escapade of a week or so. ' ' And how are they all ?
1	As the knocking , however , instead of accommodating itself to his lazy state , increased in vigour and became more importunate , as if in earnest remonstrance against his falling asleep again , now that he had once opened his eyes , <NAME> began by degrees to comprehend the possibility of there being somebody at the door ; and thus he gradually came to recollect that it was Friday morning , and he had ordered <NAME> to be in waiting upon him at an early hour .
1	Whether it was the following Sunday when I saw the gentleman again , or whether there was any greater lapse of time before he reappeared , I can not recall .
1	Here is my umble dwelling , <NAME> ! ' We entered a low , old-fashioned room , walked straight into from the street , and found there Mrs. Heep , who was the dead image of <NAME> , only short .
1	I would not hurt a hair of his gray head , for the riches of the world. " ' The old man cast down his eyes at this reproof , and they met those of his daughter .
1	I quickened my pace , and , passing among them , wondering at their looks , went hurriedly in .
1	You have the honour of being sister to one of the greatest scoundrels unhung ; and , if I may venture to say so to a lady , you are in every respect quite worthy of him .
1	I would give them my aunt .
1	' <NAME> , sir , I have company there. ' ' Have you , by <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> ; ' I suppose you happen to know whose premises these are ? ' ' <NAME> , they are yours , and I am your servant in them. ' ' Oh !
1	Is that long enough ? ' I answered , laughing , that I thought we might get through it in that time , but that he must come also ; for he would find that his renown had preceded him , and that he was almost as great a personage as I was .
1	I say the children ; I have two little daughters .
1	' I scorn your shifty evasions , and I scorn you , ' said the schoolmaster .
1	I justify myself by the authority of these Books , ' she cried , with stern emphasis , and appearing from the sound that followed to strike the dead-weight of her arm upon the table .
1	" Pray , pray tell me more . "
1	' I would not for the world , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
1	' Now , is it all thought out ?
1	The sprightly <NAME> is reputed , in that grass-grown city of the ancients , <NAME> , to be stimulated by an urgent curiosity which impels her on all convenient and inconvenient occasions to sidle about with a golden glass at her eye , peering into objects of every description .
1	He was greyer , the lines in his face and forehead were deeper , and he had every appearance of having toiled and wandered through all varieties of weather ; but he looked very strong , and like a man upheld by steadfastness of purpose , whom nothing could tire out .
1	<NAME> paid the first week in advance. ' ' Then you had better get them out at the end of it , ' said <NAME> .
1	' Show the gentlemen into the parlour , <NAME> , ' said the landlady .
1	It was a crazy old house with a wharf of its own , abutting on the water when the tide was in , and on the mud when the tide was out , and literally overrun with rats .
1	<NAME> <NAME> ' s spirits were so low , in truth , that he half determined , that day , to take no further precautions against surprise from <NAME> , but to abandon himself recklessly to chance , and be indifferent to what might happen .
1	Let us waste no words about it .
1	At first the whelp would not draw any nearer , but persisted in remaining up there by himself .
1	Here <NAME> , seized with a fit of coughing in the midst of his triumph , breaks off to ejaculate , " Oh , dear me !
1	How can you consistently ask me such a question ?
1	It said , " What the de-vil are you crying for ? "
1	Keep this quiet , and make no inquiry for me ; it is useless .
1	' And nobody , ' pursued <NAME> in the same tone , ' will hear , on any account whatever , of bringing it out. ' <NAME> looked reflective , and nodded her head slowly ; as who should say , ' Such things are , and why are they ! ' ' Now , you know , ' said <NAME> , ' _I_ couldn ' t write a play. ' ' Not a bad one , sir ? ' said <NAME> , innocently , with her eyebrows again in action .
1	Let us go forward and meet her. ' As they advanced , she saw them coming , and seemed rather troubled .
1	Let me think -- what was the year again ! '
1	The terrors that had assailed me whenever Mrs. <NAME> had gone near the pantry , or out of the room , were only to be equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had done .
1	<NAME> goes into various shops and parlours , examining the inhabitants , always shutting the door first , and by exclusion , delay , and general idiotcy exasperating the public .
1	So will my daughter <NAME> be .
1	I , who never have deserted you ; who never <NAME> desert you , <NAME> ! ' ' My love , ' said <NAME> , much affected , ' you will forgive , and our old and tried friend <NAME> will , I am sure , forgive , the momentary laceration of a wounded spirit , made sensitive by a recent collision with the <NAME> of <NAME> -- in other words , with a ribald <NAME> attached to the water-works -- and will pity , not condemn , its excesses. ' <NAME> then embraced Mrs. Micawber , and pressed my hand ; leaving me to infer from this broken allusion that his domestic supply of water had been cut off that afternoon , in consequence of default in the payment of the company ' s rates .
1	' So good-bye , <NAME> , ' said my aunt , ' and take care of yourself !
1	What did he tell thee , <NAME> ? ' ' Exactly what I told you , dear grandfather , indeed. ' ' True , ' said the old man , faintly .
1	asked the other man in a hoarse voice .
1	I am as giddy as a drunken man .
1	' Then , my friend , ' cried <NAME> , starting up and taking his work-roughened hand , ' it shall be begun all over again ! ' <NAME> looked alarmed , and replied in a hurry -- for him , ' <NAME> , no .
1	The wind has been and blown the door to , and I can ' t get in. ' ' Hah ! ' said the gentleman , who took that very coolly .
1	' Yes , ' said Mr Carker , ' we have received it !
1	I am extremely sorry to see this in you , <NAME> , " I repeated .
1	She was generally spoken of as ' a great manager ' of children ; and the secret of her management was , to give them everything that they didn ' t like , and nothing that they did -- which was found to sweeten their dispositions very much .
1	<NAME> , hooray , hooray ! —And now , <NAME> , let ' s have a little talk about <NAME> .
1	He said , shaking hands with me , ' Copperfield , you are a true friend ; but when the worst comes to the worst , no man is without a friend who is possessed of shaving materials. ' At this dreadful hint Mrs. Micawber threw her arms round <NAME> ' s neck and entreated him to be calm .
1	'In the King 's name , ' cried the voices without ; and the hoarse cry arose again , but louder .
1	said <NAME> , clenching his fist .
1	He is the father of my twins !
1	Hardly relying on my own interpretation of the indistinct sounds he made , I caused <NAME> to hear them .
1	No tear , or sound of complaint escaped him ; but the unsettled look , and disordered haste with which he paced up and down the yard , denoted the fever which was burning within .
1	' What if I had found out one who knew your brother ' s secret ; who knew the manner of his flight , who knew where he and the companion of his flight were gone ?
1	<NAME> need , in presence of that tribunal and that auditory , to show how the <NAME> had not made the paper public , with the other captured <NAME> memorials borne in procession , and had kept it , biding their time .
1	I wrote her a long letter , in which I tried to make her comprehend how blest I was , and what a darling <NAME> was .
1	Seated at the same table , though with his chair modestly and uncomfortably drawn a little way from it , sits a bald , mild , shining man who coughs respectfully behind his hand when the lawyer bids him fill his glass .
1	Many years ago , it had had it in its mind to slide down sideways ; it had been propped up , however , and was leaning on some half-dozen gigantic crutches : which gymnasium for the neighbouring cats , weather-stained , smoke-blackened , and overgrown with weeds , appeared in these latter days to be no very sure reliance .
1	The latter mode of pronunciation is perhaps the most in favour .
1	' But if we talk of examples to be shunned , ' said he , ' if we come to boys that should be a warning and a beacon to all their fellows , here ' s the one , and I hope you won ' t spare him .
1	Where there ' s a will , there ' s a way , you know. ' <NAME> made no verbal answer to this remark , but putting his hand in his pocket , pulled out an old purse of solid leather , and insisted that <NAME> should borrow from him whatever he required for his present necessities .
1	' Not I , <NAME> , thank you , ' said <NAME> , laughing .
1	I will make no such pretence to you .
1	<NAME> clasped his hands , and sank feebly backward .
1	I ' ve told her how I ' m sitivated ; she ' s ready to vait till I ' m ready , and I believe she vill .
1	<NAME> says that another of them hadn ' t a sixpence eighteen months ago , and , through the brilliancy of his genius in getting those shares issued at eighty-five , and buying them all up with no money and selling them at par for cash , has now three hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds -- Buffer particularly insisting on the odd seventy-five , and declining to take a farthing less .
1	<NAME> <NAME> instantly struck in , and begged to inquire what Mrs MacStinger meant by that , and if she knew whom she was talking to .
1	<NAME> night , my dear. ' Somehow , <NAME> was not so well pleased with this assurance and this prospect as she might have been .
1	My mind flew back to <NAME> ; and could it be <NAME> , I thought , who used to draw the skeletons !
1	It being necessary to take soundings every minute , and to feel the way with the greatest caution , Mr Wegg ' s attention was fully employed .
1	' Shall I speak of our affairs , mother ?
1	But we went to Mr Chivery before we came to the gate , and he brought us in , and got <NAME> ' s room for us -- my poor old room , you know -- and we waited there a little .
1	The fact is , that feeling extremely interested in everything that relates to <NAME> -- not for any selfish reason , <NAME> , for I am well aware that the most able thing I could do for all parties would be to put an end to my existence , which can only be regarded as an inconvenience -- I have been in the habit of bestowing a trifle now and then upon a footman ; a most respectable young man , of the name of <NAME> , who has lived in the family some time ; and <NAME> informed me , yesterday evening , that this was the state of things .
1	Also , there were two double-bedded rooms , -- " such as they were , " the landlord said .
1	'An hour this side of midnight , ' said <NAME> , raising the blind to look out and returning to his seat .
1	I took that opportunity , with my voice sticking in my throat , and my sight failing as I uttered the words , to express my hope that <NAME> was quite well ; to which <NAME> replied , with no more emotion than if he had been speaking of an ordinary human being , that he was much obliged to me , and she was very well .
1	' I have the satisfaction to know you are , sir , ' said <NAME> .
1	I must wait a little longer. " Then , when baby was expected , he says , " She is such a cheerful , glorious housewife that I can ' t afford to be rich yet .
1	He comes down , he goes to <NAME> , he relates what we have agreed upon , and he states our case better than we could .
1	' Will you therefore be so good as to give me the address of <NAME> ? ' ' Dear , dear , dear ! ' said the Patriarch , ' how very unfortunate !
1	He left his brother to be happy .
1	But , in our youthful ecstasy , I don ' t think that we really looked before us or behind us ; or had any aspiration beyond the ignorant present .
1	He finished by freezing a cup of tea for his own drinking , and retiring at his lowest temperature .
1	The hideous small boy , on the contrary , whenever he hits <NAME> , blows a whistle of triumph through a jagged gap , convenient for the purpose , in the front of his mouth , where half his teeth are wanting ; and whenever he misses him , yelps out ' Mulled agin ! ' and tries to atone for the failure by taking a more correct and vicious aim .
1	<NAME> has gone to the doctor 's to get a bottle of stuff for a sick woman but will be here anon .
1	I wish she had me to deal with ! ' said <NAME> , reddening with the energy of the wish .
1	I held him back with both arms ; and implored the men with whom I had been speaking , not to listen to him , not to do murder , not to let him stir from off that sand !
1	' May I -- <NAME> , I but ask the question humbly -- may I say it ?
1	And yet there is not in <NAME> , with its rich variety of soil and climate , a blade , a leaf , a root , a sprig , a peppercorn , which will grow to maturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror .
1	<NAME> and his mother knows where to find it , and we find it sitiwated correct. ' With this mysterious speech , Mr Chivery took his ear away and shut the door .
1	At any rate , I made up my mind to be so dreadfully industrious that I would leave myself not a moment 's leisure to be low-spirited .
1	Everybody knows how like the street the two dinner-rows of people who take their stand by the street will be .
1	" And you have reared the boy , with the intention of taking him for your apprentice ; is that so , <NAME> ? " " You know , <NAME> , " replied <NAME> , " as you and me were ever friends , and it were looked for'ard to betwixt us , as being calc'lated to lead to larks .
1	" This is a very sensible woman , " said my guardian .
1	How do you find yourself , sir ? ' In acknowledgement of this question , addressed to him with extraordinary curtness , <NAME> , uncomfortably clutching the blue bag he carried , replied that he was pretty well , he thanked my aunt , and hoped she was the same .
1	And now <NAME> looked on more attentively than ever , when the master of the house , having his daughter leaning fondly on him , sat down with her and her mother at his own fireside ; and when he thought that such another creature , quite as graceful and as full of promise , might have called him father , and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his life , his sight grew very dim indeed .
1	' I hope I am also , ' rejoined the other .
1	What is it , <NAME> ? " " <NAME> , " said I , taking hold of his rolled-up shirt sleeve , and twisting it between my finger and thumb , " you remember all that about <NAME> 's ? " " Remember ? " said <NAME> .
1	I ha ' gone t ' th ' brigg , minded to fling myseln ower , and ha ' no more on ' t .
1	said <NAME> , improving the accident .
1	To <NAME> Noggs he forwarded one half of the sum he had realised , entreating him to take an opportunity of handing it to <NAME> in secret , and conveying to her the warmest assurances of his love and affection .
1	I was so conscious of having passed through scenes of which they could have no knowledge , and of having acquired experiences foreign to my age , appearance , and condition as one of them , that I half believed it was an imposture to come there as an ordinary little schoolboy .
1	First of all , she would bring out the immense account-book , and lay it down upon the table , with a deep sigh .
1	How long did you stay there ? ' ' About ten minutes ; I should say not more .
1	What other reason could Miss Tox have for connecting Mr Dombey with her summer days and dandelion fetters ?
1	Her name is beautiful too , ' said <NAME> , shaking her head with energy , and arranging herself in her chair ; ' <NAME> is at once uncommon , as it strikes me , and distinguished .
1	There ' s no love lost between us , I assure you , ' said <NAME> , tying her bonnet strings with a jerk .
1	Mr Clennam , I am surprised that a gentleman who is capable of having a heart of his own , should be capable of the heartlessness of treating mine in that way .
1	' Well , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
1	Come here , <NAME> and Poddles. ' <NAME> was the pet-name of the boy ; <NAME> of the girl .
1	The manner in which he struggled through these inarticulate sentences , and , whenever he found himself getting near the name of <NAME> , fought his way on to it , dashed at it in a fainting state , and brought it out with a vehemence little less than marvellous , was frightful ; but now , when he sank into a chair , steaming , and looked at us , with every possible colour in his face that had no business there , and an endless procession of lumps following one another in hot haste up his throat , whence they seemed to shoot into his forehead , he had the appearance of being in the last extremity .
1	He took very little supper , but was a long time over it , and often reverted to his brother ' s declining state .
1	I took the opportunity of moving well behind my table .
1	' Do you know me now , man ? ' The landlord scratched his head , looked at the ceiling , and at the stranger , and smiled feebly .
1	They renewed their charitable efforts , and he beat them off .
1	Oh , what a misfortune is mine , ' cried <NAME> , breaking off to wipe the starting perspiration from his face as he shook from head to foot , ' that I can not so control myself as to appear a stronger creature than this , when a man who has not felt in all his life what I have felt in a day can so command himself ! ' He said it in a very agony , and even followed it with an errant motion of his hands as if he could have torn himself .
1	It is small , of course ; and the door being not solid , but grated , and without blind or curtain , the prisoner within is at all times exposed to the observation and inspection of any guard who may pass along that tier at any hour or minute of the night .
1	<NAME> ! ' These expressions , delivered in a most boisterous tone , and accompanied with loud peals of laughter , roused <NAME> from one of those sound slumbers which , lasting in reality some half-hour , seem to the sleeper to have been protracted for three weeks or a month .
1	The <NAME> , and the <NAME> LVII .
1	Now , young man , you just have the kindness to take yourself off to the schoolroom , and take the boys off with you , and don ' t you stir out of there till you have leave given you , or you and I may fall out in a way that ' ll spoil your beauty , handsome as you think yourself , and so I tell you. ' ' Indeed ! ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> to the <NAME> , my dear ma ' am , if you don ' t believe me .
1	' Are you not coming , <NAME> ? ' ' <NAME> , I will remain here .
1	At first , he was pleased with the discovery : hoping that it might be the forerunner of his release ; but such thoughts were quickly dispelled , on his sitting down to breakfast along with the Jew , who told him , in a tone and manner which increased his alarm , that he was to be taken to the residence of <NAME> that night .
1	I understand there were some of our very best men among ' em .
1	My sister went for the stone bottle , came back with the stone bottle , and poured his brandy out : no one else taking any .
1	' Bof -- fin ! ' ' Yes , <NAME> , ' he answered , coming out of a fit of abstraction , with a sigh .
1	This nerved me to get rid of <NAME> , who went so mildly , on receipt of wages , that I was surprised , until I found out about the tea-spoons , and also about the little sums she had borrowed in my name of the tradespeople without authority .
1	They threw themselves into committees in the most impassioned manner and collected subscriptions with a vehemence quite extraordinary .
1	The engaging frankness with which he made this declaration really had a disinterested appearance and captivated my guardian , if not , for the moment , <NAME> too .
1	<NAME> ever stopped him in the street to say , with gladsome looks , " My dear Scrooge , how are you ?
1	'So it is , ' acquiesced the undertaker .
1	Not a word was spoken when we first went in ; and the <NAME> clock by the dresser seemed , in the silence , to tick twice as loud as usual .
1	Does she go out to shun her <NAME> , <NAME> ? ' ' La bless you , no , <NAME> ' am .
1	" Why , look at you all ! " bawled this figure , addressing the inn servants .
1	Even when we 've good cards , <NAME> and I ca n't make nothing of 'em . '
1	" What could you have on your mind , you know !
1	' The message relates to family matters , ' said <NAME> , hesitating .
1	At parting , my aunt gave me some good advice , and a good many kisses ; and said that as her object was that I should look about me , and should think a little , she would recommend me to stay a few days in <NAME> , if I liked it , either on my way down into <NAME> , or in coming back .
1	cried the office keeper , running out .
1	' <NAME> , ' said he , using that familiar address for the first time in their communication , ' do you remember my telling you , as we walked up and down one hot morning , looking over the harbour at <NAME> , that <NAME> ' s baby sister who was dead seemed to <NAME> and me to have grown as she had grown , and changed as she had changed ? ' ' Very well. ' ' You remember my saying that our thoughts had never been able to separate those twin sisters , and that , in our fancy , whatever <NAME> was , the other was ? ' ' Yes , very well. ' ' Arthur , ' said Mr Meagles , much subdued , ' I carry that fancy further to-night .
1	' <NAME> , not that , ever ! ' More surprised than before , and a little more frightened , she looked to him for an explanation of his last words .
1	' <NAME> , who can help seeing the way to do it ? -- you astonish me !
1	Following the current with her eyes , she saw a bloody face turned up towards the moon , and drifting away .
1	This is a <NAME> boot , eh ? ' ' That , sir , ' I replied , ' is a <NAME> boot. ' He mused over it again , after the manner of <NAME> with <NAME> ' s skull ; nodded his head , as who should say , ' I pity the Institutions that led to the production of this boot ! ' ; rose ; put up his pencil , notes , and paper—glancing at himself in the glass , all the time—put on his hat—drew on his gloves very slowly ; and finally walked out .
1	Pick me up ; I want to hear better .
1	I had on ' y to think as she was found , and it was gone .
1	' There , Mr Blandois ! ' said <NAME> , showing it , ' I hope you may think that worth coming so high to see .
1	And finished his breakfast as if the flavour of the <NAME> , and also of the ham and toast and eggs , were a little on the wane .
1	One timid look around -- one moment 's pause of hesitation -- he had closed it behind him , and was in the open street .
1	There was one point which Mr <NAME> deemed it unnecessary to enlarge upon , and that was the fact of the modest quencher , which , by reason of its intrinsic strength and its coming close upon the heels of the temperate beverage he had discussed at dinner , awakened a slight degree of fever , and rendered necessary two or three other modest quenchers at the public-house in the course of the evening .
1	' There is no longer any occasion for uneasiness , ma ' am .
1	Make up the fires , and buy another coal-scuttle before you dot another i , <NAME> ! "
1	Every word. " <NAME> bent forward to look at me more nearly , as if my reply had been rather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for .
1	The <NAME> resented her claiming to know people of such distinction .
1	<NAME> Dibabs -- the <NAME> lived in the beautiful little thatched white house one story high , covered all over with ivy and creeping plants , with an exquisite little porch with twining honysuckles and all sorts of things : where the earwigs used to fall into one ' s tea on a summer evening , and always fell upon their backs and kicked dreadfully , and where the frogs used to get into the rushlight shades when one stopped all night , and sit up and look through the little holes like Christians -- <NAME> , <NAME> married a man who was a great deal older than herself , and <NAME> marry him , notwithstanding all that could be said to the contrary , and she was so fond of him that nothing was ever equal to it .
1	I can not separate and define the feelings that arose in me after this ; it is enough that the vague duty and obligation I had felt upon me from the first of following the investigation was , without my distinctly daring to ask myself any question , increased , and that I was indignantly sure of there being no possibility of a reason for my being afraid .
1	She had never breathed her dread of him to any one but <NAME> .
1	' My dear child , ' he said , as he spread it on another piece of paper before her , ' the idea of a splendid -- ! ' and then looked at her figure , and stopped short .
1	As soon as he arrived in <NAME> he would present himself to this old friend , but he must say nothing of his intention now .
1	At the upper end of the room , were a couple of boys , one of them very tall and the other very short , both dressed as sailors -- or at least as theatrical sailors , with belts , buckles , pigtails , and pistols complete -- fighting what is called in play-bills a terrific combat , with two of those short broad-swords with basket hilts which are commonly used at our minor theatres .
1	They are both tarred with a dirty brush , and I can ' t have the <NAME> tarred with the same brush .
1	And the <NAME> was above all !
1	<NAME> said the <NAME> had a secret ?
1	<NAME> , whose top waistcoat-button might have been somewhere on a level with the crown of <NAME> 's head , rubbed his eyes with the inside of his wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him , and performed some affecting tears and sniffs .
1	' <NAME> , sir , by a cask of sugar. ' ' He is a good creature , ' said <NAME> , with great earnestness .
1	But if he had looked at me for an hour or for a day , I could not have remembered his face ever afterwards , as having been more attentive .
1	He shrunk , as if to let the thing go by .
1	No. ' ' Might I ask , without seeming impertinent , whether you have any intention of selling it ? ' ' Certainly not .
1	He looked at the two , less and less attentively , and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground and looked about him in the old way .
1	' You mean Mrs. Nickleby ? ' said <NAME> .
1	Oh , I assure you he is very odd ! "
1	You pusillanimous , abject , cringing dogs !
1	It ' s in the lining of the mattress , <NAME> .
1	On Monday next , on the arrival of the four o ' clock afternoon coach at <NAME> , my foot will be on my native heath -- my name , <NAME> ! ' <NAME> resumed his seat on the close of these remarks , and drank two glasses of punch in grave succession .
1	Whereas them medical doctors ' wives do n't flop -- catch 'em at it !
1	<NAME> compassion , such gentleness , as that with which she bent down weeping and put her hand upon the mother 's might have softened any mother 's heart that ever beat .
1	Do n't break cover too soon .
1	After a few words of course , they sallied into the street .
1	So immensely absurd ! ' It fell to his lot , now , to stipulate for secrecy .
1	The female servants and female visitors were running constantly to and fro ; and there were such multitudinous demands for hot water , such repeated outcries for needles and thread , and so many half-suppressed entreaties of ' Oh , do come and tie me , there ' s a dear ! ' that <NAME> in his innocence began to imagine that something dreadful must have occurred -- when he grew more awake , and remembered the wedding .
1	' Things can not too soon be put upon the footing , ' said she , with a candour so demonstrative as to be almost obtrusive , ' that the person of the ' ouse is not a box nor yet a bundle , nor a carpet-bag .
1	Very rarely tells him anything more explicit .
1	Then , you were to pay up your subscription , get your card of membership and your riband and medal , and were evermore to live upon a platform , and evermore to say what <NAME> said , and what the <NAME> said , and what the sub-Treasurer said , and what the <NAME> said , and what the sub-Committee said , and what the Secretary said , and what the Vice-Secretary said .
1	" You seek to close these places on the <NAME> Day ? "
1	' He ' ll be doing something desperate ; he ' ll murder somebody .
1	The world was very busy now , in sooth , and had a deal to say .
1	I told her , too , how people in such voyages were sometimes wrecked and cast on rocks , where they were saved by the intrepidity and humanity of one man .
1	But on other moonlight nights , when the sadness and the silence have touched me in a different way -- have affected me with something as like a sorrowful sense of peace , as any emotion that had pain for its foundations could -- I have imagined her as coming to me in my cell , and leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress .
1	He had the special peculiarity of some birds of prey , that when he knitted his brow , his ruffled crest stood highest .
1	Do not tell me that you wish I had lost this ; for it has softened my heart to all mankind . '
1	'No , no , ' rejoined <NAME> , finding his voice .
1	' How many children are there , and what has my brother Ned given , <NAME> ? ' ' There are six children , ' replied the gentleman , ' and your brother has given us twenty pounds. ' ' My brother <NAME> is a good fellow , and you ' re a good fellow too , <NAME> , ' said the old man , shaking him by both hands with trembling eagerness .
1	Thus for ten days <NAME> bent over his pillow , laying her cheek against his .
1	Fragments of old wall , saint ' s chapel , chapter-house , convent and monastery , have got incongruously or obstructively built into many of its houses and gardens , much as kindred jumbled notions have become incorporated into many of its citizens ' minds .
1	Upon the next day , therefore , Mr Toots , putting into requisition some of the greatest marvels that <NAME> and Co. had ever turned out , went off to Mr <NAME> ' s upon this design .
1	Now I know he knows where she is gone. ' ' Can not undertake to say , sir , I am sure ! ' <NAME> again rejoined .
1	Do you see those grovelling and wandering eyes ?
1	That his papers were in arrear , and that he stood in need of assistance to develop the capacity of his business , was clear enough ; but all the results of his undertakings during many years were distinctly set forth , and were ascertainable with ease .
1	But perhaps my brother ' s penetration may enable him to have some insight into his character .
1	It rather put me out at first this morning to see you and <NAME> looking so neat and pretty and to feel ashamed of <NAME> and myself too , but on the whole I hope I am better-tempered than I was and more forgiving to <NAME> . "
1	He frequently glanced at his face as if there were something in it that gave him pain , and more than once he looked towards me as though he sought to ascertain whether I knew what the truth was .
1	'What is the name to me ? '
1	' Think of me. ' ' Tell me how <NAME> to think of you , <NAME> , and you ' ll change me altogether. ' ' I don ' t mean in that way .
1	" In their presence , " pursued <NAME> , " I will tell you , young man , what to say to <NAME> .
1	' Under such circumstances , what could a man of <NAME> ' s spirit do ?
1	We must not let you pass out of our knowledge .
1	<NAME> was in the garden in the centre and hurried out as soon as I appeared .
1	<NAME> , ' said <NAME> ; ' my friend , <NAME> , <NAME> , M.C .
1	From that time , the old man never , for a moment , forgot the weakness and devotion of the child ; from the time of that slight incident , he who had seen her toiling by his side through so much difficulty and suffering , and had scarcely thought of her otherwise than as the partner of miseries which he felt severely in his own person , and deplored for his own sake at least as much as hers , awoke to a sense of what he owed her , and what those miseries had made her .
1	The dream will have come again .
1	His mental sufferings are so great that he entertains wandering ideas of delivering himself up to justice and requiring to be cleared if innocent and punished with the utmost rigour of the law if guilty .
1	' Get down to life ! ' Mr Fledgeby seemed to think it rather a good suggestion , and with a nod turned round .
1	There was no doing it in the night , for there was no getting a light by easy friction then ; to have got one I must have struck it out of flint and steel , and have made a noise like the very pirate himself rattling his chains .
1	In this complicated dilemma , Mr Veneering approaches the large man with extended hand and , smilingly assures that incorrigible personage that he is delighted to see him : who in his fatal freshness instantly replies : ' Thank you .
1	Who , standing in the portal , received them with ghostly gloom , and all her other appliances of ceremony .
1	When the Major was too hoarse with meat and drink , and the display of his social powers , to render himself intelligible any longer , they adjourned to coffee .
1	The same pious care which enriched the abbey of St Mary , and left us , orphans , to its holy guardianship , directed that no constraint should be imposed upon our inclinations , but that we should be free to live according to our choice .
1	' You have a son , I believe ? ' said Mr Dombey .
1	I ' m a poor scholar , but I shall write to you , odd times , when you ' re away , and send my letters to <NAME> ' r <NAME> .
1	But the <NAME> forbid that I should repine under any visitation .
1	' What ' s the t ' other name ? ' said <NAME> , looking round .
1	It was so like handing green meat into the cage of a dull imprisoned bird , and <NAME> had so evidently brought the little basket as a handful of fresh relief from the stale hot paving-stones and bricks of the jail , that <NAME> said , with a smile , ' It was very kind of you to think of putting this between the wires ; but I can not even get this down to-day. ' As if the difficulty were contagious , <NAME> soon pushed away his own plate , and fell to folding the cabbage-leaf that had contained the ham .
1	But Mr Carker -- ' ' Hush ! ' said <NAME> , glancing cautiously up at the packer ' s , and at the bottle-maker ' s , as if , from any one of the tiers of warehouses , Mr Carker might be looking down .
1	" Now , do n't open your mouth too wide , because you do n't look handsome when you do it . "
1	With these materials and the aid of the kettle , he filled a tumbler with a hot and odorous mixture , measured out and compounded with as much nicety as a physician ' s prescription .
1	Blind leaders of the blind !
1	' Out of the question to marry her , ' said <NAME> , ' and out of the question to leave her .
1	I loved that stupid mite in a passionate way that she could no more deserve than I can remember without feeling ashamed of , though I was but a child .
1	The room was lighted as of yore , and at the sound of our entrance , she stopped and turned .
1	When we got into the street ( which was strange enough to me ) and smelt the fish , and pitch , and oakum , and tar , and saw the sailors walking about , and the carts jingling up and down over the stones , I felt that I had done so busy a place an injustice ; and said as much to <NAME> , who heard my expressions of delight with great complacency , and told me it was well known ( I suppose to those who had the good fortune to be born <NAME> ) that <NAME> was , upon the whole , the finest place in the universe .
1	This artificial respiration ceasing , do I feel any faint flutter under my hand upon the chest ?
1	Get behind the door , old chap , and have the jack-towel betwixt you. " I took the advice .
1	inquired the doctor ; who had returned to the room shortly after the commencement of the story .
1	And she evidently thought so , for she wept most grievously .
1	<NAME> shrugged his shoulders again , as if it were no great feat to amaze <NAME> , and cast a wistful glance at the face of <NAME> , which had several times appeared behind a couple of panes of glass in the room door ; it being a part of <NAME> ' s duty , when unimportant people called , to make various feints of supposing that the bell had rung for him to show them out : by way of a gentle hint to such visitors that it was time to go .
1	The <NAME> ' s breath came short and thick with consternation .
1	The first sitting was limited .
1	She sends you her regard .
1	My dear good man , in this world none of us can have _everything_ our own way. ' This again went to the former point , and showed Mr Meagles with all good breeding that , so far , he had been brilliantly successful in his deep designs .
1	and away with me ! ' ' To-night ? ' murmured the old man .
1	' You are not going , papa ? ' said <NAME> , anxiously .
1	Then , maybe , <NAME> ' r <NAME> , seein ' none but <NAME> there , she might take heart to creep in , trembling ; and might come to be laid down in her old bed , and rest her weary head where it was once so gay. ' I could not speak to him in reply , though I tried .
1	' I fear there is something more , ' stammered <NAME> with a half-smile , and looking towards <NAME> , ' it is a most awkward thing to say -- but -- the very mention of such a supposition makes one look like a puppy -- still -- may I ask if that lady supposes that I entertain any -- in short , does she think that I am in love with her ? ' ' <NAME> embarrassment , ' thought <NAME> , ' I have brought him to it , at last .
1	' I think you will , ' said Mrs. Mann , who had noticed the tone of the refusal , and the gesture that had accompanied it .
1	If they disclosed to me , as I suspect they did , that I should not come back , and that <NAME> was quite right , all I can say is , -- they were quite right too .
1	She falters , trembles , and puts her hand confusedly to her head .
1	' Do you know , young man , ' whispered <NAME> , drawing his chair closer to <NAME> , ' whether she has left <NAME> anything ? ' ' Who ' s he ? ' inquired Sam .
1	The <NAME> trembled to think that <NAME> was not to be got rid of , and had been brought back in a coach .
1	Beyond town , we found a heavy mist out , and it fell wet and thick .
1	Mrs <NAME> ' s niece , <NAME> , took cold pork .
1	<NAME> <NAME> walked in the middle of the road , shouldering the natives out of his way , and loudly developing a scheme he had , for making a raid on all the unemployed persons in the <NAME> , laying them every one by the heels in jail , and forcing them , on pain of prompt extermination , to become philanthropists .
1	We have nothing more to say , and may break up our pleasant party . '
1	My mother dropped her work , and arose hurriedly , but timidly I thought .
1	' I 'm <NAME> , ' said the charity-boy , 'and you 're under me .
1	<NAME> , hope , and charity , shared his whole nature among them .
1	Take a chair , <NAME> Weller. ' <NAME> took a chair , and <NAME> took a box , and the umpires took what they could get , and looked at the almanac and one or two papers which were wafered against the wall , with as much open-eyed reverence as if they had been the finest efforts of the old masters .
1	His patronage did not stop here ; for he charged <NAME> to get the tea ready , and instructed her to buy certain tea-cakes , fresh butter , eggs , cold ham , and shrimps : to purchase which collation he gave her a bank-note for ten pounds , laying strict injunctions on her to be careful of the change .
1	" By all means , <NAME> . "
1	If you were not an ornament to <NAME> , and if I was not a benefactor to <NAME> , you and I would never have come together .
1	' The monk turned to the second sister .
1	<NAME> , meagre , ragged , scowling , wolfish ; but prostrate , too , in their humility .
1	You can ' t hold me. ' ' Tell me in a word , <NAME> ! ' His eyes were fixed again , and the only word that came from his lips was the word millions of times repeated .
1	' What DID you do here when you were here before ? ' asked <NAME> .
1	Have you lately come to settle in this neighbourhood , or do you own to another neighbourhood ?
1	There 's father coming , " cried the two young Cratchits , who were everywhere at once .
1	As fast asleep as she is now , I hope ! "
1	I wrote to <NAME> as soon as <NAME> and I were engaged .
1	You here again ? " said <NAME> .
1	I am rational again now , and you shall advise me .
1	My trade is not of that kind that I need be roused from bed .
1	<NAME> was thus left at leisure to entertain himself with his own thoughts , until they arrived at the drawbridge at <NAME> , when <NAME> pulled up .
1	But they said , wait a few days more ; and then , wait a few days more ; and still she neither ran nor walked .
1	<NAME> , my boy , <NAME> , my dear , what have you been doing ?
1	You have no right to do it ; I ' m sure we never interfered with you .
1	The impending shadow of a great affliction , and a great disgrace that had no distinct form in it yet , fell like a stain upon the quiet place where I had worked and played as a boy , and did it a cruel wrong .
1	Mr Dolls now struck out the highly unexpected discovery that he had been insulted by <NAME> , and stated his desire to ' have it out with him ' on the spot , and defied him to come on , upon the liberal terms of a sovereign to a halfpenny .
1	' I don ' t deny , ' added <NAME> , ' that my schooling was cheap .
1	' You are a young man , ' she said , nodding .
1	' My dear , ' said <NAME> , ' I ' m very sorry .
1	Here , <NAME> had taken unto himself the best table , and had got all the leaves up , and was holding a kind of black <NAME> , with the aid of a quantity of black pins .
1	<NAME> , the world is before you ; and it is most probable that as you enter it , so it will receive you .
1	' Very good ; don ' t forget the bread and butter presently. ' At this fresh mention of the bread and butter , the five little boys looked very eager , and followed the waiter out , with their eyes ; meanwhile <NAME> tasted the milk and water .
1	We may have detained her longer than she expected already . '
1	Their owners had evidently come to that spot to make some needful repairs in the stage arrangements , for one of them was engaged in binding together a small gallows with thread , while the other was intent upon fixing a new black wig , with the aid of a small hammer and some tacks , upon the head of the radical neighbour , who had been beaten bald .
1	And I remember you said that night , sitting there as I sat here -- said that night when your peace of mind was first laid low , that you had taken an interest in these very affairs .
1	The completeness of his sympathy with her fancy for having a little <NAME> to protect and rear , he had shown in every act and word , and now that the kind fancy was disappointed , he treated it with a manly tenderness and respect for which she could hardly thank him enough .
1	You spoke of my sister ' s tears .
1	there ' s no accounting for tastes ; ' but the ladies resolved unanimously that <NAME> had an aristocratic air ; and nobody caring to dispute the position , it was established triumphantly .
1	Do you know it , or do you not , <NAME> ? ' says the Major , almost in a passion .
1	Her nerves is so very delicate , you see , and soon unstrung .
1	<NAME> ' t I seen you before ? ' ' Once before -- if you had your eyesight , ' replied <NAME> ; the conditional clause in an under-tone .
1	You wish me to speak to her , and tell her so , and entreat her to be your wife .
1	I don ' t pretend to stand between your mother and you. ' ' Will you tell her that I have come home ? ' ' Yes , <NAME> , yes .
1	Because , as I say , it is not good for man to be alone. ' <NAME> appears to commit this original idea to memory .
1	' I have discovered my friend <NAME> , ' said <NAME> genteelly , and without addressing himself particularly to anyone , ' not in solitude , but partaking of a social meal in company with a widow lady , and one who is apparently her offspring -- in short , ' said <NAME> , in another of his bursts of confidence , ' her son .
1	" What floor do you want ? " " The top .
1	This gentleman , becoming transfixed at the same moment as his lady-mother , could not by any means unfix himself again , but stood stiffly staring at the whole composition with <NAME> in the <NAME> .
1	Seeing the faint light of early day without , the girl rose to undraw the curtain .
1	Perhaps , see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar , bearing down upon them , too .
1	As they come through the dismal passages , some officers of the jail who are in waiting there , congratulate him , in their rough way , on his release .
1	It was momentary , but the daughter , with a slight look of intelligence , withdrew her eyes from the boy ' s face , and sat folded in her cloak as before .
1	My little portmanteau was in the boot under my feet ; I had but to turn a hinge to get it out ; I threw it down before me , got down after it , and was left at the first lamp on the first stones of the town pavement .
1	' I was thinking of the other proverbial church person -- Job , ' said <NAME> .
1	Probably it is through Provis that you have received the explanation of <NAME> -- in <NAME> ? " " It came through <NAME> , " I replied .
1	So there only remained <NAME> and <NAME> , who were both sobbing heartily ; the two brothers ; and <NAME> , who now came in to shake hands with everybody : his round face all radiant and beaming with smiles .
1	'It is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other boys , ' said the young lady , smiling .
1	for Pocket-Breaches , who instantly begins to find out that the Lammles are the only people ever entered on his soul ' s register , who are NOT the oldest and dearest friends he has in the world .
1	There was a busy little man beside him , though , who took off his hat at intervals and motioned to the people to cheer , which they regularly did , most enthusiastically ; and as the red-faced gentleman went on talking till he was redder in the face than ever , it seemed to answer his purpose quite as well as if anybody had heard him .
1	The yard was so dark that even <NAME> , who knew its every stone , was fain to grope with his hands .
1	' If oaths , or prayers , or words , could rid me of you , they should .
1	<NAME> do not be uneasy when I tell you , but it was not quite so airy , nor so bright , nor so cheerful , nor so happy and youthful altogether as I should have liked it to be .
1	' It is refreshing to know that you hold my excellent friend , <NAME> , in such high esteem .
1	So now they has two ropes , ' bout six foot apart , and three from the floor , which goes right down the room ; and the beds are made of slips of coarse sacking , stretched across ' em. ' ' Well , ' said <NAME> .
1	After waiting for a moment to receive some assurance to the contrary , and not receiving any , <NAME> proceeds , " If it had been <NAME> and <NAME> , I should have gone at once to your ladyship 's solicitor , <NAME> , of the <NAME> .
1	'Oh no , I wo n't hurt him , ' replied the officer , tearing his jacket half off his back , in proof thereof .
1	She and his father had been at variance from his earliest remembrance .
1	It is considered not unlikely that he will get up an imitation of the coroner and make it the principal feature of the <NAME> in the evening .
1	<NAME> , they come at last into the hall , where a lamp is burning , and so into <NAME> 's usual room -- the room where he drank his old wine to-night .
1	YOU understand what sweating a pound means , don ' t you ? ' ' Much as you do , sir , ' returned the old man , with his hands under opposite cuffs of his loose sleeves , as he stood at the table , deferentially observant of the master ' s face .
1	And I am -- quite sure ! ' She might rely upon it , said <NAME> .
1	If _I_ can put that aside , if _I_ can eradicate the marks of what I have endured , and can emerge before the world -- a -- ha -- gentleman unspoiled , unspotted -- is it a great deal to expect -- I say again , is it a great deal to expect -- that my children should -- hum -- do the same and sweep that accursed experience off the face of the earth ? ' In spite of his flustered state , he made all these exclamations in a carefully suppressed voice , lest the valet should overhear anything .
1	She , too , was turning homeward , when she heard a strange sound .
1	' You would not give her pain ? ' ' I am not so sure of that , if it would only rouse her .
1	At it again ? " His wife explained that she had merely " asked a blessing. " " Do n't do it ! " said <NAME> looking about , as if he rather expected to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife 's petitions .
1	' What did you think of that ? ' asked <NAME> , when <NAME> went round to the stage again .
1	' They were all fine babies , ' said <NAME> .
1	' How do we know whom he is deceiving there ?
1	I asked him afterwards , why he had done so , and he made a plausible excuse ; but since last night , father , and when I remember the circumstances by its light , I am afraid I can imagine too truly what passed between them. ' ' Let me know , ' said her father , ' if your thoughts present your guilty brother in the same dark view as mine. ' ' I fear , father , ' hesitated <NAME> , ' that he must have made some representation to <NAME> Blackpool—perhaps in my name , perhaps in his own—which induced him to do in good faith and honesty , what he had never done before , and to wait about the <NAME> those two or three nights before he left the town. ' ' Too plain ! ' returned the father .
1	' Go on , <NAME> ; do go on .
1	We made the round of the principal theatres , too , with great delight , and saw all the plays that were worth seeing .
1	You needn ' t direct your glances towards me , ' said Mrs. Wititterly , with a sudden burst of spite ; ' I am not <NAME> , no , nor <NAME> , <NAME> , nor am I <NAME> , nor <NAME> either. ' <NAME> looked at her again , but less steadily than before ; and resting her elbow on the table , covered her eyes with her hand .
1	To the <NAME> Road we went and there inquired at Mrs. <NAME> 's residence for Mrs. Guppy .
1	As he turned the key in the lock , he surveyed me with some astonishment which was not diminished when he looked from me to my companion .
1	I had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was all my fault , and that if I had been easier with <NAME> , <NAME> would have been easier with me .
1	On the day following , <NAME> and <NAME> repaired to the market-town , in the hope of seeing or hearing something of the men there ; but this effort was equally fruitless .
1	' And yet I have some respect here .
1	Keeping his eye fixed on <NAME> , he walked up to the table , and beginning with his glass , drank off the contents , and went regularly round until he had emptied the other two , when he seized the case-bottle , and hugging it under his arm , surveyed him with a most extraordinary leer .
1	' I shouldn ' t so much mind being a carpenter , <NAME> Merdle. ' ' And my complaint is , ' pursued the lady , disregarding the low remark , ' that it is not the tone of <NAME> , and that you ought to correct it , Mr Merdle .
1	We went out to the door ; and there was my mother , looking unusually pretty , I thought , and with her a gentleman with beautiful black hair and whiskers , who had walked home with us from church last Sunday .
1	I happened to arrive at the first factory just as the dinner hour was over , and the girls were returning to their work ; indeed the stairs of the mill were thronged with them as I ascended .
1	Neither did it revive for more than a few moments when she once or twice afterwards glanced at <NAME> or at me through her glass .
1	For it 's quite impossible that I can put my papers away . "
1	To see the great wheels slowly turning , and to think of being run down and crushed !
1	He may think of her constantly , or he may never think about her .
1	' The opinion of those other branches of my family , ' pursued Mrs. Micawber , ' is , that <NAME> should immediately turn his attention to coals. ' ' To what , ma ' am ? ' ' To coals , ' said Mrs. Micawber .
1	It was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him , or try to restore him , that -- as if by agreement -- they each put a hand upon his shoulder , and soothed him to sit down before the fire , with a promise that he should have his work presently .
1	' So you said just now , my dear , ' replied <NAME> .
1	' She is pale though , and looks much exhausted .
1	He was angry only one night , and that was not to me , but <NAME> .
1	' Oh , yes , he is here , and I grieve to say , <NAME> , he is going on worse than ever. ' ' Ah , ah ! ' said <NAME> .
1	On hearing this most unexpected sound , <NAME> looked , first incredulous , and afterwards amazed .
1	Mrs <NAME> took the opportunity of his being so engaged , to get a better observation of his face than she had yet taken .
1	Are you going to return there ? "
1	During our long absence , it has suffered much from internal dissentions ; and the withdrawal of my name , coupled with this and other circumstances , has occasioned its dissolution .
1	how devoutly he wished he could !
1	He closed his book hastily ; and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the renowned <NAME> .
1	' I ' ll tell ' ee more ; hear this , too .
1	I have found my son -- my youngest , who went away for a soldier so long ago .
1	Both have come upon me by surprise. ' ' But , <NAME> ' otherest Governor , ' urged Mr Riderhood , ' I don ' t know where to find you. ' ' It is of no consequence .
1	Somewhere must be thought of .
1	' ' <NAME> won something she didn ' t expect , I think , haven ' t you , dear ? ' said <NAME> , maliciously .
1	' Not at your peril ? ' ' No , <NAME> , ' said Mr Boffin , shaking his head good-humouredly .
1	If <NAME> and I were to go to some country lodging as soon as I can move , and if I had a week there in which to grow stronger and to be revived by the sweet air and to look forward to the happiness of having <NAME> with me again , I think it would be better for us . "
1	When he called his mother names , because she wouldn ' t give up the young lady ' s property , and she relenting , caused him to relent likewise , and fall down on one knee and ask her blessing , how the ladies in the audience sobbed !
1	" Now , follow that passage with your eye , and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was instructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence ?
1	You can not think what a sad change has fallen on us since. ' ' I am very , very sorry , to hear you speak like this , my dear ! ' said <NAME> .
1	They asked me a good many questions ; as , what my name was , how old I was , where I lived , how I was employed , and how I came there .
1	It would lie in this attitude all day , with its bright specks of eyes open , wondering ( as I used to imagine ) how it came to be so small and weak .
1	Through the heart of the town a deadly sewer ebbed and flowed , in the place of a fine fresh river .
1	While they were on the way back , Mr <NAME> , upon whom his present functions sat very irksomely , took an opportunity of whispering in his ear that if he would confess his guilt , even by so much as a nod , and promise not to do so any more , he would connive at his kicking <NAME> on the shins and escaping up a court ; but <NAME> indignantly rejecting this proposal , Mr <NAME> had nothing for it , but to hold him tight until they reached <NAME> , and ushered him into the presence of the charming <NAME> , who immediately took the precaution of locking the door .
1	May I be permitted to inquire , if you are charged to convey that information to me in those hopeless words , by the lady of whom we speak ? ' ' I have no charge from her. ' ' The drowning man catches at the straw .
1	' You are unusually mysterious tonight. ' ' Cold , perhaps , ' returned <NAME> ; ' cold , perhaps .
1	If I got a little pair of shoes by any chance , she would take ' em off and sell ' em for drink .
1	He sat in his usual place and attitude like a great stuffed figure .
1	" Pretty well , grandmother , I think . "
1	Among other havens of domestic tranquillity and peace of mind , my feet will naturally tend towards the King ' s <NAME> .
1	' I should like to sleep on that question to-night , ' he answered doubtfully .
1	It 's well it 's the beer , and not the pot , as hit me , or I 'd have settled somebody .
1	It was his better nature to be true to her , if it were his worse nature to be wholly selfish .
1	Mr Mortimer Lightwood and Mr <NAME> took a coffee-house dinner together in Mr Lightwood ' s office .
1	' Neighbour ! ' said the old man , stopping at the cottage where his young guide ' s mother dwelt , ' how is it that the folks are nearly all in black to-day ?
1	We are going to cross here .
1	' This evil , if evil it be , has been of my own seeking .
1	He took her mantle from the wall , and tenderly wrapped it round her .
1	' We have fallen upon strange times , and <NAME> only knows the end of them ; but I am tired with the events of these three days , and will postpone reflection till tomorrow -- if I can. ' Of the <NAME> for <NAME> , and the first Appearance of <NAME> upon any Stage <NAME> was up betimes in the morning ; but he had scarcely begun to dress , notwithstanding , when he heard footsteps ascending the stairs , and was presently saluted by the voices of <NAME> the pantomimist , and <NAME> , the tragedian .
1	It was spacious , and I dare say had once been handsome , but every discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould , and dropping to pieces .
1	His eyes looked so very sinister , as he put his leg into the room and glanced round at <NAME> , that she thought with a sudden coldness , if he were to go straight up-stairs to murder the invalid , what could she do to prevent him ?
1	And she has acted up to it glorious ! "
1	' He is quite well , <NAME> , thank you , ' said <NAME> .
1	' Ah , my poor head ! ' said Mrs. <NAME> , with a faint smile .
1	They have rumbled through the streets , and jolted over the stones , and at length reach the wide and open country .
1	As the dear old infant would be with us directly , he begged that I would make an appointment for the morning , when he might set himself right through the means of an unreserved conversation with me .
1	Though <NAME> was not at that time aware of it , the class of gentlemen before alluded to , proceed on just the same principle in all their transactions .
1	The spinster aunt was knitting .
1	Find the door where the witnesses go in , and show the door-keeper this note for <NAME> .
1	' But , if I am not sure of myself , I am sure of you , <NAME> , and I know what an upright man you are , and how much to be respected .
1	Oh dear , how very kind of you !
1	Ada being in our room with a cold , <NAME> was left alone all this time and entertained himself by playing snatches of pathetic airs and sometimes singing to them ( as we heard at a distance ) with great expression and feeling .
1	He finished reading it there , with his back towards me , and after he had finished and had folded it up , stood there for some minutes with the letter in his hand .
1	' I am afraid you have been giving her some of your wicked looks , my lord , ' said the intended .
1	Besides these works of art , there were a great many heads of old ladies and gentlemen smirking at each other out of blue and brown skies , and an elegantly written card of terms with an embossed border .
1	<NAME> <NAME> is the type and model of a young drummer .
1	" No , my dear , not ill .
1	We must have <NAME> , you know .
1	The elegant structure in which they are arranged is one of design rather than execution , for there is but one side erected out of four , though the works are stopped .
1	I prefer not to anticipate my communication here ; you will impart as much or as little of it as you please to your friends afterwards ; I have nothing to do with that. " Amidst a wondering silence , we three walked out of the <NAME> , and in a wondering silence walked home .
1	He winked , shook his head , smiled , winked again ; and , with an expression of countenance which seemed to denote that he was greatly amused with something or other , walked merrily away .
1	so very soon ? ' ' I have thought of this for weeks , and why should I postpone it ?
1	" I will not hear you say such shameful words ! "
1	you should have rung the worker ' s bell , ' said the footman , touching the handle of one in the door-post .
1	The greater part of the guests had gone to bed as soon as the eating and drinking were over ; and we , who had remained whispering and listening half-undressed , at last betook ourselves to bed , too .
1	You get husky bread and sour drink by it ; and he gets sausage of <NAME> , veal in savoury jelly , white bread , strachino cheese , and good wine by it .
1	' Get up , pig ! ' growled the first .
1	' I say , ' said the other , looking over the rails , and speaking in a hoarse whisper ; 'what a time this would be for a sell !
1	They are nothing but good to me .
1	" How do you do , sir ?
1	' <NAME> us on what grounds you make this accusation , ' said <NAME> .
1	You have hit the probabilities exactly. ' ' And with regard to your head Governor , ' said the <NAME> , ' why an interview had better come about nat ' ral between us .
1	Why does he move so softly to-night ?
1	Whereas I now found <NAME> to be a disembodied spirit , or a fiction , and his inn the dingiest collection of shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for Tom-cats .
1	In the service I mentally insert <NAME> ' s name -- I put her in among the <NAME> .
1	exclaimed the old lady , starting ; 'do n't talk in that way , child .
1	Do not speak of money at present .
1	' And if it be a necessity— ' <NAME> faltered .
1	<NAME> , <NAME> , admission for admission .
1	This desperate threat effectually broke up the party .
1	Whether he had been attacked and defeated by <NAME> , and was ashamed to show himself after his discomfiture .
1	<NAME> is no object here .
1	He withdraws his hand and falls to looking at the sleet and snow again until they seem , by being long looked at , to fall so thick and fast that he is obliged to close his eyes for a minute on the giddy whirl of white flakes and icy blots .
1	The subject did not admit of a doubt .
1	It was a great jest of his , I recollect , to pretend that he couldn ' t keep his teeth from chattering , whenever mention was made of an Alguazill in connexion with the adventures of <NAME> ; and I remember that when <NAME> met the captain of the robbers in <NAME> , this unlucky joker counterfeited such an ague of terror , that he was overheard by <NAME> , who was prowling about the passage , and handsomely flogged for disorderly conduct in the bedroom .
1	It ' s the only thing in all the world that I am fit for , or that ' s fit for me .
1	' Here you are , ' said <NAME> , ' bonds -- take care of them .
1	It happened that in the street they had several times passed a dingy house , apparently empty , with bills in the windows , announcing that it was to let .
1	The <NAME> , at his best , appeared so poor a substitute for the love and pride of parents .
1	' And I ' ll tell you what , my dear Copperfield , ' said <NAME> , ' your friend <NAME> is a young fellow who might be attorney-general .
1	" Jo , can you say what I say ? "
1	" <NAME> out of this office .
1	The arrival of this unexpected heir soon taking wind in the court still makes good for the <NAME> and keeps the court upon its mettle .
1	C. " ' said the stranger -- ' queer set out -- old fellow ' s likeness , and " P .
1	<NAME> <NAME> was in the last degree amazed and disconcerted at sight of <NAME> , and had murmured involuntarily , ' Look here !
1	<NAME> <NAME> 's niece 's sister -- the plump one with the lace tucker : not the one with the roses -- blushed .
1	Then followed the recognition of <NAME> , and then the greeting of <NAME> , and then that of Mr Pluck , and finally , to complete the young lady ' s mortification , she was compelled at Mrs. Wititterly ' s request to perform the ceremony of introducing the odious persons , whom she regarded with the utmost indignation and abhorrence .
1	' Very sorry , ' said the crestfallen <NAME> .
1	I have stood between your father and mother for a number of years .
1	Welcome to your house and home , my deary ! ' In all the first bewilderment of her wonder , the most bewilderingly wonderful thing to <NAME> was the shining countenance of Mr Boffin .
1	' But we are always glad to come home , father ; now , are we not ?
1	' I hope you dote upon pictures ? ' ' I assure you , <NAME> , ' said Mr Dombey , with solemn encouragement of his Manager , ' that <NAME> has a very good taste for pictures ; quite a natural power of appreciating them .
1	Therefore , the constable , still holding Kit in the same manner , and pushing him on a little before him , so as to keep him at about three-quarters of an arm ' s length in advance ( which is the professional mode ) , thrust him into the vehicle and followed himself .
1	But you began by saying that we took different views , you know .
1	Over ! ' And the <NAME> , hooking off his glazed hat , pulled his handkerchief out of the crown , wiped his grizzled head despairingly , and tossed the handkerchief in again , with the indifference of deep dejection .
1	That will be his place , -- there , " striking the table with her stick , " at my head !
1	On opening it to let <NAME> out , she found Mr <NAME> , instead of having gone his way , as in any less wonderful place and among less wonderful phenomena he might have been reasonably expected to do , fluttering up and down the court outside the house .
1	All this time I was deeply anxious to know what she was going to do with me ; but she took her dinner in profound silence , except when she occasionally fixed her eyes on me sitting opposite , and said , ' Mercy upon us ! ' which did not by any means relieve my anxiety .
1	There was an empty room above-stairs at the wooden <NAME> ' s , which , in days of yore , had been <NAME> ' s bedroom .
1	My low tap at the door was answered by <NAME> .
1	Evidently close at hand from the peculiar shock it communicated to the air , yet subdued as if it were far off .
1	I therefore supposed that Mrs. <NAME> was not at home , and was quite surprised when the person appeared in the passage without the pattens , and going up to the back room on the first floor before <NAME> and me , announced us as , " Them two young ladies , <NAME> ! "
1	' Well , so your old master and young mistress have gone ? ' ' Where ? ' rejoined <NAME> , looking round .
1	' I see him a-winkin ' at her , with his wicked old eye , ' shouted a fourth .
1	But , as it chanced to be immediately under his nose , it followed , as a matter of course , that he looked all over his desk for it , without finding it ; and happening in the course of his search to look straight before him , his gaze encountered the pale and terrified face of <NAME> : who , despite all the admonitory looks and pinches of <NAME> , was regarding the repulsive countenance of his future master , with a mingled expression of horror and fear , too palpable to be mistaken , even by a half-blind magistrate .
1	' I thought it was " adore. " ' ' " Love , " my dear , ' retorted <NAME> .
1	' It ' s on the spot , you see , and a very cheerful place. ' ' And when , ' hints Mr Dombey , ' would it be convenient ? ' ' I shall make a point , ' says <NAME> , ' of pledging myself for any day you think best .
1	But while I must , rather peremptorily , request my friend <NAME> not to criminate my lovely and accomplished relative until her criminality is perfectly established , I beg to assure my friend <NAME> that the family I represent , and which is now almost extinct ( devilish sad reflection for a man ) , will interpose no obstacle in his way , and will be happy to assent to any honourable course of proceeding , with a view to the future , that he may point out .
1	The fact is , the girl was washing the glasses .
1	I would sooner be put back again upon that piece of wreck , on which I have so often floated , since my preservation , in my dreams , and there left to drift , and drive , and die ! ' ' Hooroar , my lad ! ' exclaimed the <NAME> , in a burst of uncontrollable satisfaction .
1	This unforeseen and violent removal of one whom she had long watched and distrusted and who had long watched and distrusted her , one for whom she could have had few intervals of kindness , always dreading in him a dangerous and secret enemy , appeared so awful that my first thoughts were of her .
1	She could keep her own part of it from him ; he should never know of her loss ; in time to come he should know all that was of import to himself ; but he should never know what concerned her only .
1	And not only that , but <NAME> would presently , without any pointed application in the world , chance to say something with such a sting in it that <NAME> would draw back as if he had put his hand into a bee-hive .
1	He called for the lady ' s maid , and roared for the doctor ; and then , rushing into the yard , kicked the two Lincoln greens who were the most used to it , and cursing the others all round , bade them go -- but never mind where .
1	Among the rest , she converted the pantry into a dressing-room for me ; and purchased and embellished a bedstead for my occupation , which looked as like a bookcase in the daytime as a bedstead could .
1	And should you like to be always taken care of here , if you were industrious and deserving ? ' ' Oh , mum ! -- But there ' s Mrs Higden , ' said <NAME> , checking himself in his raptures , drawing back , and shaking his head with very serious meaning .
1	The old man looked , irresolutely and helplessly , first at her , then to the right and left , then at her again , and shook his head .
1	I deigned to make him no reply ; and , taking up my hat , was going out to bed , when he came between me and the door .
1	' Come , you let me alone , ' said the boy , parrying <NAME> ' s hand with both his elbows alternatively .
1	It is well meant , I have no doubt , but I reject it .
1	I can ' t stop a minute , or I shall be missed , and I don ' t want ' em to miss me. -- Eh , <NAME> ? ' He seemed to have an insatiate delight in appealing to her and looking at her ; excitedly sticking his hair up at the same moment , like a dark species of cockatoo .
1	From early in the evening until nearly midnight , little groups of two and three presented themselves at the lodge-gate , and inquired , with anxious faces , whether any reprieve had been received .
1	he said , speaking in a homely , rustic way and with great vehemence .
1	' Go about your business. ' But in taking them with so little ceremony , Mr <NAME> dropped one on the floor , and did not see what he had done ; neither did Mr Dombey observe the letter lying near his feet .
1	But no hand was there , and it opened no more .
1	<NAME> Solicitor-General then , following his leader 's lead , examined the patriot : <NAME> , gentleman , by name .
1	I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks ; I might ( mistaken or not mistaken ) have that hopefulness to-morrow. " " Do you seek any guidance from me ? " " I ask none , sir .
1	' You rendered us a very important service this morning , sir , ' said he , ' will you allow us to offer a slight mark of our gratitude by begging the favour of your company at dinner ? ' ' Great pleasure -- not presume to dictate , but broiled fowl and mushrooms- -capital thing !
1	' Fire away ! ' ' I ha ' coom , ' <NAME> began , raising his eyes from the floor , after a moment ' s consideration , ' to ask yo yor advice .
1	The seizure of the station with a fit of trembling , gradually deepening to a complaint of the heart , announced the train .
1	<NAME> ' t I say so ? ' Here Mrs. <NAME> sobbed .
1	I wish to be honourable , <NAME> , ' said Mr Toots , holding back his extended hand for a moment , ' and therefore I am obliged to say that I can not help thinking about <NAME> .
1	I should dearly like to know , of course ; ' ( which her anxious face confirmed ; ) ' but I wait until you can tell me of your own free will .
1	I never do ; I never have done .
1	But I can ' t think about the lesson .
1	said the Jew , drawing his chair forward , and speaking in a very low voice .
1	In short , must leave it alone , like or no like .
1	We ' ll drink the daisies of the field , in compliment to you ; and the lilies of the valley that toil not , neither do they spin , in compliment to me -- the more shame for me ! ' A moody smile that had overspread his features cleared off as he said this merrily , and he was his own frank , winning self again .
1	' That is a threat , ' he answered , in his voiceless manner of assent : adding aloud , ' but not directed against you. ' Proud , erect , and dignified , as she stood confronting him ; and looking through him as she did , with her full bright flashing eye ; and smiling , as she was , with scorn and bitterness ; she sunk as if the ground had dropped beneath her , and in an instant would have fallen on the floor , but that he caught her in his arms .
1	There was nothing for it , but to turn back and begin all over again .
1	That war n't your name over the water. " " What do you mean ? " " Well , I do n't know all I mean , for I ca n't call to mind what your name was , over the water. " " No ? " " No .
1	You have such a gentle nature , and you are always right. ' ' You talk , ' said <NAME> , breaking into a pleasant laugh , as she sat at work , ' as if I were the late <NAME> Larkins. ' ' Come !
1	The turnkey nodded ; and the companion passed in without being asked whom he wanted .
1	' I am not aweer , <NAME> , that you have any right to address your conversation to me .
1	' Under the impression , ' said <NAME> , ' that your peregrinations in this metropolis have not as yet been extensive , and that you might have some difficulty in penetrating the arcana of the <NAME> in the direction of the <NAME> , -- in short , ' said <NAME> , in another burst of confidence , ' that you might lose yourself -- I shall be happy to call this evening , and install you in the knowledge of the nearest way. ' I thanked him with all my heart , for it was friendly in him to offer to take that trouble .
1	He expressed great gentleness and kindness for my father 's state , and I am sure he felt it .
1	' I am sorry , <NAME> , ' said Mr Dombey , ' that you should not have thought it your duty -- ' She looked at him again .
1	Thus , she walking backward and he walking forward , they came into their own room .
1	A man of the name of <NAME> .
1	I mean to pay him too , ' retorted <NAME> .
1	If you please , miss , " said <NAME> in a whisper , with her eyes at their roundest and largest .
1	Looking out between the curtains , he espied Mr <NAME> , Mr Abel , the notary , and the single gentleman , gathered round the <NAME> , and talking to her with great earnestness but in very subdued tones -- fearing , no doubt , to disturb him .
1	<NAME> , who could hardly stand , made a shift to raise himself on his feet , and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket-collar , at a rapid pace .
1	What power could I have over them , but that they were bound in the bonds of their sin , and delivered to me ! ' More than forty years had passed over the grey head of this determined woman , since the time she recalled .
1	I had found the niece before then ; and what I did for her , was better for her far than the money of which she would have had no good. ' She added , after a moment , as though she addressed the watch : ' She herself was innocent , and I might not have forgotten to relinquish it to her at my death : ' and sat looking at it .
1	<NAME> curious , your delightful sex is ! "
1	Would you object to my writing it ? "
1	And now , dear Biddy , if you can tell me that you will go through the world with me , you will surely make it a better world for me , and me a better man for it , and I will try hard to make it a better world for you. " <NAME> was my purpose .
1	With these concluding words , <NAME> gives a shake to each of the hands he holds , and relinquishing them , backs a pace or two in a broad-chested , upright attitude , as if he had made a final confession and were immediately going to be shot with all military honours .
1	But she couldn ' t control herself to go any further .
1	' Excuse my putting it to you , <NAME> , but now really !
1	<NAME> is now at work upon embroidery or some such pretty thing , and as she bends her head over it , my Lady watches her in silence .
1	And keep as near me , as you can . '
1	' Put me down for another twenty -- or -- stop a minute , stop a minute .
1	Do not use such strong words. ' ' He might have laid my dear boy dead at my feet .
1	<NAME> , what does it matter , after all ! ' Having arrived at this comfortable frame of mind ( to which she had been greatly assisted by certain short interjectional remarks of the philosophical <NAME> ) , <NAME> consoled <NAME> with many kind words , and requested as a personal favour that whenever she thought of <NAME> , she would do nothing else but laugh at her , all the days of her life .
1	It won ' t do to be like long <NAME> , when they took him to church " to marry him to somebody " , as he says , and left the bride behind .
1	He was still too weak to get up to breakfast ; but , when he came down into the housekeeper 's room next day , his first act was to cast an eager glance at the wall , in the hope of again looking on the face of the beautiful lady .
1	growled <NAME> , in his accustomed voice , as near as he could feign it .
1	We see enough ! ' cried <NAME> .
1	' And is <NAME> absolutely banished ? ' said the Major , thrusting in his purple face over the steps .
1	Similarly , when I am reminded by any chance of what it was that the waves were always saying , my remembrance wanders for a whole winter night about the streets of <NAME> -- as I restlessly did with a little friend and I parted company .
1	In case you should think better at any time , however distant -- THAT 'S no consequence , for my feelings can never alter -- of anything I have said , particularly what might I not do , <NAME> , eighty-seven , <NAME> , or if removed , or dead ( of blighted hopes or anything of that sort ) , care of Mrs. Guppy , three hundred and two , <NAME> , will be sufficient . "
1	<NAME> ! ' looking into the lines .
1	' Not this morning , ' he said to the dog .
1	So strange , to have the road-dust on his feet instead of the coal-grit .
1	" When did he come from <NAME> ? "
1	' How can I be otherwise , my own love , when I see your empty chair ? ' ' My empty chair ! ' She clings to me for a little while , in silence .
1	Finding her still very restless on this head , they made him up a bed in an inner room , to which he presently retired .
1	Nothing more was said between the happy pair .
1	As there was a stream of people pouring into a shabby house not far from the entrance , he waited until they had made their way in , and then making up to the servant , ventured to inquire if he knew where <NAME> lived .
1	A man has confidence in untried friends , he remembers the many offers of service so freely made by his boon companions when he wanted them not ; he has hope -- the hope of happy inexperience -- and however he may bend beneath the first shock , it springs up in his bosom , and flourishes there for a brief space , until it droops beneath the blight of disappointment and neglect .
1	' <NAME> ' said <NAME> ; and down they sat .
1	I looked up , and met her sharp bright glance respectfully .
1	He wandered through the rooms : lately so luxurious ; now so bare and dismal and so changed , apparently , even in their shape and size .
1	' Allow me , ' said <NAME> suddenly , ' to ask how <NAME> is ? ' He leaned forward obsequiously , as he made the inquiry , with his chin resting on his hand ; and at the same time his eyes went up to the picture , as if he said to it , ' Now , see , how I will lead him on ! ' Mr <NAME> reddened as he answered : ' Mrs Dombey is quite well .
1	A happy party they were , that night .
1	I should never have sought you out , madam , to say what I am going to say , but since you have sought me out and are here , I will throw it off my mind .
1	<NAME> <NAME> grasped the undertaker by the arm , and led him into the building .
1	And the coach in which we came here being at the door , you ' ll allow me to hand you down to it , and pack you home to the <NAME> : where the best course for you to pursue , will be to put your feet into the hottest water you can bear , and take a glass of scalding rum and butter after you get into bed. ' With these words , <NAME> extended his right hand to the weeping lady , and escorted her to the conveyance in question , shedding many plaintive sneezes by the way .
1	If you should ever get so far as this in this long letter , you will perhaps say , Surely Little <NAME> will not leave off without telling me something about her travels , and surely it is time she did .
1	' And how , ' said <NAME> , when he had grasped his followers by the hand , and exchanged warm salutations of welcome -- ' how is <NAME> ? ' <NAME> , to whom the question was more peculiarly addressed , made no reply .
1	Mrs <NAME> circulated the news , as she received congratulations on it , with a careless grace that displayed it to advantage , as the setting displays the jewel .
1	' Dear Miss Trotwood , is that all the history ? ' said <NAME> .
1	' Not come in search of you , you see ; but still seeking some one .
1	When this interchange of <NAME> name was effected , <NAME> , picking her teeth with her toothpick , coughed another grain of cough , and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line .
1	He was taken ill in the night -- quite prostrate he was -- in consequence of <NAME> ; and after being drugged with black draughts and blue pills , to an extent which <NAME> ( whose father was a doctor ) said was enough to undermine a horse ' s constitution , received a caning and six chapters of <NAME> Testament for refusing to confess .
1	' You have no connection with any of those rascally papers have you ? ' said <NAME> .
1	What else is to be expected ! ' ' I am even a poorer man of business than I am a man , sir , ' returned <NAME> , ' and I could hardly express my deficiency in a stronger way .
1	The other lady , who had not spoken yet , said gravely and emphatically , " Very true ! " " Poor soul ! " <NAME> presently went on ( I knew they had all been looking at me in the mean time ) , " he is so very strange !
1	' " A man , " replied the figure .
1	' He said about an hour , ' replied <NAME> -- politely of course , but without any indication of being stricken to the heart by <NAME> ' s charms .
1	<NAME> , let us be courageous .
1	The whole system of shipping and conveying these unfortunate persons , is one that stands in need of thorough revision .
1	You don ' t often meet with such behaviour in young men , and it strikes one more when one does meet with it. ' ' Oh !
1	He was happy , he observed , in his public capacity as leader and representative of the <NAME> , to receive Mr Clennam when he called to pay his respects ; but he didn ' t find that he got on with him personally .
1	' I ' ll take ' em. ' ' The boots and clothes are extras , ' said <NAME> ; ' and the fires in winter time are -- ' ' Are all agreed to , ' answered the single gentleman .
1	<NAME> care of the pigs .
1	' <NAME> and gentleman ? ' inquired <NAME> , almost breathless with impatience .
1	One sunny afternoon when I had come home from school with my books and portfolio , watching my long shadow at my side , and as I was gliding upstairs to my room as usual , my godmother looked out of the parlour-door and called me back .
1	Fifty-seven churches to be erected with half-crowns , forty-two parsonage houses to be repaired with shillings , seven-and-twenty organs to be built with halfpence , twelve hundred children to be brought up on postage stamps .
1	After the first six months or so I had taken <NAME> 's advice in reference to the propriety of writing to <NAME> to say that I was happy and grateful , and with her approval I had written such a letter .
1	' <NAME> , you an ' t worth powder and shot , but I ' ll be even with you one way or another. ' ' Stop , ' interposed <NAME> , as <NAME> was about to speak .
1	' Only his playfulness , gen ' lm ' n , ' said the head hostler encouragingly ; ' jist kitch hold on him , Villiam. ' The deputy restrained the animal ' s impetuosity , and the principal ran to assist <NAME> in mounting .
1	What discussion , <NAME> ? ' ' Shall I tell him , Mr Fledgeby ? ' asked <NAME> .
1	I made it a rule to take as much out of myself as I possibly could , in my way of doing everything to which I applied my energies .
1	Therefore it is sealed and deposited for posting among the iron correspondence of the day .
1	' Open the door , and let me take my dear friend <NAME> to my arms !
1	So was <NAME> , for he was seldom otherwise .
1	" If you have allowed anything wrong to come to that security of <NAME> 's , and if you have let him in for it , and if you have put us in danger of being sold up -- and I see sold up in your face , <NAME> , as plain as print -- you have done a shameful action and have deceived us cruelly .
1	A part of this door was of glass unprotected by any shutter , which I did not observe at first , for all was very dark and silent within , and I was anxious ( as indeed the child was also ) for an answer to our summons .
1	Dropping in at Mr <NAME> ' s office on the previous evening , in the absence of that gentleman and his learned sister , he had lighted upon Mr <NAME> , who chanced at the moment to be sprinkling a glass of warm gin and water on the dust of the law , and to be moistening his clay , as the phrase goes , rather copiously .
1	In one part , carcases of houses , inauspiciously begun and never finished , rotted away .
1	Why have I alluded to it ?
1	" Then , cousin <NAME> -- " <NAME> laughingly began again .
1	' How could you presume to come here on such an errand , you scoundrel ? ' ' <NAME> !
1	When the narrative was concluded ; he raised his head hastily , as if about to speak , but on brother <NAME> resuming , fell into his old attitude again .
1	The <NAME> of <NAME> sends a splendid pile of dust and ashes , with silver wheel-boxes , patent axles , all the last improvements , and three bereaved worms , six feet high , holding on behind , in a bunch of woe .
1	But I know nothing about it , I assure you ; for I am a mere child , and I lay no claim to it , and I do n't want it ! '
1	Where does any one say I was seen ? ' returned the girl , sullenly casting down her eyes .
1	' Not going back again ? ' said the poor little anxious Child of the <NAME> , always calculating and planning for <NAME> , in the front rank of her charges .
1	I told you so beforehand , my dear , ' said <NAME> .
1	But that ' s not all , sir .
1	The nature even of the mild men got corrupted , either from their curdling it with too much lemonade , or from the general inoculation that prevailed ; and they made sarcastic jokes to one another , and whispered disparagement on stairs and in bye-places .
1	'Go to him , ' Biddy say , 'without loss of time . '
1	' <NAME> , I were never good at showin o ' t , though I ha had ' n my share in feeling o ' t .
1	' Well , ' he demanded after a silence , ' have you nothing to say to all that ? ' ' It ' s ugly , ' returned the little man , who had risen , and was brightening his knife upon his shoe , as he leaned an arm against the wall .
1	' I am certain of it .
1	The elder child remained with her father when the rest had gone away , and made his tea for him -- happy little house-keeper she was then ! -- and sat conversing with him , sometimes at the window , sometimes in the room , until the candles came .
1	' Why , they say , ' returned his wife , ' that listeners never hear any good of themselves ; though you -- but pray how long have you been here , sir ? ' ' This instant arrived , my own. ' ' Then I may go on -- though if you had been here but a moment or two sooner , you would have heard your praises sounded by Georgiana. ' ' Only , if they were to be called praises at all which I really don ' t think they were , ' explained <NAME> in a flutter , ' for being so devoted to Sophronia. ' ' Sophronia ! ' murmured <NAME> .
1	cried <NAME> , to all appearance much relieved .
1	inquired my guardian , almost sternly .
1	But I rejoice in its occurrence , for it has opened the way for me to approach <NAME> with this subject to-day , even if it has entailed upon me the penalty of her temporary displeasure .
1	' Now , ' said Mr Garland when they had made some further inquiries of him , ' I am not going to give you anything -- ' ' Thank you , sir , ' Kit replied ; and quite seriously too , for this announcement seemed to free him from the suspicion which the Notary had hinted .
1	I write the exact truth .
1	He would do nothing to make it a desperate venture , and he had very little fear of his safety with such good help .
1	Even now , although he knew that the observation of an anxious mother was much more likely to be correct in such a case than his own , and although she reminded him of many little circumstances which , taken together , were certainly susceptible of the construction she triumphantly put upon them , he was not quite convinced but that they arose from mere good-natured thoughtless gallantry , which would have dictated the same conduct towards any other girl who was young and pleasing .
1	Or take it this way , <NAME> , ' he added , after a moment ' s reflection ; ' Supposing that a man had to go through life , we won ' t say with a companion , but we ' ll say to a tune .
1	Carrying these with <NAME> ' s aid , he passed up to his dwelling .
1	Accordingly , I took the jacket off , that I might learn to do without it ; and carrying it under my arm , began a tour of inspection of the various slop-shops .
1	And why have you done it ?
1	In short , she was shaking the curls again , when the little dog came running along the walk to our relief .
1	more shame for him , ' thought <NAME> .
1	At last , however , he began to think -- as you or I would have thought at first ; for it is always the person not in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it , and would unquestionably have done it too -- at last , I say , he began to think that the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining room , from whence , on further tracing it , it seemed to shine .
1	' <NAME> word , my dear sir , very harsh word indeed .
1	During the whole interval , whenever I went to the bottom of the staircase , I heard her footstep , saw her light pass above , and heard her ceaseless low cry .
1	<NAME> looked as if she would like to trace the connexion of ideas between <NAME> and <NAME> ' s <NAME> ' s <NAME> .
1	Not so , by any means .
1	The door is opened by the same weak-eyed young man , whose imbecility of grin at sight of Mr Toots is feebleness of character personified .
1	I thought I might as well keep them to myself as have them swallowed up alive too ; so I kept them in a box , looking over them when I felt in the humour .
1	Her lips quivered and opened , in spite of her utmost efforts to keep them still .
1	<NAME> day to you , gentlemen ; good day ! "
1	<NAME> relieved her from her perplexity by taking his departure without delay : <NAME> making many gracious inquiries why he never came to see them ; and <NAME> anathematising the stairs with great volubility as he followed them down , in the hope of inducing <NAME> to look round , -- a hope , however , which was destined to remain ungratified .
1	' I think I see him now , ' cried the Jew , bending his eyes upon his pupil .
1	<NAME> ' t you speak to him ?
1	The gentleman walked on with them by the officer 's side ; and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat , got a little ahead , and stared back at <NAME> from time to time .
1	Nicholas could not go to bed without expatiating on the excellences and munificence of the brothers <NAME> , and relating the great success which had attended his efforts that day .
1	It had vanished from the earth .
1	' Tight-Jeff or Slack-Jeff , it don ' t much signify : it ' s only tight-rope and slack-rope .
1	<NAME> went on , and the turnkey began to fail .
1	' Never owed her a penny , <NAME> ' r , ' said <NAME> , in a low voice , and with visible marks of trepidation on his countenance .
1	<NAME> do it , Sir. ' As <NAME> put himself very temptingly within the reach of <NAME> ' s clenched fist , there is little doubt that that gentleman would have complied with his earnest entreaty , but for the interposition of <NAME> , who , hearing the dispute , emerged from the office , mounted the stairs , and seized his master by the arm .
1	' " I ' ll astonish you , " said <NAME> , putting his hand in his pocket .
1	I can scarcely believe it now .
1	<NAME> ' t tell me so if she has not. ' ' She has , ' cried <NAME> .
1	<NAME> kept one hand on my lips , and raised the other in a listening attitude .
1	You will find the cold mutton on the table . "
1	He took out of his pocket the most respectable hunting-watch I ever saw , and preventing the spring with his thumb from opening far , looked in at the face as if he were consulting an oracular oyster , shut it up again , and said , if I pleased , it was half past eight .
1	'Will she be buried to-morrow , or next day , or to-night ?
1	'He has brought me to this lonely place to murder me ! '
1	This <NAME> does with great discretion , appearing to address himself to <NAME> , but having an eye solely on the old girl all the time , as <NAME> has himself .
1	Sweeping past the gold and silver demonstration on the sideboard as if it were heaped-up dirt , and deigning to bestow no look upon the elegancies around her , she took her place at his board for the first time , and sat , like a statue , at the feast .
1	There is a splendid wedding in the church .
1	I am in now , as one of the regulars. ' ' Oh !
1	' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' I dare say you have been annoyed in the <NAME> ; there are some odd gentry there .
1	Was he prejudiced against the race of lawyers ?
1	We all three went home together next day .
1	He went away in high spirits .
1	<NAME> kind for once , and sing us an <NAME> song. ' ' What do you care for an <NAME> song ? ' she returned .
1	What I have left to call my own -- it is little beyond the worth of a few jewels -- I will make it the first charge of his life to bestow , with the compassion and lamenting of his dead mother , on this injured family , if the sister can be discovered . '
1	' <NAME> ' s the matter with me , ' replied <NAME> nervously .
1	Think of this now , <NAME> and Mrs. Micawber .
1	<NAME> <NAME> L. <NAME> 's <NAME> .
1	' Good-bye ! ' ' Good-bye ! ' said the pretty housemaid .
1	That wasn ' t his doing , so don ' t lay it at his door. ' ' Hold your tongue , you Jezebel , ' said <NAME> , looking fearfully round .
1	Why , you won ' t tell me , <NAME> , that you really suppose my sister Loo does care for old Bounderby. ' ' My dear fellow , ' returned the other , ' what am I bound to suppose , when I find two married people living in harmony and happiness ? ' <NAME> had by this time got both his legs on the sofa .
1	So Mr <NAME> bought a gift of each sort , and paid handsomely for it .
1	Even <NAME> standing in a window , moodily swinging the tassel of a blind , gives it a smarter jerk now , as if he found himself in better case .
1	' Have you been travelling ? ' Mr Short replied in the affirmative with a nod and a smile .
1	What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in such a case , no echoes tell ; but it is so , and it was so here .
1	' I ' ll not detain you any longer now , ' he said , putting a crown into <NAME> ' s hand , and looking towards the Notary .
1	More remarkable by being so removed from the crowd it was among than if it had been lifted on a pedestal to be seen , the figure attracted all eyes .
1	And I ' m glad to see he ' s having his fire kindled up , for it ' s chilly after the wet , and the <NAME> had both a damp feel and a damp touch this afternoon , and he was very shivery. ' They all three look towards an old stone gatehouse crossing the <NAME> , with an arched thoroughfare passing beneath it .
1	They lingered about , in the fields , for some hours .
1	There was my brother , as I read in chance <NAME> papers now and then , rising to be prosperous and famous .
1	Without other announcement or ceremony , <NAME> walks in .
1	" Since then , " said I , " we have never spoken on the subject except once . "
1	' It ' s my opinion , you see , ' said <NAME> , with a delighted face , after some further rubbing of his legs , ' as this is along of my havin ' played with her so much , and made believe as we was <NAME> , and <NAME> , and sharks , and every wariety of forinners -- bless you , yes ; and lions and whales , and I doen ' t know what all ! -- when she warn ' t no higher than my knee .
1	From many dreams of rambling through light and sunny places , but with some vague object unattained which ran indistinctly through them all , she awoke to find that it was yet night , and that the stars were shining brightly in the sky .
1	' It ' s a bad light to distinguish objects in , ' murmured Mrs. Nickleby , peering into the garden , ' and my eyes are not very good -- I was short-sighted from a child -- but , upon my word , I think there ' s another large vegetable marrow sticking , at this moment , on the broken glass bottles at the top of the wall ! ' <NAME> certain Particulars arising out of a Visit of <NAME> , which may prove important hereafter .
1	I think so , because she beckoned to me to climb up , with quite a new and motherly expression in her face , and put her arm round my neck , and gave me just such a kiss as she might have given to her own boy .
1	In taking me to him my guardian told me this , and also explained how it was that he had come to think of me .
1	" <NAME> , " I urged , " it is not so hopeless as that ? "
1	His blood is infected , and objects lose their natural aspects in his sight .
1	' Our judgments -- I am supposing a general case -- ' ' Of course , ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> may complain , but if <NAME> grumbles by so much as a word -- oh dear , down with him , down with him directly .
1	Now then , just you hear a word or two from me .
1	' Side of One-tree <NAME> , at twelve o ' clock , Sir. ' ' That ' s not <NAME> ' s land , is it ? ' ' <NAME> , <NAME> ; but it ' s close by it .
1	After this memorable event , I went to the hatter 's , and the bootmaker 's , and the hosier 's , and felt rather like <NAME> 's dog whose outfit required the services of so many trades .
1	Here somebody cried out , ' Shame , <NAME> !
1	' Major Bagstock , my darling <NAME> , ' drawled her mother , ' who is generally the most useless and disagreeable creature in the world : as you know -- ' ' It is surely not worthwhile , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , looking round , ' to observe these forms of speech .
1	In a corner below the mangle , on a couple of stools , sat two very little children : a boy and a girl ; and when the very long boy , in an interval of staring , took a turn at the mangle , it was alarming to see how it lunged itself at those two innocents , like a catapult designed for their destruction , harmlessly retiring when within an inch of their heads .
1	I don ' t know any such person. ' ' Well , <NAME> , then. ' ' I never heard the name in my life. ' ' Then , I have been deceived , and deluded , ' said <NAME> .
1	Were you one of many children ? ' He shook his head .
1	All these proceedings occupied <NAME> so much , that it was not until the following day that he saw <NAME> again .
1	The exertion this cost him , or the consciousness of talking in that feeble way , made his angry face so much more angry , and his thick veins so much thicker , when he spoke , that I am not surprised , on looking back , at this peculiarity striking me as his chief one .
1	They left that fancy ware to boys and girls , and boarding-schools and books .
1	They straggle about in wrong places , look at wrong things , do n't care for the right things , gape when more rooms are opened , exhibit profound depression of spirits , and are clearly knocked up .
1	So powerfully was his imagination impressed by it , that when his driver stopped , after having asked the way more than once , and said to the best of his belief this was the gateway they wanted , Mr <NAME> stood hesitating , with the coach-door in his hand , half afraid of the dark look of the place .
1	He was passing at nightfall along the <NAME> , and the lamp-lighter was going on before him , under whose hand the street-lamps , blurred by the foggy air , burst out one after another , like so many blazing sunflowers coming into full-blow all at once , -- when a stoppage on the pavement , caused by a train of coal-waggons toiling up from the wharves at the river-side , brought him to a stand-still .
1	<NAME> , still looking , and always looking with an immovable countenance , at the opposite side of the world , made no reply .
1	' <NAME> ! ' he thought , suddenly correcting himself , ' what a boy I am ! ' ' It is better as it is , ' said <NAME> , after he had lounged on , a few paces , and returned to the same spot .
1	In obedience to this summons the clerk got off the high stool ( to which he had communicated a high polish by countless gettings off and on ) , and presented himself in <NAME> ' s room .
1	" A tremendous family to provide for ! "
1	Ten o'clock at night ? " " Yes , sir .
1	" Do n't shake your head , " said <NAME> .
1	This matter is not at all in my course of practice and is not in my office .
1	I am sure you can tell me something connected with the coming here of this man , if you will. ' ' Why , then I ' ll tell you , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> -- ' <NAME> ' s coming ! ' ' <NAME> , indeed he is not .
1	His thoughts , as yet , have no wider range than home .
1	That ' s a cautious fellow. ' ' He is a very cautious fellow indeed , ' returned <NAME> .
1	When the man in reply avowed the truth ; the blunt , remorseless , naked truth ; ' This is the saloon , sir ' —he actually reeled beneath the blow .
1	<NAME> out of his house .
1	' <NAME> to me in half an hour , and I ' ll tell you more. ' <NAME> waited upon him at the time mentioned , and then learnt all that had taken place on the previous day , and all that was known of the appointment <NAME> had made with the brothers ; which was for that night ; and for the better understanding of which it will be requisite to return and follow his own footsteps from the house of the twin brothers .
1	His sister gently touched him on the shoulder , and pointed to it .
1	No , no , not for the world ! ' ' Is it really gone though ? ' said <NAME> , looking at <NAME> with a face as pale as his own .
1	Through the munificence of Mr Boffin .
1	He don ' t care for an old ' ooman like me , I dare say. ' ' I assure you , ma ' am , ' said <NAME> , grasping the old lady ' s hand , and speaking so loud that the exertion imparted a crimson hue to his benevolent countenance -- ' I assure you , ma ' am , that nothing delights me more than to see a lady of your time of life heading so fine a family , and looking so young and well. ' ' Ah ! ' said the old lady , after a short pause : ' it ' s all very fine , I dare say ; but I can ' t hear him. ' ' Grandma ' s rather put out now , ' said <NAME> , in a low tone ; ' but she ' ll talk to you presently. ' <NAME> nodded his readiness to humour the infirmities of age , and entered into a general conversation with the other members of the circle .
1	'Bear a hand with the boy , ' cried <NAME> , beckoning furiously to his confederate .
1	I am sure I hardly know how it ' s done ! ' ' Are many of the young ladies with you ? ' I inquired .
1	YOU must be rambling a little now , I think , if you do n't know that this is the great reason why titles will always last in the land ! "
1	' Not a syllable , sir , from my man , if we talk till doomsday , ' returned the captain .
1	Always proceeding from a rigid mouth and closed teeth , as if the jaw were locked and the face frozen up in pain .
1	' Very well , ' cried <NAME> with an air of resignation , ' then I suppose it must be done !
1	You seem to know all about ' em , ' said <NAME> .
1	' Yes , Miss. ' And threw back his head and laughed .
1	And where ' s the good of it ?
1	' Yes , <NAME> , it is , ' replies <NAME> , advancing .
1	If that was bad , I am sorry ; but you repeat it after consideration , and that seems to me to be at least no better .
1	Dash it , <NAME> , " says that gentleman , " you really ought to be careful how you wound the feelings of a man who has an unrequited image imprinted on his 'eart and who is <NAME> altogether happy in those chords which vibrate to the tenderest emotions .
1	The Captain himself was in the last extremity of shabbiness , with large whiskers , and an old , old brown great-coat with no other coat below it .
1	She settled with herself , now I ' ll never refer to that meeting under such different circumstances , and I ' ll never pretend to have any idea that these are the same girls .
1	" And not only here , but you will go to <NAME> 's too , perhaps ?
1	<NAME> <NAME> looked more astonished than hospitable , at sight of this uninvited party in his dining-room .
1	<NAME> has been busy upon this theme , but here again I must refer to the lady of the store , and say , that if many of the sister Shakers resemble her , I treat all such slander as bearing on its face the strongest marks of wild improbability .
1	'Yes , I know you are , ' said the gentleman : 'You 're hungry too , a n't you ? '
1	' And <NAME> is here , ' said <NAME> , in rapid conclusion ; ' and , could you believe it ?
1	<NAME> had , by this time , put her hand in <NAME> ' s ; and was looking very earnestly , and with increasing agitation , into every new street into which they turned .
1	I know how natural it was that he should regard my presence as something offensive ; I felt it must be so , myself. ' ' He did not say so ? ' ' No ; he said nothing : but I saw that his glance rested on me for a moment , and I was prepared for what would happen -- for what has happened .
1	It was a case of jealousy .
1	He lounged along moodily , and stopped at <NAME> to look about him , with as little interest in the crowd as any man might take , and was lounging on again , when a most unexpected object caught his eyes .
1	' Sam ! ' said <NAME> , calling over the banisters .
1	" I hope , guardian , " said I , " that you may not trust too much to my discretion .
1	<NAME> presents his kind regards to <NAME> , and will feel obliged if he will inform him at what hour tomorrow morning it will be most convenient to him to meet <NAME> at the Theatre , for the purpose of having his nose pulled in the presence of the company .
1	It may be profitable to that gentleman to know , sir , that I attribute my past follies , entirely to having lived a thoughtless life in the service of young men ; and to having allowed myself to be led by them into weaknesses , which I had not the strength to resist .
1	What do you mean by this noise , you hussies ? '
1	' And Oh my Eye , I ' m so sore ! ' cried <NAME> , starting , over on his back , in a spasmodic way that caused the dressmaker to retreat to the wall .
1	' <NAME> , ' he said , with an impatient bite at the handkerchief in which his hand was wrapped , ' you had better take and fire a loaded gun at me. ' ' But I love you , <NAME> , ' cried Mrs. Heep .
1	" If I went into <NAME> 's office , " said <NAME> , " and if I were placed under articles to <NAME> , I should have my eye on the -- hum ! -- the forbidden ground -- and should be able to study it , and master it , and to satisfy myself that it was not neglected and was being properly conducted .
1	' <NAME> has gone for an airing on the <NAME> .
1	<NAME> , Florence. ' <NAME> turned so pale , and spoke so earnestly , that <NAME> did not need her restraining hand upon her lips .
1	He looks into the second : not there .
1	She was much startled , on returning home one night , to find that Mrs <NAME> had commanded an announcement to be prepared , to the effect that the stupendous collection would only remain in its present quarters one day longer ; in fulfilment of which threat ( for all announcements connected with public amusements are well known to be irrevocable and most exact ) , the stupendous collection shut up next day .
1	When his hollow voice broke silence , they all three started .
1	' Well ; if you are curious to know , of course I have no objection. ' Ever willing to sacrifice his own feelings to the wishes of his friend , <NAME> at once took a pretty long taste .
1	<NAME> laid his hand upon his shoulder .
1	They naturally supposed me to have toppled in , drunk , when I crept to the public-house it belonged to ; for I had no notion where I was , and could not articulate -- through the poison that had made me insensible having affected my speech -- and I supposed the night to be the previous night , as it was still dark and raining .
1	Indeed , except in respect of staring about him ( a branch of the public service to which the pictorial cherub is much addicted ) , this domestic cherub discharged as many odd functions as his prototype ; with the difference , say , that he performed with a blacking-brush on the family ' s boots , instead of performing on enormous wind instruments and double-basses , and that he conducted himself with cheerful alacrity to much useful purpose , instead of foreshortening himself in the air with the vaguest intentions .
1	Confused , but sensible that something might depend on his presence of mind , he commanded himself , and was silently attentive .
1	Such were the thoughts -- if to visions so imperfect and undefined as those which wandered through his enfeebled brain , the term can be applied -- which were present to the mind of <NAME> , and rendered him deaf alike to intimidation and persuasion .
1	At length all this was devoutly believed ; and the new sexton used to exhibit to the curious , for a trifling emolument , a good-sized piece of the church weathercock which had been accidentally kicked off by the aforesaid horse in his aerial flight , and picked up by himself in the churchyard , a year or two afterwards .
1	The house was silent as the grave .
1	" Man , " said the <NAME> , " if man you be in heart , not adamant , forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered What the surplus is , and Where it is .
1	They were the prelude to the first reception of Mr and <NAME> at dinner , and they skilfully placed <NAME> on his usual ground in the new family .
1	Why not , when you can have one so devoted to you !
1	'If she lasts a couple of hours , I shall be surprised , ' said the apothecary 's apprentice , intent upon the toothpick 's point .
1	But I don ' t believe that. ' He had placed a chair for her by this time , and sat down opposite ; the violoncello lying snugly on the sofa between them .
1	But as I am not aware that any worse consequence ensued , than a sudden looking-up of all the parasols and silk stockings in the market ; and perhaps the bankruptcy of some speculative <NAME> Englander who bought them all up at any price , in expectation of a demand that never came ; I set no great store by the circumstance .
1	I couldn ' t have done it , <NAME> .
1	'Did you tell him to lock her and bar her in ? '
1	His head was all on one side , and one of his eyes was half shut up , as if he were taking aim at something with an invisible gun .
1	' <NAME> , ' said her father , gently disengaging himself , ' it was nothing. ' ' But you had that spasm yesterday , and it is terrible to see you in such pain .
1	<NAME> ith a bad piethe of bithnith , thith ith .
1	This here conduct of yourn won ' t suit my book , <NAME> .
1	My only other remembrances of the great festival are , That they would n't let me go to sleep , but whenever they saw me dropping off , woke me up and told me to enjoy myself .
1	I hope you ' re well ? ' Encouraged by these gracious words , and by my aunt ' s extending her hand , <NAME> came forward , and took the hand , and curtseyed her acknowledgements .
1	Come ! ' ' Yes , <NAME> , ' returned the <NAME> .
1	I hope you didn ' t take cold .
1	Each boy is required to bring , sir , two suits of clothes , six shirts , six pair of stockings , two nightcaps , two pocket-handkerchiefs , two pair of shoes , two hats , and a razor. ' ' A razor ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , as they walked into the next box .
1	The great majority were silent and still , looking fixedly at the ground .
1	Outside a stable door at the bottom of a long back lane without a thoroughfare , a groom in undress was idling about , apparently persuading himself that he was doing something with a spade and a wheel-barrow .
1	I learned , that , when he was past creeping out of bed to open it , and past assuring himself of its safety by means of the divining rod I had seen him use , he had required to have it placed on the chair at the bed-side , where he had ever since embraced it , night and day .
1	' Mr Wegg , ' said <NAME> , with another flush .
1	" <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , " returns <NAME> , " put it to her ladyship to clear that up .
1	<NAME> masses of the same material , carried forward by the wind , and shone through by the burning sun , stalked in the distance like pillars of living fire .
1	I have no need to observe that I do not wilfully or negligently mislead my readers and that before I wrote that description I took pains to investigate the subject .
1	There had been a quantity of printing , and promising , and proxying , and polling , and it appeared to have imparted great liveliness to all concerned , except the pensioners -- who were not elected yet .
1	" You are not the gaoler 's daughter ? " She sighed " No. " " Who are you ? " Not yet trusting the tones of her voice , she sat down on the bench beside him .
1	' My own feelings exactly , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , putting her apron to her eyes , and shaking her head .
1	Here , too , the bride ' s trustee ; an oilcake-fed style of business-gentleman with mooney spectacles , and an object of much interest .
1	' You couldn ' t put it clearer , I am sure , ma ' am. ' As this was his usual hour for having a little confidential chat with Mrs. Sparsit , and as he had already caught her eye and seen that she was going to ask him something , he made a pretence of arranging the rulers , inkstands , and so forth , while that lady went on with her tea , glancing through the open window , down into the street .
1	The climate being a thirsty one , there was never , at any hour of the day , a scarcity of loungers in the spacious bar , or a cessation of the mixing of cool liquors : but they were a merrier people here , and had musical instruments playing to them o ' nights , which it was a treat to hear again .
1	" I should not be surprised if they all voluntarily abandoned the girl -- yes , lover and all -- instead of her abandoning them , supposing she remained at <NAME> under such circumstances . "
1	He walked up one street , and down another , until exercise had abated the first passion of his grief ; and then the revulsion of feeling made him thirsty .
1	The Secretary kept silence for a little while ; then merely said , ' You are wholly mistaken , <NAME> ; wonderfully mistaken .
1	It was in vain for <NAME> to struggle and to strike ; <NAME> , with the vigorous tenacity of love , always so much stronger than hate , clasped her tight , and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle that they had .
1	The watch found at the <NAME> was challenged by the jeweller as one he had wound and set for <NAME> , at twenty minutes past two on that same afternoon ; and it had run down , before being cast into the water ; and it was the jeweller ' s positive opinion that it had never been re-wound .
1	He did neither , and meanwhile the result of this private marriage was a son .
1	I do n't tell it you on information received .
1	Was it quite consistent , in candour , with our taking that resolution against Mr Fledgeby , that you should afterwards address Mr Fledgeby as your dear and confidential friend , and entreat a favour of Mr Fledgeby ?
1	<NAME> <NAME> ' s manner towards Mrs Boffin at this time , was more the manner of a young man towards a mother , than that of a Secretary towards his employer ' s wife .
1	Who should we bury , <NAME> ? ' returned the sexton .
1	'You have borne more , and have been , through all , the best and gentlest creature that ever shed happiness on every one she knew , ' said Mrs. Maylie , embracing her tenderly .
1	The dwarf ' s lodging on <NAME> hill comprised , besides the needful accommodation for himself and <NAME> , a small sleeping-closet for that lady ' s mother , who resided with the couple and waged perpetual war with <NAME> ; of whom , notwithstanding , she stood in no slight dread .
1	<NAME> , without the least discomposure or surprise , but congratulating the old lady in an approving manner on being ' very lively to-night ' , handed her back to her chair .
1	I hid my tears in the bedclothes , and pressed her from me with my hand , when she would have raised me up .
1	It can be proved , sir .
1	' <NAME> gracious , <NAME> , what is the matter , what have you been doing ? ' cried <NAME> .
1	She said them slightingly , but not with displeasure .
1	He still wore knee-breeches , and dark cotton stockings on his nether limbs ; but they were not _the_ breeches .
1	There are bad people in it , Mr <NAME> , but if there were no bad people , there would be no good lawyers .
1	I should have been more fit for Heaven than I ever have been since .
1	<NAME> took the bit off , and put it in her mouth .
1	' You mean something more , as concerns myself and my intention .
1	That 's the time of day .
1	No veiled future dimly glanced upon him in the moonbeams .
1	I know from terrible warnings I have noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired , but I solemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right mind -- that my memory is exact and circumstantial -- and that I write the truth as I shall answer for these my last recorded words , whether they be ever read by men or not , at the <NAME> Judgment-seat .
1	In the midst of a great noise , occasioned by the prayers and entreaties of <NAME> , the cries and exclamations of the women , and the vehemence of the men , demonstrations were made of carrying off the lost son by violence .
1	The <NAME> paused a moment , as observing his condition , and giving him time to recover .
1	<NAME> must have irritated him , -- made faces at him .
1	I may not see her again for a long , long time .
1	' I won ' t take one of the others , ' said <NAME> , tying the knots of the bundle very tight , in the severity of her resolution .
1	Then you see , <NAME> , " he returns , " you are not to be trusted .
1	" I am fond of boating .
1	He is a child , you know ! "
1	A team of horses couldn ' t draw her back now ; the bolts and bars of the old <NAME> couldn ' t keep her. ' ' How did it happen ?
1	' If she don ' t like it , Mr Dombey , she must be taught to lump it. ' The good lady apologised immediately afterwards for using so common a figure of speech , but said ( and truly ) that that was the way she reasoned with ' em .
1	I look forward a long while , through years and years , and think that then , when I am growing old , or when I am dead perhaps , a beautiful woman , his daughter , happily married , may be proud of him and a blessing to him .
1	<NAME> <NAME> wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his walk had engendered , glanced complacently at the cocked hat , and smiled .
1	<NAME> electors of the borough of <NAME> .
1	It was then calm , radiant sunset .
1	A face of a transparent paleness ; every feature in it clearly defined ; one set expression on it .
1	' Fanny is not going to live with us just now , father .
1	<NAME> Orlick he 's been a bustin ' open a dwelling-ouse. " " <NAME> ? " said I .
1	' I think , <NAME> , ' he said , ' that the employment you can give <NAME> , and the kindness you can show her -- ' ' Yes and I will , ' said <NAME> , quickly .
1	The other gentleman with him , in the red under-waistcoat and dark moustache , is the <NAME> <NAME> , his bosom friend .
1	You yourself , ' said Mr Meagles , persuasively , as if the provocation to be angry were not his own at all , ' want to give the poor passionate girl another chance , I know , Clennam. ' ' It would be strange and hard indeed if I did not , ' said <NAME> , ' when you are all so forgiving .
1	The <NAME> ' s delight and wonder at the quiet housewifery of <NAME> in assisting to clear the table , arrange the parlour , and sweep up the hearth -- only to be equalled by the fervency of his protest when she began to assist him -- were gradually raised to that degree , that at last he could not choose but do nothing himself , and stand looking at her as if she were some Fairy , daintily performing these offices for him ; the red rim on his forehead glowing again , in his unspeakable admiration .
1	' If you please , partner , ' said <NAME> , rubbing his hands .
1	How do we come together—or so near together—so very unexpectedly ? ' Unexpectedly indeed , among the dingy gables and chimney-pots of P. J. T. ' s connection , and the flowers that had sprung from the salt sea .
1	' I was going to do so .
1	As soon as any gentleman found his number , he took possession of it by immediately undressing himself and crawling into bed .
1	' It ' s better for me to be stupid than uncomfortable , isn ' t it ? ' said <NAME> .
1	' Now , ' said Mr Boffin , who , in his frankness , felt that it did not become him to have a gentleman in his employment five minutes , without reposing some confidence in him , ' you must be let a little more into our affairs , <NAME> .
1	He seldom or never took the liberty of standing with his back to the fire unless he was quite alone .
1	What dear flowers ! ' said <NAME> .
1	I should have had the pleasure of -- of returning with <NAME> at an earlier period ; but , in the first place , we didn ' t know the name of the relation to whose house she had gone , and , in the second , as she had left that relation ' s and gone to another at a distance , I think that scarcely anything short of the sagacity of the <NAME> , would have found her out in the time. ' Florence was sure of it .
1	The air , the movement in the court , the lapse of time , or the combination of these things recovers him .
1	Yes , they do happen to be bloody .
1	' There are bad tidings in that letter. ' ' Yes .
1	' Why ? ' The child sat on the table looking at him , with a curious expression of suppressed emotion in his face , and beating one hand proudly on his knee as if he had the rising tears beneath it , and crushed them .
1	The young ladies laughed very heartily , and the old one tried to look amiable , but couldn ' t manage it .
1	All its disputes , all its ill-will and bad blood , rise up before you .
1	That , they never could lay their heads upon their pillows ; that , they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying their heads upon their pillows ; that , they never could endure the notion of their children laying their heads upon their pillows ; in short , that there never more could be , for them or theirs , any laying of heads upon pillows at all , unless the prisoner 's head was taken off .
1	He was greatly interested to hear that I knew <NAME> , and spoke of him with such warmth that I made him tell <NAME> what he thought of him .
1	The gentleman next door had been vilified by <NAME> ; rudely stigmatised as a dotard and an idiot ; and for these attacks upon his understanding , Mrs. <NAME> was , in some sort , accountable .
1	Yes , it is , it is .
1	Talk of <NAME> risk in the conspiracy ! ' ' I say , ' remonstrated <NAME> , looking uneasily round : ' don ' t call it that !
1	How dare you look me in the face and do it , sir ? ' ' Well , <NAME> , if you come to that , ' responded <NAME> , ' how dare you look me in the face , and call me a serpent , sir ? ' ' Because you are one , ' replied <NAME> .
1	Are you sure that it would not be better to try that course ?
1	More composure came to me after a while , and we talked as we used to talk , lying on the grass at the old Battery .
1	What childhood did you ever leave to me ?
1	'Why , ' whispered <NAME> , 'as you cross the lawn -- ' 'Yes ? '
1	Grandfather Smallweed inquires , slowly rubbing his legs .
1	The mother laid her work upon the table , and put her hand up to her face .
1	As <NAME> sat on a large old-fashioned window-seat , where there was ample room for two , it was also natural that <NAME> should sit down beside her ; and as to <NAME> ' s being unusually spruce and particular in his attire that day , why it was a high festival and a great occasion , and that was the most natural thing of all .
1	But the eyes of this history can follow him westward , by <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and the <NAME> , to <NAME> and the <NAME> .
1	That he must know of <NAME> ' s abrupt departure , and that he must divine its cause , was not to be doubted .
1	Then I watch ; then I hide , until he walks and smokes .
1	<NAME> , <NAME> , run , in <NAME> ' s name !
1	We were shut out that night , and sat at the iron gate , and walked about till morning .
1	My son -- my only son , <NAME> -- has been his brother ; Mrs. Squeers has been his mother , grandmother , aunt , -- ah !
1	' However , ' said that fascinating gentleman , wiping his eyes again , ' if we go on in this way , we shall seem to be almost making game of Mr Riah , or of <NAME> and Co. Saint Mary Axe , or of somebody : which is far from our intention .
1	Your lodging ( which I have arranged for ) will be paid by me .
1	Long before we saw the sea , its spray was on our lips , and showered salt rain upon us .
1	' I am quite glad , ' said <NAME> , arrived at her own door , ' to know you .
1	I believe I have as much influence with your Papa as anybody has .
1	He remained at the bottom , apparently drowned , for at least ten minutes .
1	'You do n't mean to say that 's the boy who had the fever , I hope ? '
1	I remarked that my mother , though she smiled when <NAME> looked at her , became more serious and thoughtful .
1	Permit me to say , <NAME> , that I highly admire your conduct , and extremely regret having caused you the inconvenience of this meeting , to no purpose. ' ' I beg you won ' t mention it , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
1	troubled me none the less because I went on .
1	It flattered him to picture to himself , this proud and stately woman doing the honours of his house , and chilling his guests after his own manner .
1	He lies a little turned away , but his eyes are surely open .
1	" Why do n't you cry ? " " Because I do n't want to. " " You do , " said she .
1	Just as anybody might. ' ' Precisely so , ' said <NAME> .
1	He looks to you , sir. ' ' I do my best , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , uneasily .
1	I wavered again , and began to think here were greater expectations than my own .
1	But I must not take that at a word .
1	' Now , darlings ! ' said the gentleman with the black hair .
1	' How can I prevent his having his own way ? ' began the dressmaker .
1	And walked with a settled step , down-stairs .
1	I feared you would think too much of what passed here just now .
1	So he remains , dodging and lurking about in the gloom of the staircase while they confer .
1	The Orfling was likewise accommodated with an inexpensive lodging in the same neighbourhood .
1	Among other items , <NAME> and <NAME> , solicitors , of <NAME> , were instructed by their client <NAME> , <NAME> , to address a letter to Mr <NAME> , enclosing the sum of twenty-four pounds nine shillings and eightpence , being the amount of principal and interest computed at the rate of five per cent .
1	No words can describe the <NAME> ' s consternation at this sight .
1	And they appended to their verdict , a recommendation to the <NAME> ( which Mr Inspector appeared to think highly sensible ) , to offer a reward for the solution of the mystery .
1	She passed the scene of the struggle -- yonder it was , on her left , well over the boat ' s stern -- she passed on her right , the end of the village street , a hilly street that almost dipped into the river ; its sounds were growing faint again , and she slackened ; looking as the boat drove , everywhere , everywhere , for the floating face .
1	I am very ignorant , and it troubles me -- just a little. " " <NAME> me what it is. " " I have a cousin , an only relative and an orphan , like myself , whom I love very dearly .
1	If none of the new family were particularly at home in private , it was resolved that <NAME> at least should be at home in public , without delay .
1	See if <NAME> is in the lodge , and beg him to come to me. ' All the guests were now in consternation , and everybody rose .
1	No man thinks of walking in this desolate place , or of turning it to any account .
1	Why , he knows you have come home .
1	Numbers of people were lost in the <NAME> Office .
1	<NAME> <NAME> looked mildly at <NAME> , and said -- ' I should like to speak to you in private .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , ' said the Jew , trembling ; 'do n't speak so loud ! '
1	But there was the sun shining and there were the birds singing , as the sun only shines and the birds only sing on holidays and half-holidays ; there were the trees waving to all free boys to climb and nestle among their leafy branches ; the hay , entreating them to come and scatter it to the pure air ; the green corn , gently beckoning towards wood and stream ; the smooth ground , rendered smoother still by blending lights and shadows , inviting to runs and leaps , and long walks God knows whither .
1	<NAME> as the counting-house dial , which he maintained to be the best time-keeper in <NAME> next after the clock of some old , hidden , unknown church hard by , ( for <NAME> held the fabled goodness of that at the <NAME> to be a pleasant fiction , invented by jealous West-enders , ) the old clerk performed the minutest actions of the day , and arranged the minutest articles in the little room , in a precise and regular order , which could not have been exceeded if it had actually been a real glass case , fitted with the choicest curiosities .
1	The name of that lady no longer appeared on the flaming door-plate , that of <NAME> being substituted in its stead ; but the bonnets and dresses were still dimly visible in the first-floor windows by the decaying light of a summer ' s evening , and excepting this ostensible alteration in the proprietorship , the establishment wore its old appearance .
1	So sometimes I put a quiet tea at the window here , with a little quiet contemplation of the <NAME> ( which comes soothing ) , between the day , and domestic -- ' ' <NAME> , ' suggested <NAME> , sorrowfully .
1	<NAME> me. " <NAME> raised his head thoughtfully , as if there were something in that too .
1	' Let me do something for you , at least , ' said <NAME> .
1	At that meal , for which he had no appetite , everything was quite as solemn and genteel as at the others ; and when it was finished , he followed <NAME> upstairs .
1	You might point out to her that she probably would , in good time , find a husband at <NAME> by whom she would not be -- " <NAME> adds , after a moment 's consideration , " dragged from the altars of her forefathers . "
1	No , he scorned the base insinuation .
1	She hesitates , but he motions again , and she sits down .
1	<NAME> , who had stimulated this anxiety by his hard reserve of manner , and who had begun to understand his man very well , replied with an air ; as if he were saying something extraordinarily generous and great : ' Mr Boffin , I never bargain. ' ' So I should have thought of you ! ' said Mr Boffin , admiringly .
1	But it might have been. ' ' Of how much ? ' ' Oh !
1	Mr Carker the Manager treats no one ; neither is he treated ; but alone in his own room he shows his teeth all day ; and it would seem that there is something gone from Mr <NAME> ' s path -- some obstacle removed -- which clears his way before him .
1	Yet every one had had enough , and the youngest Cratchits in particular , were steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows !
1	You can not fail to know that she is far below him. ' ' Raise her up ! ' said <NAME> .
1	' But by G -- , sir , there is offence , ' said the other , interrupting him , ' when you intrude yourself upon a couple of gentlemen who are particularly engaged. ' ' I had no intention to offend , ' said the old man , looking anxiously at the cards .
1	Hereupon the coachman , and the guard , and <NAME> , and <NAME> , and <NAME> , and all the hostlers , and every one of the idlers , who are more in number than all the others put together , shout for the missing gentlemen as loud as they can bawl .
1	" I am away on leave this day -- should have been gone in another hour -- and that is to smooth it over , for my selling out .
1	They apply so happily to the late case that <NAME> has come from the library to my <NAME> 's room expressly to read them aloud .
1	This would not do , it was quite clear .
1	' Do you mean mine ? ' asked <NAME> .
1	From him , ' she said , with a laugh .
1	A little while , and he was always in pursuit of her , and he and I crossed one another every day .
1	My Lord inquired of <NAME> ( the prisoner 's counsel ) , whether they were next to try <NAME> ( name of my learned friend ) for treason ?
1	But , <NAME> , if your object is to find her , and to have her here , myself and the <NAME> will produce her with every dispatch that devotion on my part , and great intelligence on the <NAME> ' s , can ensure. ' Mr <NAME> was so manifestly delighted and revived by the prospect of being useful , and the disinterested sincerity of his devotion was so unquestionable , that it would have been cruel to refuse him .
1	" Let me see , <NAME> , " said I , pretending to consider .
1	The removal of <NAME> Dorrit herself from their customary association , did not mend the matter .
1	There were samples of cheap clocks , and samples of cheap vases of flowers .
1	The letter had made no difference between us except that the seat by his side had come to be mine ; it made none now .
1	" That 's a bad presentiment , mother . "
1	He receives these salutations with gravity and buries them along with the rest of his knowledge .
1	Having seen him safely carried into the hotel , he turned his face homewards , running as fast as he could , to make up for lost time : and recalling with a great deal of astonishment and some fear , the extraordinary behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted .
1	I am subject to -- gout " -- <NAME> was going to say indisposition and would have said it to anybody else , but <NAME> palpably knows all about it -- " and recent circumstances have brought it on . "
1	Her father thought so as he looked at her .
1	As he spoke , there was another great cry of pity from the beach ; four men arose with the wreck out of the deep , clinging to the rigging of the remaining mast ; uppermost , the active figure with the curling hair .
1	I was there , as I have mentioned , at all hours .
1	Now , I no longer Weep for the hour , When to <NAME> bower , The <NAME> of the valley with offers came ; Neither does the moon hide her light From the heavens to-night , And weep behind her clouds o ' er any individual in the present <NAME> ' s shame .
1	He cast himself on the grass by the <NAME> side , in an indolent way , with his back in that direction , and , having gathered a few blades , fell to chewing them .
1	Early in the afternoon the subdued sound of his heavy military trot is heard on the turf in the avenue as he rides on with imaginary clank and jingle of accoutrements under the old elm-trees .
1	Mrs. <NAME> curtseyed and smiled , and curtseyed again , and remarked , rubbing her hands as she did so , that she hadn ' t the -- really -- the honour to -- ' To know us , ' said the first gentleman .
1	The talking-over stranger , Mr Venus. ' ' Is that any one I know ? ' inquires the staring Secretary .
1	I am well aware , sir , of the many demands upon your time , and its -- ha -- enormous value , ' Mr Dorrit could not say enormous roundly enough for his own satisfaction .
1	' He had hardly read it when he was called away .
1	It is something so new to Pleasant to see her father an object of sympathy and interest , to find any one very willing to tolerate his society in this world , not to say pressingly and soothingly entreating him to belong to it , that it gives her a sensation she never experienced before .
1	Nothing can change them , or prevent them coming back. ' ' I do not understand , ' said <NAME> , gazing on her agitated face which seemed to darken as she looked .
1	Two minutes hence may be too late .
1	How can I get that reading , <NAME> ?
1	At the foot of a flight of steps , leading to the house door , which was guarded on either side by an <NAME> aloe in a green tub , the sedan- chair stopped .
1	It was nearly midnight when they rushed out , wild , burning with wine , their blood boiling , and their brains on fire , to the gaming-table .
1	<NAME> , having taken the pony to a neighbouring stable , was at work at a desk in this room , which had a brass frame on the top to hang paper upon , and on which the writing he was making a copy of was then hanging .
1	' How should you like to be my number two , Nelly ? ' ' To be what , sir ? ' ' My number two , Nelly , my second , my Mrs Quilp , ' said the dwarf .
1	As we walked to and fro , all four together , before breakfast , I deemed it right to recount what I had seen .
1	Now , Mr <NAME> ' s gentleman has it whispered in his ear that this witness is disposed to be friendly to the prisoner -- which , to say the truth , he is rather glad to hear , as his strength is considered to lie in what is familiarly termed badgering .
1	' How you frightened me ! ' ' I meant to , you jade , ' returned the dwarf .
1	' I make false statements , it appears ?
1	<NAME> was taken off in an instant , with a blessing from his mother , and a scream from little <NAME> , ringing in his ears .
1	' I didn ' t tell her who you were , either , or where you ' d seen her .
1	There seemed to be something very comical in the reputation of <NAME> of <NAME> , for both the gentlemen laughed heartily when he was mentioned , and <NAME> was a good deal amused also .
1	Now , you know , there ' s a struggle going on when that ' s the case .
1	I remember the place well. ' Looking very curiously round it .
1	As to <NAME> and <NAME> , I discovered immediately that they lodged ( they are always looking after lodgings in a pantomime ) at a very small clockmaker ' s one story high , near the hotel ; which , in addition to various symbols and devices , almost covering the whole front , had a great dial hanging out—to be jumped through , of course .
1	The burning of the body ( previously reduced to pieces convenient for the purpose ) was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire ; and the tools , shoes , and leather , were buried in the garden .
1	I believe there was not a soul in the place , except myself , who knew that she did it purposely to wound and gall me !
1	When she reached it , she looked back and saw the head of <NAME> peeping out of the low wooden passage , where she had issued her parting injunctions ; likewise the fist of <NAME> Mrs Brown shaking towards her .
1	<NAME> training is always desirable , whether the race be for place , cup , or sweepstakes . '
1	Many flaunting dolls had to be gaily dressed , before the money was in the dressmaker ' s pocket to get mourning for Mr Dolls .
1	The poor side , you say ?
1	The <NAME> , after bowing his head with great reverence , stared all round the circle , beginning with Mr Toots , and ending with the Instrument-maker ; then gravely said : ' <NAME> !
1	He made that promise when he proposed these curious interviews , and has kept it so faithfully and pleasantly , that if I ever felt any trifling uneasiness about them in the beginning ( which I don ' t think I did , <NAME> ; his manner was so plain and true ) it very soon vanished , and left me quite glad when the day was coming .
1	She will have in me a man already pretty well off , and a rapidly rising man , and a man of some distinction : it is a piece of good fortune for her , but she is worthy of good fortune .
1	In about ten minutes ' time , <NAME> was seized with a fit of coughing ; upon which <NAME> pulled her shawl over her shoulders , and declared it was time to go .
1	'Only think , ' said <NAME> , shrugging his shoulders , and stretching out his hands ; 'only consider .
1	I thought I had read in his face that he would like to speak to me alone .
1	'You were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on the subject which has brought us here to-night , I hope ? '
1	' <NAME> , ' returns <NAME> , with his wristbands bristling a little , ' <NAME> repeat the word ; I repeat the word .
1	Would you ! ' <NAME> had caught him round the body .
1	She sees nothing and hears nothing .
1	It was with some difficulty that she could be induced to go back with the excuse ; but the promise of being told a story -- of old her great delight -- on condition that she concentrated her faculties upon the errand and left her little mistress to herself for an hour longer , combined with a misgiving on <NAME> ' s part that she had left her good temper at the bottom of the staircase , prevailed .
1	' For no better reason , truly , than because I was thinking , ' he said , after a pause , ' of something like it , when it came by .
1	She is gone with me upon a distant voyage .
1	<NAME> times , ' said <NAME> , thrice throwing out his left hand with all its fingers spread , and doing it so rapidly that the sense of sight could hardly follow the action , ' I ask of him in every place where go the foreigners ; and fifteen times , ' repeating the same swift performance , ' they know nothing .
1	What you say now , gives me new heart. ' She faltered , and burst into tears .
1	I know your tricks and your manners , my friend ! ' ' <NAME> ' s sister , ' said <NAME> , ' is not come home yet ? ' ' You are quite a conjuror , ' returned <NAME> .
1	' You needn ' t mind me. ' ' To answer it in person , however inconvenient the journey , ' pursued <NAME> , ' rather than by letter .
1	' He ' s here , sir , ' rejoined Mr Swiveller .
1	At least , ' said <NAME> , ' you are known to be alive and unharmed .
1	The effect of this ceremonial was for some quarter of an hour afterwards perfectly paralyzing on the neighbours , and was much enhanced by the worthy lady airing herself for that term in a kind of splendidly serene trance on the top step .
1	And me bound , too , to a born devil that only wants the will , and has the power to , to -- ' Panting for breath , the old man stammered for a word ; and in that instant checked the torrent of his wrath , and changed his whole demeanour .
1	I am not one of your players of music , stage actors , writers of books , or painters of pictures , who assume a station that the laws of their country don ' t recognise .
1	There was one little ceremony peculiar to the day , both the matter and manner of which made a very strong impression upon <NAME> .
1	The child he was nursing stretched forth its arms and cried out to be taken by <NAME> .
1	I am as obstinate as one , I am more stupid than one , I get as much pleasure as one , and I should like to kick like one. ' ' Not me , I hope , <NAME> ? ' ' <NAME> , <NAME> ; I wouldn ' t hurt _you_ .
1	I only know that I don ' t like it .
1	I will not say ( whatever I may think ) that this affair has been got up solely to degrade and insult me .
1	<NAME> _as though_ crippled in the back. ' ' Ran away , <NAME> .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , like a tall tower in a flat country , seemed to project himself across the table-cloth , hide the light from the honourable Member , cool the honourable Member ' s marrow , and give him a woeful idea of distance .
1	' Not if you are ready , <NAME> , my dear. ' ' Well ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , delighted .
1	Little Em ' ly had overcome her shyness , and was sitting by my side upon the lowest and least of the lockers , which was just large enough for us two , and just fitted into the chimney corner .
1	' Say what you have to say ; it ' s the old story , I suppose ? ' ' With a difference , my dear <NAME> ; with a difference , ' rejoined <NAME> , deliberately folding up the paper and putting it into his pocket again .
1	This earth looked spectral , and so did the pale stars : while the cold eastern glare , expressionless as to heat or colour , with the eye of the firmament quenched , might have been likened to the stare of the dead .
1	I will take you there directly , without a minute 's loss of time .
1	She always made a bargain for it , by holding up , as a statement of its just price , one finger less than the merchant held up , whatever his number might be .
1	Jinks , ' said the magistrate , ' you ' re a fool. ' <NAME> looked humbly at the great man , and bit the top of his pen .
1	" And I want you , <NAME> , " said I , shaking my head , " to understand some one else . "
1	I really will , you know ! ' she answered .
1	And she may have the pain of knowing that he does so . '
1	I need scarcely ask you. ' ' Quite , <NAME> ' r <NAME> , ' he returned ; ' and told <NAME> ' ly .
1	So this calling follows the rest .
1	' I am going on , Mr Headstone , don ' t you be afraid .
1	I don ' t mean -- Heaven forbid ! -- that you intended it ; but you hardly know with what a sudden swing you removed yourself from me. ' ' However ! ' said the boy , taking no heed of the remonstrance , and pursuing his own mortified disappointment , ' I know what this means , and you shall not disgrace me. ' ' It means what I have told you , <NAME> , and nothing more. ' ' That ' s not true , ' said the boy in a violent tone , ' and you know it ' s not .
1	He is very low and wretched at not having heard from his father. ' ' Low , is he ? ' said the old gentlemen .
1	Sometimes when I raise my eyes and see her in the black dress that she still wears , teaching my <NAME> , I feel -- it is difficult to express -- as if it were so good to know that she remembers her dear Esther in her prayers .
1	<NAME> : <NAME> 's was a munificent house , and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen from their high estate .
1	She caught the hand which <NAME> instinctively placed in hers , and , blowing out the light , drew him after her up the stairs .
1	If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind , <NAME> would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he had been , in his anxiety , so anxious to obtain .
1	" He has none , and no anger .
1	If I was to tell you how I found out this word , you ' d believe that .
1	The eye was pained to see the stumps of great trees thickly strewn in every field of wheat , and seldom to lose the eternal swamp and dull morass , with hundreds of rotten trunks and twisted branches steeped in its unwholesome water .
1	For I naturally said , " Esther !
1	To whom , in a few easy words adapted to his capacity , <NAME> stated the question at issue .
1	Yet the air was so intensely clear , and dry , and bright , that the temperature was not only endurable , but delicious .
1	What botanical blotches would he cheerfully stick upon his cheek , or forehead , if the dear old lady convicted him of an imperceptible pimple there !
1	The coach , with <NAME> inside , came up in due time , and I took my box-seat again , and arrived in <NAME> safe , -- but not sound , for my heart was gone .
1	<NAME> <NAME> paid , the door was unbolted , and out they came ; the uncombed gentleman bestowing a friendly nod upon <NAME> , who happened to be passing at the moment .
1	<NAME> hands have strewn the ground deep with snow , that the lightest footstep may be lighter yet ; and the very birds are dead , that they may not wake her .
1	<NAME> <NAME> understood her quite as well as if she had said a thousand .
1	<NAME> remind me of them to-morrow. ' Little <NAME> was not without doubts how Mr <NAME> might take their patronage ; but she promised not to fail in the reminder .
1	' Go , deceiver , go , some day , <NAME> , p ' r ' aps you ' ll waken , from pleasure ' s dream to know , the grief of orphans forsaken .
1	Self-acting ink , that ' ere ; it ' s wrote your mark upon the wall , old gen ' l ' m ' n .
1	He would have made a wonderful cabinet-maker , said <NAME> , ' if there had been the money to put him to it. ' She had seen him handle tools that he had borrowed to mend the mangle , or to knock a broken piece of furniture together , in a surprising manner .
1	'So I _do_ do as she bids me , ' replied <NAME> ; ' I should n't have been milled , if it had n't been for her advice .
1	Much as if one nostril was caught up with a horse-hair and a little fish-hook .
1	A white figure advancing along this path , proved to be nothing more ghostly than Mr Boffin , easily attired for the pursuit of knowledge , in an undress garment of short white smock-frock .
1	said <NAME> , caustically ; after an attentive perusal of <NAME> 's features .
1	' Dear Little Dorrit , it is not my imprisonment only that will soon be over .
1	Do ye gang whoam wi ' me , and do yon loight an ' toight young whipster look sharp out for a brokken head , next time he cums under my hond. ' ' Mercy on us , what ' s all this ? ' cried <NAME> , in affected astonishment .
1	' Now , I ask you , ' said Mr Meagles in the blandest confidence , falling back a step himself , and handing his daughter a step forward to illustrate his question : ' I ask you simply , as between man and man , you know , DID you ever hear of such damned nonsense as putting <NAME> in quarantine ? ' ' It has had the result of making even quarantine enjoyable. ' ' Come ! ' said Mr Meagles , ' that ' s something to be sure .
1	You are not more than ordinarily honourable , perhaps ? " I announce myself , " <NAME> , a gentleman from the birth , and a gentleman to the death ; but _not_ more than ordinarily honourable .
1	you know ! ' The <NAME> , with responsive gravity and mystery , immediately waved his hook towards the little parlour , whither Mr <NAME> followed him .
1	' N -- no , ' returned <NAME> , shaking his head at once observantly , thoughtfully , and playfully .
1	" I am well known to be prudent , " says <NAME> , composedly smoking .
1	This is a charming spot , is the <NAME> , but you must get to apprechiate it by degrees .
1	Mr Toots , who had been detained by an important letter from the <NAME> of <NAME> , found <NAME> out after a time ; and having looked at him for a long while , as before , inquired if he was fond of waistcoats .
1	' Was it property that we ever thought of ? ' ' <NAME> , ' cried Mrs. <NAME> , ' I scorn it. ' ' So do I , ' said <NAME> , ' and always did. ' ' My feelings have been lancerated , ' said Mrs. <NAME> , ' my heart has been torn asunder with anguish , I have been thrown back in my confinement , my unoffending infant has been rendered uncomfortable and fractious , <NAME> has pined herself away to nothing ; all this I forget and forgive , and with you , uncle , I never can quarrel .
1	'It make you nervous , <NAME> , -- reminds you of being nabbed , does it ? '
1	As Mr <NAME> was somewhat noisily getting his steam up for departure , he concluded by asking that gentleman if he would walk with him ?
1	I suppose I shall hear a knock here .
1	Glancing at the angry eyes which now avoid him and at the angry figure trembling from head to foot , yet striving to be still , <NAME> feels his way with his forefinger and in a low voice proceeds .
1	Oh , dem , dem , dem ! ' The woman looked , first at <NAME> , and then at <NAME> , as if uncertain on whom to visit this extraordinary behaviour ; but Mr Mantalini happening by ill-luck to thrust his nose from under the bedclothes , in his anxiety to ascertain whether the visitors were gone , she suddenly , and with a dexterity which could only have been acquired by long practice , flung a pretty heavy clothes-basket at him , with so good an aim that he kicked more violently than before , though without venturing to make any effort to disengage his head , which was quite extinguished .
1	Now , what ' ll you read on ? ' ' Thank you , sir , ' returned <NAME> , as if there were nothing new in his reading at all .
1	One other singularity was that nobody with a mission -- except <NAME> , whose mission , as I think I have formerly said , was to be in ecstasies with everybody 's mission -- cared at all for anybody 's mission .
1	Mrs. <NAME> shook her head mournfully , as if deploring the mental blindness of those paupers who did not know it ; and thrusting a silver spoon ( private property ) into the inmost recesses of a two-ounce tin tea-caddy , proceeded to make the tea .
1	' We have no <NAME> left , positively , ' said <NAME> , advancing her shrivelled ear ; for Mr <NAME> was saying something to <NAME> .
1	On glancing at the address , the parochial functionary observed that it contained no name .
1	<NAME> , I wonder you have never turned your thoughts to emigration. ' ' <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , ' it was the dream of my youth , and the fallacious aspiration of my riper years. ' I am thoroughly persuaded , by the by , that he had never thought of it in his life .
1	I am not clear , Mr Boffin , but that the hive may be satirical. ' ' At all events , they work , ' said Mr Boffin .
1	I was not insensible , indeed .
1	What I suffered from that placard , nobody can imagine .
1	In a short pause which ensued , she had a fancy that she felt <NAME> touch her hair , and that with no ungentle hand ; but , looking at her , in her timid hope , she found that lady sitting with the skirt of her dress tucked up , her hands folded on one knee , and her feet upon the fender , frowning at the fire .
1	' Em ' ly is like me , ' said <NAME> , ' and would like to see him. ' Em ' ly was confused by our all observing her , and hung down her head , and her face was covered with blushes .
1	That gentleman has lost his senses , and I am the unhappy cause. ' ' YOU the cause ! ' said <NAME> , greatly astonished .
1	It has aged me , tired me , vexed me , disappointed me .
1	Now Mr Headstone , as Mr <NAME> has been obliged to hear what I had to say , and couldn ' t help himself , and as I have said it out to the last word , we have done all we wanted to do , and may go. ' ' Go down-stairs , and leave me a moment , <NAME> , ' he returned .
1	It ' s nigh six in the morning. ' ' Is it though ?
1	A sedan chair was kept inside the railing before the <NAME> ' s <NAME> , but it had never come out within the memory of man ; and on fine mornings , the top of every rail ( there were eight-and-forty , as <NAME> had often counted ) was decorated with a pewter-pot .
1	' <NAME> ' t alarm me at the very beginning .
1	You may know the name. ' ' Never heard of it. ' Mrs <NAME> said it , and Mr <NAME> echoed it .
1	' Now , <NAME> , ' cried <NAME> , quite unconscious that there was anything the matter .
1	This was a quieter time ; for he would come and look over the writer ' s shoulder , and tell him mildly to observe how such a letter was turned in such a copy on the wall , praise such an up-stroke here and such a down-stroke there , and bid him take it for his model .
1	We are not ignorant , sir , ' said <NAME> , slowly shaking his little head again , ' down in our part of the country , of your fame .
1	So that some of us thinks he ' s peeping out towards where his own country is , and some of us thinks he ' s looking for somebody he don ' t want to see , and some of us don ' t know what to think. ' Mr <NAME> seemed to have a general understanding of what she said ; or perhaps his quickness caught and applied her slight action of peeping .
1	If there ' s a bad thing to be done , can it ever be Patroned and Patronessed right ?
1	Now whether the tall horse , in the natural playfulness of his disposition , was desirous of having a little innocent recreation with <NAME> , or whether it occurred to him that he could perform the journey as much to his own satisfaction without a rider as with one , are points upon which , of course , we can arrive at no definite and distinct conclusion .
1	<NAME> has been done , to which you were morally if not really a party . '
1	<NAME> , don ' t deny that. ' ' Yes , I believe she is considered so , ' replied <NAME> .
1	" But my dear young friend , " said <NAME> , " you must be hungry , you must be exhausted .
1	To which <NAME> retorts , " I say so ! "
1	And <NAME> , with another short laugh of the purest glee , made her eyes very round again and looked as serious as became my maid .
1	I have been stinted of education , liberty , money , dress , the very necessaries of life , the commonest pleasures of childhood , the commonest possessions of youth .
1	' Except that it is a fire , ' said <NAME> , ' it looks to me as stupid and blank as everything else looks .
1	I understood him to add that she was parting amidships , and I could readily suppose so , for the rolling and beating were too tremendous for any human work to suffer long .
1	I have been alone , and indifferent to it .
1	But , perhaps , nobody 's ever did ?
1	But he slept out of the house too , at his mother ' s lodging ; and before I had gone many hundred yards , came up with me .
1	I understand your allusion , my love .
1	I shall come to no harm .
1	something of that sort , ' replied <NAME> .
1	<NAME> , my dear young friend , with three lumps of sugar to the tumbler. ' ' Wery sorry to say , sir , ' said <NAME> , ' that they don ' t allow that particular wanity to be sold in this here establishment. ' ' Oh , the hardness of heart of these inveterate men ! ' ejaculated <NAME> .
1	It had an official look , however , and there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen .
1	A hurry and contradiction pervaded all his thoughts .
1	think I was ; * fired a musket -- fired with an idea -- rushed into wine shop -- wrote it down -- back again -- whiz , bang -- another idea -- wine shop again -- pen and ink -- back again -- cut and slash -- noble time , <NAME> .
1	I am sure I can not imagine what the cause of it is .
1	But they reached their journey ' s end at last ; and there , in a front room , looking over the wild sea , <NAME> showed him a nice little bed with white hangings , close to the window , on which there was already beautifully written on a card in round text -- down strokes very thick , and up strokes very fine -- <NAME> ; while two other little bedsteads in the same room were announced , through like means , as respectively appertaining unto Just as they got downstairs again into the hall , <NAME> saw the weak-eyed young man who had given that mortal offence to Mrs Pipchin , suddenly seize a very large drumstick , and fly at a gong that was hanging up , as if he had gone mad , or wanted vengeance .
1	' <NAME> , ' replied the unwelcome visitor .
1	I will not disgrace your recommendation .
1	' I assure you , ' said <NAME> , taking his arm , ' that I think myself very lucky they did not owe all the money instead of being sixpence short .
1	'Why , a beak 's a madgst'rate ; and when you walk by a beak 's order , it 's not straight forerd , but always agoing up , and niver a coming down agin .
1	' You don ' t appear to understand me , <NAME> ! ' observed old Sol .
1	I have been in prison for contempt of court .
1	" And could n't <NAME> , the sergeant , see that my door was locked ? "
1	They all returned his look .
1	But upon my soul I can ' t make flourishes , and I would rather be disappointed than try. ' If he meant to follow home what was in <NAME> ' s thoughts , it was skilfully done .
1	And it really did me good , for though nobody but <NAME> and I knew anything about it , I somehow felt as if it had diminished the separation between <NAME> and me and had brought us together again for those moments .
1	' " My love , " said the baron .
1	' I ' b dot certaid you cad , ' said <NAME> , who was the attendant sprite ; 'but I 'll idquire . '
1	" Begging your pardon for interrupting you a moment ? "
1	And so , indeed , it proved , for the <NAME> gradually coming to herself ; and asking with wild emotion , ' <NAME> dear , are you safe ? ' and further , ' George love , what has happened ?
1	He wound his arms round the old man ' s body , and held him back .
1	Has nothing but cold water to drink , and never feels thirsty ( great applause ) .
1	' <NAME> , <NAME> ; don ' t you like him now ? ' Without returning any direct reply , <NAME> , all at once , fell into a paroxysm of spiteful tears , and exclaimed that she was a wretched , neglected , miserable castaway .
1	' Now , gentlemen , ' said <NAME> , looking at them attentively .
1	<NAME> 's business was the swindling , handwriting forging , stolen bank-note passing , and such-like .
1	The scientific gentleman was a bachelor .
1	It got there in course of time ; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground ; finally , accomplished the interment of the deceased <NAME> in its own way , and highly to its own satisfaction .
1	' Come , dear boy ! ' said <NAME> .
1	O , if you could know how faithful , you would almost pity me for being so far away and being so grand !
1	That which promised happiness when we were one in heart , is fraught with misery now that we are two .
1	Because you hadn ' t cleared his father to him , and you ought to have done it .
1	said my guardian , looking back over his shoulder half angrily ; only half angrily , for he never seemed to consider <NAME> an accountable being .
1	At length he pushed his plate from him , and spoke aloud ; with the strangest inconsistency .
1	' " Family of Mr Gallanbile , MP .
1	He had scarcely washed himself , and made everything tidy , by emptying the basin out of the window , agreeably to the <NAME> 's directions , when the <NAME> returned : accompanied by a very sprightly young friend , whom <NAME> had seen smoking on the previous night , and who was now formally introduced to him as <NAME> .
1	' Good-bye , Loo. ' She gave him an affectionate good-night , and went out with him to the door , whence the fires of <NAME> could be seen , making the distance lurid .
1	' " What is it , my dear ? " said my uncle , looking in at the coach window .
1	The lanterns glimmered , as the men ran to and fro ; the horses ' hoofs clattered on the uneven paving of the yard ; the chaise rumbled as it was drawn out of the coach-house ; and all was noise and bustle .
1	I tell him again , much he cares about the truth. ' ' Our connexion being at an end , Mr Boffin , ' said the Secretary , ' it can be of very little moment to me what you say. ' ' Oh !
1	You 'll lose your temper with the whole round of 'em , again and again ; and I shall take you on a score of warrants yet , if I have luck . "
1	' <NAME> ' t be alarmed , ' cried <NAME> , running down ; ' here it is ; it ' s all out , it ' s all over ; pray compose yourselves ; there ' s no harm done ; ' and with these , and a thousand other assurances , he delivered the baby ( whom , in his hurry , he had carried upside down ) , to Mrs. <NAME> , and ran back to assist <NAME> , who was rubbing his head very hard , and looking much bewildered by his tumble .
1	'The game of that is , that they always leave it open with a catch , so that the dog , who 's got a bed in here , may walk up and down the passage when he feels wakeful .
1	' These two gentlemen have ordered supper in an hour ' s time , ' she said , taking her into the bar ; ' and your best plan will be to sup with them .
1	' <NAME> d ' ye do , old fellow ? ' This was a rival trainer of young noblemen and gentlemen , and the person of all others whom <NAME> most hated and dreaded to meet .
1	If it be at all , it can only be by one of these. " " Or both , " said <NAME> .
1	He had glittering eyes , -- small , keen , and black , -- and thin wide mottled lips .
1	<NAME> ' s eyes followed him to the door , lighted on Mr Boffin complacently thrown back in his easy chair , and drooped over her book .
1	So when the coachman came round for his fee , he pleasantly asked him what he considered a very good fee indeed , now -- a liberal one -- and on his replying half a crown for a single passenger , said it was little enough too , all things considered , and left <NAME> to give it him .
1	' What ! ' said Mr Carker , who had heard this .
1	A carriage at the gate , and <NAME> ' s man arrives , looking rather like a spurious <NAME> and an unacknowledged member of that gentleman ' s family .
1	' And now , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , consulting a large double-faced silver watch that hung at the end of the copper chain .
1	I didn ' t before I was married ; but I do now , because <NAME> does .
1	It has been too short and easy .
1	I therefore hope , ' said <NAME> , ' that you can make yourself happy in those relations. ' ' I should have nothing to wish , sir , if— ' ' I understand you , ' said <NAME> ; ' you still refer to your father .
1	They would have talked to me too , but I held back , and moped in my corner ; scared by their love-making and hilarity , though it was far from boisterous , and almost wondering that no judgement came upon them for their hardness of heart .
1	<NAME> , dear , I am changed .
1	' I entered on his lodgings t ' other day , chiefly because I had seen this very board .
1	We learnt , however , as the time went on , that a new application was made to the <NAME> on <NAME> 's behalf as an infant and a ward , and I do n't know what , and that there was a quantity of talking , and that the <NAME> Chancellor described him in open court as a vexatious and capricious infant , and that the matter was adjourned and readjourned , and referred , and reported on , and petitioned about until <NAME> began to doubt ( as he told us ) whether , if he entered the army at all , it would not be as a veteran of seventy or eighty years of age .
1	However opinions may differ on a variety of subjects , I should think it would be universally agreed , <NAME> , that I am not much to boast of . "
1	Here <NAME> is much dismayed by the graces and accomplishments of his nieces that are and by the beauty of <NAME> , his niece that is to be , and by the affectionate salutations of these young ladies , which he receives in a sort of dream .
1	<NAME> had not been idle , for there was a little cart at the door , and the effects were hurrying out already .
1	' Be thankful for me , if you have a kind heart , as I think you have , ' she said , ' that while I know well what I am , I can be cheerful and endure it all .
1	He was going to <NAME> and to <NAME> as a surgeon on board ship .
1	The hue and cry going off to the <NAME> , and people coming thence to examine the iron , <NAME> 's opinion was corroborated .
1	As one might go to survey the weather and the general aspect of the heavenly bodies .
1	' For her own sake , ' repeated <NAME> , warming , ' and for her brother ' s , and as a perfectly disinterested person. ' ' Really , <NAME> , ' remarked the dressmaker , ' since it comes to this , we must positively turn you with your face to the wall. ' She had hardly done so , when <NAME> arrived , and showed some surprise on seeing <NAME> there , and <NAME> shaking her little fist at him close before her eyes , and the <NAME> Mrs T. with her face to the wall .
1	Here , too , are <NAME> and <NAME> , and the two other Buffers ; each Buffer with a flower in his button-hole , his hair curled , and his gloves buttoned on tight , apparently come prepared , if anything had happened to the bridegroom , to be married instantly .
1	<NAME> <NAME> gave his arm to <NAME> , and <NAME> walked , detached , in front .
1	As they proceed with great gravity through the streets towards the region of <NAME> , <NAME> , observing his companion to be thoughtful , considers it a friendly part to refer to Mrs. Bagnet 's late sally .
1	' Disappointed ? ' he went on , as he walked between them under the trees .
1	His tone is no less sorrowfully echoed by his new acquaintance .
1	If the <NAME> proposed to new skylight the market-place , the <NAME> got up public meetings , and denounced the proceeding ; if the <NAME> proposed the erection of an additional pump in the <NAME> , the <NAME> rose as one man and stood aghast at the enormity .
1	Whether or no , the mender of roads ran , on the sultry morning , as if for his life , down the hill , knee-high in dust , and never stopped till he got to the fountain .
1	I should be more disposed to quarrel with myself even then , than with poor <NAME> , for I brought you together .
1	She was sinking under a painful and incurable disease , and wished to recover him before she died .
1	' <NAME> de do , <NAME> ? ' said a voice beside him .
1	Those are of a different kind .
1	' You are from <NAME> , sir , are you .
1	Several times she has gone out early , and been absent until evening .
1	<NAME> ' t moddley-coddley , there ' s a good fellow .
1	<NAME> <NAME> ' s coarse and insulting behaviour on the occasion in question had produced a deep impression on his mind ; a strong suspicion of his having led him on to pursue <NAME> for purposes of his own , had been lurking there for some time ; he was really ashamed of his share in the transaction , and deeply mortified by the misgiving that he had been gulled .
1	That Mr <NAME> was himself perplexed , and that in no small degree , by the contents of the letter , was sufficiently obvious .
1	' What is the matter ? ' asked her visitor .
1	But one morning when she happened to come upon him suddenly , from a by-path among some pollard willows which terminated in the little shelving piece of stony ground that lay between his dwelling and the water , where he was bending over a fire he had made to caulk the old boat which was lying bottom upwards , close by , he raised his head at the sound of her footstep , and gave her Good morning .
1	The common welfare was my business ; charity , mercy , forbearance , and benevolence , were , all , my business .
1	That he was well known in the neighbourhood , and enjoyed the reputation of having sold himself to the devil , I soon understood from the visits he received from the boys , who continually came skirmishing about the shop , shouting that legend , and calling to him to bring out his gold .
1	But , thinking that the Jew , being so much his senior , must know best , he followed him quietly to the table , and was soon deeply involved in his new study .
1	' Which of ' em have you got in that lot ? ' asked Mr Boffin .
1	" I hope not , guardian , " said I .
1	' Avay vith melincholly , as the little boy said ven his schoolmissus died .
1	' You don ' t hate <NAME> , <NAME> ? ' ' I hate to be obliged to call her Jupe .
1	' I ' m not a child , to be taken notice of by strangers. ' ' You ARE a child. ' ' I ' m not a child , and I won ' t be taken notice of .
1	If my heart were pure and all untried , and you its idol , could you ask more ; could you have more ? ' ' <NAME> not , <NAME> , ' he returned coolly .
1	As these things passed through his thoughts , he jumped upon his feet , and again walked forward .
1	So , <NAME> goes home to <NAME> , <NAME> ' s , to take a plate of mutton broth with a chop in it , and a look at the marriage-service , in order that he may cut in at the right place to-morrow ; and he is low , and feels it dull over the livery stable-yard , and is distinctly aware of a dint in his heart , made by the most adorable of the adorable bridesmaids .
1	' Come ! ' said he , ' you know what you have engaged to do .
1	There will not be the smallest impropriety -- <NAME> , sir , is the very soul of honour .
1	How many years is it , ' said <NAME> , pondering , ' since I first noticed him , quite a little child , dragging himself about on a pair of tiny crutches ?
1	The man was a bad man , and willing enough to be in his pay .
1	Imprisonment began to tell upon him .
1	' I say , ' he proceeded , ' Miss Dombey !
1	<NAME> in return , requiring name of such <NAME> .
1	' Not there ! ' cried <NAME> .
1	' Whatever possessed that poor unfortunate <NAME> , that she must go and be married again , ' said my aunt , when I had finished , ' I can ' t conceive. ' ' Perhaps she fell in love with her second husband , ' <NAME> suggested .
1	When <NAME> drew in his head again , his countenance was smiling and placid ; and , walking quietly back into the office , he declared that he had now removed a great weight from his mind , and that he felt perfectly comfortable and happy .
1	They came , and the shady house was sunny with a child 's laugh , and the <NAME> friend of children , to whom in her trouble she had confided hers , seemed to take her child in his arms , as He took the child of old , and made it a sacred joy to her .
1	In one of these pauses of invention , the scientific gentleman was gazing abstractedly on the thick darkness outside , when he was very much surprised by observing a most brilliant light glide through the air , at a short distance above the ground , and almost instantaneously vanish .
1	Yes , for I am going ; ' she said it as in prompt reply to something in his face ; ' to appeal to you. ' Mr Dombey , with a slightly condescending bend of his chin that rustled and crackled his stiff cravat , sat down on a sofa that was near him , to hear the appeal .
1	<NAME> sought to learn their secret ; sought to find out what it was she had missed ; what simple art they knew , and she knew not ; how she could be taught by them to show her father that she loved him , and to win his love again .
1	Never , never , never ! ' He had a violent fit of trembling , and then sunk into his chair .
1	Uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise , as his eyes rested on <NAME> , <NAME> brought himself into a sitting posture , and demanded who that was .
1	Oliver having 'caught it , ' in fulfilment of <NAME> 's prediction , followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast .
1	At that instant , <NAME> , who has been lying in wait for nothing else all along , says in a deep warning voice : ' Clara ! ' My mother starts , colours , and smiles faintly .
1	It is the mode. ' Though <NAME> ' s back was turned while he spoke , and thenceforth to the end of the interview , he kept those glittering eyes of his that were too near together , upon him , and evidently saw in the very carriage of the head , as he passed with his braggart recklessness from clause to clause of what he said , that he was saying nothing which <NAME> did not already know .
1	<NAME> peculiarities were easily to be detected by experienced eyes in Mr Doyce ' s way of managing his affairs , but they almost always involved some ingenious simplification of a difficulty , and some plain road to the desired end .
1	<NAME> , we are observed ! -- we are discovered ! ' <NAME> looked round .
1	There is some inconvenience in the necessity of writing <NAME> , ' said Mr Dombey , making a fictitious autograph on his knee ; ' but it is merely of a private and personal complexion .
1	Oh , madam , if you have but one thought of him who sent me here , but one last lingering care for your own peace of mind and heart , I do for <NAME> ' s sake urge you to give me a hearing. ' She attempted to pass him , but <NAME> gently detained her .
1	' Why didn ' t ' ee punch his head , or lay theeself doon and kick , and squeal out for the pollis ?
1	<NAME> <NAME> detained it while he murmured a profusion of compliments , which <NAME> , remembering what had passed between them , rightly considered as so many aggravations of the insult he had already put upon her .
1	I don ' t say whether with having some knowledge of it that hasn ' t come out. ' ' You don ' t surprise me .
1	It is let off in sets of chambers now , and in those shrunken fragments of its greatness , lawyers lie like maggots in nuts .
1	" I was alluding , <NAME> , " said <NAME> , " to a stranger who entered into conversation with me in the street as I came to the <NAME> .
1	The firm was known as <NAME> and <NAME> .
1	There was a draped doorway , but no door ; and as he stopped here , looking in unseen , he felt a pang .
1	Then he approached the window with dignity ; looking on at <NAME> ' s news exactly as he had looked on at the dinners in that very room .
1	O dear , good , compassionate sir , for the truth ! " " A -- a matter of business .
1	What are you stopping for ? " said I .
1	So , leaving word with the shopman on what day I was wanted at <NAME> 's again , I set off on the four-mile walk to our forge ; pondering , as I went along , on all I had seen , and deeply revolving that I was a common laboring-boy ; that my hands were coarse ; that my boots were thick ; that I had fallen into a despicable habit of calling knaves <NAME> ; that I was much more ignorant than I had considered myself last night , and generally that I was in a low-lived bad way .
1	And so I worked at home and did cleaning and nursing and washing for a long time before I began to go out .
1	You wonder for a long time how she goes on , for there seems to be nobody in charge of her ; and when another of these dull machines comes splashing by , you feel quite indignant with it , as a sullen cumbrous , ungraceful , unshiplike leviathan : quite forgetting that the vessel you are on board of , is its very counterpart .
1	'Now , boy , tell us what 's the matter : do n't be afraid . '
1	' I remember there were poles pushed out of upper windows on which clothes were drying , and I remember a low public-house , and the sound flowing down a narrow passage belonging to it of the scraping of a fiddle and the shuffling of feet .
1	You came down here , sir , to expose the treachery and falsehood of an individual on whose truth and honour you had placed implicit reliance -- eh ? ' Here <NAME> indulged in a prolonged sneer ; and taking off his green spectacles -- which he probably found superfluous in his fit of jealousy -- rolled his little eyes about , in a manner frightful to behold .
1	I do n't mean constant to <NAME> , for I love her dearly -- better and better every day -- but constant to myself .
1	But it was generally said that <NAME> was a woman of system with children ; and no doubt she was .
1	So he told it , and <NAME> was as much moved as amazed , and the dear fellow and I were not the worse friends for the long concealment .
1	Here ' s a burial volume , just the thing !
1	She tried to recall the way they had come , and to look in the direction where the fire by which they had slept last night was burning .
1	But I am never fatigued .
1	What do you mean , boy ? ' ' I ' ll explain to you , then , ' said the gentleman , after another and a dismal pause , ' why you wouldn ' t paper a room with representations of horses .
1	Meanwhile , and pending the arrangement of the proceedings , and a fair division of the speechifying , the public in the large room were eyeing , by turns , the empty platform , and the ladies in the <NAME> .
1	' <NAME> see to the drag ven you go downhill .
1	At his particular request , I appointed to call for him at the Castle at half past eight on Monday morning , and so we parted for the time .
1	A deaf serving-woman and the light porter completed Mrs. Sparsit ' s empire .
1	" But knows a quantity , I suppose ?
1	' What can I do for you , sir ? ' ' You can shake hands with me , <NAME> , if you please , ' said I , putting out my own .
1	' I say ? ' ' Well ? ' ' Are you going to come here regular ? ' ' No , ' rejoined <NAME> , shaking her head , ' I ' m going away again to-night .
1	In a by-yard , there was a wilderness of empty casks , which had a certain sour remembrance of better days lingering about them ; but it was too sour to be accepted as a sample of the beer that was gone , -- and in this respect I remember those recluses as being like most others .
1	' I don ' t know. ' ' Any intelligence of him ? ' asks the Major .
1	' It is an old prerogative of kings to govern everything but their passions .
1	Not that he spared her , or was fearful of her being spent by watching and fatigue ; he was not more troubled on that score than he had usually been .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , as I have already said , was grey-headed , and florid : I should have said all about him , in saying so , had not his head been curiously bowed -- not by age ; it reminded me of one of <NAME> ' s boys ' heads after a beating -- and his grey eyes prominent and large , with a strange kind of watery brightness in them that made me , in combination with his vacant manner , his submission to my aunt , and his childish delight when she praised him , suspect him of being a little mad ; though , if he were mad , how he came to be there puzzled me extremely .
1	<NAME> looked to such men as his good friend to do such things .
1	Knitted , in her own stitches and her own symbols , it will always be as plain to her as the sun .
1	He had a great admiration for bright eyes , and sweet faces , and pretty legs and feet ; in short , he was fond of the whole sex .
1	Could any less idea shed the light already dawning on your early grave , or give birth to the softened sorrow that is springing into life beneath this rain of tears ! ' ' My dear child , ' said <NAME> , who held it as a duty incumbent on her , to improve the occasion , ' when you are as old as I am -- ' ' <NAME> will be the prime of life , ' observed <NAME> .
1	I should be happy , myself , to propose two months -- three -- an indefinite period , in fact -- but I have a partner .
1	Under the forcing system , a young gentleman usually took leave of his spirits in three weeks .
1	' Would it be such hopeless work ?
1	He will never forget that at <NAME> ' s he first saw <NAME> .
1	I can remember , when I was a very little girl indeed , I used to say to my doll when we were alone together , " Now , <NAME> , I am not clever , you know very well , and you must be patient with me , like a dear ! "
1	" And I ai n't took back to Tom-all-Alone 's .
1	He has not returned , sir. ' ' No ? ' said <NAME> , heating some rum in a little saucepan , and watching it to prevent its boiling over .
1	' Bleeding Heart Yard ? ' said <NAME> , with a puff and a snort .
1	Mr Witherden the notary , too , regarded him with a friendly eye ; and even Mr Chuckster would sometimes condescend to give him a slight nod , or to honour him with that peculiar form of recognition which is called ' taking a sight , ' or to favour him with some other salute combining pleasantry with patronage .
1	She went up to the house , keeping within the shrubbery , and went round it , peeping between the leaves at the lower windows .
1	As to the divine <NAME> herself , she rubbed her hands as men of business do , and took a few turns up and down the office with her pen behind her ear .
1	I wish <NAME> was not so arbitrary , I wish it was not so exacting -- Bird , be quiet ! ' The parrot had given a most piercing shriek , as if its name were <NAME> and it asserted its right to its exactions .
1	" So it is , so it is , " returned my guardian hurriedly .
1	Throw it in the fire ! ' <NAME> did as she was bidden , and waited for the next .
1	Everything sloped the wrong way : which in itself was an aggravation scarcely to be borne .
1	If you ' ll show me <NAME> ' s room I ' ll step up myself. ' ' What name , <NAME> ? ' said the waiter .
1	And now , to be defied and spurned , to be held up to her in the worst and most repulsive colours , to know that she was taught to hate and despise him : to feel that there was infection in his touch , and taint in his companionship -- to know all this , and to know that the mover of it all was that same boyish poor relation who had twitted him in their very first interview , and openly bearded and braved him since , wrought his quiet and stealthy malignity to such a pitch , that there was scarcely anything he would not have hazarded to gratify it , if he could have seen his way to some immediate retaliation .
1	They resumed their journey ; and certainly the prospect before them was by no means encouraging .
1	As <NAME> knew enough of the place to know that he was required to remain in the Lodge a certain time , he took a seat in a corner , and feigned to be occupied with the perusal of letters from his pocket .
1	Clapping her hands with pleasure and running on before me for a short distance , my little acquaintance stopped at a door and remaining on the step till I came up knocked at it when I joined her .
1	Why , I remember the time when old Maunders as had three-and-twenty wans -- I remember the time when old Maunders had in his cottage in <NAME> Fields in the winter time , when the season was over , eight male and female dwarfs setting down to dinner every day , who was waited on by eight old giants in green coats , red smalls , blue cotton stockings , and high-lows : and there was one dwarf as had grown elderly and wicious who whenever his giant wasn ' t quick enough to please him , used to stick pins in his legs , not being able to reach up any higher .
1	I am a widower with three daughters -- <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> -- and my desire is so to discharge the duties of life as to leave them a good name .
1	Of morning , noon , and sunset ; night , and the rising of an early moon .
1	' It ' s no use knocking , coachman .
1	said the Jew , when they had regained the passage .
1	'And I for his falsehood with my head ! '
1	Mrs <NAME> and <NAME> were driven to their own lodgings ; Mr <NAME> was graciously invited by <NAME> to return thither with Mr Dombey and the Major , in the evening , to hear some of <NAME> ' s music ; and the three gentlemen repaired to their hotel to dinner .
1	He crossed by <NAME> ' s and went down , at a long angle , almost to the water ' s edge , through some of the crooked and descending streets which lie ( and lay more crookedly and closely then ) between the river and <NAME> .
1	The mistake is mine , no doubt , sir. ' ' If you should see him first -- ' said I .
1	I never did take anything from any one .
1	The <NAME> stepped back in this emergency , with more agility than could have been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude ; and , seizing up the pot , prepared to hurl it at his assailant 's head .
1	<NAME> and <NAME> had been in a bad thing with a rich lady some years afore , and they 'd made a pot of money by it ; but <NAME> betted and gamed , and he 'd have run through the king 's taxes .
1	As much as to say , " <NAME> , we remember your existence when you are not here to remind us of it by your presence .
1	' Providence is against him , no doubt , ' replied <NAME> , scratching his nose .
1	The horror-stricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his ears , and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro , like one distracted .
1	What do you mean by leaving a man in this state , three weeks and more , you false-hearted wagabond ? '
1	It ' s the best of old worlds !
1	' You never mean it ! ' ' Mean what , <NAME> dear ? ' ' Well !
1	Then <NAME> would appear , and the man would retire .
1	You feared that I should be beforehand with you .
1	Oliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared , and pondered , with a trembling heart , on the words he had just heard .
1	He was a <NAME> , or something of that sort , if I am not mistaken .
1	It is better to be torn to pieces at a spring , than to be a mouse at the caprice of such a cat. ' He looked at her so hard with those eyes too near together that the sinister sight of each , crossing that of the other , seemed to make the bridge of his hooked nose crooked .
1	' Why , as to <NAME> , you see , ' returned Mr Boffin , with his hand still to his chin , ' the odds are that <NAME> and me may never go upon the water .
1	' Very , ' said <NAME> , with his mouth full .
1	I ' ve been here before. ' ' Did you Leave anything when you were here before ? ' asked <NAME> , with a view to principal and interest .
1	Up came the sun to find him washed and brushed , methodically dressed in decent black coat and waistcoat , decent formal black tie , and pepper-and-salt pantaloons , with his decent silver watch in its pocket , and its decent hair-guard round his neck : a scholastic huntsman clad for the field , with his fresh pack yelping and barking around him .
1	Slowly , therefore , and in a quiet tone of voice , he explained them as best he could , and enlarged on the nature of <NAME> ' s service .
1	'More like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg-grater , ' suggested <NAME> .
1	Constable , my good fellow , we had better be going. ' ' What ! ' shrieked <NAME> .
1	After which , he walked home , whistling .
1	Mrs. <NAME> was a majestic female in a pink gauze turban and a light brown wig .
1	But still , when that day and many other days were gone and past , it seemed that <NAME> took no heed whatever of the Major , and thought nothing at all about him .
1	'Bayton , ' said the undertaker , looking from the scrap of paper to <NAME> .
1	When I had made this discovery , I went back , in an attraction I could not resist , to a lane by Mrs. <NAME> ' s , and looked over the corner of the garden wall .
1	<NAME> , " he went on , in the tone of one who really was looking over a hand at cards : " Sheep of the prisons , emissary of <NAME> committees , now turnkey , now prisoner , always spy and secret informer , so much the more valuable here for being <NAME> that an Englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a <NAME> , represents himself to his employers under a false name .
1	Now , from the days when it was always summer in <NAME> , to these days when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes , the world of a man has invariably gone one way -- <NAME> 's way -- the way of the love of a woman .
1	Looking in , I saw a lighted candle on a table , a bench , and a mattress on a truckle bedstead .
1	You will please consider me your guardian .
1	Every one had a friendly nod and a kind word for " poor Mrs. <NAME> " ; and sometimes , when she stopped to exchange a few words with a neighbour at the conclusion of the service in the little row of elm-trees which leads to the church porch , or lingered behind to gaze with a mother ' s pride and fondness upon her healthy boy , as he sported before her with some little companions , her careworn face would lighten up with an expression of heartfelt gratitude ; and she would look , if not cheerful and happy , at least tranquil and contented .
1	He is a most extraordinary old chap , sir .
1	The bare walls had been coloured green , evidently by an unskilled hand , and were poorly decorated with a few prints .
1	She ' s well to do now , and a widow .
1	My <NAME> 's lips move , but they utter nothing .
1	' Now then ! -- is that chaise coming out to-night ? ' cried <NAME> .
1	The enchanting <NAME> leaves a card .
1	Have you seen how anxious the old man is to get on -- always wanting to be furder away -- furder away .
1	Such are the changes which a few years bring about , and so do things pass away , like a tale that is told !
1	'You should , indeed , ' replied <NAME> .
1	The best work and the worst , the plainest and the richest , the stateliest and the least imposing -- both of <NAME> ' s work and <NAME> ' s -- all found one common level here , and told one common tale .
1	The town is clean and pretty , and of course is ' going to be ' much larger .
1	I would rather you didn ' t. ' ' Demmit , <NAME> , can ' t you -- ' began <NAME> .
1	Who takes the smallest notice of me ?
1	' Yes. ' ' Yes what ? ' said the inexorable Wegg : ' I won ' t take yes .
1	<NAME> care of the birdcage in my hand , will you ? ' ' Thinks of a birdcage , afore me ! ' cried the old woman , apostrophizing the ceiling .
1	' Let me see the names , ' replied <NAME> , impatiently extending his hand for the bills .
1	If she had died without this happiness -- and she is an old woman now and ca n't look to live very long -- she would have blessed him with her last breath , if she had had her senses , as her beloved son <NAME> .
1	I dined with him yesterday. " " This is an authority to him to pay you that money , to lay out at your irresponsible discretion for your friend .
1	treat him kindly , <NAME> for my sake ! '
1	What do you think of my being , at the present moment , under special orders to squeeze you dry on Monday ? ' The reply was given in a murmur of ' Shame ! ' and ' <NAME> ! ' ' <NAME> ? ' snorted <NAME> .
1	A very remarkable way , <NAME> , of acquiring a knowledge of men and things. ' ' I mention it , sir , ' <NAME> rejoins , with unspeakable complacency , ' because , as I say , it don ' t do to boast of what you are ; but show how you came to be it , and then you prove it. ' ' Most interesting .
1	' Very well , then , ' said the old man ; ' make his bed .
1	At this early hour many sickly girls , whose business , like that of the poor worm , is to produce , with patient toil , the finery that bedecks the thoughtless and luxurious , traverse our streets , making towards the scene of their daily labour , and catching , as if by stealth , in their hurried walk , the only gasp of wholesome air and glimpse of sunlight which cheer their monotonous existence during the long train of hours that make a working day .
1	You are in a counting-house , you know , and you look about you. " It struck me as a singular implication that you could n't be out of a counting-house , you know , and look about you ; but I silently deferred to his experience .
1	He took the youngest child on his arm , where she was willing enough to be carried .
1	If you are sure of that , on good consideration , send <NAME> to me this night week -- 'for the letter . '
1	What line are you in ?
1	" Why am I confined alone ? " " How do I know ! " " I can buy pen , ink , and paper ? " " Such are not my orders .
1	' And now , ' said <NAME> , ' concerning <NAME> ' As <NAME> , with his chin tucked in and lips pouting , reclined in <NAME> ' s lap , concentrating his blue eyes on the visitors and shading them from observation with a dimpled arm , old <NAME> took one of his fresh fat hands in her withered right , and fell to gently beating it on her withered left .
1	<NAME> me. ' As <NAME> progressed in his explanation , <NAME> ' s countenance grew more and more dignified .
1	" Never have a mission , my dear child . "
1	The latter part of the proposal is so directly to the purpose that <NAME> says with emotion , " <NAME> , my trump , your fist ! "
1	The iron gentleman makes an iron bow .
1	I can ' t be drowned. ' ' I can be ! ' returned <NAME> , in a desperate , clenched voice .
1	<NAME> <NAME> found that his three companions had risen , and were waiting his arrival to commence breakfast , which was ready laid in tempting display .
1	' Well , well , ' said brother <NAME> , ' go into that room , my dear -- that door yonder -- and see if there ' s not a letter for you from her .
1	I adopted her , to be loved .
1	Your feet are not wet ?
1	In which a <NAME> is holden 13 .
1	The law had been her nurse .
1	" In short , <NAME> , " he says , " Jew as you are , you never laid such snares as I 'll contrive for my young brother , <NAME> . " '
1	' Oh my own pretty darling sweet <NAME> ! ' cried the <NAME> , running into <NAME> ' s room , ' to think that it should come to this and I should find you here my own dear dove with nobody to wait upon you and no home to call your own but never never will I go away again <NAME> for though I may not gather moss I ' m not a rolling stone nor is my heart a stone or else it wouldn ' t bust as it is busting now oh dear oh dear ! ' Pouring out these words , without the faintest indication of a stop , of any sort , <NAME> , on her knees beside her mistress , hugged her close .
1	I never see such a naughty boy in all my days ! ' ' You have been fighting for a bird ! ' exclaimed his mother .
1	How much of the practice I have just reduced to precept , I owe to <NAME> , I will not repeat here .
1	<NAME> or reality , he had no voice , nor had he power to stir .
1	It was a run indeed now , and what <NAME> called , in the only two words he spoke all the time , " a Winder. " Down banks and up banks , and over gates , and splashing into dikes , and breaking among coarse rushes : no man cared where he went .
1	After an hour or so of this travelling , we came to a rough wooden hut and a landing-place .
1	Going out early in life and marrying late , as his father had done before him , he too begat a lean and anxious-minded son , who in his turn , going out early in life and marrying late , became the father of <NAME> and <NAME> , twins .
1	His voice was rich and mellow and he had so long been thoroughly persuaded of the weight and import to mankind of any word he said that his words really had come to sound as if there were something in them .
1	' <NAME> , ' said the Major , defiantly , ' I know better ; a man of your mark -- the <NAME> of commerce -- is not to be interrupted .
1	Softened sounds and hum of traffic pass it and flow on irregularly into the lonely Precincts ; but very little else goes by , save violent rushes of wind .
1	<NAME> , however , that the projected dinner at home was put off , <NAME> thought it likely that she would go out in the evening to fulfil the engagement she had spoken of ; and resolved to try and meet her , then , upon the staircase .
1	The beadle , though generally understood in the neighbourhood to be a ridiculous institution , is not without a certain popularity for the moment , if it were only as a man who is going to see the body .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , dearest , about young Fledgeby. ' ' Oh no , don ' t !
1	And when the day came on , which must remove her in her earthly shape from earthly eyes for ever , he led him away , that he might not know when she was taken from him .
1	Because you have got a daughter .
1	My walking-stick is also to be seen on application to the chaplain of the <NAME> of <NAME> , who is strictly forbidden to take any money for showing it .
1	Now , there was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this woman , and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it <NAME> principally rested his case .
1	' You -- you -- are not particularly attached to it , I dare say , ' said <NAME> , trembling with anxiety .
1	Her very step was different and new to him , Mr <NAME> thought , as his eyes followed her to the door .
1	Then he thought how the long streets were dotted with lamps , and how the peaceful stars were shining overhead .
1	' Ve thought ve should ha ' been obliged to strait-veskit him last night ; he ' s been a-ravin ' all day ; and he says if he can ' t see you afore to-morrow night ' s over , he vishes he may be somethin ' unpleasanted if he don ' t drownd hisself. ' ' Oh , no , no , <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> , clasping her hands .
1	I am afraid , ' she added , her momentary composure forsaking her , ' I am afraid I may not have said , strongly enough , how deeply I felt such disinterested love , and how earnestly I prayed for his future happiness .
1	If that 's not the boy , sir , who had the orange , and threw this bit of peel upon the staircase , I 'll eat my head , and his too . '
1	I feel as if I do ; I know that , " says <NAME> with a very genuine shudder .
1	' Yours , sir , I ' m sure , ' replied Mr Abel mildly .
1	' That was judicious , ' remarked <NAME> ; ' and what else ? ' ' I fretted and fumed all next day , and raised a great disturbance , ' rejoined the old gentleman .
1	He read with young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a living tongue spoken all over the world , and he cultivated a taste for its stores of knowledge and fancy .
1	To whom could it belong ?
1	I suppose I would sell mine , if I could get enough for it. ' And so she would come round again to the war with herself .
1	By the time he had handed it back , and its beautiful wearer had put it on again ( which she did with perfect composure and indifference ) , the lodger returned with the show and showmen at his heels , and a strong addition to the body of spectators .
1	In this , too , there is perhaps more dandyism at <NAME> than the brilliant and distinguished circle will find good for itself in the long run .
1	" My dear friend , I am afraid he will , " returns the old man , looking up at him like a pygmy .
1	Any amount of singular look for me , but not a double look !
1	" O dear me ! " said I , as if I found myself compelled to give up Biddy in despair .
1	Tired of walking , repulsed and pushed about , stunned by the noise and confusion , anxious for her brother and the nurses , terrified by what she had undergone , and the prospect of encountering her angry father in such an altered state ; perplexed and frightened alike by what had passed , and what was passing , and what was yet before her ; <NAME> went upon her weary way with tearful eyes , and once or twice could not help stopping to ease her bursting heart by crying bitterly .
1	'He is the master of this establishment ; his death will cause a wacancy ; that wacancy must be filled up .
1	I don ' t like red noses .
1	In satisfying himself , however , Mr <NAME> was not regardless of the younger branches about him , who , although they had made their own evening repast , were on the look-out for irregular morsels , as possessing a relish .
1	My aunt mused a little while , and then said : ' Mr .
1	The stranger had left his hat in Mr Witherden ' s room , and seemed to have established himself in this short interval on quite a friendly footing .
1	" What 's _he_ got to do with the case ? " asked the man he had spoken with .
1	I don ' t know what harm I may have brought about , but , great or little , I did it for you , <NAME> .
1	He stopped on hearing some one at the locks and bolts and did not resume until the door had been opened and was shut again .
1	' Why , sister <NAME> , sister <NAME> , what do you see from the turret ? ' said <NAME> , rallying her .
1	" Where what is left among us of deportment , " he added , " still lingers .
1	One old man says at the fountain , that his right hand , armed with the knife , will be burnt off before his face ; that , into wounds which will be made in his arms , his breast , and his legs , there will be poured boiling oil , melted lead , hot resin , wax , and sulphur ; finally , that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses .
1	' When you leave work of a night , between this and your going away , just hang about the <NAME> an hour or so , will you ?
1	It ' s so nonsensical ! ' ' My love , ' said I , ' I have work to do. ' ' But don ' t do it ! ' returned <NAME> .
1	But I also know what <NAME> is .
1	<NAME> mak ' st me humbly wishfo ' to be more like thee , and fearfo ' to lose thee when this life is ower , and a ' the muddle cleared awa ' .
1	He is wretched , I have no doubt ; but he is nothing to me .
1	' Humph ! ' said <NAME> , pausing at the door .
1	Therefore I hinted to Peggotty that she would find <NAME> much recovered from the shock of <NAME> ' s decease ; and indeed he came in like a bridegroom .
1	' You ' re the only person that ' s kind to me , Goodwin. ' At this affecting appeal , <NAME> got up a little domestic tragedy of her own , and shed tears copiously .
1	<NAME> sat upon the other side of me , next to <NAME> , to whom we imparted the whole history of the engagement as soon as we got back .
1	' Why what bloodshot , draggled , dishevelled spectacle is this ! ' cried Mortimer .
1	I carried coffee , <NAME> , for a long time .
1	I had never been told where it was .
1	You are a young man that I should like to put in the witness-box , to humanise the minds of the legal profession .
1	When all was snug , and the shop-door fastened , he said to the perspiring <NAME> : ' I suppose , Mr Wegg , we may now produce the paper ? ' ' <NAME> on a minute , sir , ' replied that discreet character ; ' hold on a minute .
1	said <NAME> , anxiously bringing a chair towards my table .
1	If <NAME> had been like anybody else , I might have had some little musical knowledge to begin upon .
1	' It ain ' t many that comes into a poor place , that deems it worth their while to move their hats , ' said <NAME> .
1	' I want a boy , and he mus n't be a big 'un .
1	Terms , twenty guineas per annum .
1	' And what , ' said <NAME> , looking at the confusion about him , ' what do you mean by moving the goods ? ' ' That I have bought ' em , <NAME> , ' rejoined <NAME> .
1	Could we walk , my friends , without strength ?
1	<NAME> <NAME> ! ' was the only reply .
1	The afternoon wore away , however , and he did not appear .
1	This done , and <NAME> having satisfied his appetite ( <NAME> could eat nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow ) , the two men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap .
1	The indescribable interest with which I strained my eyes , as the first patches of <NAME> soil peeped like molehills from the green sea , and followed them , as they swelled , by slow and almost imperceptible degrees , into a continuous line of coast , can hardly be exaggerated .
1	" A quarter past , " said <NAME> , counting .
1	<NAME> was in my room in the morning before I was up , to bring me that reproachful shaving-water , and to put out my clothes .
1	His walk is as erect , his bearing is as stiff as ever it has been .
1	<NAME> and her baby sister were so exactly alike , and so completely one , that in our thoughts we have never been able to separate them since .
1	Two half-quartern brans ; pound of best fresh ; piece of double Glo'ster ; and , to wind up all , some of the richest sort you ever lushed ! '
1	' Thank you , dear <NAME> ! ' said I .
1	I have never swerved from my purpose for a moment ' s space ; but if I had , one thought of her uncomplaining , suffering look , as she drooped away , or of the starving face of our innocent child , would have nerved me to my task .
1	I say to them , What else are you made for ?
1	' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , before whom Mrs General instantly loomed , ' no , I thank you .
1	" Nothing yet. " " What 's coming on ? " " The <NAME> case. " " The quartering one , eh ? " " Ah ! " returned the man , with a relish ; " he 'll be drawn on a hurdle to be half hanged , and then he 'll be taken down and sliced before his own face , and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on , and then his head will be chopped off , and he 'll be cut into quarters .
1	If I consulted merely my own interests with <NAME> , I should not be here .
1	The windows of the chamber where he lay , I darkened last .
1	" I might as well ask you , " said <NAME> , " how you manage ? " " No ; because when I come in from the forge of a night , any one can see me turning to at it .
1	Here , he was searched , that he might not have about him the means of anticipating the law ; this ceremony performed , they led him to one of the condemned cells , and left him there -- alone .
1	She shaded it , after this change , with her hands ; and when she arose , and with an affectionate embrace bade <NAME> good-night , went quickly , and without looking round .
1	The mild <NAME> could not possibly bear malice at such a time , if at any time .
1	Between you and me , I think there is some danger of my being just enough soured not to be able to do that. ' ' To do what ? ' asked <NAME> .
1	Having made up his mind on this important point , he circulated the glass ( from his right hand to left , and back again ) pretty freely , to enable him to act his part with the greater discretion , and then , after making some slight improvements in his toilet , bent his steps towards the spot hallowed by the fair object of his meditations .
1	Our residence at <NAME> , and our local connexion , will , no doubt , enable him to take advantage of any vacancy that may arise in the <NAME> corps. ' On looking at <NAME> Micawber again , I saw that he had a certain expression of face , as if his voice were behind his eyebrows ; where it presently appeared to be , on his singing us ( as an alternative between that and bed ) ' The Wood-Pecker tapping ' .
1	When she had conveyed it to her bosom , Mr <NAME> had the appearance of feeling relieved , and breathing more freely , as not having been quite certain that the hundred pounds were his , until the note had been safely transferred out of Mr <NAME> ' s keeping into his own <NAME> ' s .
1	I have heard that Mrs. <NAME> was understood to suffer great mortification from her daughter 's ignoble marriage and pursuits , but I hope she got over it in time .
1	I never was so happy ; in all my life I never was ! ' The worthy soul hid her face in her handkerchief , and sobbed aloud ; for it was the first opportunity she had had of unburdening her heart , and it would have its way .
1	I sat down by his side in silence .
1	And I can not bear to think , ' cried <NAME> , covering her tears with her hands , ' I can not bear to think that you of all the world should see him in his only moments of degradation. ' ' Pray , ' said <NAME> , ' do not be so distressed .
1	" No , my love , " said he .
1	Guess. ' ' I am not good at guessing anything. ' ' She did .
1	She once or twice fell into children 's company when she was about ten years old , but the children could n't get on with <NAME> , and <NAME> could n't get on with them .
1	' The truth is , <NAME> , my life , ' I said ; ' I have been trying to be wise. ' ' And to make me wise too , ' said <NAME> , timidly .
1	" Cos , " says Jo with a perplexed stare but without being at all shaken in his certainty , " cos that there 's the wale , the bonnet , and the gownd .
1	' Ye-es , ' said the other , turning full upon him .
1	Ma can do it. ' ' At any rate , my love , ' said <NAME> , soothingly , ' that ' s over. ' ' Yes , it ' s over , ' returned <NAME> , ' but there ' s nothing gained by that .
1	The store of creature comforts was not the chief part of the visitor ' s reception .
1	" He was put there , " says Jo , holding to the bars and looking in .
1	<NAME> , <NAME> ! ' ' Get along with you , you wretch , ' said the hand-maiden , obviously not ill-pleased with the compliment , however .
1	' What more could you do ! ' sneered Quilp , ' couldn ' t you have done something less ?
1	I fancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this , and a purpose of always holding her in suspense .
1	It 's a monomania with him to think he is possessed of documents .
1	' <NAME> , does it ? ' said <NAME> .
1	Its effect was precisely what a more experienced observer would have foreseen .
1	' Wa ' at I say , I stick by. ' ' And that ' s a fine thing to do , and manly too , ' said <NAME> , ' though it ' s not exactly what we understand by " coming <NAME> over us " in <NAME> .
1	To this favour , <NAME> immediately replied , with his respectful compliments , that he would have the honour of waiting on the <NAME> , at the time appointed ; accompanied , in accordance with their kind permission , by his friend <NAME> of the <NAME> .
1	' You are putting it on yourself , father , and getting into all this injury of your own accord ! ' said the young gentleman morosely .
1	'Why , the gentleman 's got him , ' replied the officer .
1	he asked aloud , winking at us and pointing at her as she turned away , affecting to sweep the grate .
1	said the Jew , seizing the Dodger tightly by the collar , and threatening him with horrid imprecations .
1	Once for all ; I loved her none the less because I knew it , and it had no more influence in restraining me than if I had devoutly believed her to be human perfection .
1	Above all , I found that the most professing men were the greatest objects of interest ; and that their conceit , their vanity , their want of excitement , and their love of deception ( which many of them possessed to an almost incredible extent , as their histories showed ) , all prompted to these professions , and were all gratified by them .
1	The furniture was not the same , and the figure in the chair was not himself .
1	Give me a week. ' ' One week , ' said <NAME> , turning to his companion , ' from today .
1	This preliminary proceeding laying bare his head , the expert lady , clasping him tightly round the throat with one hand , inflicted a shower of blows ( dealt with singular vigour and dexterity ) upon it with the other .
1	The kinchin lay will be a fortune to you . '
1	If the room to which my bed was removed were a sentient thing that could give evidence , I might appeal to it at this day -- who sleeps there now , I wonder ! -- to bear witness for me what a heavy heart I carried to it .
1	<NAME> Leicester feels it incumbent on him to observe a crushing aspect towards <NAME> because it is whispered abroad that these necessary expenses will , in some two hundred election petitions , be unpleasantly connected with the word bribery , and because some graceless jokers have consequently suggested the omission from the <NAME> service of the ordinary supplication in behalf of the <NAME> of <NAME> and have recommended instead that the prayers of the congregation be requested for six hundred and fifty-eight gentlemen in a very unhealthy state .
1	It reflects disgrace on no one living , except you who use it .
1	He seemed to feel that as long as <NAME> could make no discovery without his knowledge , he was so far safe .
1	<NAME> and I both laughed , but not so loud .
1	Hence the concession , and hence the appearance of <NAME> , piloted in by the man , man .
1	The wine being by this time poured out , <NAME> drank to Mrs. Perker and the children , and <NAME> to <NAME> .
1	<NAME> ' t talk like that , <NAME> , if you please. ' ' I won ' t talk at all , ' said <NAME> , with an action of her crooked fingers that made him shrink into half his natural compass in the corner .
1	The clerk and clergyman then appearing , we were ranged in order at those fatal rails .
1	Did you observe his excited eye , <NAME> ? ' ' <NAME> , Sir. ' ' I haven ' t touched a drop of spirits this morning , ' said the man , who was as sober a fellow as need be .
1	" Do n't lose your temper as well as your money , " says <NAME> , calmly knocking the ashes out of his pipe .
1	'It wrings my heart to hear you ! '
1	O Miss Manette , when the little picture of a happy father 's face looks up in yours , when you see your own bright beauty springing up anew at your feet , think now and then that there is a man who would give his life , to keep a life you love beside you ! " He said , " Farewell ! " said a last " God bless you ! " and left her .
1	In addition to these establishments , there are in <NAME> , excellent hospitals and schools , literary institutions and libraries ; an admirable fire department ( as indeed it should be , having constant practice ) , and charities of every sort and kind .
1	' It ' s the contemplation of this sort of thing , that makes me deplore my fate in being a bachelor .
1	' I have taken the measure of the two women that died last night , <NAME> , ' said the undertaker .
1	Oh , the solemn woods over which the light and shadow travelled swiftly , as if heavenly wings were sweeping on benignant errands through the summer air ; the smooth green slopes , the glittering water , the garden where the flowers were so symmetrically arranged in clusters of the richest colours , how beautiful they looked !
1	'And mind you do n't poison it , ' said <NAME> , laying his hat upon the table .
1	Can I not recall you -- forgive me again ! -- to a better course ?
1	She had flung herself heavily upon the couch , and with her head drooping over the cushion , and her face hidden in her hands , seemed to be still weeping in an agony of shame and grief .
1	<NAME> was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near the <NAME> in their lives , in the realisation of this fancy , and they were roughly hustled and maltreated .
1	But there being now an appearance of a temporary calm , in which the proceedings of little Wackford could scarcely fail to be observed , he feigned to be aware of the circumstance for the first time , and inflicted upon the face of that young gentleman a slap that made the very tea-cups ring .
1	If you are going to throw away a hundred guineas or so , I am as poor as a poor relation of great people usually is , and I shall be very much obliged to you , if you ' ll throw them away upon me .
1	' Not very well , dear Mr Boffin ; I have fluttered myself by being -- perhaps foolishly -- uneasy and anxious .
1	' The young lady might think herself well off , ' she observed , ' to have such a beau .
1	To this , Mrs. Nickleby only replied that she durst say she was very stupid , indeed she had no doubt she was , for her own children almost as much as told her so , every day of her life ; to be sure she was a little older than they , and perhaps some foolish people might think she ought reasonably to know best .
1	It was a cross-country road , full , after the first three or four miles , of holes and cart-ruts , which , being covered by the snow , were so many pitfalls to the trembling horses , and obliged them to keep a footpace .
1	When they were alone again , the <NAME> insisted on her eating a slice of dry toast , and drinking a glass of spiced negus ( which he made to perfection ) ; and , encouraging her with every kind word and inconsequential quotation he could possibly think of , led her upstairs to her bedroom .
1	So entirely had it lost the life and resonance of the human voice , that it affected the senses like a once beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain .
1	Mr <NAME> , I drink yours .
1	Resisting all entreaties to stay till he came back , and finding it quite impossible to engage <NAME> in any intelligible conversation on the subject nearest his heart , or indeed on any other , <NAME> took his departure , and returned to the Bush .
1	And you needn ' t nudge him , Mr <NAME> , for I know your work begins early tomorrow , and I say the same to you .
1	Mr Carker , who was quite prepared for a cold reception , wrote upon a card that he must take the liberty of pressing for an interview , and that he would not be so bold as to do so , for the second time ( this he underlined ) , if he were not equally sure of the occasion being sufficient for his justification .
1	I hope they may never come to hear of it .
1	" Would any one believe this ? "
1	I want to say a word to you. ' He raised himself a little in his low bed , as she kneeled beside it to bring her face near him ; and put his hand between hers .
1	' <NAME> , my dear friend , I am very sorry to see you here. ' ' I am very sorry to be here , sir , ' said <NAME> ; ' but your conduct , <NAME> , has rendered this deputation from your constituents imperatively necessary. ' ' My conduct , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , looking round upon the deputation with gracious magnanimity -- ' my conduct has been , and ever will be , regulated by a sincere regard for the true and real interests of this great and happy country .
1	' So you vouldn ' t subscribe to the flannel veskits ? ' said <NAME> , after another interval of smoking .
1	Among her pre-matrimonial transactions with <NAME> ' s father , <NAME> ' s mother had raised money of him at a great disadvantage on a certain reversionary interest .
1	He suffered for this on several occasions ; and particularly once , when <NAME> laughed in church , and the <NAME> thought it was <NAME> , and took him out .
1	Though I never knew what they were ( being in <NAME> ) , further than that they were highly eulogistic of the lineage of <NAME> ap-Kerrig .
1	' Compliments. ' ' Love ! ' repeated <NAME> , with a little stamp of her foot .
1	This unhappy boy , <NAME> , has been the occasion of much domestic trouble and uneasiness ; both during the lifetime of my late dear wife , and since .
1	It made a great impression on me , and I remembered it a long time afterwards ; as I shall have occasion to narrate when the time comes .
1	Where dogs would howl to lie , women , and men , and boys slink off to sleep , forcing the dislodged rats to move away in quest of better lodgings .
1	Whether there was , or not , we must leave the reader to determine , when we have faithfully recorded the behaviour of the individual in question .
1	As he gathers himself up again into an upright position , or into a position as nearly upright as he ever maintains , he is again conscious of being watched by his companion .
1	Where are my friends ? ' ' You ain ' t got no friends .
1	" Twice before , " says <NAME> .
1	" No letter that can possibly have been overlooked ? "
1	However , it ' s soon set right .
1	<NAME> would have stopped him too , and indignantly ordered him to speak openly or not at all , but that he said , in a low Voice -- ' <NAME> -- the young lady who has just left the room -- ' <NAME> suffered him to proceed .
1	' She goes on errands as well as any one. ' <NAME> laughed .
1	A chorus of bystanders took up the shout of <NAME> ' s praise , shook their heads sagely , and unanimously cried , ' Very ! ' As the enthusiasm in <NAME> Smorltork ' s favour ran very high , his praises might have been sung until the end of the festivities , if the four something-ean singers had not ranged themselves in front of a small apple-tree , to look picturesque , and commenced singing their national songs , which appeared by no means difficult of execution , inasmuch as the grand secret seemed to be , that three of the something-ean singers should grunt , while the fourth howled .
1	We shall meet at dinner-time .
1	Ai n't the lady the t'other lady ? "
1	'Stand still , a minute , ' cried the voice ; ' I 'll be with you directly . '
1	He remembered how he used to look up into her pale face ; and how her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she gazed upon his features -- tears which fell hot upon his forehead as she stooped to kiss him , and made him weep too , although he little knew then what bitter tears hers were .
1	It was a very lame pretence on both sides ; the lamer , because we both went into the coffee-room , where he had just finished his breakfast , and where I ordered mine .
1	That he was afraid he took a rash step in doing anything for the boy , and one that might expose him to the censure of the prudent ; but that he did it of himself and for himself , and risked the consequences single-handed ; and that his mother ' s past connexion with Mr <NAME> ' s family had nothing to do with it , and that Mr <NAME> had nothing to do with it , but that he , Mr Carker , was the be-all and the end-all of this business .
1	At which astounding intelligence , <NAME> clasped her hands , fell into a tremble , and shed tears of sympathy and pleasure , like the good-natured creature she really was .
1	" My dear doctor , " said I to <NAME> , in this very room , the very last time he came .
1	Was he to be told that , he wished to know again , by his own son on his own hearth , to his own face ?
1	Even in this temple of good intentions , an exceptionally sharp boy exceptionally determined to learn , could learn something , and , having learned it , could impart it much better than the teachers ; as being more knowing than they , and not at the disadvantage in which they stood towards the shrewder pupils .
1	To have been out in such a wind , and not to have known it was blowing !
1	What a strange rest and pause in my life there seems to be -- and in all life , within doors and without -- when I sit in the quiet , shaded , orderly room , with the blue eyes of my child-wife turned towards me , and her little fingers twining round my hand !
1	But they ' re <NAME> metal. ' ' The silver will be the brighter when it comes , ' said I .
1	I congratulate you on your feathers .
1	<NAME> and still eastward through the stale streets he takes his way , until he reaches his destination : a miserable court , specially miserable among many such .
1	The craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together , and restored the usual hand to his mouth .
1	He points it , however , by no deviation from his straightforward manner of speech , though in saying it he turns towards that part of the dim room where my Lady sits .
1	<NAME> <NAME> had arrived on the wheels just now alluded to , and came running into the room in a breathless condition .
1	' There , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> ; ' and let me tell you , at the same time , to show you how much out of temper I was , that if I had gone away without another word , it would have made no difference respecting that pound or two which I shall leave among your children when I die. ' ' Morleena <NAME> , ' cried her mother , in a torrent of affection .
1	He was a miserable wretch , but her word was more than a law for him .
1	To your husband , poor wretch , this was well enough -- ' ' Why , if , ' she said , surveying him with a haughty contempt and disgust , that he shrunk under , let him brave it as he would , ' if all my other reasons for despising him could have been blown away like feathers , his having you for his counsellor and favourite , would have almost been enough to hold their place. ' ' Is that a reason why you have run away with me ? ' he asked her , tauntingly .
1	" Then he 's as good as gold , " said the little creature -- Oh , in such a motherly , womanly way !
1	" She has no daughter of her own , has she ? "
1	His social existence had been more like that of an early <NAME> , than an innocent child of the nineteenth century .
1	Therefore , on the removal of the cloth , the <NAME> developed himself as a choice spirit in the broader and more comprehensive range of narrating regimental stories , and cracking regimental jokes , which he did with such prodigal exuberance , that <NAME> was ( or feigned to be ) quite exhausted with laughter and admiration : while Mr <NAME> looked on over his starched cravat , like the <NAME> ' s proprietor , or like a stately showman who was glad to see his bear dancing well .
1	<NAME> walked forth , elated with the scene ; and all was brightness and splendour .
1	'You do n't mean to go yourself , I suppose ? '
1	About five-and-twenty boys were studiously engaged at their books when we went in , but they rose to give the Doctor good morning , and remained standing when they saw <NAME> and me .
1	<NAME> at <NAME> and <NAME> !
1	<NAME> looked from his wine glass at <NAME> and at Mr Lammle ; but mightn ' t , couldn ' t , shouldn ' t , wouldn ' t , look at <NAME> .
1	' Oh the joy of -- ' ' Be rational , sir , pray , ' said <NAME> .
1	He has the power to render us happy or unhappy ; to make our service light or burdensome ; a pleasure or a toil .
1	'You know that <NAME> is worse to-night , my fascinator ? '
1	There are many by-streets , almost as neutral in clean colours , and positive in dirty ones , as by-streets in <NAME> ; and there is one quarter , commonly called the Five Points , which , in respect of filth and wretchedness , may be safely backed against <NAME> , or any other part of famed St. <NAME> ' s .
1	During the time of my illness , we were still in <NAME> , where Mrs. <NAME> had come , on my guardian 's invitation , to stay with us .
1	' <NAME> is rather vulgar , my dear .
1	You must not return to us any more .
1	' Now , <NAME> , ' said the <NAME> , so sharply rapping the table to bespeak his attention as <NAME> turned the leaves of her book , that she started ; ' where were we ? ' ' You were saying , sir , ' returned the Secretary , with an air of some reluctance and a glance towards those others who were present , ' that you considered the time had come for fixing my salary. ' ' Don ' t be above calling it wages , man , ' said Mr Boffin , testily .
1	' <NAME> , ' said Mr Feeder , in a low reproachful voice , ' take some water. ' The <NAME> , looking very stern , made a pause until the water was brought , and then resumed : ' And when , Mr Feeder -- ' But Mr Feeder , who saw that <NAME> must break out again , and who knew that the Doctor would never come to a period before the young gentlemen until he had finished all he meant to say , couldn ' t keep his eye off <NAME> ; and thus was caught in the fact of not looking at the <NAME> , who consequently stopped .
1	Meanwhile the chaise proceeded , without any slackening of pace , towards the conclusion of the stage .
1	She takes advantage of them , and makes them wait upon her , in a manner that she knows she could not exact of others ; and in various ways shows her Saxon blood .
1	For as she looked , she saw him murdering that fond idea to which she had held in spite of him .
1	Dismissed ! ' said <NAME> , giving <NAME> his hand before lightly waving it , as if he waved the whole subject away .
1	The debilitated cousin , more debilitated by the dreariness of the place , gets into a fearful state of depression , groaning under penitential sofa-pillows in his gunless hours and protesting that such fernal old jail 's -- nough t'sew fler up -- frever .
1	He inquired particularly after Mr Merdle .
1	Is there no old banker , no old business , no old servant , no old time , rising in your mind , <NAME> ? " As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly , by turns , at <NAME> and at <NAME> , some long obliterated marks of an actively intent intelligence in the middle of the forehead , gradually forced themselves through the black mist that had fallen on him .
1	she added in the same breath , laughing as he laughed .
1	Her hand , for a moment , left the velvet chair to bring a knife within her reach upon the table ; then she stood as she had stood before .
1	<NAME> and water I alwayth take. ' He had already called for a glass , and now called for another .
1	That he was a muscular man , strong on his legs , and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to weather .
1	She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me , I thought , if she saw me frightened ; and she would have no fair reason .
1	I wish you well and happy ! " As I put my glass to my lips , he glanced with surprise at the end of his neckerchief , dropping from his mouth when he opened it , and stretched out his hand .
1	' Ye-es , if I can , ' returned the other , promptly .
1	" Is this a cut ? " said <NAME> .
1	' No better yet ? ' inquired <NAME> .
1	Not a little more magnificence , therefore , on the part of <NAME> .
1	Mrs. Pardiggle accordingly rose and made a little vortex in the confined room from which the pipe itself very narrowly escaped .
1	It would be such a hard surprise. ' ' I don ' t see it at all , ' blustered <NAME> .
1	' Forgive ME ! ' For there were tears in her eyes , and they were prettier in his sight ( though they smote him on the heart rather reproachfully too ) than any other glitter in the world .
1	The school reopened next day .
1	He only requires to be understood .
1	" <NAME> mentioned , " pursued <NAME> , addressing himself again to my guardian , " mentioned to the housekeeper , who , as he may have observed , is an old and attached retainer of the family -- " ( " That is , when I walked through the house the other day , on the occasion of my going down to visit <NAME> and <NAME> , " <NAME> airily explained to us . )
1	What should I gain by that , and how much should I lose ! ' <NAME> ' s expressive little eyebrows remonstrated with the fire for some short time before she rejoined : ' <NAME> ' t think that I press you , <NAME> ; but wouldn ' t you gain in peace , and hope , and even in freedom ?
1	I merely said that you were paying a hackney coach .
1	Do n't be afraid of it . "
1	The idea of your coming down the Lane yourself !
1	They are numerous , my stock of human warious is large , the shop is pretty well crammed , and I don ' t just now want any more trophies of my art .
1	He made the most dismal sounds I have ever heard produced by any means , natural or artificial .
1	' I know you ' ll be sorry afterwards .
1	I hope I have learnt how to accommodate myself to the changes of life .
1	" That they are what they are , do not blame me ! "
1	Looking about him while in this state of suspense , <NAME> observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and patriots , the latter far outnumbering the former ; and that while ingress into the city for peasants ' carts bringing in supplies , and for similar traffic and traffickers , was easy enough , egress , even for the homeliest people , was very difficult .
1	' Did I look well in snuff-colour ?
1	now I ' m off. ' ' I hope you are , ' said <NAME> to himself .
1	I chose it as a conspicuous part of the house .
1	Thus , a wounded prince or bandit chief , who is bleeding to death and too faint to move , except to the softest music ( and then only upon his hands and knees ) , shall be seen to approach a cottage door for aid in such a series of writhings and twistings , and with such curlings up of the legs , and such rollings over and over , and such gettings up and tumblings down again , as could never be achieved save by a very strong man skilled in posture-making .
1	Good-night ! ' Still covering her face , she sobbed , and answered ' Good-night , dear <NAME> , ' and silently ascended .
1	Come and see. ' He went on again , and <NAME> accompanied him .
1	We all drew nearer to the cages , feigning to examine the birds .
1	' Next ( to clear the ground before coming to business ) , you ' ve placed in this yard a skulking , a sneaking , and a sniffing , menial. ' ' He hadn ' t a cold in his head when I sent him here , ' said Mr Boffin .
1	" She 's gone forrard to the Police Office , " returns <NAME> .
1	<NAME> <NAME> tripped up the steps to the house-door , tripped down the steps with the key , tripped across the little garden , and opened the gate .
1	Forty year ago , you had only to let down the bucket till the first knot in the rope was free of the windlass , and you heard it splashing in the cold dull water .
1	My Uncle ' s child made people ' s blood run cold , some times , she did ! ' ' <NAME> ? ' asked <NAME> .
1	I had to preside , too , over the entertainment , consisting of a dish of fish , a roast fowl , a sweetbread , vegetables , pudding , and <NAME> ; and it was so pleasant to see how she enjoyed it , and with what state and ceremony she did honour to it , that I was soon thinking of nothing else .
1	I have undertaken then to let you know that—in short , that <NAME> has informed me that he has long watched your progress with particular interest and pleasure , and has long hoped that the time might ultimately arrive when he should offer you his hand in marriage .
1	' Well , <NAME> , what ' s the matter with you ? ' said <NAME> .
1	' Run on -- nothing to the hours , days , weeks , months , years , when we ' re united -- run on -- they ' ll fly on -- bolt -- mizzle -- steam-engine -- thousand- horse power -- nothing to it. ' ' Can ' t -- can ' t we be married before to-morrow morning ? ' inquired <NAME> .
1	And <NAME> , seeing all these things as they developed themselves , could not but wonder , anxiously , into what back corner of the genteel establishment <NAME> ' s children would be poked by-and-by , and who would take care of those unborn little victims .
1	She had been struck with something blunt and heavy , on the head and spine ; after the blows were dealt , something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable violence , as she lay on her face .
1	He strengthens and invigorates a man , <NAME> , does <NAME> , in his moral nature. ' Mr <NAME> snapped at the expression .
1	The Beginning of a Longer Journey LII .
1	" I could n't make him hear , and I softly opened the door and looked in .
1	Excuse me if I recommend you not to chafe so much , not to be so impetuous , not to wear yourself out so .
1	The attitude was no less familiar to her than the tone of voice had been .
1	' I never thought you ' d get better .
1	He spoke of him , in short , not bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him , but as anybody might who saw him as he showed himself .
1	Then , he blessed me and stood waving his hand to me until I had passed the crook in the road ; and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge before I pursued my way home .
1	Mrs. Crewler couldn ' t see me before we left -- couldn ' t forgive me , then , for depriving her of her child -- but she is a good creature , and has done so since .
1	So fixed was his figure , that it would have been matter of some difficulty to bend him sufficiently to get him in the carriage-door , if he had not received the timely assistance of a maternal pull from within .
1	In the atmosphere of vague anxiety and dread that lowered about them in connexion with their fugitive brother , this sound , unusual there , became almost alarming .
1	<NAME> had been dozing ; but looked worse , and was more feverish than he had appeared yet .
1	' We had better , ' said this subordinate minister of justice , ' get to the office while there ' s a magistrate sitting .
1	I have been faithful to my post since the days of his <NAME> Highness the <NAME> , and I will not desert it now .
1	He believed that Mr <NAME> was disposed to entertain a ripe regard for him , and he knew that he had a sincere regard for Mr Meagles and his good wife .
1	I 've been negotiating with this gentleman on behalf of <NAME> , <NAME> , and one way and another I 've been in and out and about his premises a deal .
1	The lady was at the farther end of the room , and once she ventured to wave her hand , as if beseeching my uncle ' s assistance .
1	' But bless your hearts and eyebrows , all this sort of thing was nothing to my uncle !
1	The little citizen , not to be outdone , declared her to be a celestial witness .
1	' Things come about very strangely ! ' thought <NAME> , as he walked home .
1	<NAME> ' t stand staring at me , but do look sharp , will you ? ' Offering no further observation , <NAME> huddled on his clothes .
1	If your daughter is disposed to try after the situation , I ' ll take her there directly. ' ' Have you nothing to say to your uncle , my love ? ' inquired Mrs. Nickleby .
1	The sun came proudly up in all his majesty , the noble river ran its winding course , the leaves quivered and rustled in the air , the birds poured their cheerful songs from every tree , the short-lived butterfly fluttered its little wings ; all the light and life of day came on ; and , amidst it all , and pressing down the grass whose every blade bore twenty tiny lives , lay the dead man , with his stark and rigid face turned upwards to the sky .
1	A charming reflection sir , very charming ! ' While he addressed his clerk in these words , Mr <NAME> was , somewhat ostentatiously , engaged in minutely examining and holding up against the light a five-pound bank note , which he had brought in , in his hand .
1	If the thing were gone , my dear <NAME> , might not the fear go with it ?
1	To speak unreservedly to you , I do .
1	<NAME> care how you spend it , and do n't get yourself into trouble . "
1	He ran violently down the stairs , out into the street , and so past the window , without any hat , towards the quarter whence the sound proceeded -- bent , no doubt , upon securing the strangers ' services directly .
1	Then he too stood , with his doubled hand upon the table near it , waiting to be addressed .
1	' A schooner , from <NAME> or <NAME> , laden with fruit and wine .
1	Squeers was jealous of the influence which his man had so soon acquired , and his family hated him , and <NAME> paid for both .
1	I am talking of <NAME> as if she was a man-of-war .
1	There was but one consideration to set against the heavy loss of <NAME> , and though it was slight comfort to her burdened heart , she tried to think it some relief .
1	<NAME> there no other neck to clasp ; no other face to turn to ?
1	' Bustle ! ' said the old gentleman again , but the admonition was quite unnecessary , for one of the girls poured out the cherry brandy , and another brought in the towels , and one of the men suddenly seizing <NAME> by the leg , at imminent hazard of throwing him off his balance , brushed away at his boot till his corns were red-hot ; while the other shampooed <NAME> with a heavy clothes-brush , indulging , during the operation , in that hissing sound which hostlers are wont to produce when engaged in rubbing down a horse .
1	All ' s over. ' Therefore , the police sent for something to cover it , and it was covered and borne through the streets , the people falling away .
1	The sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and searching acid , it set my very teeth on edge .
1	' You see , my love , she ' s already quite contented and comfortable , and means to say goodbye to her sister <NAME> and her little pets , and her good honest husband , with a light heart and a smile ; don ' t she , my dear ? ' ' Oh yes ! ' cried <NAME> .
1	" Kit ' s coming to-morrow morning , I know .
1	' Why nat ' rally , ' said Mr Riderhood , ' ain ' t I always thirsty ! ' ( <NAME> at the absurdity of the question . )
1	' I have sent him a letter that I ' ll trouble him to attend to , or he and I will fall out , I can tell him ! ' ' Does he know where I am , aunt ? ' I inquired , alarmed .
1	' Yes , mother , ' returned Alice , stooping forward for a moment and kissing her , but endeavouring , even in the act , to disengage herself from her embrace .
1	My shoes were by this time in a woeful condition .
1	If you would empower me to do it , I would do it for you with the greatest satisfaction ! "
1	' I will , directly , sir , ' replied <NAME> : undoing the chain , and turning the key .
1	To <NAME> and <NAME> , and into <NAME> .
1	" I have seen it done very often in my time , <NAME> , between more people than I should like to mention to you ; but it never came to anything after all. " ' " You must have seen some queer things , " said <NAME> , with an inquisitive look .
1	This was addressed to <NAME> , who now made his appearance ; that gentleman , motioning <NAME> to retire , brought in the two ladies , and shut the door .
1	His anxiety , his eagerness , and affliction at this pass are pitiable to behold .
1	' I am delighted to hear it .
1	Did you think that I was long gone ? ' It is as the face of a woman , shaded by a quantity of rich dark hair .
1	<NAME> <NAME> was some time absent , and , when he came back , showed that he had been outside by bringing with him fresh butter in a cabbage leaf , some thin slices of boiled ham in another cabbage leaf , and a little basket of water-cresses and salad herbs .
1	The <NAME> being very cold , he set off for a brisk trot after service ; the trot to end in a charge at his favourite fragment of ruin , which was to be carried by storm , without a pause for breath .
1	" Lor ! " I says , " I ' ll think of something else -- something comfortable -- and put it out of my head. " So I thought of the new house and <NAME> , and was thinking at a great rate with that sheet there in my hand , when all of a sudden , the faces seemed to be hidden in among the folds of it and I let it drop. ' As it still lay on the floor where it had fallen , Mr <NAME> picked it up and laid it on the chest .
1	' We are older than we were , I see , ' said my aunt .
1	I know too much about it , sir .
1	Whatever the old girl says , do -- do it ! "
1	I have come to ask if you would let me stay with you ? ' ' Why should you stay with me ?
1	Now , hear me , my dears !
1	This grew so strong with me , that I resolved to go back to the yard before I took my dinner , and ask the boat-builder if he thought his attempting to return by sea at all likely ?
1	She stands looking at him as he writes on , all unconscious , and only her fluttering hands give utterance to her emotions .
1	Many of them came out to look after him , and to observe to one another , with great unctuousness , that he was ' pulled down by it. ' Mrs Plornish and her father stood at the top of the steps at their own end , much depressed and shaking their heads .
1	Now , a tall church spire appeared in view , which presently became a tree , a barn , a shadow on the ground , thrown on it by their own bright lamps .
1	'Do you live in <NAME> ? '
1	The rooms were low and damp , the clammy walls were pierced with chinks and holes , the rotten floors had sunk from their level , the very beams started from their places and warned the timid stranger from their neighbourhood .
1	Such appearances are common to many vehicles belonging to , and maintained by , old ladies of economic habits ; and in this vehicle sat an old lady who was its mistress and proprietor .
1	Mr Pitt in a nightcap and bedgown , and without his boots , represented the poet <NAME> with perfect exactness ; and <NAME> of <NAME> in a dark wig , white shirt-collar , and male attire , was such a complete image of <NAME> that the young ladies quite screamed when they saw it .
1	She prayed him to forgive her , before my Agnes came into this world .
1	At length they arrived at the large stone .
1	But all these sights were of short duration , being speedily broken up by coffee , and the desertion of the room .
1	Quickening their pace , they turned up a road upon the left hand .
1	Yielding by degrees to the influence of the exciting liquid , rendered more so by the heat , <NAME> expressed a strong desire to recollect a song which he had heard in his infancy , and the attempt proving abortive , sought to stimulate his memory with more glasses of punch , which appeared to have quite a contrary effect ; for , from forgetting the words of the song , he began to forget how to articulate any words at all ; and finally , after rising to his legs to address the company in an eloquent speech , he fell into the barrow , and fast asleep , simultaneously .
1	' I believe , father , ' said <NAME> , ' he will not come back to town to-night. ' <NAME> turned away , and said no more .
1	His man looked back pretty often as he went , but got no hint of him .
1	thieves ! ' shrieked the usurer , starting up and folding his book to his breast .
1	But , next day , he resumed the subject by saying in his off-hand manner and with a slighting laugh , ' Well , <NAME> , when shall we go to this Maecenas of yours ?
1	'Not too strong , ' replied <NAME> , with a delicate cough .
1	' If you please , ma ' am , ' I began .
1	' Can you drive ? ' said the fat boy .
1	' And there really is no hurry , you know , ' said <NAME> in a lower voice .
1	' What insupportable creature is this , coming in ? ' said <NAME> , ' I can not hear it .
1	The poor girl was sitting on the floor where they had laid her down .
1	' I have now said all I have to say : except that this young couple parted , firmly , though not without tears and sorrow , on the evening when you last saw them together. ' <NAME> heard a terrible shriek , and saw no ghastly figure , sitting or standing ; saw nothing but a heap of torn and miry clothes upon the floor .
1	It is remarkable that what we call the world , which is so very credulous in what professes to be true , is most incredulous in what professes to be imaginary ; and that , while , every day in real life , it will allow in one man no blemishes , and in another no virtues , it will seldom admit a very strongly-marked character , either good or bad , in a fictitious narrative , to be within the limits of probability .
1	' And poor <NAME> , perhaps , my dear ? ' suggested R. W. ' Pardon me , ' said <NAME> , ' no ! ' It was one of the worthy woman ' s specialities that she had an amazing power of gratifying her splenetic or worldly-minded humours by extolling her own family : which she thus proceeded , in the present case , to do .
1	' I think I have caught it now , ' said <NAME> .
1	As the day declined into the afternoon , and the air , which had been at intervals clear enough to allow the <NAME> coast to be seen , became again charged with mist and vapour , <NAME> 's thoughts seemed to cloud too .
1	I am more important to my sister than he thinks .
1	The childish feet of long ago , did not tread such enchanted ground as theirs do now .
1	As he looked at the fire , I thought I saw a cunning expression , followed by a half-laugh , come into his face .
1	There were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into the street , who were evidently anxious to speak with him ; but there was something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled his presence , that they gave it up for that day .
1	How long this scene might have lasted , or how much <NAME> might have suffered , no one can tell , had not a carriage , which was driving swiftly by , suddenly pulled up , from whence there descended old <NAME> and <NAME> , the former of whom , in far less time than it takes to write it , if not to read it , had made his way to <NAME> ' s side , and placed him in the vehicle , just as the latter had concluded the third and last round of a single combat with the town-beadle .
1	' <NAME> , aunt ! ' I seriously believe it had never once entered my head for a single moment , to consider whether she was or not .
1	She ' ll drop down the river with that theer tide .
1	Having something more than a suspicion of the object of the gentleman ' s visit , <NAME> preceded him to the <NAME> and <NAME> , and , turning sharp round , planted himself in the centre of the doorway .
1	When I came back , she was dying ; and all the blood in my heart has dried up , for they starved her to death .
1	But this is the custom : for if the law were to bind down a free and independent citizen to keep his word with the public , what would become of the liberty of the subject ?
1	I must see him to-night , for I faithfully promised to do so .
1	" Yes , we thought you 'd come to us this morning , but we turned out early and left <NAME> , the best of boys , to mind his sisters and came to you instead -- as you see !
1	' I am sure I thought it was the boy , or I would n't have meddled with him .
1	' And you see , <NAME> , ' he added , dropping his voice , ' how powerful money is , and how anxious people are to get it .
1	<NAME> , and thin , and pallid , he awoke at last from what seemed to have been a long and troubled dream .
1	Likewise you 're a oncommon scholar. " " No , I am ignorant and backward , Joe. " " Why , see what a letter you wrote last night !
1	I yield. ' <NAME> was at once overwhelmed with blushes and expressions of gratitude , of which latter commodity neither <NAME> nor Mrs. <NAME> was by any means sparing .
1	Neither was his manner influenced .
1	Not in the least likely .
1	How can I ever thank you ?
1	You speak as if he had threatened you in some dark way. ' ' He has never spoken to me about—that .
1	The truth is , my dear <NAME> , " <NAME> glanced at the distant <NAME> , and lowered his voice , " you can have no conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted , and of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved .
1	What would be the consequence ?
1	' That ' s cheering ! ' ' I have only one difficulty , aunt. ' ' Say what it is , <NAME> , ' she returned .
1	I ask , for information. ' ' My dear <NAME> , I wish I ever had ! ' ' Then you have not ?
1	She is never to blame in any such instance .
1	" You said on that occasion , " I recommenced , " that you might possibly have the means of advancing my interests and promoting my fortunes by making discoveries of which I should be the subject .
1	It is falling still ; upon the roof , upon the skylight , even through the skylight , and drip , drip , drip , with the regularity of the <NAME> 's <NAME> , on the stone floor below .
1	I walked up to where he was sitting , and said , ' How do you do , <NAME> ? ' He was greatly fluttered by this unexpected address from a stranger , and replied , in his slow way , ' I thank you , sir , you are very good .
1	'Do you think this respectful or proper conduct , Mrs. Mann , ' inquired <NAME> , grasping his cane , 'to keep the parish officers a waiting at your garden-gate , when they come here upon porochial business with the porochial orphans ?
1	The villainy , however , which could first borrow money of his faithful follower , and then abbreviate his name to ' <NAME> , ' was more than he could patiently bear .
1	<NAME> wonder than these , when a bottle-nosed person in a glazed hat had after some considerable hesitation ordered another glass of gin and water of the attendant potboy , and when <NAME> , instead of sending it , appeared in person , saying , ' Captain Joey , you have had as much as will do you good , ' not only did the captain feebly rub his knees and contemplate the fire without offering a word of protest , but the rest of the company murmured , ' Ay , ay , <NAME> !
1	'Bless her , she 's going off ! '
1	' <NAME> ' t you find <NAME> blooming , sir ?
1	May I hold the pens ? ' The remembrance of her pretty joy when I said yes , brings tears into my eyes .
1	' Well , <NAME> , ' said the buxom female , ' I ' m sure I only spoke to you out of kindness. ' ' <NAME> likely , mum , ' replied <NAME> .
1	Mr <NAME> projected a life of holidays from that time forth ; for , as he regularly informed <NAME> every day , it was his ' last half ' at <NAME> Blimber ' s , and he was going to begin to come into his property directly .
1	At one time , she was all cordiality and ease ; at another , all stiffness and frigidity .
1	When she had entered two or three laborious items in the account-book , <NAME> would walk over the page , wagging his tail , and smear them all out .
1	' Wicked one ! ' ' You have been here before , if I am not mistaken ? ' said Mr Dombey .
1	I confess that we were so unpopular with the outrageous mob , that I only got away from <NAME> at the risk of being ducked to death , and that <NAME> was so ferreted up and down , that he never would have got away at all but for that sham .
1	But its sound had revived a long train of miserable <NAME> , and the procession would not stop with the bell , but continued to march on .
1	Among the trees and not far from the residence he pointed out the spire of the little church of which he had spoken .
1	After <NAME> had fixed a day for his departure to <NAME> , these symptoms increased ; and it became evident that something was in progress which affected the peace of the young lady , and of somebody else besides .
1	' <NAME> ' had taken her down into <NAME> for a wedding trip , and there she had seen my aunt , too ; and both my aunt and <NAME> were well , and they had all talked of nothing but me .
1	If there must be such a shadow anywhere , I would keep it for the future in my own breast .
1	I thought she would have come round again before this , but she hasn ' t been here. ' ' About <NAME> -- ' said <NAME> .
1	' Your way lies there , sir , ' said <NAME> , in a suppressed voice , that some devil might have owned with pride .
1	And having caught some inkling of our story , the young people about us -- as young as you and I are now , <NAME> -- may come to us for sympathy , and pour distresses which hope and inexperience could scarcely feel enough for , into the compassionate ears of the old bachelor brother and his maiden sister. ' Kate smiled through her tears as <NAME> drew this picture ; but they were not tears of sorrow , although they continued to fall when he had ceased to speak .
1	I have seen enough of you to know that you are a bully and coward .
1	It was as well that he did so ; for although the <NAME> was not gone long , he was gone much longer than he had proposed .
1	The public-houses by the wayside , from being empty and noiseless as those in the remoter parts had been , now sent out boisterous shouts and clouds of smoke ; and , from the misty windows , clusters of broad red faces looked down upon the road .
1	I am sure you don ' t. ' ' I do , ' returned the old woman .
1	While these , and many other encomiums , were being passed on the accomplished <NAME> , that young lady made the best of her way to the police-office ; whither , notwithstanding a little natural timidity consequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected , she arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards .
1	He never opened it without occasion .
1	he exclaimed , " I fear you more than any spectre I have seen .
1	<NAME> <NAME> gave him good day .
1	' I am sure we are very much obliged to him , ' observed Mrs. Nickleby .
1	That young man hears the words I speak .
1	' <NAME> , sir ! ' replied the young lady sharply , smiling though as she turned aside , and biting her lip , ( whereat Mrs. <NAME> , who was still standing on the stairs , glanced at her with disdain , and called to her husband to come away ) .
1	The woman sits beside him , very attentive to the pipe , which is all the while at his lips .
1	Such an idle thing should be repeated , with my glad consent , fifty times a day , to save you a moment ' s heart-ache , <NAME> Dorrit. ' She had taken courage now , and answered , far more in her usual manner , ' You are so good !
1	cried <NAME> , holding up his hands .
1	The frozen particles of ice , brushed from the blades of grass by the wind , and borne across my face ; the hard clatter of the horse ' s hoofs , beating a tune upon the ground ; the stiff-tilled soil ; the snowdrift , lightly eddying in the chalk-pit as the breeze ruffled it ; the smoking team with the waggon of old hay , stopping to breathe on the hill-top , and shaking their bells musically ; the whitened slopes and sweeps of Down-land lying against the dark sky , as if they were drawn on a huge slate !
1	' <NAME> of <NAME> is not to be plundered and nobody suspected .
1	' He is not being educated anywhere .
1	' Wot a game it is ! ' said the elder <NAME> , with a chuckle .
1	I won her through a rash vow .
1	' I don ' t mind it at all .
1	' Did I always say that that ' ere blessed child was the most interesting I ever see ?
1	But , being what he was -- and is , I hope -- I can ' t believe it. ' ' Wal ' r , my lad , ' inquired the <NAME> , wistfully eyeing him as he pondered and pondered , ' what do you make of it , then ? ' ' <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , ' I don ' t know what to make of it .
1	I replaced the razor in its usual drawer , unfastened the door , and called loudly for assistance .
1	His personal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod , and in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both hands , and then tightening the post-office , and putting his hands in his pockets .
1	I couldn ' t , <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> .
1	There ' s nothing lost , neither , by one ' s being here ; because the boys ' money comes in just the same as if I was at home , and Mrs. Squeers she keeps them in order .
1	I was a listening. ' ' Was you , indeed ? ' said Mr Wegg , dubiously .
1	As if it were <NAME> , the hero of the ballad , and Mr Venus were the sparrow with his bow and arrow , and Mr Wegg were the fly with his little eye .
1	' I knew you would admire my brother .
1	Take me away ! ' With one swift turn of her lithe figures <NAME> laid the little beauty on a sofa , as if she had never caught her up .
1	<NAME> pound a week -- it ' s too cheap , <NAME> .
1	It looked very comfortable indeed .
1	<NAME> is a sort of distant connexion of mine -- it doesn ' t matter how ; I needn ' t enter into that .
1	He thought , if this man could be raised up now , what would be his foremost thoughts ?
1	All things in it are of the past .
1	' Oh , yes , it ' s all right , ' replied Mrs. Crummles , anticipating the question .
1	" Tell her how it was . "
1	But all he could do was to comfort and console her by kind words ; and words they were of such love and kindness , and cheerful encouragement , that poor <NAME> threw her arms about his neck , and declared she would weep no more .
1	Here ' s your health , sir. ' ' Hold hard there , ' interposed the mottled-faced gentleman , with sudden energy ; ' your eyes on me , gen ' l ' m ' n ! ' Saying this , the mottled-faced gentleman rose , as did the other gentlemen .
1	First he thought of his friends , and wondered when they would join him ; then his mind reverted to Mrs. <NAME> ; and from that lady it wandered , by a natural process , to the dingy counting-house of <NAME> & <NAME> .
1	<NAME> ' t you knock her cap off , or her tooth out , or scratch her , or do something or other to her ? ' asked <NAME> .
1	She hurried out to meet him ; and little Bob in his comforter -- he had need of it , poor fellow -- came in .
1	'Amen to that , my child ! '
1	Mrs Alfred <NAME> faced her lord .
1	When the shadow of the church-porch swallowed them up , victorious Gruff and <NAME> likewise presented himself to be swallowed up .
1	And I tell you what , <NAME> , if I hadn ' t more of these qualities that commonly endear man to man , than our articled clerk has , I ' d steal a <NAME> cheese , tie it round my neck , and drown myself .
1	In connection with the quaker <NAME> , there is a picture by <NAME> , which is exhibited for the benefit of the funds of the institution .
1	In the course of a couple of hours the noble Refrigerator , at no time less than a hundred years behind the period , got about five centuries in arrears , and delivered solemn political oracles appropriate to that epoch .
1	<NAME> , I had brought in all our hammers , one after another , but without avail .
1	'Just a leetle drop , with a little cold water , and a lump of sugar . '
1	He shook the snow from his hat and clothes , and brushed it away from his face , while I was inwardly making these remarks .
1	<NAME> ' t say , " Oh , <NAME> , <NAME> ! " That ' s childish .
1	Trembling in every joint , from cold and exhaustion , he made an effort to stand upright ; but , shuddering from head to foot , fell prostrate on the ground .
1	In the morning he was downhearted again , and would have sustained himself by giving me all the money he had in his possession , gold and silver too , if my aunt had not interposed , and limited the gift to five shillings , which , at his earnest petition , were afterwards increased to ten .
1	' What man , ' thought <NAME> proudly , while on his way , soon afterwards , to the brothers ' house , ' would not be sufficiently rewarded for any sacrifice of fortune by the possession of such a heart as <NAME> ' s , which , but that hearts weigh light , and gold and silver heavy , is beyond all praise ?
1	I imagined it would be a kind of company to have the boys , and the bedroom where I used to tell the stories , so near me : although the boys would know nothing of my being there , and the bedroom would yield me no shelter .
1	And so indeed it was , for the schoolmaster had ordered it to be put down , and it was getting on so well that the doctor might have smelt it if he had tried ; perhaps he did .
1	If <NAME> were in her worst , I intensified it .
1	' <NAME> and water-erily you mean , sir , ' he returned , with some little thickness of speech , in consequence of the Gum-Ticklers having tickled it .
1	This fact is interesting , as illustrating the secret connection and sympathy which always exist between great minds .
1	He ' s my brother. ' ' He ' s MY brother ! ' cried the preacher .
1	He says to the woman , " Miserable creature , what has he done ? "
1	This is the witness encountered by appointment , by me , <NAME> .
1	' Never mind , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , with dignity .
1	It had no variety but in depth .
1	I had recognized her with amazement , for <NAME> .
1	Though a young man , I have ferreted out evidence , got up cases , and seen lots of life .
1	Let me have a word with you . '
1	' With all my heart , ' said Mr Swiveller .
1	' I am sir , ' replied the landlord .
1	' We have only met each other once before , you know .
1	It must not be lost. ' He tapped at the cottage door .
1	It was yet early , and the old man being still asleep , she walked out into the churchyard , brushing the dew from the long grass with her feet , and often turning aside into places where it grew longer than in others , that she might not tread upon the graves .
1	But look where he will , he still beholds him close to the opposite houses , making his way with his wary hand from brick to brick and from door to door , and often , as he creeps along , glancing over at him watchfully .
1	In a later stage of the dinner : that is to say , when the <NAME> stood at the <NAME> ' s elbow ready to serve the first bottle of champagne : the <NAME> became still slyer .
1	Mrs <NAME> rang for candles as soon as the <NAME> had closed upon him .
1	' O ' course you air , ' said <NAME> argumentatively .
1	He lay , that night , at a cottage , where beds were let at a cheap rate to the more humble class of travellers ; and , rising betimes next morning , made his way before night to <NAME> .
1	This has not been broken very long .
1	She ' s extremely sorry to lose you , Mr <NAME> , but a sense of her duty to society reconciles her .
1	You ask yourself , how would all them ancestors of yours , away to <NAME> -- not to go beyond him at present -- have borne that blow ; you remember scores of them that would have borne it well ; and you bear it well on their accounts , and to maintain the family credit .
1	He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well as in the morning ?
1	Now let us walk the other way .
1	While it roared through the steeple of St <NAME> ' s <NAME> , and twirled all the cowls in the neighbourhood , it made a swoop to beat the <NAME> smoke into the jail ; and , plunging down the chimneys of the few early collegians who were yet lighting their fires , half suffocated them .
1	' I beg your pardon ! ' As he bent his head to Mr Dombey , with an air of deference that accorded ill with his words , though they were humbly spoken , he moved it round towards her , and kept his watching eyes that way .
1	The general aspect of the room recalled him to himself at once ; but he had no sooner cast his eye on the figure of a man who was brooding over the dusty fire , than , letting his hat fall on the floor , he stood perfectly fixed and immovable with astonishment .
1	The country through which the road meandered , was rich and beautiful ; the weather very fine ; and for many miles the <NAME> mountains , where <NAME> and the ghostly <NAME> played at ninepins one memorable gusty afternoon , towered in the blue distance , like stately clouds .
1	'What of the house , my man ; eh ? '
1	" Peace , my friends , " says <NAME> , rising and wiping the oily exudations from his reverend visage .
1	' I tell you , ' returned <NAME> boldly , ' that I don ' t know .
1	The man , after looking at me for a moment , turned me upside down , and emptied my pockets .
1	Thereupon all the young ladies rose and began shaking their skirts out behind .
1	' That was our light porter at the <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' who brought you the message to-night .
1	Come now , think of somethink else. ' To this encouragement , offered with the indulgent toleration of a wise and liberal expert , <NAME> would rejoin , reddening : ' Or , my dear , you might propose to the person of the house a duck. ' ' Well , <NAME> ! ' the <NAME> would exclaim ( still no word being spoken by <NAME> ) , ' you do surprise me when you speak of ducks !
1	' But it can ' t be helped , I ' ve done my duty , <NAME> , I have indeed .
1	' You will doubtless be surprised , my dear <NAME> , to receive this communication .
1	He sought to raise himself a little .
1	The figures in this boat were those of a strong man with ragged grizzled hair and a sun-browned face , and a dark girl of nineteen or twenty , sufficiently like him to be recognizable as his daughter .
1	" <NAME> , " says the <NAME> ' en , " will you take a observation round the shop. " " Well , " says the man , " I ' ve done. " " Do you see wot you want ? " says the <NAME> ' en " No , I don ' t , " says the man .
1	Would you not ? " " Truly , madame , I think so .
1	With her woful eyes , so haggard and wild , so heavy and large , she looked all round the room , and passed the corner where he slept in his chair .
1	These are the weapons of <NAME> .
1	I was never unmindful of <NAME> , and she never left that sanctuary in my thoughts -- if I may call it so -- where I had placed her from the first .
1	A very few <NAME> leagues of his journey were accomplished , when <NAME> began to perceive that for him along these country roads there was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen at <NAME> .
1	' <NAME> on , further on , darling , further away if we walk till midnight. ' ' There ' s a good barn hard by , master , ' said the man , ' or there ' s travellers ' lodging , I know , at the Plow an ' Harrer .
1	The setting sun was glowing on the strange lady , over the garden-fence , and she came walking up to the door with a fell rigidity of figure and composure of countenance that could have belonged to nobody else .
1	At length , he gave the matter up , as hopeless for that night , and suddenly breaking into a run as though to force himself away , scampered off at his utmost speed , nor once ventured to look behind him lest he should be tempted back again .
1	<NAME> was so near her when they shook hands , that he could see a small tiny tear , yet trembling on an eyelash .
1	So that 's disposed of , and we will talk of something else . "
1	But just as my first impulse had been to pity her , so was his .
1	' I am afraid , <NAME> , that his feelings have made him so indeed , ' said Mrs. Weller mournfully .
1	' I thought so , ' he observed .
1	He was pitched out of his gig once , and knocked , head first , against a milestone .
1	' This is not all the good-fortune .
1	Come both of you ! ' ' Come , <NAME> , ' said the little man .
1	<NAME> here , <NAME> ! ' <NAME> put her finger on her own lip , and then on Pa ' s , and then on her own lip again , and then on her husband ' s .
1	It may be something in the air -- there is plenty in it -- or it may be something in himself that is in fault ; but <NAME> , otherwise Jobling , is very ill at ease .
1	Even with those aids , I might not have come to myself as soon as I did , but that I saw <NAME> approaching with the keys , to let me out .
1	' Thank you , my lord , ' said Mr <NAME> ; ' thank you .
1	This is the offer you mentioned , sir ? ' ' Yes .
1	' Mr <NAME> , ' said Mr Dombey , ' will you take the bottom of the table , if you please ?
1	The carriage turned about , and drove on at its former speed .
1	He charged himself even with restraining <NAME> from improving his opportunity .
1	But you told me to prepare to be tried , and I prepared myself. ' He drew her to nestle closer to him , and told her it would soon be over , and the truth would soon appear .
1	Between the real landscape and its shadow in the water , there was no division ; both were so untroubled and clear , and , while so fraught with solemn mystery of life and death , so hopefully reassuring to the gazer ' s soothed heart , because so tenderly and mercifully beautiful .
1	A curious contagion of whispering was upon it , and also , when it gathered together at the fountain in the dark , another curious contagion of looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only .
1	' So misplaced , ' <NAME> went on , ' that I feel constantly apologetic towards him .
1	' He von ' t begin , sir , ' rejoined <NAME> ; ' he knows I ain ' t ekal to ex-pressin ' myself ven there ' s anythin ' partickler to be done , and yet he ' ll stand and see me a-settin ' here taking up your walable time , and makin ' a reg ' lar spectacle o ' myself , rayther than help me out vith a syllable .
1	As they were pretty certain of the road he must have taken , however , and kept on at a great pace , they came up with him , at the very moment when he had taken breath , and was breaking into a run again .
1	' <NAME> , madam ? ' ' And the dismal evening , and -- and everything , ' said <NAME> .
1	' " <NAME> were hid under the cushions and covers of the chairs " ' ; ( Here Mr <NAME> looked under himself on the settle . )
1	He observed the look and said , ' To my mother , of course .
1	' It ' s been chasing me all my life , but it shall never take me nor mine alive ! ' cried old Betty .
1	" Well , <NAME> , you know , " replied <NAME> , as if that were a little unreasonable , " you yourself see me put 'em in my 'at , and therefore you know as they are here. " With which he took them out , and gave them , not to <NAME> , but to me .
1	And you are in mourning too !
1	A short pause followed these consolatory remarks of <NAME> .
1	In the morning , too , when I felt weary , and should have enjoyed another hour ' s repose very much , it was a tiresome thing to be roused , like the <NAME> , and forced into a long story before the getting-up bell rang ; but <NAME> was resolute ; and as he explained to me , in return , my sums and exercises , and anything in my tasks that was too hard for me , I was no loser by the transaction .
1	How long have I been here ? " For , I had a strange and strong misgiving that I had been lying there a long time -- a day and a night , -- two days and nights , -- more .
1	It is not dark enough yet .
1	I would have a settlement out of somebody , by fair means or by foul .
1	' I told you this morning , ' said the old gentleman , laying his hand upon his brother ' s shoulder , ' that I came to you in mercy .
1	' The most extraordinary thing in the world , ' said <NAME> , saluting both ladies with the utmost cordiality ; ' the most extraordinary thing .
1	Go and sit down this instant ! " " Mamma dear , " lisped the little girl , " baby ood have put hith eyeth out. " " How dare you tell me so ? " retorted Mrs. Pocket .
1	' Are you always as busy as you are now ? ' ' Busier .
1	When I got nigh the place as I had been told of , I began to think within my own self , " What shall I do when I see her ? " ' The listening face , insensible to the inclement night , still drooped at the door , and the hands begged me -- prayed me -- not to cast it forth .
1	how , is , my , lit , tle , friend ? ' over and over and over again .
1	I saw the lots shortly afterwards in Kimber ' s lodgings—through the window—and I easily made out that there had been a sneaking pretence of lending them till better times .
1	The uncongenial oddity of its surroundings , with the two brass knobs of the iron safe of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> staring from a corner , like the eyes of some dull dragon , only made it the more delightful .
1	' Keep quiet , do , ' said <NAME> , ' there never vos such a old picter-card born .
1	I can ' t say. ' ' As you supposed he was at home , it would seem that he has just gone out ?
1	As I rode back in the lonely night , the wind going by me like a restless memory , I thought of this , and feared she was not happy .
1	He will be no worse off than he was , you know .
1	I recollect it was settled by general consent that <NAME> was quite a misrepresented country , and had nothing objectionable in it , but a tiger or two , and a little heat in the warm part of the day .
1	' Who sent it me ? ' ' Why , your friend , ' replied the man .
1	On our arrival in <NAME> , we had called with <NAME> at Mrs. <NAME> 's but had not been so fortunate as to find her at home .
1	' Now , don ' t allow yourself to be fatigued beyond your powers ; there ' s a amiable bein ' .
1	' I am , ' said the girl earnestly .
1	<NAME> had already got abroad that the little girl who used to show the wax-work , was the child of great people who had been stolen from her parents in infancy , and had only just been traced .
1	' You can if you like .
1	The whole party arrived in safety at the Bush before <NAME> had recovered his breath .
1	What he supposed , for example , <NAME> would do , if he and <NAME> ever should encounter ?
1	<NAME> <NAME> might have asked with <NAME> ' into my grave ? ' so chill and earthy was the place .
1	Why , <NAME> ' r <NAME> , you was but the heighth of the littlest of these , when I first see you !
1	' I remember its making you very uneasy , indeed. ' ' Ecod , you see <NAME> has a sharp eye , <NAME> ! ' cried Mr Boffin , shaking his head with an admiring air .
1	You might think me better employed in enrolling myself a member of your Society. ' ' Ay , indeed , sir ! ' retorted <NAME> , shaking his head in a threatening manner .
1	But Mr Carker rising to depart , she only thanked him with her mother ' s prayers and blessings ; thanks so rich when paid out of the Heart ' s mint , especially for any service Mr <NAME> had rendered , that he might have given back a large amount of change , and yet been overpaid .
1	The possession of two of these , is supposed to compensate for the absence of so much air and exercise as can be had in the dull strip attached to each of the others , in an hour ' s time every day ; and therefore every prisoner in this upper story has two cells , adjoining and communicating with , each other .
1	' Not at all , <NAME> , not at all , ' returned the other haughtily .
1	' Hurrah ! ' And then there was another roaring , like that of a whole menagerie when the elephant has rung the bell for the cold meat .
1	I heard the clocks strike twelve , and was still reading , without knowing what I read , when <NAME> touched me .
1	No man removed his hand from it now .
1	' Now , I pass to sick and deranged impressions ; they are so strong , that I rely upon them ; but there are spaces between them that I know nothing about , and they are not pervaded by any idea of time .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , walking with the stool under his arm at his father 's side along sunny and crowded Fleet-street , was a very different Young <NAME> from him of the previous night , running home through darkness and solitude from his grim pursuer .
1	' That is a black shadow to be following the girl , ' said <NAME> , standing still ; ' what does it mean ? ' He spoke in a low voice that sounded almost strange to <NAME> .
1	' I have seen the gentleman , ' replied <NAME> , scarcely able to articulate , 'the gentleman who was so good to me -- <NAME> , that we have so often talked about . '
1	Yet she could not help returning ; and her work would soon fall unheeded from her hands again .
1	Then endeavouring by every little artifice to prepare his mind for what must come , and dwelling with many fervent words upon the happy lot to which she had been removed , they told him , at last , the truth .
1	In vain did the eager <NAME> , and the enthusiastic <NAME> , do all that skill and experience could suggest , to regain the ground <NAME> had lost in the contest -- it was of no avail ; and in an early period of the winning game <NAME> gave in , and allowed the superior prowess of All-Muggleton .
1	When he is most proud and happy in her and her children , he will be most repentant of his own part in the dark vision of our married life .
1	Early as it was , on the windy March morning , the room in which he lay abed was already scrubbed throughout ; and between the cups and saucers arranged for breakfast , and the lumbering deal table , a very clean white cloth was spread .
1	And why on the sly ?
1	Thus equipped , he was to saunter into the office , as some country fellow from <NAME> market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his curiousity ; and as he was as awkward , ungainly , and raw-boned a fellow as need be , <NAME> had no fear but that he would look the part to perfection .
1	' I do n't know ; I really do n't know , ' said <NAME> , with a rueful countenance .
1	Nor was this all , for the elder <NAME> was going through a similar ceremony with <NAME> ; while <NAME> , with a very little second-hand camlet cloak , worn theatrically over his left shoulder , stood by , in the attitude of an attendant officer , waiting to convey the two victims to the scaffold .
1	' Of course ; that was to be expected .
1	My dear , for the moment -- true .
1	" Anything else ? " " I think I should like to go home. " " And never see her again , though she is so pretty ? " " I am not sure that I should n't like to see her again , but I should like to go home now. " " You shall go soon , " said <NAME> , aloud .
1	please ! ' cried <NAME> , with a kiss , ' don ' t be a naughty <NAME> !
1	" I wish , sir , " said <NAME> , " to leave a good name behind me .
1	We think we have hinted elsewhere , that <NAME> had a way of becoming sentimental after brandy .
1	There have been a meeting to-night where he have been spoken of in the same shameful way .
1	I haven ' t seen her for this many a week. ' ' How ' s that ? ' asked <NAME> .
1	One other quotation from the same Preface may serve to introduce a fact that my readers may think curious .
1	Doing charmingly. ' ' I am very happy and very thankful to know it , ' said the debtor , ' though I little thought once , that -- ' ' That a child would be born to you in a place like this ? ' said the doctor .
1	_I_ do n't want to intrude upon your secrets . '
1	<NAME> would find that his confidence in the <NAME> was not misplaced. ' <NAME> said no more , but looked on thoughtfully while they prepared the table for two persons , and set the wine upon it .
1	' Why should you ? ' It was impossible to say to that sweet little surprised face , otherwise than lightly and playfully , that we must work to live .
1	Perhaps we had better go to your place of residence .
1	Think of her ; think of all the sorrows and afflictions you have shared together ; of all the trials , and all the peaceful pleasures , you have jointly known. ' ' I do .
1	' My darling girl , ' she began again .
1	Which contains a brief Account of the <NAME> of the Action of <NAME> against Pickwick 27 .
1	' Wish you good-night , <NAME> , ' said Mrs. Craddock .
1	A constable , sir , if you please ! ' <NAME> stood as one entranced , with his eyes opened wide and fixed upon the ground , regardless alike of the tremulous hold which Mr <NAME> maintained on one side of his cravat , and of the firmer grasp of <NAME> upon the other ; although this latter detention was in itself no small inconvenience , as that fascinating woman , besides screwing her knuckles inconveniently into his throat from time to time , had fastened upon him in the first instance with so tight a grip that even in the disorder and distraction of his thoughts he could not divest himself of an uneasy sense of choking .
1	' As <NAME> ' ly ' s eyes -- which was heavy -- see this woman better , ' <NAME> went on , ' she know ' d as she was one of them as she had often talked to on the beach .
1	If it is any comfort to you to know what plans I may work out by keeping myself strictly respectable in the scale of society , these are the plans at present occurring to me .
1	The old man , looking up at the cages after another look at us , went through the list .
1	' Very good , ' said <NAME> , looking about : ' ve -- ry good .
1	Night after night he had risen from his bed of wretchedness at twelve or one o ' clock , and had sat at his window watching the sickly lamps in the yard , and looking upward for the first wan trace of day , hours before it was possible that the sky could show it to him .
1	said I. I always sat down on the other side of him .
1	How did you find me ?
1	Yes. ' ' He was a good ' un , ' said Mr Boffin , ' and he had a sister worthy of him .
1	I was thinking <NAME> seemed out of sorts. ' ' Me ! ' cried <NAME> , biting her lips , and trembling with very jealousy .
1	<NAME> , as pat as need be. ' Newman reflected for a few seconds , and then hurried away , muttering that he would be back directly .
1	I advised you to ; but no , it ' s not your way to take advice .
1	The perfect ease of manner with which he put the money up again and looked at me with a smile on his refined face , as if he had been mentioning a curious little fact about somebody else , almost made me feel as if he really had nothing to do with it .
1	I then proceeded to the object of my visit .
1	' Overtake him ; bring him back instantly !
1	" Guppy , " says <NAME> , " I will not deny it .
1	Which the playacting have likeways brought him to <NAME> along with me .
1	But it ' s so easy to hope not and think not , without the riches. ' ' Why don ' t you say , my darling -- instead of that phrase -- being poor ? ' he asked , looking earnestly at her .
1	There is a positive vulgarity in carrying your business affairs about with you as you do. ' ' How do I carry them about , <NAME> ? ' asked Mr Merdle .
1	' Well , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , thrusting his head out of the window .
1	<NAME> , indeed ! ' cried <NAME> , bridling up .
1	The houses have no owners ; they are broken open , and entered upon by those who have the courage ; and there they live , and there they die .
1	' You want some one ? ' said the lady in a stern manner .
1	If the fire will burn ( it _will_ sometimes ) we are pretty cheerful .
1	We shall have plenty of time. ' ' Capital ! ' said <NAME> .
1	I must give you a kiss of congratulation , <NAME> ; but don ' t touch my right shoulder , for there ' s something running down it all day long .
1	Mr Clennam is a very gentlemanly man -- very gentlemanly .
1	' There never was a happier one ! ' I exclaimed , laying down the carving-knife and fork .
1	It was not like sleep -- and yet it must have been , or why those pleasant dreams of the little scholar all night long !
1	Having nothing to learn now , he thought of this frequently ; though not so often as he might have done , if he had had fewer things to think of .
1	I did not set this down as a discovery , rashly .
1	My sister , Mrs. <NAME> , with black hair and eyes , had such a prevailing redness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap .
1	' Could you lend me a penknife ? ' It was an odd thing , <NAME> smilingly observed , for her who could seldom prevail upon herself even to write a letter , to lend to a man of such vast business as Mr Merdle .
1	' Drat ' em , ' says <NAME> ' you read the same things over ' em and instead of sovereigns get sixpences ! ' Mr Sownds the beadle is more liberal than Mrs Miff -- but then he is not a pew-opener .
1	The face of each child , as the amount of his contribution was mentioned , darkened in a peculiarly vindictive manner , but his was by far the worst .
1	said the elder , when I went in .
1	What say you , my dear sir ?
1	Some people maintains that an Englishman ' s house is his castle .
1	The discreet Mrs Wilfer now looking out of window and beholding her daughter in conference with her lodger , instantly tied up her head and came out for a casual walk .
1	' The fact is , he is my servant , but I allow him to take a good many liberties ; for , between ourselves , I flatter myself he is an original , and I am rather proud of him. ' ' Ah , ' said the red-haired man , ' that , you see , is a matter of taste .
1	' Will you never be a <NAME> , my dear child ! ' said <NAME> , with pathetic reproachfulness .
1	I knew how quick she always was to divine the truth , and that she would never be the first to breathe his name .
1	' You need not leave this place , sir , for it will be relieved of my presence in one minute , and it will be long , very long , before I darken these doors again. ' ' Nicholas , ' cried <NAME> , throwing herself on her brother ' s shoulder , ' do not say so .
1	' Well , <NAME> , what have you got to say to me ? ' <NAME> remained silent .
1	It 's only a question between the larger sum and the smaller .
1	' Parents who never showed their love , complain of want of natural affection in their children ; children who never showed their duty , complain of want of natural feeling in their parents ; law-makers who find both so miserable that their affections have never had enough of life ' s sun to develop them , are loud in their moralisings over parents and children too , and cry that the very ties of nature are disregarded .
1	Nothing could be more acceptable to me than the sweet presence of last evening , for all the remaining evenings of my existence ; but these are not fit surroundings for a young lady .
1	There is one cock who gets upon a post to crow , and seems to take particular notice of me as I look at him through the kitchen window , who makes me shiver , he is so fierce .
1	<NAME> , " said <NAME> , " after being all of a heap for half an hour , struck out a plan .
1	<NAME> <NAME> 's words were , that she would live to bless us all for many years to come .
1	Some of the letters were proceedings of ladies ' committees or resolutions of ladies ' meetings , which she read to us ; others were applications from people excited in various ways about the cultivation of coffee , and natives ; others required answers , and these she sent her eldest daughter from the table three or four times to write .
1	" Skin the stockings off <NAME> , " said the owner of that property , " or you 'll bust 'em .
1	" As we happen to be alone for the moment , and are both people of business , " he said , when they had got back to the drawing-room and had sat down there in friendly relations , " let me ask you -- does the <NAME> , in talking with <NAME> , never refer to the shoemaking time , yet ? " " Never. " " And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him ? " " Ah ! " returned <NAME> , shaking her head .
1	" 'To promote the conversation , ' as a joker might say .
1	I said it certainly was not business that I came upon , but it was not quite a pleasant matter .
1	' I should be quite sure of it , from your saying so ; but what you tell me is confirmed by suppressed hints and references that I meet with every day. ' ' Now , ' <NAME> again resumed , in a tone of mild though firm persuasion , ' is not this to be regretted , and ought it not to be amended ?
1	' And pray , what did you mean by that , sir ? ' demanded <NAME> , turning angrily on his assistant .
1	" What do you want , sir ? "
1	He ca n't be expected to know much of such a labyrinth . "
1	One might have fancied he had talked it off ; and that what was left , all standing up in disorder , was in that condition from being constantly blown about by his windy boastfulness .
1	' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , after thoughtfully pausing in her work .
1	Mrs. <NAME> continued to open and sort letters and to repeat occasionally in quite a charming tone of voice and with a smile of perfect composure , " No , indeed . "
1	But if you had gone into the case as I have , if you had only applied yourself to the papers as I did when I was at <NAME> 's , if you only knew what an accumulation of charges and counter-charges , and suspicions and cross-suspicions , they involve , you would think me moderate in comparison . "
1	On the very first night of these later hours , at nine exactly , there came : not the young lady herself , but her servant , who , being closeted with brother <NAME> for some time , went away , and returned next night at the same hour , and on the next , and on the next again .
1	As the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment ; and as their blood , like his , had all gone down again ; some speculation ensued upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament .
1	And the day ended , and the night ended , and the morning came , and <NAME> , simply dressed as usual and having no one with her but <NAME> , came into the prison with the sunshine .
1	I hate it. ' ' Hate it , <NAME> ? ' ( <NAME> bewildered . )
1	The stranger , however , picking up her cap with an air of gallantry , interposed .
1	<NAME> <NAME> has many of these breakfasts , <NAME> , ' resumed the new acquaintance -- ' " feasts of reason , " sir , " and flows of soul , " as somebody who wrote a sonnet to Mrs. Leo Hunter on her breakfasts , feelingly and originally observed. ' ' Was _he_ celebrated for his works and talents ? ' inquired <NAME> .
1	They won ' t do over here .
1	' Yes , you have taken cold , ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> , you honest tradesman , it would n't suit _your_ line of business !
1	<NAME> at the bees. ' ' I beg your pardon , ' returned <NAME> , with a reluctant smile , ' but will you excuse my mentioning that I always protest against being referred to the bees ? ' ' Do you ! ' said Mr Boffin .
1	But I won ' t say anything more about it , if you ' ll promise not to cry , that ' s all ; and you take the baby that ' s a lighter weight , and give me little <NAME> ; and as we go along ( which we must do pretty quick ) I ' ll give you the news I bring , which will surprise you a little , I can tell you .
1	You turn a little to the right when you get to the end of the town ; it stands by itself , some little distance off the high road , with the name on a brass plate on the gate. ' ' I know it , ' said <NAME> .
1	Will you come ? ' Florence put her arm through his ; and confiding her father to the black-eyed Mrs Toots , who sat as brisk and smart at her work as black-eyed woman could , accompanied her husband downstairs .
1	" If you wo n't let me speak -- " " You 're speaking now .
1	He quite shook hands with me -- which was a violent proceeding for him , his usual course being to slide a tepid little fish-slice , an inch or two in advance of his hip , and evince the greatest discomposure when anybody grappled with it .
1	And you remember <NAME> , my dear , ath wath a ' motht a mother to you ?
1	It was as true , ' said <NAME> , nodding his nightcap , which was his only means of emphasis , ' as taxes is .
1	<NAME> , ' adds <NAME> , ' can exceed their good-humour .
1	' I fear I must , ' said <NAME> , with heroic firmness .
1	You shall go by the way we have come , and I will go forward by the path .
1	' Why then , it ' s done. ' Kit looked at him in some confusion .
1	'Who the devil can tell that , without knowing of what kind it is ? '
1	A revival of the passing interest in the subject which had been by chance awakened at the door of the <NAME> Office , originated in this feeling .
1	He told us that he held the whole house , but rarely used more of it than we saw .
1	' Look at yourself in the glass. ' Mr Merdle involuntarily turned his eyes in the direction of the nearest mirror , and asked , with a slow determination of his turbid blood to his temples , whether a man was to be called to account for his digestion ?
1	I came here some nine months before you ; I had had one crop before you came .
1	Not venturing to trust himself in the church any more , and yet wishing to have some social participation in what was going on there , Mr <NAME> was , after this , seen from time to time , looking in , with a lorn aspect , at one or other of the windows ; and as there were several windows accessible to him from without , and as his restlessness was very great , it not only became difficult to conceive at which window he would appear next , but likewise became necessary , as it were , for the whole congregation to speculate upon the chances of the different windows , during the comparative leisure afforded them by the sermon .
1	<NAME> <NAME> may become a <NAME> or anything else she likes , but not a <NAME> .
1	" I salute you , citizen. " This in passing .
1	I fancy , even already , that unavailing attendance on delays and evasions has made you something less elastic than you used to be. ' ' Private anxieties may have done that for the moment , ' said <NAME> , ' but not official harrying .
1	Her name was Mrs. Markleham ; but our boys used to call her the <NAME> , on account of her generalship , and the skill with which she marshalled great forces of relations against the Doctor .
1	If it means that I grow a little too fervid , or perhaps even hyperbolical , in extolling my native land , I admit the full justice of the remark .
1	Strictly between ourselves. ' ' Number one , my dear ? ' said her father , settling her arm comfortably and confidentially .
1	First , he took the two secret men .
1	( He had now set Mr Merdle down on a couch , side by side with <NAME> , and to it they must go , now or never . )
1	He thought of the picturesque alliance between those two , externally so very different .
1	' Hush ! ' said <NAME> , suddenly , ' Edith ! ' The loving mother can scarcely be described as resuming her insipid and affected air when she made this exclamation ; for she had never cast it off ; nor was it likely that she ever would or could , in any other place than in the grave .
1	<NAME> added , with strong marks of irritation , that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder was infernal unconstitutional , for it burnt holes in them , and there was no remedy against the <NAME> .
1	Her grandson apologizes with " True .
1	That without any affectation of disparaging such professional distinction as I may have attained ( which our friend <NAME> will have many opportunities of estimating ) , I am not so weak -- no , really , " said <NAME> to us generally , " so unreasonable -- as to put my reputation on the same footing with such first-rate men as <NAME> and <NAME> .
1	<NAME> <NAME> concluded by drawing a rather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging ; and , with great friendliness and politeness of manner , expressed his anxious hopes that he might never be obliged to submit <NAME> to that unpleasant operation .
1	' I should by your description .
1	' Any snow , or sleet , or slush , or anything of that sort ? ' he asked .
1	So little did I know of the world !
1	<NAME> <NAME> was called to confirm it , and did so .
1	<NAME> , old boy , you have seen the figures , and you know how they come out. ' Mr Baptist , who had not the slightest arithmetical power of compensating himself in this way , nodded , with a fine display of bright teeth .
1	I ' m umbly anxious for his good. ' I gave him no answer , and went upstairs into the quiet room where <NAME> had so often sat beside me at my books .
1	<NAME> had scarcely settled herself on a little heap of straw in one corner , when she fell asleep , for the first time that day .
1	Repeating ' no ' , and ' not the least ' , and other short assurances to the same purport , <NAME> jogged on before us , at a queer , uneven pace ; and we followed : <NAME> , looking grave , I observed , and shaking his head to himself , without knowing that I saw him .
1	And tell her that before she marries my boy , I ' ll come and make your house so beautiful for you , if you ' ll let me ! ' I declared that nobody else should touch it ; and this gave <NAME> such delight that she went away in good spirits .
1	Went to Westminster School as a King ' s <NAME> , when I was principally living on garbage , and sleeping in market baskets .
1	' <NAME> ' whatever , <NAME> , ' retorted <NAME> ; ' I ' m afeered the little box must be chock full o ' your own as it is. ' This speech was accompanied with such a very expressive look at that particular portion of <NAME> ' s attire , by the appearance of which the skill of laundresses in getting up gentlemen ' s linen is generally tested , that he was fain to turn upon his heel , and , for the present at any rate , to give up all design on <NAME> ' s purse and wardrobe .
1	My aunt being supremely indifferent to Mrs. Crupp ' s opinion and everybody else ' s , and rather favouring than discouraging the idea , Mrs. Crupp , of late the bold , became within a few days so faint-hearted , that rather than encounter my aunt upon the staircase , she would endeavour to hide her portly form behind doors -- leaving visible , however , a wide margin of flannel petticoat -- or would shrink into dark corners .
1	<NAME> , a petition. " With an exclamation of impatience , but with his unchangeable face , <NAME> looked out .
1	There 's subjects enough as betwixt two sech , without onnecessary ones .
1	A <NAME> Day and <NAME> Still impassive , as behoves its breeding , the <NAME> town house carries itself as usual towards the street of dismal grandeur .
1	He had not miscalculated the effect then !
1	<NAME> knows , <NAME> , it is a lenient and considerate one , when we remember all ! ' ' If it be lenient and considerate to punish you at all , <NAME> , for the misdeed of another , ' she replied gently , ' yes. ' ' We have been an ill-omened race to him , ' said <NAME> .
1	After a great many jokes about squeezing the ladies ' sleeves , and a vast quantity of blushing at sundry jocose proposals , that the ladies should sit in the gentlemen ' s laps , the whole party were stowed down in the barouche ; and the stout gentleman proceeded to hand the things from the fat boy ( who had mounted up behind for the purpose ) into the carriage .
1	Ill-assorted couple , unhappy in themselves and in each other , bound together by no tie but the manacle that joined their fettered hands , and straining that so harshly , in their shrinking asunder , that it wore and chafed to the bone , <NAME> , consoler of affliction and softener of anger , could do nothing to help them .
1	" What do you call him again ? "
1	' -- I said , ' proceeded old <NAME> , ' that still there was no certain information got yet .
1	I would pretend to know -- if I didn ' t , but I should from her son -- all about her age .
1	How many anxious years , how many pinching days and sleepless nights , before I scraped together that ten thousand pounds ! -- Ten thousand pounds !
1	Guster is minding the shop , for the 'prentices take tea in the kitchen with <NAME> and Mrs. Snagsby ; consequently , the robe-maker 's two daughters , combing their curls at the two glasses in the two second-floor windows of the opposite house , are not driving the two 'prentices to distraction as they fondly suppose , but are merely awakening the unprofitable admiration of <NAME> , whose hair wo n't grow , and never would , and it is confidently thought , never will .
1	' And you can hardly think , ' said <NAME> , ' having experience of what we see , in the <NAME> here , every day , of the various unaccountable and negligent proceedings of men , in respect of their testamentary arrangements -- of all subjects , the one on which perhaps the strangest revelations of human inconsistency are to be met with -- but that mine are made ? ' I inclined my head in acquiescence .
1	'Yes , ' said the old lady , looking up for a moment from the broth ; 'that 's a portrait . '
1	to be peeped at like a wild lion through the iron bars -- to gnash one ' s teeth and howl , through the long still night , to the merry ring of a heavy chain and to roll and twine among the straw , transported with such brave music .
1	I hope to meet your niece here presently. ' ' Oh ! ' said he , pondering .
1	She fell upon her knees , and clinging to this stroller ' s child looked up at her almost with veneration .
1	My sister , Mrs. <NAME> , throwing the door wide open , and finding an obstruction behind it , immediately divined the cause , and applied <NAME> to its further investigation .
1	He was a better follower than <NAME> .
1	Many minor incidents in the household life of the <NAME> ' Instrument-maker who was proud of his little Midshipman , assisted and bore out this fancy .
1	That 's not my sort either . "
1	' Hey ! ' cried the lady of the caravan , scooping the crumbs out of her lap and swallowing the same before wiping her lips .
1	On this point opinion was divided .
1	He had taken two or three undecided turns up and down while uttering these broken sentences , retaining the poker in one hand and rubbing his hair with the other , with a good-natured vexation at once so whimsical and so lovable that I am sure we were more delighted with him than we could possibly have expressed in any words .
1	For I own it seems to me , my dear <NAME> , ' said Mrs. Micawber , who always fell back on me , I suppose from old habit , to whomsoever else she might address her discourse at starting , ' that the time is come when the past should be buried in oblivion ; when my family should take <NAME> by the hand , and <NAME> should take my family by the hand ; when the lion should lie down with the lamb , and my family be on terms with <NAME> Micawber. ' I said I thought so too .
1	I won ' t eat more than I can help , and I know you love your old master too much to eat more than YOU can help , don ' t you , <NAME> ? ' ' Don ' t I what ? ' said <NAME> .
1	So far from that , I had no doubt of her being prepared to have a great reliance on him and to like him very much .
1	From that blessed little room , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , the Vicar of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , came out , a glorious host , to keep me company .
1	They travel about on the same errands , say and do the same things in exactly the same manner , and follow in the same dull cheerless round .
1	" I felt it a good deal at first .
1	It is difficult to believe that <NAME> ( round-eyed still , and not at all grammatical ) is married to a miller in our neighbourhood ; yet so it is ; and even now , looking up from my desk as I write early in the morning at my summer window , I see the very mill beginning to go round .
1	Never mind , <NAME> , never mind ! ' said <NAME> .
1	And really it did seem possible .
1	' Had I ? ' said the man again .
1	But the old gentleman 's shoulders were shrugged up to his ears ; and his eyes were vacantly staring on the opposite wall .
1	I ' m a mother to both .
1	I chose the night for the journey , that there might be less curiosity when I left the town .
1	At the doors and windows some men and women lounged or prowled about , and took little notice of us except to laugh to one another or to say something as we passed about gentlefolks minding their own business and not troubling their heads and muddying their shoes with coming to look after other people 's .
1	There were other times when she would come to a sudden check in this tone and in all her many tones , and would seem to pity me .
1	It was done in a minute .
1	' I ' m glad to hear it .
1	It was a hot , wild night , and they were all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the lightning from the same place .
1	In the business part of the proceedings he carried all before him . "
1	' You are quite sure , ' said <NAME> junior , calling after him when he got to the door , unwilling wholly to relinquish the bright business idea he had conceived ; ' that it ' s nothing about <NAME> ? ' ' <NAME> sure. ' With such assurance , and rather wondering what might have taken place if it _had_ been anything about tonnage , Mr <NAME> withdrew to pursue his inquiries .
1	That don ' t seem very far out of the way now , do it ? ' <NAME> scratched his head mournfully , in reluctant admission that it did not , and clambering up to the old nail took down the cage and set himself to clean it and to feed the bird .
1	His telling her of the glorious state that Mr <NAME> kept , and of the court that bowed before him , naturally brought him to Mrs Merdle .
1	We hear sometimes of an action for damages against the unqualified medical practitioner , who has deformed a broken limb in pretending to heal it .
1	I know my duty better now .
1	And between them and the white-haired man afar off , was the one small link , that they had once looked in at him through the chinks in the wall .
1	Still , although I had no doubt that they were very beautiful , and very improving , and very sufficient for a great many purposes of life , and always remembered all through life , I did doubt whether <NAME> would not have profited by some one studying him a little , instead of his studying them quite so much .
1	I thought all this very pretty and engaging , and <NAME> seemed to think so too , as we looked after them fading away in the light of a young moon .
1	For some changes in the fortunes of my friends , I was prepared .
1	I observed , upon that closer opportunity of observation , that she was worn and haggard , and that her sunken eyes expressed privation and endurance .
1	Lie down again ; there 's a dear ! '
1	In the back kitchen , I raved as became me .
1	As he stood by the sideboard he seemed to announce , ' I have accepted office to look at this which is now before me , and to look at nothing less than this. ' If he missed the presiding bosom , it was as a part of his own state of which he was , from unavoidable circumstances , temporarily deprived , just as he might have missed a centre-piece , or a choice wine-cooler , which had been sent to the <NAME> ' s .
1	' <NAME> ' t like the boy. ' ' What do you say to his master ? ' ' I say that I think he ' s bespoke. ' <NAME> finished putting the hair carefully back over the misshapen shoulders , and then lighted a candle .
1	Thoroughly used to him as he was , he found something new and strained in him that was for the moment perplexing .
1	His advice , energy , activity , money , credit , all his resources whatsoever , were all made useless .
1	' I should be the victim of their fury , ' replied <NAME> .
1	As to the strange man ; if he had come back for his two bank-notes there could have been no dispute about them , because my sister was fully prepared to restore them .
1	I 'll tell true , indeed , Mrs .
1	I was awoke by somebody saying ' Here he is ! ' and uncovering my hot head .
1	I am better by myself. " If I was to be put upon my oath to-morrow , <NAME> , before a magistrate , ' said <NAME> , ' I have no doubt I could venture to swear to those identical words. ' Miss Tox expressed her admiration by saying , ' My Louisa is ever methodical ! ' ' In short , <NAME> , ' resumed her aunt , ' literally nothing has passed between your poor <NAME> and myself , until to-day ; when I mentioned to your Papa that <NAME> and <NAME> had written exceedingly kind notes -- our sweet boy !
1	These answers and his manner were strange enough to cause my guardian to inquire of <NAME> , as we all walked across <NAME> 's <NAME> together , whether <NAME> were really , as his lodger represented him , deranged .
1	It was not for his friend to abate that confidence .
1	As she knew <NAME> ( indeed <NAME> and I both thought that she evidently associated him with the receipt of her wages ) , she immediately relented and allowed us to pass in .
1	I told her so , as she sat brooding after this outburst .
1	<NAME> , I envy them the luxury of their own feelings on this occasion .
1	' He is such a devilish close chap , ' said <NAME> , who had come up a little before , and now joined in the conversation .
1	" You could n't name an individual human being -- except myself -- that my little woman is more set and determined against than Jo , " says <NAME> .
1	'Well , well , ' said <NAME> , 'every trade has its drawbacks .
1	Do n't tell me anything : I do n't want to know anything ; I am not curious. " Of course I saw that he knew the man was come .
1	In the after cabin we were only fifteen passengers in all , and the greater part were from <NAME> , where some of us had known each other .
1	They sleep at the parsonage , but divide their attentions so equally among its inmates , and <NAME> and <NAME> , and <NAME> , that to this day the villagers have never been able to discover to which establishment they properly belong .
1	<NAME> , woman , have you found what you want yet ? ' She had been collecting sheets and blankets from a press , and hastened to gather them up , and to reply , ' Yes , Jeremiah. ' <NAME> helped her by carrying the load himself , wished the old man good night , and went up-stairs with her to the top of the house .
1	The man stepped forward for a few paces , followed by the two friends and their legal adviser .
1	ha ! ' laughed the old gentleman , rubbing his hands and wrists as if he were washing them .
1	You are faint with the closeness of the room , and the heat of these lamps .
1	' There ain ' t a better nor a kinder father going , than mine is. ' ' Why don ' t you want to see him then ? ' inquired his patron .
1	What time the beadle , hovering between the door of <NAME> 's establishment and the door of the <NAME> 's <NAME> , shows the curiosity in his keeping to a few discreet spirits and accepts the compliment of a glass of ale or so in return .
1	' He has kissed one of ' em ! ' exclaimed the delighted little man .
1	Take my arm ! ' Then leaning on Mr Merdle ' s arm , did Mr Dorrit descend the staircase , seeing the worshippers on the steps , and feeling that the light of Mr Merdle shone by reflection in himself .
1	This made me , I dare say , more timid and retiring than I naturally was and cast me upon Dolly as the only friend with whom I felt at ease .
1	And for what place of all places ?
1	I told him that I had heard by chance of his being in difficulty and had come to consult with him what could best be done .
1	But notwithstanding these drawbacks , the <NAME> , being heartily in earnest , read the service to the very last line , and with genuine feeling too ; and approving of it very much when he had done , turned in , under the counter ( but not before he had been upstairs , and listened at <NAME> ' s door ) , with a serene breast , and a most benevolent visage .
1	At the expiration of the term , steadily adhering to his old resolution and the pledge he gave his mother , he made his way back to <NAME> amidst innumerable difficulties , and returned , on foot , to his native place .
1	They , on the contrary , are much obliged to him for the pleasure he has given them in his company ; and so they part with many expressions of goodwill on both sides .
1	But the occasion was no common one , for Rob the <NAME> had certainly never stood in the doorway of <NAME> Cuttle ' s room before , and in it he stood then , panting at the <NAME> , with a flushed and touzled air of Bed about him , that greatly heightened both his colour and expression .
1	His family is as old as the hills , and infinitely more respectable .
1	Can you show me all those places that were spoken of in the account I read ?
1	I am rejoiced to see you , <NAME> , even under present circumstances. ' I believed that ; for he seemed to relish them very much .
1	Am I blind to that boy ' s defects ?
1	In the same room , there is a very characteristic and life-like portrait by <NAME> , a distinguished <NAME> artist .
1	If he were at sea that night , and near a dangerous coast , as it is said he was ; and if the vessel that was seen should really be the ship which -- ' ' Rosa ! ' said Mrs. <NAME> , ' come to me ! ' She came , but with no sympathy or gentleness .
1	But in travelling about , out of the large cities—as I have remarked in former parts of these volumes—I was quite oppressed by the prevailing seriousness and melancholy air of business : which was so general and unvarying , that at every new town I came to , I seemed to meet the very same people whom I had left behind me , at the last .
1	Your beer will be the worse for to-night ' s thunder I expect. -- Game !
1	And as she blows , and shading it with her lean hand , concentrates its red spark of light , it serves in the dim morning as a lamp to show him what he sees of her .
1	In trickery , evasion , procrastination , spoliation , botheration , under false pretences of all sorts , there are influences that can never come to good .
1	Your father has absconded—deserted you—and you mustn ' t expect to see him again as long as you live. ' They cared so little for plain <NAME> , these people , and were in that advanced state of degeneracy on the subject , that instead of being impressed by the speaker ' s strong common sense , they took it in extraordinary dudgeon .
1	' <NAME> ! ' cried <NAME> , recoiling in amazement .
1	They were not so successful as I could have wished ; for though the advantages of the school were undeniable , my aunt had not approved of any of the boarding-houses proposed for me .
1	'Add five pounds to the sum you have named ; give me five-and-twenty pounds in gold , ' said the woman ; 'and I 'll tell you all I know .
1	What with taking heed of these two faces , and what with feeling conscious that the stealthy occupation must set some mark on her own , <NAME> soon began to think that there was not a candid or a natural face among them all but <NAME> ' s .
1	Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse , is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being , I do mean to say that in this particular instance , it was the best thing for <NAME> that could by possibility have occurred .
1	The grass was coarse and high , but there was yet the spot on which they had so often sat together , when change and sorrow were but names .
1	' What is the matter ? ' ' She is not one yet ! ' cried the boy , embracing her still more closely .
1	But , in an instant consciousness was gone again , and no spirit of <NAME> was in <NAME> ' s crushed outer form .
1	Shaken out of destiny ' s dice-box into the company of a mere smuggler ; -- shut up with a poor little contraband trader , whose papers are wrong , and whom the police lay hold of besides , for placing his boat ( as a means of getting beyond the frontier ) at the disposition of other little people whose papers are wrong ; and he instinctively recognises my position , even by this light and in this place .
1	Moved by these considerations , a stout lady opened the proceedings by inquiring , with an air of great concern and sympathy , how Mr <NAME> was ; whereunto Mr Quilp ' s wife ' s mother replied sharply , ' Oh !
1	<NAME> , being a flabby gentleman with a moist surface and eyes so much too small for his moon of a face that they seemed to have been originally made for somebody else , was not at first sight prepossessing ; yet he was scarcely seated before <NAME> asked <NAME> and me , not inaudibly , whether he was not a great creature -- which he certainly was , flabbily speaking , though <NAME> meant in intellectual beauty -- and whether we were not struck by his massive configuration of brow .
1	Drownded , ain ' t he ? ' Concluding his apostrophe with this abrupt appeal to <NAME> , the <NAME> bade her good-night , and descended the stairs , while <NAME> remained at the top , holding the candle out to light him down .
1	<NAME> noticed the first <NAME> .
1	The very tall young man who suffered from excitement early , is better ; but a vague sentiment of repentance has seized upon him , and he hates the other very tall young man , and wrests dishes from him by violence , and takes a grim delight in disobliging the company .
1	' How does he bear it , my dear creature ? ' asks <NAME> .
1	<NAME> , sir -- everybody knows <NAME> -- apples , cherries , hops , and women .
1	That was how the phrase began to circulate , and what it meant ; nothing more. ' ' How do they call him ? ' said the landlady .
1	I told you from the first it was a toss-up .
1	He was apparently about to proceed to do so , when <NAME> , who had been eyeing him with great curiosity , said with considerable scorn , ' Haven ' t I seen you at the theatre , <NAME> ? ' ' Certainly , ' replied the unabashed stranger .
1	Finding all remonstrances unavailing , <NAME> pulled his hat firmly on , threw his father ' s coat over his arm , and taking the old man round the waist , forcibly dragged him down the ladder , and into the street ; never releasing his hold , or permitting him to stop , until they reached the corner .
1	Still more , when his mourning 'at is unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers brings it off , try to keep it on how you may. " A ghost-seeing effect in <NAME> 's own countenance informed me that <NAME> had entered the room .
1	As a consciously ' splendid woman , ' accustomed to overhear herself so denominated by elderly osteologists pursuing their studies in dinner society , <NAME> could dispense with her daughter .
1	I entreated her to rise , and got my arms about her to help her up ; but she only pressed that hand of mine which was nearest to her grasp , and hung her head over it and wept .
1	But , <NAME> , I do , notwithstanding , perceive the state of -- of things -- with <NAME> .
1	If I were dead , that could not be surer than it is henceforth .
1	As <NAME> looked fixedly at this phenomenon , it was a knocker again .
1	' Say out what you have to say .
1	" He is as indifferent to the honour of knowing me , I dare say , as I am to the honour of knowing him .
1	' Shall I go for the police ? ' inquired <NAME> , with a nimble start towards the door .
1	Then <NAME> beat him , and pouted , and said , ' My poor beautiful flowers ! ' as compassionately , I thought , as if <NAME> had laid hold of me .
1	' <NAME> , ' says the Major , seeing this , ' I give you joy .
1	We know now , what a struggle you made of old .
1	'What do you mean by lagging and a lifer ? '
1	' I was so surprised at first , ' said I , giving him welcome with all the cordiality I felt , ' that I had hardly breath to greet you with , Steerforth. ' ' Well , the sight of me is good for sore eyes , as the <NAME> say , ' replied <NAME> , ' and so is the sight of you , <NAME> , in full bloom .
1	' I beg your pardon , sir , ' says I , ' if you please , I ' m looking for the dog. ' ' Dog ? ' he says .
1	That was all , and what was that !
1	In the midst of all this , the lazy gentleman , who seems to have no luggage of any kind—not so much as a friend , even—lounges up and down the hurricane deck , coolly puffing a cigar ; and , as this unconcerned demeanour again exalts him in the opinion of those who have leisure to observe his proceedings , every time he looks up at the masts , or down at the decks , or over the side , they look there too , as wondering whether he sees anything wrong anywhere , and hoping that , in case he should , he will have the goodness to mention it .
1	" Say you said that , and even <NAME> will probably betray surprise. " " There you quite mistake him , " said I .
1	At this hint , the wan page , who had been surveying the party over the top of the chair , vanished behind it , as if the ground had swallowed him up .
1	' Of course , ' replied <NAME> , who had by this time advanced , horse in hand , to the garden rails .
1	What a girl you are ! ' ' The child ' s father is employed by the house that employs me ; that ' s how I came to know it , <NAME> .
1	Be careful , <NAME> , be careful .
1	cried <NAME> , 'What is it ? '
1	Yet , he knew so little about the inmates that he gave them names of his own invention : as ' Miss <NAME> ' , ' <NAME> ' , ' Aunt <NAME> ' , ' Uncle <NAME> ' -- having no authority whatever for any such designations , but particularly the last -- to which , as a natural consequence , he stuck with great obstinacy .
1	As soon as she came nearly below the tree , <NAME> began , by way of gently indicating his presence , to make sundry diabolical noises similar to those which would probably be natural to a person of middle age who had been afflicted with a combination of inflammatory sore throat , croup , and whooping-cough , from his earliest infancy .
1	" My prudent <NAME> , why not ? "
1	Know you very well , gentlemen , though you mayn ' t remember me .
1	To entreat her , at least , to pause .
1	She can not endure their restraint and will walk alone in a neighbouring garden .
1	' If you had money now -- ' said Mr Dombey .
1	As <NAME> looked round on the kind faces , and saw among them those of <NAME> and his lady , and of Mr Toots , who was chuckling and staring at her from a distance , she was reminded of the night when <NAME> and she had come from <NAME> ' s : and when the carriage drove away , her face was wet with tears .
1	' Oh , my goodness , how polite we are ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , making a preposterous attempt to cover her large face with her morsel of a hand .
1	As I found ( after pacifying him ) that he was a little boy with a naturally large head , I thought that perhaps where his head could go , his body could follow , and mentioned that the best mode of extrication might be to push him forward .
1	<NAME> uses me to it .
1	<NAME> else at your time of life , and after what has passed -- my dear <NAME> , I have lost my pocket handkerchief again -- would be glad to leave here , one would suppose. ' ' I should not like to feel , ' said <NAME> , ' as if the house was avoided .
1	They sit down , <NAME> as if he had no power of bending himself , except at the hips , for that purpose .
1	All through dinner , <NAME> combined her present appetite for eating and drinking with her past appetite for romantic love , in a way that made <NAME> afraid to lift his eyes from his plate ; since he could not look towards her without receiving some glance of mysterious meaning or warning , as if they were engaged in a plot .
1	It is a black , dilapidated street , avoided by all decent people , where the crazy houses were seized upon , when their decay was far advanced , by some bold vagrants who after establishing their own possession took to letting them out in lodgings .
1	Say then , madame ! ' Under this ferocious banter , she sat breathing harder , and her mouth was disturbed .
1	' Away ! ' was the first word he could utter as he literally gnashed his teeth .
1	In the course of that letter , I told <NAME> that I had a particular occasion for half a guinea ; and that if she could lend me that sum until I could repay it , I should be very much obliged to her , and would tell her afterwards what I had wanted it for .
1	Is it a bargain , or is it not ? ' <NAME> pushed some papers from him as he spoke , and carelessly rattled his cash-box , as though by mere accident .
1	I will not tell you that it will soon pass ; I will not tell you that it is the fancy of the moment ; I will not tell you that such caprices have their rise and fall among the young and ardent every hour ; I will leave you undisturbed in the belief that it has few parallels or none , that it will abide with you a long time , and that it will be very difficult to conquer .
1	<NAME> <NAME> walked up and down the shop for some time , cogitating profoundly , and bringing his bushy black eyebrows to bear so heavily on his nose , like clouds setting on a mountain , that <NAME> was afraid to offer any interruption to the current of his reflections .
1	' What the dey -- ' ' As a bait for you , ' repeated his friend ; ' old <NAME> told me so himself. ' ' What a fine old cock it is ! ' exclaimed <NAME> ; ' a noble rascal ! ' ' Yes , ' said <NAME> , ' he knew she was a smart little creature -- ' ' Smart ! ' interposed the young lord .
1	This is the most I consider possible .
1	Viewing the matter precisely in this light , <NAME> , without the slightest intimation of his purpose , sprang vigorously out of bed , struck the <NAME> so smart a blow in the chest as to deprive him of a considerable portion of the commodity which sometimes bears his name , and then , recapturing his nightcap , boldly placed himself in an attitude of defence .
1	' You have a packet left with you which you were to give to <NAME> , if it was not reclaimed before this place closed to-night. ' ' Yes. ' ' I reclaim it. ' Little <NAME> took it from her bosom , and gave it into her hand , which remained stretched out after receiving it .
1	The yard or two of smile on the part of the alligator might have been invested with the meaning , ' All about this was quite familiar knowledge down in the depths of the slime , ages ago. ' ' But , ' said <NAME> , possibly with some slight perception to the foregoing effect , ' your speaking countenance remarks , Mr Venus , that I ' m duller and savager than usual .
1	Mr <NAME> had said once , that he believed she was a ' love-child ' ( which means anything but a child of love ) , and that was all the information <NAME> could obtain .
1	He must go to it .
1	Let him call again. ' <NAME> gave vent to his usual grunt , as much as to say ' I thought so ! ' and , the ring being repeated , went to the door , whence he presently returned , ushering in , by the name of <NAME> , a pale gentleman in a violent hurry , who , with his hair standing up in great disorder all over his head , and a very narrow white cravat tied loosely round his throat , looked as if he had been knocked up in the night and had not dressed himself since .
1	The bulk of his property he divided into two equal portions -- one for <NAME> , and the other for their child , if it should be born alive , and ever come of age .
1	<NAME> was not much in the habit of cracking jokes , nor did he feel , in his heart , by any means waggish then .
1	I know their tricks and their manners. ' She said this with an angry little shake of her tight fist close before her eyes .
1	" I would greatly prefer , officer , " <NAME> returns stiffly , " my <NAME> 's name being entirely omitted from this discussion . "
1	If <NAME> will call on <NAME> at nine o ' clock , <NAME> will have the pleasure of introducing <NAME> .
1	But when they set the bier down on the threshold , they looked at one another , and at me , and whispered .
1	'Well , well , ' said <NAME> , with a sigh , ' I 'll send the <NAME> round presently . '
1	He was the meanest cur existing , with a single pair of legs .
1	Not we. ' ' Do you mean to say , <NAME> , ' inquired Mr <NAME> ; looking at him with marked displeasure , ' that you have called a child after a boiler ? ' ' No , no , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , with a tender consideration for his mistake .
1	' An unusually cold spring , ' says Mr Dombey -- to deceive the world .
1	<NAME> said he played the fife .
1	And if you do give me three-and-sixpence , deary , I ' ll tell you something. ' He counts the money from his pocket , and puts it in her hand .
1	I trust he may not turn out -- well -- no matter -- my love to you , my dear , and long life to the baby ! ' ' Your namesake , ' said Mrs. <NAME> , with a sweet smile .
1	You may keep the books , if you 're fond of reading .
1	I remember how I seemed to float , then , down the melancholy glory of that track upon the sea , away into the world of dreams .
1	The maid who ought to be a skeleton , but is in truth a buxom damsel , is , on the other hand , in a most amiable state : considering her quarterly stipend much safer than heretofore , and foreseeing a great improvement in her board and lodging .
1	' He broke it over me .
1	It IS a wilderness , ' said the old man with much animation .
1	' <NAME> game -- well played -- some strokes admirable , ' said the stranger , as both sides crowded into the tent , at the conclusion of the game .
1	'Why , if he did n't mind -- ' observed Fagin .
1	<NAME> , after some villainous thinking and smiling , wrote , and read aloud , as follows : ' Wait answer .
1	' At least , ' said Mr Inspector , ' you will not object to leave me your card , sir ? ' ' I should not object , if I had one ; but I have not. ' He reddened and was much confused as he gave the answer .
1	If I was not innocent of this crime , I could n't look at you and keep my secret to myself under the condescension of the present visit .
1	But you wouldn ' t have had the whole weight of any uncomfortable secrets if she had been with you , because she would have known how to relieve you of ' em , and I don ' t. ' ' Yes , yes , you do , ' returned the Instrument-maker .
1	Did you find Madeline herself , waiting for you and expecting you ?
1	<NAME> ' t say you are a prisoner , <NAME> !
1	Oh dear , dear , not on any account .
1	He will take something to eat and drink , I dare say , on your invitation , while you are getting your bonnet on. ' Mr Inspector declined eating , but assented to the proposal of a glass of brandy and water .
1	You 'll hardly believe what I am going to tell you .
1	Veneering ' s object is to let Pocket-Breaches know that his friend on his right ( <NAME> ) is a man of wealth .
1	" It ' s unekal , " as my father used to say wen his grog worn ' t made half-and-half : " it ' s unekal , and that ' s the fault on it. " ' ' I think you ' re right , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , after a few moments ' reflection , ' quite right. ' ' P ' raps , now and then , there ' s some honest people as likes it , ' observed <NAME> , in a ruminative tone , ' but I never heerd o ' one as I can call to mind , ' cept the little dirty-faced man in the brown coat ; and that was force of habit. ' ' And who was he ? ' inquired <NAME> .
1	What did he do it for ? "
1	<NAME> <NAME> said , ' Oh , <NAME> , <NAME> , this is really very careless ! ' and piled them up afresh for him ; and this time , by dint of balancing them with great nicety , <NAME> got out of the room , and down a few stairs before two of them escaped again .
1	He stopped at <NAME> ' s door , according to custom , and knocked to say good-night .
1	The general action of a man so engaged -- pausing to look over a bundle of papers in his hand , dealing them round in various portions , taking up another bundle and examining its contents with knitted brows and pursed-out lips -- dealing , and sorting , and pondering by turns -- would easily suggest some whimsical resemblance to a player at cards .
1	" And then , " he added , whispering and grinning , " if that ever was to happen -- which it wo n't -- the birds that have never been caged would kill 'em . "
1	' Oh , you do , do you ? ' sneered <NAME> .
1	But , observing lately , that her accessible point did appear to be a very strong description of tenderness for the daughter of my friend <NAME> , it occurred to me that if I could bring about a meeting , unexpected on both sides , it might lead to beneficial results .
1	' He hadn ' t got his card in his pocket. ' ' I object to the introduction o ' politics , ' said the mottled-faced gentleman .
1	I would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom I have so long moved , and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it .
1	There , there ! ' To see the <NAME> lift her on the sofa , and cover her with his coat , would have been worth a hundred state sights .
1	The horsemen abreast of that cart , frequently point out one man in it with their swords .
1	He says it ' s his opinion that when a man has made a handsome sum by his business , he is bound to give it up ; and that <NAME> would be an assistance in it which any man might be proud of .
1	In reply to the last interrogation , the small servant , with a look of infinite cunning mingled with fear , screwed up her mouth very tight and round , and nodded violently .
1	The breath of the men was cloud , the breath of the mules was cloud , the lights were encircled by cloud , speakers close at hand were not seen for cloud , though their voices and all other sounds were surprisingly clear .
1	It will be two o ' clock by the time we get back .
1	I ses 'yes I can ' I ses .
1	' Now , <NAME> dear , ' said <NAME> in due course , ' the salad ' s ready , and it ' s past supper-time. ' Mrs <NAME> rose , but remained speechless .
1	says Mrs. Bagnet , quietly threading her needle .
1	' <NAME> , Mrs. <NAME> , ' said Mrs. Cluppins , ' see what you ' ve been and done ! ' ' Well , that is a good one ! ' ejaculated Mrs. Sanders .
1	So with every lithe action of the girl , with every turn of her wrist , perhaps most of all with her look of dread or horror ; they were things of usage .
1	' I have a long series of insults to avenge , ' said <NAME> , flushed with passion ; ' and my indignation is aggravated by the dastardly cruelties practised on helpless infancy in this foul den .
1	I shall come all right again , then , do n't you be afraid . "
1	At the third , which is a very , very little tailor ' s shop , pants are fixed to order ; or in other words , pantaloons are made to measure .
1	Let the bearer see his wife. " It was dated from <NAME> , within an hour .
1	Each of these gentlemen occupied a little chamber like a bath-room , opening from the passage outside Mr <NAME> ' s door .
1	<NAME> <NAME> sat opposite the tipstaff ; and the tipstaff sat with his hat between his knees , whistling a tune , and looking out of the coach window .
1	It ' s gone on in the other wans to the assembly-rooms , and there it ' ll be exhibited the day after to-morrow .
1	To the very last ( feeble action of liver ) , she addressed me in the same unfinished terms. ' <NAME> has closed his eyes as the auctioneer has deepened his voice .
1	You will presently see that we ca n't be too private .
1	<NAME> bracelet , produced by Veneering before going down , and clasped upon the arm of bride .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , much stiffened as to his cravat , and sobered down as to his spirits , was at home for the holidays , and appeared to feel himself aggrieved by the solicitude of his excellent mother that he should be attentive to <NAME> .
1	What has this to do with me ? "
1	In short , sir , ' with an irrepressible outburst , ' in the passion into which he lashed me , I would have cut him down if I could , and I tried to do it. ' ' You have clenched that hand again , ' is <NAME> ' s quiet commentary .
1	He was the meekest of his sex , the mildest of little men .
1	What are his necessities , and what does he require ?
1	' And he wouldn ' t be persuaded by the ladies , wouldn ' t he ? ' said <NAME> .
1	' <NAME> d ' ye do , <NAME> ? ' said Mr Toots .
1	We have never had any quarrel , to which I have been a party .
1	These things she could plainly see .
1	These three groups sat round the fire eyeing each other drily , and waiting for supper .
1	Looking out of my chamber-window , before going to bed , I saw , on the opposite side of the way , a handsome building of white marble , which had a mournful ghost-like aspect , dreary to behold .
1	He has been written to by <NAME> , on the subject of your lodgings , and he will receive you as a lodger. ' ' My address , ' said <NAME> , ' is <NAME> , <NAME> .
1	' Do you think he won ' t ? ' cried <NAME> , really showing great capability for the stage .
1	' I don ' t know , ' I said , pretending to be undecided , ' whether I shall take a shot or not. ' ' <NAME> is got wery shy , I ' m told , ' said <NAME> .
1	' Well , then , ' said <NAME> , with some sternness , ' wot do you persevere in bein ' obstinit for , vastin ' your precious life away , in this here magnified pound ?
1	In the mildest language , I adore you .
1	How was it ! " As the concentrated expression returned to his forehead , he seemed to become conscious that it was in hers too .
1	This glorious establishment had been early in the field , when the one sublime principle involving the difficult art of governing a country , was first distinctly revealed to statesmen .
1	" Ca n't help it , " he returned .
1	Seven-eighths of my stock is old-fashioned .
1	Influenced by these noble sentiments , they had even gone out of their way to purchase little luxuries in the grocery and butter line to which they were unaccustomed ; saying to one another , that if they did stretch a point , was it not for a neighbour and a friend , and for whom ought a point to be stretched if not for such ?
1	' <NAME> ' t stand there , <NAME> , turning your spectacle-case over and over , ' cried Mr Meagles , ' but tell Mr Clennam what you confessed to me. ' ' I undoubtedly was made to feel , ' said the inventor , ' as if I had committed an offence .
1	' The principal productions of these towns , ' says <NAME> , ' appear to be soldiers , sailors , <NAME> , chalk , shrimps , officers , and dockyard men .
1	However , you did not. ' ' I meant to have acknowledged it when I first came in this evening , sir. ' ' Not a business-like acknowledgment , ' returned <NAME> ; ' however , let that pass .
1	He was soon calmed and fell asleep , singing to himself in a low voice , like a little child .
1	" Roast weal , " says the patient .
1	I thought of you so anxiously , and it appeared so long to morning. ' ' I have thought of you -- ' he hesitated what to call her .
1	" Are the pictures all as they used to be ? "
1	' One other word , my Little Dorrit .
1	What <NAME> ' s father was to me , she made him .
1	<NAME> , having rambled through the handsome house , from room to room , seeks her own chamber , where the care of <NAME> has surrounded her with luxuries and comforts ; and divesting herself of her handsome dress , puts on her old simple mourning for dear <NAME> , and sits down to read , with <NAME> winking and blinking on the ground beside her .
1	He was down once , but they made a ring round him , and fought their way along .
1	After awhile , he began to remember a few disjointed fragments of what the judge had said : though it had seemed to him , at the time , that he could not hear a word .
1	In good time next morning , however , we came again in sight of the detestable morass called <NAME> ; and stopping there to take in wood , lay alongside a barge , whose starting timbers scarcely held together .
1	In short , charity must have its romance , as the novelist or playwright must have his .
1	<NAME> ! ' ' Yes , your Worship. ' ' Is Grummer downstairs ? ' ' Yes , your Worship. ' ' Send him up. ' The obsequious <NAME> retired , and presently returned , introducing the elderly gentleman in the top-boots , who was chiefly remarkable for a bottle-nose , a hoarse voice , a snuff-coloured surtout , and a wandering eye .
1	I regret to say , <NAME> , that I could have wished you had fatigued yourself a little more on this occasion .
1	'It is , ' was the reply .
1	' Then , ' says Mr Venus , looking up , after meditating with his hair held in his hands , as if he could only fix his attention by fixing his head ; ' if anything was to be unburied from under the dust , it would be kept a secret by you and me ?
1	' I have told you once before to-night. ' ' You have done nothing of the sort. ' ' I tell you I have .
1	All you ' ve got to do , ' said the <NAME> , with the solemnity of a man who was delivering himself of one of the most precious practical tenets ever discovered by human wisdom , ' is to lay your head well to the wind , and we ' ll fight through it ! ' Old Sol returned the pressure of his hand , and thanked him .
1	' For fifteen years , ' exclaimed <NAME> , sobbing in a most affecting manner , ' for fifteen years have I been the credit and ornament of this room and the one upstairs .
1	But he set up no monopoly of the general attention , or the conversation .
1	Consequently he fills and empties his glass with a smack of his lips and is proceeding with his refreshment when an idea enters his mind .
1	" Is she married , my dear ? "
1	' <NAME> than any prose. ' ' I couldn ' t give more than three , ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> ' s very well as far as he goes , but the real friend is <NAME> -- not Short. ' Eking out these professions with a number of benevolent and protecting looks and great fervour of manner , <NAME> stole away on tiptoe , leaving the child in a state of extreme surprise .
1	' A stranger ! ' she returned , stopping between each short reply , and looking at the fire .
1	There is no bridesmaid , unless <NAME> is one ; and no better father than <NAME> .
1	Even when , slightly thawing under the influence of sparkling champagne , she related to her son-in-law some passages of domestic interest concerning her papa , she infused into the narrative such <NAME> suggestions of her having been an unappreciated blessing to mankind , since her papa ' s days , and also of that gentleman ' s having been a frosty impersonation of a frosty race , as struck cold to the very soles of the feet of the hearers .
1	' If I had had but that money before -- If I had only known of it a few minutes ago ! ' muttered the old man .
1	This was such a very singular proceeding on the part of an utter stranger , and his appearance was so extremely peculiar , that <NAME> , who had a sufficiently keen sense of the ridiculous , could not refrain from breaking into a smile as he inquired whether <NAME> had any commands for him .
1	I know that I lounged about the streets , insufficiently and unsatisfactorily fed .
1	' I feel , my dear , ' said <NAME> , quite amazing herself by the business-like manner in which she was getting on , ' that the subject must be a painful one to you , but I am mixed up in it also ; for -- I don ' t know whether you may know it or suspect it -- I am the willed-away girl who was to have been married to the unfortunate gentleman , if he had been pleased to approve of me .
1	Thus it was , however ; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the flints , and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that its purchase crumbled , and it now turned and turned with nothing to bite , <NAME> began to run away from a phenomenon so low and unaccountable .
1	I am his friend , and you shall find me so. ' ' And you will find <NAME> on the stairs , ' remarked <NAME> .
1	Then little Mrs. <NAME> proposed as a toast , ' Success to <NAME> agin <NAME> ' ; and then the ladies emptied their glasses in honour of the sentiment , and got very talkative directly .
1	<NAME> didn ' t know : already having everything she wanted , she couldn ' t say .
1	You know that I came to you , extremely apprehensive , on my dear boy ' s behalf , of his mad violence .
1	' Thank you , ' stammered Mr Sparkler , ' she ' s uncommonly well -- at least , poorly. ' ' In <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> <NAME> was extremely glad to see me , but a little confused too .
1	' For this gentleman ? ' said Mrs. Crupp , feeling in her pocket for her keys .
1	He softly reclosed the door .
1	Within the shadow , I may figuratively say , of that religious edifice immortalized by <NAME> , which was anciently the resort of <NAME> from the remotest corners of -- in short , ' said <NAME> , ' in the immediate neighbourhood of the Cathedral. ' I replied that it was .
1	For some moments , I was so lost in reconsidering what I had heard and seen in <NAME> Street that I was quite unable to talk to <NAME> or even to fix my attention on what she said to me , especially when I began to inquire in my mind whether there were , or ever had been , any other gentlemen , not in the dancing profession , who lived and founded a reputation entirely on their deportment .
1	If I felt that I could ever give him the best right he could have to be my protector , and if I felt that I could happily and justly become the dear companion of his remaining life , superior to all lighter chances and changes than death , even then he could not have me bind myself irrevocably while this letter was yet so new to me , but even then I must have ample time for reconsideration .
1	And here , in the very first stage , I was supplanted by a shabby man with a squint , who had no other merit than smelling like a livery-stables , and being able to walk across me , more like a fly than a human being , while the horses were at a canter !
1	' Indeed , ma ' am ! ' replied <NAME> , timidly .
1	Put me in the dock anywhere -- I don ' t care where -- and I says , " My Lord , I am a honest man. " Put me in the witness-box anywhere -- I don ' t care where -- and I says the same to his lordship , and I kisses the book .
1	' <NAME> , dear , ' she said , ' I have been looking for you everywhere. ' As she sat down by the side of <NAME> , she stooped and kissed her hand .
1	' Is it possible , sir , ' said Mr Dorrit , reddening excessively , ' that you have -- ha -- had the audacity to place one of my rooms at the disposition of any other person ? ' Thousands of pardons !
1	It was the self-same chimney-piece , and somehow he felt as if _he_ were the whelp to-night .
1	<NAME> or no husband , that fellow is incapable of the feeling with which I am inspired towards the beautiful young creature whom he treats like a doll .
1	" But I hope , " said the gentleman , following the chief gaoler with his eyes , who moved across the room , " that you are not in secret ? " " I do not understand the meaning of the term , but I have heard them say so. " " Ah , what a pity !
1	But tell him , sir , ' she had shrunk away from him , ' if you don ' t feel too hard to me to do it , that I never was in any way the cause of his misfortune. ' ' It has never been attributed to you , ' I returned , earnestly responding to her earnestness .
1	It is not worth your noticing .
1	At all events , I will shut out the world with the bedclothes , and try. ' <NAME> crossed the staircase to his raw and foggy bedroom , and was soon ready for bed .
1	And , lastly , that <NAME> should be understood as distinctly pledging himself not to resort to the window , fireplace , or other surreptitious mode of escape in the meanwhile .
1	I don ' t know why or wherefore , but I appeared to run in his mind perpetually , and to dissatisfy him very much .
1	She said she had tried to exert herself , and so , I have no doubt , she had .
1	The day wore on , and all these bright colours subsided , and assumed a quieter tint , like young hopes softened down by time , or youthful features by degrees resolving into the calm and serenity of age .
1	At length Mr Dombey , bringing down <NAME> and <NAME> to see the children , and finding the Major again at <NAME> , invited him to dinner at the <NAME> , and complimented <NAME> highly , beforehand , on her neighbour and acquaintance .
1	There they stand yet , without the motion of a hand .
1	If you ask me , <NAME> , whether from the first I believed <NAME> to be the murderer , I tell you candidly no , but he might be , notwithstanding , and there was enough against him to make it my duty to take him and get him kept under remand .
1	Ultimately I found myself backing <NAME> into the fireplace , and bowing in great confusion to two dry little elderly ladies , dressed in black , and each looking wonderfully like a preparation in chip or tan of the late <NAME> .
1	There is a dusty old pew-opener who only keeps herself , and finds that quite enough to do .
1	I have been a weak child .
1	She would officially succeed to the chamber she had rented so long .
1	Have I suffered nothing in this room , no deprivation , no imprisonment , that I should condescend at last to contemplate myself in such a glass as _that_ .
1	You ain ' t so wery ' andsome that you can afford to throw avay many o ' your good looks .
1	At length , the Major having disposed of all the missiles that were convenient to his hand , and having called the Native so many new names as must have given him great occasion to marvel at the resources of the <NAME> language , submitted to have his cravat put on ; and being dressed , and finding himself in a brisk flow of spirits after this exercise , went downstairs to enliven ' <NAME> ' and his right-hand man .
1	But as ' them two clever ones ' -- Mrs Affery ' s perpetual reference , in whom her personality was swallowed up -- were agreed to accept <NAME> as a matter of course , she had nothing for it but to follow suit .
1	Quite correct , <NAME> dear ; but I didn ' t see you do it , so I asked .
1	' I am convinced , my dear Amy , ' said Mr Sparkler , ' that if ever there was a girl , next to your highly endowed and beautiful sister , who had no nonsense about her -- ' ' We know all about that , <NAME> , ' interposed <NAME> .
1	He lighted the second at the ashes of the first , and smoked on , looking sideways at his companion , who , preoccupied with his own case , hardly looked at him .
1	' If you please , <NAME> ' am , Mr Carker sends his respectful compliments , and begs you would spare him one minute , if you could -- for business , <NAME> ' am , if you please. ' ' Really , my love , ' said <NAME> in her mildest manner ; for her daughter ' s face was threatening ; ' if you would allow me to offer a word , I should recommend -- ' ' Show him this way , ' said <NAME> .
1	' No , he didn ' t , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> .
1	In these , the <NAME> ' s most glaring moments of unreason , <NAME> would shut her up and knock her on the table , apostrophising her with the compliment , ' O you ARE a stupid old Donkey !
1	<NAME> and ruin came on me -- came on me. ' Raising her eyes swiftly from their moody gaze upon the fire , to <NAME> ' s face , she said : ' I am wasting time , and there is none to spare ; yet if I hadn ' t thought of all , I shouldn ' t be here now .
1	Will it be believed that the eyes which are to watch over and control the wanderings of minds on which the most dreadful visitation to which our nature is exposed has fallen , must wear the glasses of some wretched side in Politics ?
1	' You scoundrel ! ' said <NAME> , whose seafaring hold was like that of a vice .
1	' I don ' t think you are well to-night , dear Fanny. ' ' Stuff and nonsense ! ' replied the young lady , turning angry again ; ' I am as well as you are .
1	But I do assure you that it is a satisfaction to me to receive you in my humble home .
1	I had the paragraph here somewhere -- but I don ' t know -- oh , yes , here it is. ' So saying , <NAME> , after pretending that he thought he must have lost it , produced a square inch of newspaper from the pocket of the pantaloons he wore in private life ( which , together with the plain clothes of several other gentlemen , lay scattered about on a kind of dresser in the room ) , and gave it to <NAME> to read : ' The talented Vincent Crummles , long favourably known to fame as a country manager and actor of no ordinary pretensions , is about to cross the <NAME> on a histrionic expedition .
1	I am aware that I am merely a female , and that a masculine judgement is usually considered more competent to the discussion of such questions ; still I must not forget that , when I lived at home with my papa and mama , my papa was in the habit of saying , " Emma ' s form is fragile , but her grasp of a subject is inferior to none. " That my papa was too partial , I well know ; but that he was an observer of character in some degree , my duty and my reason equally forbid me to doubt. ' With these words , and resisting our entreaties that she would grace the remaining circulation of the punch with her presence , Mrs. Micawber retired to my bedroom .
1	In the yard , were Mr <NAME> and Mr Rugg , come to see the last touch given to their work .
1	Why do you take me , ' said Mr <NAME> , ' to the glittering halls with which I can never compete , and then taunt me with my moderate salary ?
1	' Restrain him , ' cried <NAME> ; ' Winkle , <NAME> -- he must not peril his distinguished life in such a cause as this. ' ' Let me go , ' said <NAME> .
1	He ' d have made a good ' un in our line , but it would have been too limited for him ; his genius would have busted all bonds , and coming over every obstacle , broke down all before it , till it erected itself into a monneyment of -- Well , I ' ll think of the rest , and say it when conwenient. ' Making a halt in his reflections at this place , <NAME> again put his glass to his lips , and drawing a dirty letter from his pocket , proceeded to con over its contents with the air of a man who had read it very often , and now refreshed his memory rather in the absence of better amusement than for any specific information .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , understanding the message , after some twenty repetitions , tied a wet cloth round his head to sober himself , and , having partially succeeded , put on his green spectacles and issued forth .
1	I told him I had come up again to say how sorry I was that anything disagreeable should have occurred , and that I hoped he would not blame me much .
1	' There is no air here , ' said the man faintly .
1	<NAME> had said , when he stayed there for an hour , en route , and left the letter for <NAME> -- <NAME> had received it surely ? ' ' Yes. ' ' A thousand pardons !
1	But when she sat down on the seat , she was a handsome lady still ; and well I knew the bright eye with its lofty look , that had been a light in my very dreams at school .
1	The young man and the girl both laughed .
1	" I salute you , citizeness , " from the Doctor .
1	<NAME> at the birds , my pretty ! ' ' Poor birds ! ' said the child .
1	' Thou seest this daughter of my dear dead brother !
1	' Quite unnecessary , ' replied <NAME> ; ' name them to me , and I can procure the attendance of a friend afterwards. ' ' Shall we say -- sunset this evening ? ' inquired the officer , in a careless tone .
1	" If you could n't abear yourself -- " <NAME> asked me here , as she sat holding my sister 's plate , " Have you thought about when you 'll show yourself to <NAME> , and your sister and me ?
1	He was an undecided , irresolute chap , who had everything but his orphan life scared out of him when he was young .
1	And now , my dear Sir , I put it to you .
1	' I may grow rich ! ' repeated <NAME> , with a mournful smile , ' ay , and I may grow old !
1	<NAME> <NAME> shut her eyes , and disdainfully inclined her head ; then , slowly opening her eyes , resumed : ' <NAME> , I shall not attempt to disguise the fact , that I formed an unfavourable opinion of you in your childhood .
1	' Not in health ? ' ' N -- n -- o ; perhaps not in health exactly , ' said <NAME> , pausing to consider , ' although he is a worn and feeble creature , and has that in his face which it would wring my heart to see in yours .
1	He will , he will indeed. ' ' He wull , he wull ! ' replied <NAME> impatiently .
1	' I never know ' d a respectable coachman as wrote poetry , ' cept one , as made an affectin ' copy o ' werses the night afore he was hung for a highway robbery ; and he wos only a <NAME> man , so even that ' s no rule. ' But <NAME> was not to be dissuaded from the poetical idea that had occurred to him , so he signed the letter -- ' Your love-sick Pickwick. ' And having folded it , in a very intricate manner , squeezed a downhill direction in one corner : ' To <NAME> , <NAME> , at <NAME> ' s , <NAME> ' s , <NAME> , <NAME> ' ; and put it into his pocket , wafered , and ready for the general post .
1	My friend is dead , my neighbour is dead , my love , the darling of my soul , is dead ; it is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality , and which I shall carry in mine to my life 's end .
1	Both Ada and I expressed our regret that he should go , then , only to be disappointed .
1	' I think we may adjourn , ' said <NAME> .
1	That I was ashamed to tell him exactly how I was placed , and what I had come down to , I do not seek to conceal ; but I hope my reluctance was not quite an unworthy one .
1	' She would have been proud of you .
1	Of my walking so proudly and lovingly down the aisle with my sweet wife upon my arm , through a mist of half-seen people , pulpits , monuments , pews , fonts , organs , and church windows , in which there flutter faint airs of association with my childish church at home , so long ago .
1	Yielding , therefore , the chair at the bedside to the quaint old housekeeper , <NAME> sits at a table a little removed , sympathetically sighing .
1	' Here , <NAME> , show the gentleman in to <NAME> Lowten. ' ' The gen ' l ' m ' n can ' t go in just now , ' said a shambling pot-boy , with a red head , ' cos ' <NAME> ' s a-singin ' a comic song , and he ' ll put him out .
1	I had lapsed into a stupid state ; but I was recovering a little and looking forward to <NAME> , albeit <NAME> loomed behind him .
1	There was daily duty to discharge , and daily work to do -- for such commonplace spirits that are not heroic , often work hard with their hands -- and <NAME> was soon busy with her household tasks .
1	Wherever I looked I saw the ominous words that ran in it repeated .
1	Let 's see ; there 's <NAME> , one ; <NAME> , two ; Blackfriars , three ; <NAME> , four ; Westminster , five ; <NAME> , six. " He had checked off each bridge in its turn , with the handle of his safe-key on the palm of his hand .
1	Let him go on with the luggage , if you wish it , and do you follow with us .
1	Let my arm go ! ' ' Not yet .
1	Still , when the sun is on them , do they shine and glow like molten gold .
1	The polite and attentive stranger would desire , say , to consult her inclinations on the subject of potatoes .
1	Only because I am sure that you would too .
1	<NAME> little children ! ' ' Ah , poor little children ! ' said <NAME> .
1	' <NAME> that off ; ' which he did , with his right thumb on his left .
1	My Missis as I had the hard time wi ' -- Stop though !
1	' <NAME> is very nearly nineteen , ' replied the widow .
1	Its steeples and towers and its one great dome grow more ethereal ; its smoky house-tops lose their grossness in the pale effulgence ; the noises that arise from the streets are fewer and are softened , and the footsteps on the pavements pass more tranquilly away .
1	The <NAME> , husband and wife , came lumbering under the starlight , in their public vehicle , to that gate of <NAME> whereunto their journey naturally tended .
1	' So much the more is this whelp the only creature she has ever cared for , ' thought <NAME> , turning it over and over .
1	Have no imagination at all. " " I stand corrected ; do you suppose -- you go so far as to suppose , sometimes ? " " Now and then , " said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , perhaps thinking that such a process might be productive of inconvenience to himself , declined to offer the temptation , and , soon after , called up <NAME> .
1	Then they would climb and clamber upstairs with him , and romp about him on the sofa , or group themselves at his knee , a very nosegay of little faces , while he seemed to tell them some story .
1	You came into this world with the same dispositions , and you passed your younger days together surrounded by the same adverse circumstances .
1	Seeing that he was up and dressed , and that the room appeared to have been occupied ever since she quitted it on the previous evening , she stopped short , in some embarrassment .
1	During the delivery of the oration , Mrs. <NAME> sobbed and wept at the end of the paragraphs ; while <NAME> , sitting cross-legged on a chair and resting his arms on the top rail , regarded the speaker with great suavity and blandness of demeanour ; occasionally bestowing a look of recognition on the old gentleman , who was delighted at the beginning , and went to sleep about half-way .
1	' <NAME> as ever. ' ' And your mother , and the clergyman , and all of ' em ? ' ' Quite well. ' ' Where , ' said <NAME> , with an effort -- ' where is -- _she_ , <NAME> ? ' and he turned away his head , and covered his eyes with his hand .
1	" What have you done with your candle ? "
1	Standing on one side of his own peculiar fire ( for there are two ) , <NAME> .
1	Love to <NAME> at the next music-lesson. ' ' You expect <NAME> , then ? ' said <NAME> .
1	The look-out was kept , long after all was still again and the two steamers were gone ; but everybody knew that it was hopeless now .
1	My moral influence with them lads , ' added <NAME> , with deeper gravity , ' is a tottering to its basis .
1	' We should all try to discharge our duty , <NAME> , and I humbly endeavour to discharge mine , <NAME> ; but it is a hard trial to betray a master , <NAME> , whose clothes you wear , and whose bread you eat , even though he is a scoundrel , Sir. ' ' You are a very good fellow , ' said <NAME> , much affected ; ' an honest fellow. ' ' Come , come , ' interposed <NAME> , who had witnessed <NAME> ' s tears with considerable impatience , ' blow this ' ere water-cart bis ' ness .
1	I wish to prove to <NAME> that I can rise to a heighth of which perhaps she hardly thought me capable .
1	" Yours is a long life to look back upon , sir ? " said <NAME> , wistfully .
1	Many a budding president has walked into my room with his cap on his head and his hands in his pockets , and stared at me for two whole hours : occasionally refreshing himself with a tweak of his nose , or a draught from the water-jug ; or by walking to the windows and inviting other boys in the street below , to come up and do likewise : crying , ' Here he is ! ' ' Come on ! ' ' Bring all your brothers ! ' with other hospitable entreaties of that nature .
1	I felt so different from her , even making every allowance for the differences between a child and a woman ; I felt so poor , so trifling , and so far off that I never could be unrestrained with her -- no , could never even love her as I wished .
1	And I can always like you now , and your sister will not tease or trifle with you .
1	<NAME> to atone for his past neglect without another hour ' s delay , he straightway walked upstairs to <NAME> , and requested leave of absence for this laudable purpose .
1	' Because , ' said my aunt , ' it ' s all I have .
1	I tell you that you shall have as bad , and twice as bad , if you so much as open your mouths about him. ' ' If I catch him , ' said <NAME> , ' I ' ll only stop short of flaying him alive .
1	As luck would have it , <NAME> ' s friend was of a playful turn , and hearing <NAME> sigh , she took it into her head to rally the lovers on their lowness of spirits .
1	" Your woman 's wit hits the mark .
1	' Take care that other people know when to hold theirs. ' ' You jade , ' said <NAME> , ' if your husband has been idiot enough to trust you with his secrets , keep them ; keep them , she-devil that you are ! ' ' Not so much his secrets as other people ' s secrets , perhaps , ' retorted the woman ; ' not so much his secrets as yours .
1	' You will communicate with us again ? ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> officers are not so well paid that they can afford to refuse any little extra fee , when it comes to them in a civil and proper manner . '
1	Set me free ! ' ' <NAME> ? ' he repeated , ' Mrs Dombey ? ' ' Tell him , ' said <NAME> , addressing her proud face to <NAME> , ' that I wish for a separation between us , That there had better be one .
1	What should you say was the cause for those lights , now ? ' The scientific gentleman smilingly anticipated <NAME> ' s reply that he could assign no cause for them at all .
1	Constantly exercising an Art which brought him into mechanical harmony with others , and which could not have been pursued unless he and they had been in the nicest mechanical relations and unison , it is curious to consider that the spirit of the man was in moral accordance or interchange with nothing around him .
1	We asked a gentleman by us if he knew what cause was on .
1	" Your ladyship is acquainted with the name of <NAME> ? "
1	My hair had known no comb or brush since I left <NAME> .
1	By all means ! ' Assuming , with a shiver of resignation , a deadly cheerfulness .
1	And she spoke the truth .
1	At last , when he appealed by name to <NAME> , an <NAME> gentleman then and there present , who , like himself , had been a witness on that <NAME> trial and could corroborate his account of it , the <NAME> declared that they had heard enough , and that they were ready with their votes if the President were content to receive them .
1	I recollect trying to think about something ( about anything in the whole wide world , I was not particular ) without the smallest effect .
1	He had every reason given him to be so , but he was not ; and solely on his side , an estrangement began to arise between them .
1	YOU 'RE a moral character , " says the trooper , eyeing him in his large way with no small indignation ; " upon my life you are , <NAME> ! "
1	<NAME> , <NAME> quack , Bow-wow ! ' And then trotted silently downstairs , with his shoulders in a state of the liveliest commotion .
1	Though that seems wretchedly prejudiced—does it not ? —for I never saw him .
1	" His successor is in my house now -- in possession , I think he calls it .
1	What I ha getn , I mun mak th ' best on. ' ' <NAME> , ' said the chairman , rising , ' think on ' t agen .
1	It is the <NAME> thing altogether .
1	' The race that one has started in , ' said he .
1	' Will you go and see if <NAME> is on the lock ? ' She was at his side , and touching him , but he still perversely supposed her to be in her seat , and called out , still leaning over the table , ' Amy , <NAME> .
1	Mr Boffin heard of you through a certain Mr Lightwood .
1	' I shall thus have much improvement to effect in my sweet child , ' Mrs <NAME> continued , ' and can not have her near me too soon .
1	So far from having high connections I have no connections at all , and I come of the scum of the earth .
1	<NAME> <NAME> ' s half sorry he advised you now .
1	To the <NAME> , therefore , I directed my steps .
1	Besides all this , when we were five or six days out , there began to be much talk of icebergs , of which wandering islands an unusual number had been seen by the vessels that had come into <NAME> a day or two before we left that port , and of whose dangerous neighbourhood we were warned by the sudden coldness of the weather , and the sinking of the mercury in the barometer .
1	<NAME> crowding reflections , increasing the distress and fear I always felt when the name was mentioned , made me so agitated that I could scarcely hold my place at the table .
1	Stamp them into the dust ; so that you take me , were it even mortally hating me ! ' The frightful vehemence of the man , now reaching its full height , so additionally terrifies her as to break the spell that has held her to the spot .
1	perhaps <NAME> first , ' I admitted , with a blush .
1	' But no doubt you are a good deal changed since then , sir ? ' ' Probably , ' said I .
1	'She 's always a-doin ' of it , <NAME> , sir ; she chucks me under the chin , please , sir ; and makes all manner of love ! '
1	Another fisherman was picked up here -- and that so silently , that if <NAME> had been superstitious , he might have supposed the second follower of the gentle craft to have , all of a sudden , split himself into two .
1	But there are unexpressed confidences , Mr Clennam ; and as you have been together intimately among these people , I can not doubt that a confidence of that sort exists in the present case .
1	There ' s <NAME> , and <NAME> , and now here ' s another little stranger. ' ' A female stranger ? ' inquires the <NAME> .
1	That ' s all over long ago .
1	This is a way of life which reminds me of the period when I was myself in a state of celibacy , and Mrs. Micawber had not yet been solicited to plight her faith at the <NAME> altar. ' ' He means , solicited by him , <NAME> , ' said Mrs. Micawber , archly .
1	' You Bob <NAME> , ' said <NAME> to this pot-boy , ' run round to <NAME> ' s and tell his daughter <NAME> that I want to speak to her. ' With exemplary swiftness <NAME> departed , and returned .
1	The confined room , strong of parchment-grease , is warehouse , counting-house , and copying-office .
1	<NAME> perhaps , but so it is ! "
1	So hurrah for the <NAME> , <NAME> !
1	And yet she lay down , with nothing between her and the sky ; and , with no fear for herself , for she was past it now , put up a prayer for the poor old man .
1	As they passed where he sat , <NAME> looked so wistfully at the little turn-out , that the old gentleman looked at him .
1	<NAME> fell upon the ground but a few particles of froth , which slowly detached themselves from the rim , and trickled lazily down .
1	Standing , as it were , apart with her on the edge of his grave , not all the staring curiosity that looked on , could , for the moment , nerve him to remain quite still .
1	On the anniversary of her birthday , which was upon the nineteenth of July [ ' at ten minutes past three o ' clock in the morning , ' thought Mrs. Nickleby in a parenthesis , ' for I recollect asking what o ' clock it was ' ) , <NAME> would give a great feast to all his tenants , and would return them three and a half per cent on the amount of their last half-year ' s rent , as would be fully described and recorded in the fashionable intelligence , to the immeasurable delight and admiration of all the readers thereof .
1	After a time she arose , and with feeble and tottering steps ascended the street .
1	So the girl eyed him .
1	She walked on as before , growing more familiar with me as we proceeded and talking cheerfully by the way , but she said no more about her home , beyond remarking that we were going quite a new road and asking if it were a short one .
1	I turn my head , and see it , in its beautiful serenity , beside me .
1	He passed a great many public-houses ; but , at length paused before one in a by-way , whose parlour , as he gathered from a hasty peep over the blinds , was deserted , save by one solitary customer .
1	' Surely , surely , ' returned <NAME> .
1	" And not being the richer for trusting in a rotten reed , " said my guardian , laying his hand emphatically on the sleeve of <NAME> 's dressing-gown , " be you very careful not to encourage him in that reliance , <NAME> . "
1	I told him that he addressed my interest or what he supposed to be my interest quite as unsuccessfully as he addressed my inclination , and he would now understand that I requested him , if he pleased , to go away immediately .
1	She was so preoccupied that at first she did not know me , though she sat looking at me with that curious , <NAME> , far-off look of hers .
1	Nothing but mysteries in connection with <NAME> ' s house .
1	' I should not allow , ' said <NAME> , with an evident increase of pious sentiment , and slowly shaking his head as he poised himself upon his toes and heels alternately , ' my suitable provision for my child to be influenced by a piece of youthful folly like the present .
1	And what a happy wife ! ' ' Aye , missus , I suppose she be , ' said <NAME> .
1	Anywhere in the immediate vicinity there might be seen pictures of ships speeding away full sail to all parts of the world ; outfitting warehouses ready to pack off anybody anywhere , fully equipped in half an hour ; and little timber midshipmen in obsolete naval uniforms , eternally employed outside the shop doors of nautical Instrument-makers in taking observations of the hackney carriages .
1	His face was a queer , good-tempered , crooked-featured piece of workmanship , ornamented with a couple of eyes that must have worn a very joyous expression at one time , for they sparkled yet .
1	As ever I took of you .
1	When am I to get my money ready ?
1	<NAME> -- little Jack -- man with a cast in his eye , and slight impediment in his speech -- man who sat for somebody ' s borough .
1	Everything about him tended to confirm him in the custom of looking on himself as an elderly man , from whom such aspirations as he had combated in the case of <NAME> ( though that was not so long ago either , reckoning by months and seasons ) , were finally departed .
1	And as our utmost endeavours could only elicit from <NAME> himself sweeping assurances that everything was going on capitally and that it really was all right at last , our anxiety was not much relieved by him .
1	It was not alluded to in any way , and no pale young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises .
1	This he had several times hinted at the club : in connexion with little jocularities , of which old <NAME> , old <NAME> , old J. Bagstock , old <NAME> , or so forth , was the perpetual theme : it being , as it were , the <NAME> ' s stronghold and donjon-keep of light humour , to be on the most familiar terms with his own name .
1	And , my good fellow , if you will open your bedevilments to me when they come thick upon you , I may show you better ways out of them than you can find for yourself. ' ' Thank you , ' said <NAME> , shaking his head dismally , and chewing rosebuds .
1	Because , in minds that have been practically formed by rule and line , from the cradle upwards , this is so curious , so incomprehensible. ' ' Stop a bit ! ' cried <NAME> , who all this time had been standing , as before , on the hearth , bursting at the very furniture of the room with explosive humility .
1	As the trooper speaks , he conducts them to the other end of the gallery and opens one of the little cabins .
1	I tried to look at my pet in the wisest manner , but of course I could n't .
1	<NAME> <NAME> opens both the doors exactly as he would have done yesterday , or as he would have done ten years ago , and makes his old-fashioned bow as she passes out .
1	We had one favourite spot , deep in moss and last year 's leaves , where there were some felled trees from which the bark was all stripped off .
1	' Nothing , thank you , ' rejoined <NAME> .
1	It did not , however , so continue .
1	She was waiting at the foot of the stairs -- was sitting on the bottom stair , in fact -- to receive Pa when he came down , but her only object seemed to be to get Pa well out of the house .
1	" You said about ten , " Tony repeats .
1	Say I am , my child ; say " yes " , dear boy , and <NAME> will love you ; and <NAME> ' s love is a great deal better than mine , <NAME> .
1	<NAME> <NAME> takes out his papers , asks permission to place them on a golden talisman of a table at my <NAME> 's elbow , puts on his spectacles , and begins to read by the light of a shaded lamp .
1	I thought that kind of life was on all hands understood to be -- eh ? ' ' It is education for a very grave profession , if you mean that , <NAME> , ' Mrs. <NAME> answered with some coldness .
1	' By your look. ' He seemed very much amused , and laughed as heartily as it was in his nature to laugh .
1	I shall very well know how to manage and smooth old Bounderby ! ' Their shadows were defined upon the wall , but those of the high presses in the room were all blended together on the wall and on the ceiling , as if the brother and sister were overhung by a dark cavern .
1	He ruminated for a minute ; eyeing the broker , meanwhile , as a deep genius ; and then called the Instrument-maker aside .
1	He had to think , too , of Mr Toots , and Mr Feeder , <NAME> , of all the boys ; and of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> ; of home , and of his aunt and <NAME> ; of his father ; <NAME> and <NAME> , <NAME> with the poor old Uncle who had got the money he wanted , and that gruff-voiced Captain with the iron hand .
1	Look out in that direction. ' ' Sir , it shall be done. ' ' Casting my eye over the accounts , I find that branch of business pays pretty fairly , and I am game for extending it .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , I believed you true , and I was blest in so believing , but now I mourn that e ' er I knew , a girl so fair yet so deceiving. ' Miss <NAME> bit her lip and affected to look with great interest after Mr Cheggs , who was quaffing lemonade in the distance .
1	It being now dark , the shutter was closed , and a candle lighted and placed upon the table .
1	' The best thing to be done , sir , will be for <NAME> to give you a hoist up into the tree , and perhaps <NAME> will have the goodness to see that nobody comes up the lane , while I watch at the other end of the garden .
1	A drowsy city , <NAME> , whose inhabitants seem to suppose , with an inconsistency more strange than rare , that all its changes lie behind it , and that there are no more to come .
1	Mr <NAME> was so astonished , and so uncomfortable , and so perfectly at a loss how to pursue the conversation , that he could only sit looking at his son by the light of the fire , with his hand resting on his back , as if it were detained there by some magnetic attraction .
1	The water was trickling out of a leaky butt , and a most wretched cat was lapping up the drops with the sickly eagerness of starvation .
1	The reversal of the two natures , in their relative positions , <NAME> ' s of power and <NAME> ' s of dependence , was a sight more painful to me than I can express .
1	' With respect to the pecuniary assistance enabling us to launch our frail canoe on the ocean of enterprise , I have reconsidered that important business-point ; and would beg to propose my notes of hand -- drawn , it is needless to stipulate , on stamps of the amounts respectively required by the various Acts of <NAME> applying to such securities -- at eighteen , twenty-four , and thirty months .
1	The grave beneath the tree , where both my parents lay -- on which I had looked out , when it was my father ' s only , with such curious feelings of compassion , and by which I had stood , so desolate , when it was opened to receive my pretty mother and her baby -- the grave which <NAME> ' s own faithful care had ever since kept neat , and made a garden of , I walked near , by the hour .
1	All this , so quickly , that her exclamation and her dead condition seem to have passed away like the features of those long-preserved dead bodies sometimes opened up in tombs , which , struck by the air like lightning , vanish in a breath .
1	This was a vagrant of sixty-five , who was going to prison for _not_ playing the flute ; or , in other words , for begging in the streets , and doing nothing for his livelihood .
1	It came into my head that he must have occupied this very vault of mine , and I got out of bed to assure myself that there were no red marks about ; then opened the door to look out into the passages , and cheer myself with the companionship of a distant light , near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing .
1	Who _could _have told you that , <NAME> ? ' ' Ah , to be sure , ' said <NAME> , with a cunning look , ' that ' s the pint .
1	Let him do it , if it must be done , when I am not here to see it .
1	' Yes , sir , it was , ' replied <NAME> ; ' and _blue bore_ , <NAME> , if you like that better ; ha !
1	" I have been quite alarmed .
1	' He is very , very ill , ' said <NAME> .
1	I will simply make statements , therefore , and not put questions .
1	There are no words which can express , nothing with which can be compared , the perfect pallor , the clear transparent whiteness , of the beautiful face which turned towards him when he entered .
1	The rain had been thick and heavy all day , and with little intermission for many days .
1	She looked in amazement at her sister and would have asked a question , but that <NAME> with a warning frown pointed to a curtained doorway of communication with another room .
1	<NAME> <NAME> re-asserts it by another inclination of his head .
1	' To be sure , ' said <NAME> , by no means disconcerted .
1	The young man inclines his head in acknowledgment of the precepts of experience .
1	' It will not be hard to find a trade for him. ' <NAME> being buried under mountains now , the Secretary that very same day set himself to finish his affairs and have done with him .
1	Not that <NAME> care for such society , you know !
1	Without a word , without a shadow on the fire of her bright eye , without abatement of her awful smile , she looked on Mr Dombey to the last , in moving to the door ; and left him .
1	All this was food for my secret mirth , and I laughed behind the white handkerchief which I held up to my face , as we rode home , till the tears came into my eyes .
1	<NAME> face , sunken eyes , hollow cheeks , beard of three days ' growth , wasted flesh , short thick breath ; it was the very ghost of <NAME> .
1	He was a long way down the sunny street , and was making expressive gestures for me to stop .
1	' An old acquaintance of mine , sir , an old pensioner. ' And then said , ' Be covered , my good <NAME> ; put your hat on , ' with great consideration .
1	It made her very sad to know that this was so -- so sad to see it that sometimes when he sat idly by , smiling and nodding to her when she looked round , or when he caressed some little child and carried it to and fro , as he was fond of doing by the hour together , perplexed by its simple questions , yet patient under his own infirmity , and seeming almost conscious of it too , and humbled even before the mind of an infant -- so sad it made her to see him thus , that she would burst into tears , and , withdrawing into some secret place , fall down upon her knees and pray that he might be restored .
1	<NAME> , rain , or sunshine , you can ' t walk half a dozen yards up the street , without encountering half a dozen green parasols. ' Here the little man indulged in a convulsion of mirth , which was only checked by the entrance of a third party .
1	But , in the absence of any such miraculous provision , my desire was to apply myself to some pursuit that would not lie too heavily upon her purse ; and to do my duty in it , whatever it might be .
1	It appeared , under the circumstances , rather agreeable to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses , and often barely escaping from being run down .
1	Taunts the beadle in shrill youthful voices with having boiled a boy , choruses fragments of a popular song to that effect and importing that the boy was made into soup for the workhouse .
1	But I must say , even to you , having known this injured family from childhood , that if you suppose the girl , so deeply wronged , has not been cruelly deluded , and would not rather die a hundred deaths than take a cup of water from your son ' s hand now , you cherish a terrible mistake. ' ' Well , <NAME> , well ! ' said Mrs. <NAME> , as the other was about to interpose , ' it is no matter .
1	The chaining of the door behind her , as she went forth , disenchanted <NAME> of that first relief she had felt .
1	If two angels could be concerned in it , I believe it would change their nature . "
1	<NAME> went last , and closed the door .
1	He was a quiet , plain , steady man ; made no attempt to escape ; and seemed a little depressed , but neither ashamed nor repentant .
1	" <NAME> , " I interrupted , pettishly , " how can you call me , sir ? " <NAME> looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like reproach .
1	I give ' em away to the young ladies .
1	Not so , however , Mr Sparkler .
1	But <NAME> , instead of sharing in those transports , tried to check them ( though very kindly ) , and looked confused and out of sorts .
1	It is among their dignities .
1	She certainly held down her head , and examined the corner of a very smart little apron , with more closeness than there appeared any absolute occasion for .
1	At sight of her child , Mrs. <NAME> started ; suddenly recollecting herself , she kissed him in a frantic manner ; then relapsing into a state of hysterical imbecility , the good lady requested to be informed where she was .
1	Let us make the friendly move of agreeing to look for it together .
1	<NAME> <NAME> being by this time deep in the bill of costs , took no notice whatever of <NAME> , but went scratching on , with a noisy pen , scoring down the figures with evident delight , and working like a steam-engine .
1	' There , precious ! ' said the <NAME> , when she ceased ; and deep attention the <NAME> had paid to her while she spoke ; listening , with his glazed hat all awry and his mouth wide open .
1	I ' ve been a- turnin ' the bis ' ness over in my mind , and he may make his-self easy , <NAME> .
1	But on the contrary , comrade , what MAY we find ?
1	He was obliged to sit close to it , and brood over it , before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel .
1	There are dark pools of water , muddy lanes , and miserable habitations far below .
1	It shrunk , collapsed , and dwindled down into a bedpost .
1	The attitude was that of one who sought the heat .
1	'So do I , ' cried <NAME> .
1	Then observing that his companion was fast asleep , he added in an earnest whisper , ' <NAME> ' s the friend , remember -- not Short. ' ' Making some nosegays , ' the child replied ; ' I am going to try and sell some , these three days of the races .
1	' I have made head against many trials ; but the misery of another , and such misery , is involved in this one , that I declare to you I am rendered desperate , and know not how to act. ' In truth , it did seem a hopeless case .
1	Again , <NAME> , in pursuit of her strong purpose with reference to her father , and her steady resolution to believe that she was herself unwittingly to blame for their so cold and distant relations , would recall to mind that this gentleman was his confidential friend , and would think , with an anxious heart , could her struggling tendency to dislike and fear him be a part of that misfortune in her , which had turned her father ' s love adrift , and left her so alone ?
1	Some of the rest lingered a little , marrying golden liqueur glasses to <NAME> tables with sticky rings ; on the desperate chance of Mr Merdle ' s saying something .
1	' She ' ll never get better as long as you ' re here. ' All the ladies concurred in this opinion ; so <NAME> was pushed out of the room , and requested to give himself an airing in the back yard .
1	The planter ' s house was an airy , rustic dwelling , that brought <NAME> ' s description of such places strongly to my recollection .
1	" It was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say , " she remarked , directing her eyes to the ships again .
1	When <NAME> 's nephew laughed in this way : holding his sides , rolling his head , and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions : <NAME> 's niece , by marriage , laughed as heartily as he .
1	They have never given ME any vexation ; quite the contrary .
1	Then , he launched into a general eulogium on the <NAME> .
1	He mended his pace , keeping his eyes upon the light with a strange intensity , as if he were taking aim at it .
1	' We mustn ' t let him go ?
1	The man who could have any one he chose to dine with him , and who had made the money !
1	' To-morrow morning , sir , we give a public breakfast -- a _fete champetre_ -- to a great number of those who have rendered themselves celebrated by their works and talents .
1	Finally Mr Podsnap telegraphs to Mrs Veneering , ' We have brought him in. ' Another gorgeous dinner awaits them on their return to the Veneering halls , and <NAME> awaits them , and <NAME> and <NAME> await them .
1	He is journeying to-day into the iron country farther north to look about him .
1	<NAME> looks ' Excuse me , ' towards Mrs Veneering , goes out , and finds <NAME> , <NAME> ' s clerk , at the hall-door .
1	I heard of these doings of yours only last night , or you should have heard of ' em from me , sooner , take your oath of it .
1	The waking traveller , therefore , stole a little nearer , and yet a little nearer , and a little nearer to the sleeping traveller ' s bed , until he stood close beside it .
1	It ' s the most singular circumstance I ever knew. ' Undoubtedly it was singular , that if <NAME> did feel a strong interest in <NAME> , it should not rather have been the interest of a maiden aunt or grandmother ; that being the conclusion to which the difference in their respective ages would have naturally tended .
1	Pack up your things directly !
1	Are the two so deeply separated in this town , that there is no place whatever for an honest workman between them ? ' <NAME> shook her head in silence .
1	I can not deny that I shed tears .
1	" I ' ll help you , " says I ; and off we set -- the wrong wa ' !
1	' Very disagreeable , <NAME> , and so was Lavvy. ' ' They are sometimes a little liable to it , ' observed the patient cherub ; ' but I hope you made allowances , <NAME> , my dear ? ' ' No .
1	Copperfield. ' ' I am glad to see you , sir .
1	I should like a drink , ' said <NAME> ; but without appearing to attend much .
1	<NAME> <NAME> walked all the way , and talked to me so kind , it quite knocked me over .
1	I was to go abroad .
1	My father and <NAME> never met again .
1	' Before I hear you , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , when the door was closed , ' I wish you to hear me. ' ' To be addressed by <NAME> , ' he returned , ' even in accents of unmerited reproach , is an honour I so greatly esteem , that although I were not her servant in all things , I should defer to such a wish , most readily. ' ' If you are charged by the man whom you have just now left , <NAME> ; ' Mr <NAME> raised his eyes , as if he were going to counterfeit surprise , but she met them , and stopped him , if such were his intention ; ' with any message to me , do not attempt to deliver it , for I will not receive it .
1	Who 's the worse for the loss of a few things like these ?
1	' Thou changest me from bad to good .
1	I was delighted that he should know it ; I was delighted that he should feel keenly , and I hoped he did .
1	" I told you this was the growlery , my dear .
1	Yet it would never do to run away from him .
1	He added in a low voice , ' With my tiddle tol toor rul ' -- when he was providentially stopped by <NAME> , who announced : ' <NAME> ! ' And enter that fair enslaver , with a blue nose and indescribably frosty face , referable to her being very thinly clad in a maze of fluttering odds and ends , to do honour to the ceremony .
1	At length , towards break of day , that deep sleep came upon her which succeeds to weariness and over-watching , and which has no consciousness but one of overpowering and irresistible enjoyment .
1	' I couldn ' t believe my eyes .
1	' But I want you to know , my love .
1	The <NAME> changed the motion of her head , which had not yet left off nodding , and suddenly began to shake it from side to side , with a vehemence which threatened to dislocate her neck .
1	You see this place ; you know what sort of a place it is ; you are aware that there ' s not a completer place of its size in this kingdom or elsewhere—I don ' t care where—and here , got into the middle of it , like a maggot into a nut , is <NAME> .
1	' What light is that ! ' said the younger brother .
1	They spoke in such a tone as they would have used if they had been watching by a sick-bed in the night .
1	The boat had returned , and his guard were ready , so we followed him to the landing-place made of rough stakes and stones , and saw him put into the boat , which was rowed by a crew of convicts like himself .
1	So , with great perseverance and untiring industry , he prospered .
1	They came out of the avenue next moment , arm-in-arm as they had entered it : and the trees seemed to close up behind them in the darkness , like their own perspective of the past .
1	You were to have universal concord , and were to get it by eliminating all the people who wouldn ' t , or conscientiously couldn ' t , be concordant .
1	The only circumstance which gave me any new hope , was my aunt ' s stopping on the stairs to inquire about a smell of fire that was prevalent there ; and janet ' s replying that she had been making tinder down in the kitchen , of my old shirt .
1	Her step towards the door brings her front to front with <NAME> .
1	" A young lady 's walking shoe , " he muttered , without looking up .
1	You don ' t see the reg ' lar wagrants there ; trust ' em , they knows better than that .
1	'Then perhaps she 'll go off in that way , if you do n't make a row , ' said the young man .
1	After settling this question , he said a word to Mr Doyce about this Gowan -- who would have run in his head a good deal , if he had been his rival .
1	After a few words of preparation , we then went in search of <NAME> , whom we found , grouped with his hat and gloves , as a model of deportment , on the sofa in his private apartment -- the only comfortable room in the house .
1	There was a terror in every ash that dropped out of the fire .
1	I want you to burn something for me. ' ' What ? ' ' Only this folded paper .
1	I have a great respect for <NAME> , and no one in whom he is interested can be an object of indifference to me . "
1	My anger was roused in behalf of an absent , friendless stranger .
1	<NAME> ' t let her come here , <NAME> ! ' which was a corruption of <NAME> .
1	<NAME> said how laudable this was in Mrs Pipchin , relict of a man who had died of the <NAME> mines ; and what a staunch , high , independent spirit the old lady had .
1	On the grounds that it ' s well understood along the cause ' ays and the stairs that he done it .
1	' Take care of the last step , <NAME> .
1	I found , now I had leisure to count them , that there were no fewer than six little <NAME> present , in various stages of tumbling up .
1	To divert his thoughts from this melancholy subject , I informed <NAME> that I relied upon him for a bowl of punch , and led him to the lemons .
1	Then <NAME> , instructed by <NAME> , shook hands with the four young gentlemen at Mr Feeder ' s desk ; then with the two young gentlemen at work on the problems , who were very feverish ; then with the young gentleman at work against time , who was very inky ; and lastly with the young gentleman in a state of stupefaction , who was flabby and quite cold .
1	Is he ready to go ?
1	I hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see him , even though a gentleman , for you had ever a good heart , and he is a worthy , worthy man .
1	'Pretty well , thank you , sir ' replied Oliver , with considerable hesitation .
1	The old housekeeper dying at the end of that time , <NAME> promoted <NAME> to the situation , on condition of her marrying <NAME> at once , which she did without a murmur .
1	The poor child clings to her for awhile , as she clings to him , and then , when the old man calls , he says " I must go !
1	' And the other rioter -- what ' s his name , <NAME> ? ' ' Tupman , Sir. ' Tupman is the second ? ' ' Yes. ' ' The other principal , you say , has absconded , ma ' am ? ' ' Yes , ' replied <NAME> , with a short cough .
1	' Former pastrycook and Muffin-maker , much respected ; ' introducing gravestone .
1	For I did love him once .
1	In a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that <NAME> had arrived from <NAME> , and would be happy to see the gentleman from <NAME> 's .
1	' The cause is too good a one to fail. ' They arranged to proceed upon their journey next evening , as a stage-waggon , which travelled for some distance on the same road as they must take , would stop at the inn to change horses , and the driver for a small gratuity would give <NAME> a place inside .
1	There is <NAME> , clerk to <NAME> and <NAME> , who was at first as open as the sun at noon , but who suddenly shut up as close as midnight , under the influence -- no doubt -- of <NAME> 's suborning and tampering .
1	I must do <NAME> the further justice of saying that he had looked more and more ashamed and that he looked most ashamed and very earnest when he now replied with a burning face , " Upon my word and honour , upon my life , upon my soul , <NAME> , as I am a living man , I 'll act according to your wish !
1	As he went his way , up the ancient street , he saw the cheerful light of the blazing fires gleam through the old casements , and heard the loud laugh and the cheerful shouts of those who were assembled around them ; he marked the bustling preparations for next day ' s cheer , and smelled the numerous savoury odours consequent thereupon , as they steamed up from the kitchen windows in clouds .
1	Some purpose , strong enough to fill up any pause , possessed her .
1	If a man don ' t wrap up , ' said the Major , taking in another button of his buff waistcoat , ' he has nothing to fall back upon .
1	' The only name I could possibly care to know , to-night. ' ' Sissy Jupe. ' ' Pardon my curiosity at parting .
1	He had loved <NAME> from the hour of his danger .
1	So I shall have time gradually to make her familiar with my hopes , as opportunities offer .
1	Secondly and thirdly , an honest young Yorkshireman , connected with some <NAME> house ; domiciled in that same city , and carrying thither his beautiful young wife to whom he had been married but a fortnight , and who was the fairest specimen of a comely <NAME> country girl I have ever seen .
1	' I heard of no one having died. ' ' She lived in another hamlet , my dear , ' returned the sexton .
1	Are you there , my friend ?
1	Monsieur the <NAME> ran his eyes over them all , as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes .
1	My uncle , gentlemen , ' said the bagman , ' was one of the merriest , pleasantest , cleverest fellows , that ever lived .
1	' I heard from <NAME> , ' said the Patriarch with his benevolent smile , ' that she was coming to call , coming to call .
1	All others belonging to him have gone to the <NAME> and the Glory , and I have a mind that they ' re drawing him to them -- leading him away. ' ' No , no , no , ' said <NAME> .
1	But she asked him , in a rapid , urgent manner , to let her stay -- to let her feel assured ( I heard her murmur some broken words to this effect ) that she was in his confidence that night .
1	" I take it , " he says , making just as much and as little change in his position as will enable him to reach the glass to his lips with a round , full action , " that I am the only man alive ( or dead either ) that gets the value of a pipe out of <NAME> ? "
1	[ ' With a morbid expectation , ' murmured <NAME> to <NAME> , ' that somebody is always going to tell him the truth. ' ) ' This is <NAME> ' s boat , ' said Mr Inspector .
1	said the <NAME> , stopping short when there had been a long silence ; and addressing <NAME> .
1	' Whatever it be , ' said <NAME> , flushed with anger , ' I shall not look to you to make it more. ' ' Nicholas , my dear , recollect yourself , ' remonstrated Mrs. Nickleby .
1	A delightful walk it was ; for it was a pleasant afternoon in June , and their way lay through a deep and shady wood , cooled by the light wind which gently rustled the thick foliage , and enlivened by the songs of the birds that perched upon the boughs .
1	" So you gave him notice ? "
1	<NAME> , you have addressed some remarks to me. ' <NAME> turned round , bent his head meekly , and smiled .
1	Such a marriage would irretrievably blight my son ' s career , and ruin his prospects .
1	" This is a day , " said <NAME> , gaily taking a little claret in a tumbler , " that will ever be remembered here .
1	<NAME> drew it suddenly away , and , for a moment , looked at her with the same strange dread ( there was a sort of wild avoidance in it ) as before ; but she presently said , ' Nothing , nothing .
1	<NAME> sobs out that she is very sorry to leave my <NAME> , and that she was happy at <NAME> , and has been happy with my Lady , and that she thanks my Lady over and over again .
1	I didn ' t know what to make of it , till this gentleman favoured us with his first visit .
1	It seems like a dream. ' With the view , no doubt , of testing the reality of his position , Mr <NAME> pushed his tumbler as he spoke towards Mrs Jiniwin for the purpose of being replenished ; and turned towards the attendant mariners .
1	Thinking of her , and of the possibility of her father ' s release from prison by the unbarring hand of death -- the only change of circumstance he could foresee that might enable him to be such a friend to her as he wished to be , by altering her whole manner of life , smoothing her rough road , and giving her a home -- he regarded her , in that perspective , as his adopted daughter , his poor child of the <NAME> hushed to rest .
1	He is among us ! " " Among us ! " from the universal throat again .
1	It ' s his right evening , and he ' s very regular. ' ' I suppose , ' said Mr Toodle , relishing his meal infinitely , ' as our <NAME> is a doin ' now about as well as a boy can do , eh , <NAME> ? ' ' Oh !
1	Then she would flit along the yard , climb the scores of stairs that led to her room , and take her seat at the window .
1	' With what I shall call your unhallowed opinions , you have been quite shocking this lady : who , as I have already told you , is a born lady , and who , as I have not already told you , has had her own marriage misfortunes to the tune of tens of thousands of pounds—tens of Thousands of <NAME> ! ' ( he repeated it with great relish ) .
1	There was mutton , a steak , and an apple-pie -- nothing in the remotest way connected with ganders -- and the dinner went on like a disenchanted feast , as it truly was .
1	<NAME> <NAME> presented her , and his lordship begged her to sit down near him .
1	' It will be enough to say that this was not the case ; that she was not happy ; that they fell into complicated distresses and difficulties ; that she came , twelve months before her death , to appeal to my old friendship ; sadly changed , sadly altered , broken-spirited from suffering and ill-usage , and almost broken-hearted .
1	' <NAME> , junior , if you don ' t leave off chattering your teeth , and shaking with the cold , I ' ll warm you with a severe thrashing in about half a minute ' s time. ' ' Sit fast here , genelmen , ' said the guard as he clambered up .
1	He went away this morning , father , and he cried very much at going , and he hoped you would forgive him. ' ' Let him never come a nigh me to ask me my forgiveness , ' said the father , again emphasizing his words with the knife .
1	I speak , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ' as a female , necessarily ; but I have always been of opinion that <NAME> possesses what I have heard my papa call , when I lived at home , the judicial mind ; and I hope <NAME> is now entering on a field where that mind will develop itself , and take a commanding station. ' I quite believe that <NAME> saw himself , in his judicial mind ' s eye , on the woolsack .
1	You told me you had a proposal ; what is it ?
1	' I ' ll tell you how I did it , ' said the delighted <NAME> , putting his hair into a condition as elevated as himself .
1	I mean <NAME> ! ' My heart quite died within me .
1	You are wet , and you look weary .
1	<NAME> is pounds , shillings , and pence .
1	<NAME> and louder yet , it shrieks and cries as it comes tearing on resistless to the goal : and now its way , still like the way of <NAME> , is strewn with ashes thickly .
1	Within a few minutes of our stopping , not before , I saw two great white clouds rising up slowly and majestically from the depths of the earth .
1	The tall man was standing in the snug little bar , with his hands behind him , quite at home .
1	This unlucky morning , of all mornings in the year , was the morning next after Mr <NAME> ' s interview with <NAME> in her little carriage .
1	But when I stole a glance at her and saw her so composed and distant and unapproachable , I felt this to be a foolish weakness .
1	' What _can_ he mean by this ? ' said <NAME> , when the horse had executed this manoeuvre for the twentieth time .
1	It ' s enough for me to see how loving you and your husband are .
1	For anything I know , he was eating something to keep the raw morning air out ; but he made motions with his mouth as if the pear were ripe already , and he were smacking his lips over it .
1	If you had been another sort of nephew , you would have come into possession ( so says the will , and I see no reason to doubt it ) of five-and-twenty thousand pounds .
1	' <NAME> dear , ' said <NAME> , with a melancholy smile , ' after what has passed , I am sure Ma will tell Pa that he may tell Bella we shall all be glad to see her and her husband. ' Mr <NAME> said he was sure of it too ; murmuring how eminently he respected <NAME> , and ever must , and ever would .
1	' I have stood before him face to face , and he crushed me down in the dirt of his contempt , and walked over me .
1	<NAME> <NAME> salutes the gentleman but otherwise sits bolt upright and profoundly silent -- very forward in his chair , as if the full complement of regulation appendages for a field-day hung about him .
1	<NAME> heard her father speak to Mr Carker sometimes on business matters , and heard him softly reply , but she paid little attention to what they said , and only wished the dinner at an end .
1	But it appeared to me -- I dare say magnifying the importance of the thing -- that it was respectful to explain to you how the matter stood and candid to consult your wishes and convenience .
1	<NAME> is uncommonly fond of you , Trot. ' ' There is nothing she would leave undone to prove it , ' said I .
1	It is a pot of money. " For it IS a pot , ' said Mr Riderhood , with candour , ' and why deny it ? ' ' Hear ! ' from <NAME> as he touched his drawing .
1	<NAME> macaroons , glittering liqueurs , magically-preserved tropical spices , and jellies of celestial tropical fruits , displayed themselves profusely at an instant ' s notice .
1	It is not flattering to my self-love , but I am afraid you did. ' ' How could you be so cruel ? ' ' O Mr Wrayburn , ' she answered , suddenly breaking into tears , ' is the cruelty on my side !
1	It seemed to fill to inconvenience the little bar in which the widow landlady and her two daughters received him ; it was much too big for the narrow wainscoted room with a bagatelle-board in it , that was first proposed for his reception ; it perfectly swamped the little private holiday sitting-room of the family , which was finally given up to him .
1	So here I am , a poor devil of an artist. ' <NAME> was beginning , ' But on the other hand -- ' when <NAME> took him up .
1	' I thought perhaps you wouldn ' t mind , in this fine weather , coming home by water , <NAME> .
1	Keep me always at it , and I ' ll keep you always at it , you keep somebody else always at it .
1	From the exterior of <NAME> 's Shooting Gallery , and the long entry , and the bare perspective beyond it , <NAME> augurs well .
1	He is standing close to the lazy gentleman , and says with a faint smile that he believes She is a very strong <NAME> ; to which the lazy gentleman , looking first in his questioner ' s eye and then very hard in the wind ' s , answers unexpectedly and ominously , that She need be .
1	Staggering as if struck by lightning , he lost his balance and tumbled over the parapet .
1	Or he may have been muddled altogether by long staring at whatever he HAS got , and by drink , and by hanging about the <NAME> 's Court and hearing of documents for ever , " returns <NAME> .
1	She was much given to tying up her head in a pocket-handkerchief , knotted under the chin .
1	The military band outside the building struck up " God save the <NAME> " with great vigour before his <NAME> had quite finished ; the people shouted ; the in ' s rubbed their hands ; the out ' s shook their heads ; the Government party said there never was such a good speech ; the <NAME> declared there never was such a bad one ; the Speaker and members of the <NAME> of <NAME> withdrew from the bar to say a great deal among themselves and do a little : and , in short , everything went on , and promised to go on , just as it does at home upon the like occasions .
1	Shutting his eyes and rolling .
1	The Augurs of the <NAME> invariably predict that when <NAME> and that finger are in much conference , a terrible avenger will be heard of before long .
1	To catch up in her arms the sick child who was dear to her , and hide it as if it were a criminal , and keep off all ministration but such as her own ignorant tenderness and patience could supply , had become this woman ' s idea of maternal love , fidelity , and duty .
1	Although <NAME> had roused himself from sleep , he was not thoroughly awake .
1	But this little death has made me ask myself the question , seriously , whether I wasn ' t too bent upon pleasing myself .
1	' I shall do you a mischief ! '
1	Yes , and a wery good place it is to live in , ain ' t it ? ' As <NAME> turned somewhat fiercely upon <NAME> in saying this , and moreover muttered in an excited fashion certain unpleasant invocations concerning his own eyes , limbs , and circulating fluids , the latter gentleman deemed it advisable to pursue the discourse no further .
1	" Pass that torch slowly along these walls , that I may see them , " said <NAME> to the turnkey .
1	' <NAME> ! ' cried <NAME> , ' at <NAME> !
1	' Was the boys sorry to see me in such a dreadful condition , <NAME> , or was they glad ? ' asked <NAME> , in a sentimental manner .
1	Lately , they very often wouldn ' t laugh , and he used to come home despairing .
1	Penetrating to the heart of this region , he arrives by a court and a long whitewashed passage at a great brick building composed of bare walls , floors , roof-rafters , and skylights , on the front of which , if it can be said to have any front , is painted <NAME> 'S <NAME> 's Shooting Gallery , & c. , he goes ; and in it there are gaslights ( partly turned off now ) , and two whitened targets for rifle-shooting , and archery accommodation , and fencing appliances , and all necessaries for the <NAME> art of boxing .
1	You address nothing in my breast , you touch nothing there .
1	' There , ' said <NAME> , pausing for breath when they reached another gallery of the same dimensions as the one below , ' this is the coffee- room flight ; the one above ' s the third , and the one above that ' s the top ; and the room where you ' re a-going to sleep to-night is the warden ' s room , and it ' s this way -- come on. ' <NAME> said all this in a breath , <NAME> mounted another flight of stairs with <NAME> and <NAME> following at his heels .
1	) , that I think she may come , on his account , to be kind to me. ' I fathomed the depth of the rascal ' s whole scheme , and understood why he laid it bare .
1	" <NAME> , a decree for selling the property of emigrants. " " When passed ? " " On the fourteenth. " " The day I left <NAME> ! " " Everybody says it is but one of several , and that there will be others -- if there are not already -- banishing all emigrants , and condemning all to death who return .
1	She is engaged to be married to a most worthy and deserving man in her own station of life .
1	What will they think of us !
1	' Let me see , said the blind man .
1	From my point of view , he was the wrong twin all the time , and only externally like the <NAME> of <NAME> .
1	The eyes were there , before he had laid himself along .
1	How can one expect she should , when she is so very unlike a <NAME> ? ' Miss Tox looked as if she saw no way out of such a cogent argument as that , at all .
1	The wound was a sword-thrust , received from twenty to twenty-four hours before , but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to without delay .
1	Repressing , with as good a grace as possible , these little familiarities -- for which , there is reason to believe , the black bottle was at least as much to blame as any constitutional infirmity on the part of Mrs. Sliderskew -- he protested that he had only been joking : and , in proof of his unimpaired good-humour , that he was ready to examine the deeds at once , if , by so doing , he could afford any satisfaction or relief of mind to his fair friend .
1	replied <NAME> eagerly ; 'but I was thinking that I am ungrateful now . '
1	<NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' what is the matter , <NAME> ? ' ' Never mind , <NAME> ! ' replied <NAME> , with haughty defiance .
1	' It has come back upon me to-day , it has all come back since we have been sitting here .
1	' Let us speak for ourselves , sir .
1	For the face , it expressed nothing but violent and evil passions .
1	' Nothing , I suppose ? ' said <NAME> , with a diabolical grin .
1	But , next come the <NAME> , and Mr Perch ; and Mr Perch brings <NAME> to talk it over in the kitchen , and to spend a pleasant evening .
1	<NAME> <NAME> looked after Mr Baps when he went to cheer up Mrs Baps ( who , being quite deserted , was pretending to look over the music-book of the gentleman who played the harp ) , as if he thought him a remarkable kind of man ; and shortly afterwards he said so in those words to <NAME> , and inquired if he might take the liberty of asking who he was , and whether he had ever been in the <NAME> of <NAME> .
1	<NAME> ' t you pity <NAME> , and I won ' t pity <NAME> .
1	And I would wish in conclusion to remind you , as a business precaution , in case it should be necessary to recall the fact in any communication with <NAME> , that throughout our interview I have expressly stated my sole consideration to be <NAME> 's feelings and honour and the family reputation .
1	why <NAME> ? ' ' Because , ' said Mrs. Crisparkle , retiring on first principles , ' he came home intoxicated , and did great discredit to this house , and showed great disrespect to this family. ' ' That is not to be denied , <NAME> .
1	I remarked that , once or twice when <NAME> was talking , he looked at <NAME> sideways , as if to make sure of his not being displeased ; and that once when <NAME> ( the other gentleman ) was in high spirits , he trod upon his foot , and gave him a secret caution with his eyes , to observe <NAME> , who was sitting stern and silent .
1	' The day had broken when <NAME> awoke , and found himself lying at full length on the flat gravestone in the churchyard , with the wicker bottle lying empty by his side , and his coat , spade , and lantern , all well whitened by the last night ' s frost , scattered on the ground .
1	As she glanced down into the yard , she saw <NAME> come in and leer up with the corner of his eye as he went by .
1	' I wrote him a note , I said it was a painful thing .
1	The kind of foreign help which people usually seek for their children , I can afford to despise ; being above it , I hope .
1	I think the reply was , " Cut away , then ! "
1	She shall be rich -- noble ! ' <NAME> took out his pocket-handkerchief , and wiped his eyes .
1	Light mists arise , and the dew falls , and all the sweet scents in the garden are heavy in the air .
1	The company consisted of the brothers <NAME> , <NAME> , a ruddy-faced white-headed friend of <NAME> ' s ( who was a superannuated bank clerk ) , and <NAME> , who was presented to <NAME> ' s sister with much gravity and solemnity .
1	' She is in <NAME> , with all her family , <NAME> , ' he said , when the dreaded lady was occupied again .
1	I have very strong reasons indeed , for entertaining that wish .
1	Of course it ' s an exertion , but still , when I know how much depends upon me in this house , I am obliged to make it .
1	' Is the <NAME> in his room , <NAME> ? ' inquired <NAME> , offering his box with all imaginable courtesy .
1	While we waited at the gate , I peeped in ( even then <NAME> said , " And fourteen ? " but I pretended not to hear him ) , and saw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery .
1	'This is a painful task , ' said he , 'but these declarations , which have been signed in <NAME> before many gentlemen , must be in substance repeated here .
1	Charged with this message , the fat boy returned , slumbering as peaceably in his dickey , over the stones , as if it had been a down bed on watch springs .
1	Her father was a country gentleman down in your part of the world , and was a brewer .
1	The schoolmaster put his hand in his pocket , and produced two half-crowns , and placed them in Mr Riderhood ' s palm : who stopped at a convenient doorstep to ring them both , before acknowledging their receipt .
1	Before breakfast in the morning , <NAME> walked out to look about him .
1	Stumping with fresh vigour , he goes in at the dark greasy entry , pushes a little greasy dark reluctant side-door , and follows the door into the little dark greasy shop .
1	And I might have a nice little bit of hot roast meat spoiling at home all this time -- how does HE know I haven ' t ?
1	She says to her , " Rise up from worse than death , and come with me ! " Them belonging to the house would have stopped her , but they might as soon have stopped the sea .
1	Other gentlemen , who had no briefs to show , carried under their arms goodly octavos , with a red label behind , and that under-done-pie-crust-coloured cover , which is technically known as ' law calf. ' Others , who had neither briefs nor books , thrust their hands into their pockets , and looked as wise as they conveniently could ; others , again , moved here and there with great restlessness and earnestness of manner , content to awaken thereby the admiration and astonishment of the uninitiated strangers .
1	But I could make nothing of the word .
1	' My dear <NAME> , I am here. ' ' How long is this to last , <NAME> ? ' <NAME> shook his head .
1	The plain dark dresses , akin to mourning dresses , which she and her child wore , were as neat and as well attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days .
1	That , he ( <NAME> Attorney-General ) was prepared to hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant ; but that , in a general way , he preferred him to his ( <NAME> Attorney-General 's ) brothers and sisters , and honoured him more than his ( <NAME> Attorney-General 's ) father and mother .
1	He seemed to be the only restless thing , except the clocks , in the whole motionless house .
1	' I prefer to remain at home .
1	' When it was said above that a sign was made , it was intended to say , that the action was performed by her teacher , she feeling his hands , and then imitating the motion .
1	I denounce them to <NAME> and to earth. " A terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done .
1	Would you begin without my uncle ? ' ' I forgot the collector , ' said <NAME> ; ' oh no , that would never do. ' ' He ' s so particular , ' said Mrs. <NAME> , turning to the other married lady , ' that if we began without him , I should be out of his will for ever. ' ' Dear ! ' cried the married lady .
1	For this purpose there are schools in <NAME> ; and there are churches and chapels of various persuasions , in which the young women may observe that form of worship in which they have been educated .
1	I see Her with a child upon her bosom , who bears my name .
1	' Where might it be deposited at present ? ' asked Mr Boffin , in a wheedling tone .
1	The dawn coming , the morning coming , and the day coming , and neither message nor letter coming with either , he went down to the country house .
1	She had no fear that she would live through another night .
1	Then came the question , which of the two next doors ?
1	'You must compose yourself , ' said the doctor supporting her .
1	The newly married pair , on their arrival in <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , were received by the Chief <NAME> .
1	<NAME> of Mr <NAME> ' s house , and serving about his person , <NAME> kept his round eyes on the white teeth with fear and trembling , and felt that he had need to open them wider than ever .
1	Once for all ; I knew to my sorrow , often and often , if not always , that I loved her against reason , against promise , against peace , against hope , against happiness , against all discouragement that could be .
1	However , he steamed in and out of his little back Dock according as he was wanted or not wanted in the <NAME> presence , and business had gone on in its customary course .
1	If there was only one man with a wooden leg what a property he ' d be ! ' ' So he would ! ' observed the landlord and <NAME> both together .
1	' Does she like it ? ' ' She ' ll like it better , ' returned that strong-minded lady , ' when she has tea ; so let us have it , and don ' t bother. ' ' Sweet Sally ! ' cried <NAME> , extending his arms as if about to embrace her .
1	As we leave the same day , will you -- will you take me somewhere that morning , <NAME> -- early -- before we go to church ? ' <NAME> seemed to understand her , as so true a lover so truly loved should , and confirmed his ready promise with a kiss -- with more than one perhaps , or two or three , or five or six ; and in the grave , peaceful evening , <NAME> was very happy .
1	My guardian being as pleased with the idea as <NAME> was , we took her home next day to arrange the matter and brought her out again in triumph with her boxes and all the purchases that could be squeezed out of a ten-pound note , which <NAME> had found in the docks I suppose , but which he at all events gave her .
1	' Nonsense ! ' cried <NAME> -- somewhat resentful of the idea .
1	' <NAME> said , my lad , ' observed the <NAME> , nodding his head thoughtfully ; ' and true .
1	This was very torturing indeed ; and I don ' t think I ever felt such perfect gratification and gratitude of heart , as I did when I heard from the ship ' s doctor that he had been obliged to put a large mustard poultice on this very gentleman ' s stomach .
1	He laughed as he retired with the bird -- it was a plump one .
1	I am not , as I hope you are aware , a governess -- ' ' O dear no ! ' said Mr Dorrit .
1	My husband , fellow-citizen , is a good <NAME> and a bold man ; he has deserved well of the <NAME> , and possesses its confidence .
1	<NAME> would have walked into any poverty-stricken debtor ' s house , and pointed him out to a bailiff , though in attendance upon a young child ' s death-bed , without the smallest concern , because it would have been a matter quite in the ordinary course of business , and the man would have been an offender against his only code of morality .
1	One thousand , four hundred and seventy-five pounds , four shillings , and threepence , tomorrow at twelve o ' clock .
1	As often as he began to consider how to increase this inheritance , or to lay it by , so often his misgiving that there was some one with an unsatisfied claim upon his justice , returned ; and that alone was a subject to outlast the longest walk .
1	' I have not been here a week tomorrow , without considering that too , my dear , ' she returned .
1	" Such things may be , " repeats <NAME> , " or they may not be .
1	' This , however , ' said Mr Toots , ' is not the point .
1	Mr <NAME> lived in a street in the <NAME> ' s <NAME> , which had set off from that thoroughfare with the intention of running at one heat down into the valley , and up again to the top of <NAME> ; but which had run itself out of breath in twenty yards , and had stood still ever since .
1	' I ' ll try , ' said <NAME> , ' if you ' ll help me away .
1	Mr Boffin , submitting to be led on tiptoe to the nursery door , looked in with immense satisfaction , although there was nothing to see but <NAME> in a musing state of happiness , seated in a little low chair upon the hearth , with her child in her fair young arms , and her soft eyelashes shading her eyes from the fire .
1	' Why , ' replied <NAME> very slowly , ' I rather think one old gen ' l ' m ' n was missin ' ; I know his hat was found , but I ain ' t quite certain whether his head was in it or not .
1	' You have reminded me , <NAME> , that this conversation was private -- private and confidential , gentlemen .
1	Where is <NAME> ? " " Here he is , " said the <NAME> , entering the dark room at the moment .
1	He well remembered , too , that when he had placed his foot upon the coach-steps , he turned round and looked upon him with a face so ashy pale and so very wild and vacant that it made him shudder , and for the moment almost afraid to follow .
1	But I did both , and made them happy .
1	' At any rate I ' m going .
1	Besides , ' said <NAME> , with logical good faith , ' I shall have a debt to pay off , by littles , and naturally that would bring me back , if nothing else would. ' ' MUST it be done ? ' asked <NAME> , still reluctant , of the Secretary .
1	If you only repose half as much confidence in me as I repose in you after what I 've experienced of you , that 'll do .
1	' Not by no means , ' acquiesced <NAME> , affably but magisterially .
1	Do you see THIS ? ' cried <NAME> , sitting up , and pointing to his prostrate lady , who was holding him very tight round the waist .
1	N. F. was some tender , lovely , fascinating fair-creature , I make no doubt , ' observed Mr Blandois , as he snapped on the case again .
1	After a moment of suspense , I went and kissed my mother : she kissed me , patted me gently on the shoulder , and sat down again to her work .
1	When I think of my past follies , and my present state , I am sure it would be best for you .
1	He didn ' t happen to take that particular five-pound note , but I have not the smallest doubt that he ' s always up to something of that sort .
1	Only a miser ; that 's all . '
1	And at a table sat the old man himself ; the only living creature there ; his white face pinched and sharpened by the greediness which made his eyes unnaturally bright -- counting the money of which his hands had robbed her .
1	' She has actually passed me without the slightest acknowledgment of my presence ! ' The young lady turned and curtsied .
1	We fed at the same times , on the same kind of viands , in the same dull manner , and with the same observances .
1	asked <NAME> , advancing to meet him .
1	So I call upon <NAME> , before I say another word , to fetch him in and send him packing to the right-about. ' The unsuspecting <NAME> was at that moment airing his many buttons within view of the window .
1	Sometimes she glanced out of the window , as though she thought we were going slowly , though indeed we were going fast ; but otherwise remained exactly as at first .
1	At last <NAME> pledged himself to betray no further curiosity , and they walked on : both ladies giggling very much , and declaring that they never had seen such a wicked creature in all their born days -- never .
1	<NAME> ' s servant ! ' said <NAME> earnestly .
1	' And a manager ' s wife , ' added Mrs. Crummles , in her accustomed tragedy tones .
1	She taught her , indeed , nearly all she knows .
1	He had slipped across the water in his first leisure , and had slipped as quickly back again for his farewell interview with <NAME> .
1	' It ' s quite dreadful , ' said <NAME> , stopping his ears .
1	Indeed , so much affection for him had been added in this one evening to my gratitude that I hoped I already began to understand him through that mingled feeling .
1	' Oh yes , I know you very well ; too well , perhaps , and perhaps he does too , and sorry am I that I should have to say it. ' ' Tell him that I saw him through the window-blind above , as I crossed the road just now , and that I would speak to him on business , ' said <NAME> .
1	She courted <NAME> , though <NAME> never responded ; listened , day after day , to the guitar , though I am afraid she had no taste for music ; never attacked the <NAME> , though the temptation must have been severe ; went wonderful distances on foot to purchase , as surprises , any trifles that she found out <NAME> wanted ; and never came in by the garden , and missed her from the room , but she would call out , at the foot of the stairs , in a voice that sounded cheerfully all over the house : ' Where ' s <NAME> ? ' It was some time now , since I had left the Doctor .
1	I am in statu quo. ' ' And Mrs. Micawber ? ' I pursued .
1	The latter faithful appendage is also invariably a part of the old girl 's presence out of doors .
1	How can I think so , looking back on such a trifling wasted youth as mine !
1	This dangerous ground in his steeple-chase towards manhood passed , he still found it very rough riding , and was grievously beset by all the obstacles in his course .
1	But I was softened by the softened aspect of the man , and felt a touch of reproach .
1	Is there so much hurry in this going away , that <NAME> , with a wave of her hand , sweeps on , and is gone !
1	He saw a strength within her that was resistless .
1	To complete it , she seated herself in a chair by the side of the little chair , and protectingly drew under her arm the spare hand that crept up to her .
1	In damp weather , the place is rendered close , by the steams of moist acts of parliament and frouzy petitions ; general postmen grow faint as they enter its infected limits , and shabby figures in quest of franks , flit restlessly to and fro like the troubled ghosts of <NAME> Letter-writers departed .
1	How long I have been wearing out , I do n't know ; I seemed to break down in an hour .
1	What queer bills are to be bought , and at what prices ?
1	I tell you , cruelly , <NAME> .
1	asked <NAME> of the gentleman whom we had found in attendance on her .
1	' Placed me in such an extremely awkward situation , ' continued <NAME> .
1	You know , just accustom yourself to talk it over , with your tact and in your quiet way , with him and <NAME> , and see what you all make of it .
1	How is he , sir ? ' ' He was very well indeed when I came away , <NAME> Peggotty. ' ' There ' s a friend ! ' said <NAME> , stretching out his pipe .
1	Being roused in the morning at the appointed time , and roused with difficulty , after his late fatigues , <NAME> instructed <NAME> to make a fire in the yard of sundry pieces of old timber , and to prepare some coffee for breakfast ; for the better furnishing of which repast he entrusted him with certain small moneys , to be expended in the purchase of hot rolls , butter , sugar , <NAME> bloaters , and other articles of housekeeping ; so that in a few minutes a savoury meal was smoking on the board .
1	But we held our own without any appearance of molestation .
1	said the stranger , thrown off his guard ; and plainly showing that all his fears ( whatever they were ) were aroused afresh by the intelligence .
1	' <NAME> , make us truly thankful , brother Ned , ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> , that I express no opinion , one way or other , on the trust I undertake .
1	The old lady submitted to this piece of practical politeness with all the dignity which befitted so important and serious a solemnity , but the younger ladies , not being so thoroughly imbued with a superstitious veneration for the custom , or imagining that the value of a salute is very much enhanced if it cost a little trouble to obtain it , screamed and struggled , and ran into corners , and threatened and remonstrated , and did everything but leave the room , until some of the less adventurous gentlemen were on the point of desisting , when they all at once found it useless to resist any longer , and submitted to be kissed with a good grace .
1	During the long vacation , sir , I shall devote my leisure to studying your interests more and more closely and to making arrangements for moving heaven and earth ( including , of course , the Chancellor ) after <NAME> term ; and when I ultimately congratulate you , sir , " says <NAME> with the severity of a determined man , " when I ultimately congratulate you , sir , with all my heart , on your accession to fortune -- which , but that I never give hopes , I might say something further about -- you will owe me nothing beyond whatever little balance may be then outstanding of the costs as between solicitor and client not included in the taxed costs allowed out of the estate .
1	When such a man is not deterred from regarding her as his equal , and when he has convinced himself that there is no blemish on her , I think the fact must be taken to be pretty expressive. ' ' And there is such a man ? ' said the Secretary .
1	What does anybody want here ?
1	I walked along the path towards the house , glancing at the windows , and fearing at every step to see <NAME> or <NAME> lowering out of one of them .
1	The suspense seemed to have taken a new lease , and to have begun afresh from a recent date .
1	And why does Mr Carker , passing through the people to the hall-door , think of the old woman who called to him in the Grove that morning ?
1	<NAME> assented to all this , and we went out immediately after breakfast to pursue our investigations .
1	However , sir , such as the place is , and so long as it lasts , here it is at your service . "
1	What a demd savage lamb ! ' cried <NAME> .
1	' You are an errand-boy for aught I know , ' said <NAME> .
1	They have brought him to a rich end , truly !
1	The sun went down and she was still there .
1	I often look up at the stars , even from the balcony of this room , and believe that I am in the street again , shut out with <NAME> .
1	There is great force in that .
1	I had always pitied her , never so much as now .
1	And how dare you encourage him , you insolent minx ?
1	' The hag is out , on some preparation for your wedding festivities , I suppose , ' said <NAME> , preparing to depart .
1	He laughed heartily and answered , " No . "
1	The sound was far away -- now in one quarter , now answered in another -- nor was it any guide , for it often came from shipboard , as he knew .
1	' O , sir , sir , sir ! ' ' Then why , ' retorted <NAME> , with some slight tinge of a blush , ' don ' t you out with your reason for having your spoon in the soup at all ? ' ' <NAME> , I will tell you the truth .
1	<NAME> ' t you think so ? ' ' Yes. ' ' We know we have done right , <NAME> ? ' ' Yes. ' ' We know we are better so , even now ? ' ' And shall be far , far better so by-and-by. ' Still there was that lingering tenderness in their hearts towards the old positions they were relinquishing , that they prolonged their parting .
1	If <NAME> thought , as she glanced at the mighty <NAME> , how agreeable it would be to have an hour ' s gardening there , with a bright copper shovel , among the money , still she was not in an avaricious vein .
1	Do you believe what I am saying ? ' ' I fear I must .
1	" And as to <NAME> , " resumes <NAME> .
1	' I am very happy to receive such support in my opinion , sir , ' he rejoined .
1	' You are mad , ' said <NAME> .
1	There was a distant glimmer of something that was not quite darkness , rather than of light , in the sky ; and foreboding night was shivering and restless , as the dying are who make a troubled end .
1	' That ' s capital ! ' he whispered , giving <NAME> such a hug that it squeezed a new expression into his face .
1	" <NAME> , " said <NAME> with a rough sort of salutation , " you bear your wrongs more quietly than I can bear mine .
1	" Me , " said the boy , " and <NAME> , " patting the limp bonnet of the child he was nursing .
1	It seems to require much mixing and compounding .
1	' So I think , <NAME> , when they come to me .
1	" Nothing but a mine below it on a busy day in term time , with all its records , rules , and precedents collected in it and every functionary belonging to it also , high and low , upward and downward , from its son the Accountant-General to its father the <NAME> , and the whole blown to atoms with ten thousand hundredweight of gunpowder , would reform it in the least ! "
1	The men -- the second of whom was a dark , bilious subject , in a jacket , close shaved , and with a black head of hair close cropped -- had completed their preparation of the table , and were standing looking at it .
1	He always sat in a particular corner , on a particular stool , which was called ' <NAME> ' , after him ; here he would sit , with his grey head bent forward , attentively listening to whatever might be going on , with a profound veneration for the learning he had never been able to acquire .
1	The agony of our impatience is then so great , that in our wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running -- hiding -- doing anything but stopping .
1	<NAME> , sir ! ' ' Well , ma ' am ? ' retorted <NAME> .
1	Oh , <NAME> , you silly , silly , silly puss ! "
1	( to the <NAME> ) it 's no use your looking frightened ; I wo n't show you no mercy , not a ha'porth of it .
1	His blue bag was slung over his shoulder , honest industry beamed in his eyes , a determination to proceed to <NAME> 's with cheerful briskness was indicated in his gait .
1	As he could read in it , however , no additional information or anything to lead him to believe he had spoken falsely ; and as Mr <NAME> , left to his own meditations , sighed deeply , and was evidently growing maudlin on the subject of Mrs <NAME> ; the dwarf soon broke up the conference and took his departure , leaving the bereaved one to his melancholy ruminations .
1	And if you please , <NAME> and <NAME> and me is to see each other once a month .
1	He had now an opportunity of observing that as to the phrenological formation of the backs of their heads , the Professing Philanthropists were uncommonly like the Pugilists .
1	' From day to day I feel this .
1	He did so ; and , by the light of the lamps , saw the girl 's retreating figure , already at some distance before him .
1	A seal or two , a pencil-case , a pair of sleeve-buttons , and a brooch of no great value , were all .
1	<NAME> hastened to the window of his office , and looked in .
1	At once I put bills up in the windows ; for , I was in debt , and had scarcely any money , and began to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs .
1	Judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities , his story is a very doubtful one . '
1	' I do nothing but beg and pray you to be comforted and overlook it .
1	' Or abroad. ' ' Surely , ' the <NAME> answered .
1	' No , don ' t , ' said <NAME> , folding his crushed hat to lay his elbow on , and bringing himself still closer to the young lady ; ' upon my life , you oughtn ' t to .
1	We all went to church , and <NAME> gave her away .
1	I suppose nobody ever was in such a state of ink .
1	' Here is your letter , ' said <NAME> .
1	' Not for all the world and his wife .
1	" You 'll want all day to-morrow , I suppose ? "
1	" How do you do , Mr .
1	His red hair hung down upon his bloodless face ; his beard was torn , and twisted into knots ; his eyes shone with a terrible light ; his unwashed flesh crackled with the fever that burnt him up .
1	<NAME> walk into the back shop , sir . "
1	I laid her out ; and I must walk , you know .
1	He grasped them heartily , raised them to his lips , kissed them , and still held them .
1	' My son ' s great capacity was tempted on , there , by a feeling of voluntary emulation and conscious pride , ' the fond lady went on to say .
1	The low , bad , unimpressible face is coming up from the depths of the river , or what other depths , to the surface again .
1	I know how listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both .
1	It was a pretty letter .
1	Something so stately , you know : so uncompromising : so very wide across the chest : so upright !
1	' <NAME> , sir , ' said his wife , ' is my particular friend ; ' and although Mr Mantalini leered till his eyes seemed in danger of never coming back to their right places again , <NAME> showed no signs of softening .
1	She knows that there ' s nobody in the world I look up to , as I do to Miss <NAME> .
1	" And I am very happy to-night , dear father .
1	He used fur to say to me , ' I am as poor as you to-day , <NAME> , ' he ses .
1	The old gentleman thought that two handsomer or finer young fellows could scarcely stand side by side than those on whom he looked with so much pleasure .
1	' I don ' t think he will , Sir. ' ' Whenever I meet that <NAME> again , wherever it is , ' said <NAME> , raising himself in bed , and indenting his pillow with a tremendous blow , ' I ' ll inflict personal chastisement on him , in addition to the exposure he so richly merits .
1	The Jew thrust his head out of the room door when <NAME> had left it ; looked after him as he walked up the dark passage ; shook his clenched fist ; muttered a deep curse ; and then , with a horrible grin , reseated himself at the table ; where he was soon deeply absorbed in the interesting pages of the Hue-and-Cry .
1	<NAME> and lustrous as she was , there was that in her face and air which seemed to separate her hopelessly from <NAME> , and from everyone , for ever more .
1	But you are coming my way .
1	There was something positively awful to me in this , and in the brightness of her eyes , as she said , looking fixedly at me : ' What is he doing ? ' I repeated the words , more to myself than her , being so amazed .
1	' Not in that place , p ' raps , ' returned the <NAME> , with a wink .
1	Shortly afterwards , Mrs. <NAME> appeared .
1	See the plaintive often and considered as his air was feariocious and not to be allowed to go about some children being timid ( and if doubted hoping Mrs. Perkins may be brought forard for she is here and will do credit to her husband and herself and family ) .
1	But , in general , <NAME> has had no secrets from the bosom of affection -- I allude to his wife -- and has invariably , on our retirement to rest , recalled the events of the day .
1	All continued dark and silent as before .
1	It ' s well I ' m quite prepared .
1	One person whom he need not name to me , it was not now possible for him to advise or help .
1	I wore away the longest part of many wild sad nights , in those rides ; reviving , as I went , the thoughts that had occupied me in my long absence .
1	Now my soul , my gentle , captivating , bewitching , and most demnebly enslaving chick-a-biddy , be calm , ' said <NAME> , humbly .
1	A great sensation was created throughout the room by the entrance of a tall gentleman in a blue coat and bright buttons , a large lady in blue satin , and two young ladies , on a similar scale , in fashionably-made dresses of the same hue .
1	and goes on with the <NAME> letters . "
1	<NAME> <NAME> , promise me you will. " ' " I do , I do , " said the man , throwing himself passionately on his knees before her .
1	'Wot a rum chap you are , <NAME> ! '
1	' Now let me hear some more about the <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , who was not quite right in the name yet , ' for I an ' t heard half enough. ' I couldn ' t quite understand why <NAME> looked so queer , or why she was so ready to go back to the crocodiles .
1	They were high from the ground , and they burnt with the steady dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed .
1	" I am sorry , with all my heart , to find you so resolute .
1	Straightway she turned her eyes back to his corner , with the defiance of last night , and moving very cautiously and softly , stretched out her greedy hand .
1	I knew that when I was changed into a part of the vapor that had crept towards me but a little while before , like my own warning ghost , he would do as he had done in my sister 's case , -- make all haste to the town , and be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses .
1	" My roses , " he said when he came back , " take care of mama .
1	' I have a letter to present , and inquiries to make , you know .
1	For , my young friends , " suddenly addressing the 'prentices and <NAME> , to their consternation , " if I am told by the doctor that calomel or castor-oil is good for me , I may naturally ask what is calomel , and what is castor-oil .
1	There are also a great many ladies who have nobody with them : for any lady may travel alone , from one end of the <NAME> to the other , and be certain of the most courteous and considerate treatment everywhere .
1	' I am sure we are constantly hearing , ma ' am , till it becomes quite nauseous , concerning their wives and families , ' said <NAME> .
1	He awoke refreshed , and they continued their journey .
1	She stood still , and listened .
1	' Before that boy says a word , hear me. ' <NAME> bit his lip and shook his head in a threatening manner , but appeared for the moment unable to articulate a syllable .
1	At once to exhibit his deportment to the best models and to keep the best models constantly before himself , he had found it necessary to frequent all public places of fashionable and lounging resort , to be seen at <NAME> and elsewhere at fashionable times , and to lead an idle life in the very best clothes .
1	He had expected labour , and he found it , and did it and made the best of it .
1	Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for <NAME> ; he always pricked up his senses , and became excited , when a funeral passed <NAME> 's .
1	It comes over me at times. ' Was it gone ?
1	He was turning out of the gateway when he accidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak , who was at that moment coming out of the inn door .
1	The entreaties to remain were pressing , but <NAME> was inflexible .
1	' This morning , <NAME> ' am , ' returned the Major .
1	But I was bound to try everything , you know , with such a charge upon my hands .
1	The walls and ceiling were blackened with flies .
1	' We ' ll drink our friend what ' s-his-name , ' said <NAME> , holding up the bright frothy pot ; ' -- that was talking to you this morning , you know -- I know him -- a good fellow , but eccentric -- very -- here ' s what ' s-his-name ! ' <NAME> pledged him .
1	You or I to finish ? ' ' I ! ' she answered , with increased determination , if it were possible .
1	If I could clear this mystery for her , or prove her to be well related , or find that having the honour to be a remote branch of your ladyship 's family she had a right to be made a party in <NAME> and <NAME> , why , I might make a sort of a claim upon <NAME> to look with an eye of more dedicated favour on my proposals than she has exactly done as yet .
1	' " They are here , sisters , " said the elder lady in a trembling voice .
1	At the same time a singular combination of perfumes was diffused through the room , as if some brandy had been put by mistake in a lavender-water bottle , or as if some lavender-water had been put by mistake in a brandy-bottle .
1	The younger Toodles clustered round their mother ' s gown , and peeped from under their own chubby arms at their desperado brother and his unknown friend .
1	The slightest provocation , even being asked if there is anything he would prefer for dinner , causes him to express a wish for a separation .
1	Nor need you either , ' he added , turning to the old man , ' if you were not as weak as a reed , and nearly as senseless. ' ' What would you have me do ? ' he retorted in a kind of helpless desperation .
1	To many a single combat with <NAME> , did <NAME> gallantly devote herself , and if ever Mrs Pipchin in all her life had found her match , she had found it now .
1	Her eyes met mine for but an instant , yet I saw how much she knew of what had passed .
1	In Mr Plornish ' s judgment you would be the worse for it .
1	After still looking hard at <NAME> from his throne , as he shook his head , and rubbed his hands , and remained in the same state of agitation , <NAME> turned to <NAME> , and said : ' Now , sir , as he don ' t condescend to tell me , what is this ? ' <NAME> evaded the question for a little while ; looking in scorn and anger on his opponent , and remaining silent .
1	I ' ve swore my oath that I ' ll not miss ye twice ! ' Accordingly , that same evening the poor soul stands in <NAME> High Street , looking at the many quaint gables of the <NAME> ' <NAME> , and getting through the time as she best can until nine o ' clock ; at which hour she has reason to suppose that the arriving omnibus passengers may have some interest for her .
1	Why , Wemmick. " I could not have spoken one word , though it had been to save my life .
1	Well , we came to the old boat again in good time at night ; and there <NAME> and Mrs. <NAME> bade us good-bye , and drove away snugly to their own home .
1	He was about to take another bite , and had just got his head on one side for a good purchase on it , when his eye fell on me , and he saw that my bread and butter was gone .
1	At all events , I know it. ' ' You never heard <NAME> say anything ? ' ' Say anything ? ' repeated <NAME> .
1	' But wot else is it , my lambs , as they sometimes ketches in rivers ? ' Chorus at a loss .
1	I 'll see what I hold , -- <NAME> , you know what a brute I am ; I wish you 'd give me a little brandy. " It was put before him , and he drank off a glassful -- drank off another glassful -- pushed the bottle thoughtfully away .
1	Mr <NAME> , assenting , armed himself with his stool and the large ruler , and repaired with his employer to the scene of action , where <NAME> was already ringing a hand-bell with all her might , and yet without producing the smallest effect upon their mysterious lodger .
1	When all the rest were got in and were seated , one of these mild men still appeared , in smiling confusion , totally destitute and unprovided for , and , escorted by the butler , made the complete circuit of the table twice before his chair could be found , which it finally was , on Mrs <NAME> ' s left hand ; after which the mild man never held up his head again .
1	'Whoever it was , I 'd serve them the same . '
1	' I did n't know , my dear , I did n't know , ' replied <NAME> , humbly ; for the Jew was the new comer .
1	Have a skein of the best , and some new buttons for the coat , and -- this is a good idea , <NAME> , and one you ' ll like , I know -- as I have never given her anything yet , and girls like such attentions , you shall polish up a sparking necklace that I have got upstairs , and I ' ll give it her upon the wedding morning -- clasp it round her charming little neck myself -- and take it away again next day .
1	' The proposal is like yourself , and if the position I shall assume at the <NAME> is one that I could occupy without descending lower in the social scale— ' ' Why , of course it is , ' said <NAME> .
1	But <NAME> , with her lips only , shaping the two words , ' Her father , ' he delayed no longer .
1	As many of the jury as can crowd together at the table sit there .
1	In short , they suffered so many disappointments , that they began to think it would be necessary to build a palatial residence .
1	How much greater cause she had for weeping now !
1	' I think , <NAME> , ' the cherub hinted at last , ' that if you can spare me the young person distantly related to myself , I ' ll take her in. ' ' I can ' t spare her , ' answered <NAME> , ' but I must lend her to you. -- My Darling ! ' A word of magic which caused <NAME> instantly to disappear again .
1	' You ' re to have it every day , he says .
1	The air was filled with phantoms , wandering hither and thither in restless haste , and moaning as they went .
1	as soft as possible , if you please. ' With which words , <NAME> sighed .
1	<NAME> <NAME> had paid the first appointed portion of the debt to Mr Dombey , and was hopeful of working his way through the rest ; and to cast him down afresh , when he had sprung up so manfully from his troubles , was a very distressing necessity .
1	I -- ha -- I did so ; and I found that it contained -- ahem -- two guineas .
1	I tried to wean her fra ' t ower and ower agen .
1	I did see from the first , that there was no affection on your part for Mr Dombey -- how could it possibly exist between such different subjects ?
1	' Master ! ' he cried , stooping on one knee and catching at his hand .
1	'Why , now she 's on the other tack ! '
1	The staring of Mrs. Markleham during the whole narration , and the shrill , sharp interjections with which she occasionally interrupted it , defy description .
1	I have used no threat , remember ; I have done no more than show you how the case stands ; -- how the case stands , so far. ' At this moment her brother sauntered into view close by .
1	Not that there is any scarcity of far better and more endearing and more accomplished girls than I am ; not that I am much , but that they have made so much of me ! ' <NAME> ' s affectionate heart was overcharged , and she sobbed while she pictured what would happen .
1	I glanced down at the foot from which the shoe was absent , and saw that the silk stocking on it , once white , now yellow , had been trodden ragged .
1	Even children so require sustaining under the general excitement that a pieman who has established himself for the occasion at the corner of the court says his brandy-balls go off like smoke .
1	The little dried gentleman was so occupied with his own depressed reflections that he did not notice the remark until the sound of Mr Fledgeby ' s voice had died out of the counting-house .
1	<NAME> <NAME> grows jealous , and the middle-aged Lady apprehensive , which brings the Pickwickians within the Grasp of the Law 25 .
1	I want the room cleared of these two scum. ' ' That ' s not going to be done , <NAME> , ' replied Mr Boffin , sitting composedly on the library-table , at one end , while the Secretary sat composedly on it at the other .
1	But while he did this , and wore the most careless and indifferent deportment that his practised arts enabled him to assume , he inwardly resolved , not only to visit all the mortification of being compelled to suppress his feelings , with additional severity upon <NAME> , but also to make the young lord pay dearly for it , one day , in some shape or other .
1	And what I say unto you , I say unto all , <NAME> ! ' "
1	Here , for example , I have been speaking to you this morning about tumblers .
1	' I wonder I haven ' t chucked it away afore now .
1	My hown cuthen'th gone to <NAME> at thith prethent minute , to hoffer him hany termth .
1	You don ' t know what <NAME> is , sir , when he is aroused by anything that appeals to his feelings very strongly ; then he is terrific , sir , is <NAME> , absolutely terrific .
1	' Oh , to be sure ! ' said <NAME> .
1	All the wealth I have is hers if she will take me for her slave .
1	' The sisters saluted the holy man with becoming reverence , and the eldest motioned him to a mossy seat beside them .
1	I called <NAME> back , and when she came -- at first pretending to smile , but as she drew nearer to me , looking grieved -- I took her in my arms and said , " It matters very little , <NAME> .
1	Only into the kitchen to fetch hot water. ' To think of growing up with a kind of awe upon one as to the luxuries of that superb establishment , the <NAME> !
1	<NAME> and <NAME> was no more -- his children no more .
1	'It 's your fancy , ' said the Jew , taking up the light and turning to his companion .
1	How many of the mounds in that old churchyard where she had lately strayed , grew green above the graves of children !
1	You remember the night when I first looked in here , and found you floating your powerful mind in tea ? ' Still swilling tea , Mr <NAME> nodded assent .
1	I walked there , and I walked back , and I had the most delightful time !
1	It needed no great pressing to induce me to stay , for if my curiosity has been excited on the occasion of my first visit , it certainly was not diminished now .
1	It was drowned in the tintinnabulation of the gong , which sounding again with great fury , there was a general move towards the dining-room ; still excepting <NAME> the stony boy , who remained where he was , and as he was ; and on its way to whom <NAME> presently encountered a round of bread , genteelly served on a plate and napkin , and with a silver fork lying crosswise on the top of it .
1	And besides , <NAME> ! -- Will you never , without strong reason , let pass your lips what I am going to say ? ' She bent forward to say it in a whisper .
1	" I am not the messenger , if you please , miss , " returned my little maid .
1	' As to understanding him , you are a cleverer fellow than most of us , <NAME> , if you can do that. ' ' That ' s true , indeed , ' said I , moving my chair to the table .
1	But I am anticipating now the purport of our conversation on the ride home instead of first marrying <NAME> .
1	It ' s a popular prejudice , <NAME> ; and yet I am sure I don ' t know why , for I have been trusted in my time to a considerable amount , and I can safely say that I never forsook my trust until it deserted me -- never .
1	I will remain here , till he come to ask me for it . '
1	" Now , I can feel what I am about " ( as perhaps he can in two senses ) , " Mr .
1	Under this impression he returned to the charge .
1	These are not business manners , sir , nor business looks , but she carries me out of myself. ' ' Why don ' t you leave him alone ? ' said <NAME> .
1	' Now , boy , ' said <NAME> , ' I am going to put a question to you. ' ' As many as you please , ' said I .
1	Save the prisoner <NAME> at <NAME> ! " and a thousand answering shouts .
1	' You ain ' t got nothin ' on your mind as makes you fret yourself , have you ? ' inquired Sam .
1	I begged <NAME> to be comforted , for ( as he said ) we had ever been the best of friends , and ( as I said ) we ever would be so .
1	' However , I have made up my mind that I will become respectable in the scale of society , and that I will not be dragged down by others .
1	' Having so much influence with you , <NAME> , as I have , perhaps I should have done better to have had a little chat with you in the first instance , before Mr Headstone spoke for himself .
1	Mrs. Perkins and Mrs. Piper compare opinions on the subject of the young lady of professional celebrity who assists at the <NAME> and who has a space to herself in the manuscript announcement in the window , Mrs. Perkins possessing information that she has been married a year and a half , though announced as <NAME> , the noted siren , and that her baby is clandestinely conveyed to the <NAME> 's <NAME> every night to receive its natural nourishment during the entertainments .
1	My Lady walks upon the other side .
1	He decided in favour of this latter track , and pursued it with some toil ; the rise being steep , and the way worn into deep ruts .
1	And finding nobody about the parlours , it occurred to him , that he could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the kitchen ; so into the kitchen he went .
1	" You won ' t scream ? " said <NAME> doubtfully .
1	Here and there a Hatchment , with the whole science of <NAME> in it , loomed down upon the street , like an Archbishop discoursing on <NAME> .
1	' Now , sir , what do you want ! ' said a man with a large white bow at his button-hole , opening the door , and confronting him with a very stoical aspect .
1	' <NAME> ' t you though ! ' said Mrs. Heep .
1	' Was that half-past twelve , <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> , in a sharp and grating voice .
1	He has learnt his lesson , I see. ' Seeing that what he said had no effect on me or any of us , he sat on the edge of his table with his hands in his pockets , and one of his splay feet twisted round the other leg , waiting doggedly for what might follow .
1	Seeing that <NAME> now glanced anxiously at my aunt again , I reminded him of the second and last point to which he had adverted .
1	'For the love of <NAME> , ' said <NAME> solemnly , 'do not say that now , upon the very verge of death ; but tell me where they are .
1	It was impossible to escape the observation of them , for he showed them whenever he spoke ; and bore so wide a smile upon his countenance ( a smile , however , very rarely , indeed , extending beyond his mouth ) , that there was something in it like the snarl of a cat .
1	which he propounded with a sense of its importance , in itself so edifying and improving as to give it quite an orthodox air .
1	He is not polite. ' ' Sir , ' said <NAME> , striking in expeditiously , ' whoever you are , and however you come to be here , if I were the master of this house I would lose no time in placing you on the outside of it. ' ' But you are not , ' said his mother , without looking at him .
1	Let me relieve you of that bundle !
1	I don ' t say she and I are alike -- I know there is a long , long way between us .
1	I never was so wickedly wronged .
1	Besides , my dearest <NAME> will be her natural and constant guardian when you return , and I had better not encroach upon her trust , perhaps .
1	I used to think , when I got into that state , that people were all against me because of my first beginning ; and the kinder they were to me , the worse fault I found in them .
1	" The place is national property now , and used as a kind of armoury , my love. " Twice more in all ; but , the last spell of work was feeble and fitful .
1	Never. ' ' What has he done ? ' ' He has made a slave of me with his looks .
1	My father had left a small collection of books in a little room upstairs , to which I had access ( for it adjoined my own ) and which nobody else in our house ever troubled .
1	<NAME> amusements are not wanting .
1	But these solemn lessons which succeeded those , I remember as the death-blow of my peace , and a grievous daily drudgery and misery .
1	' Whenever it may be necessary that you and I should have any further communication together , ' said <NAME> , ' I will come back .
1	She knows its influence perfectly , has studied it too well to miss a grain of its effect on any one .
1	' A magnum of the double-diamond , <NAME> , to drink the health of Mr Linkinwater. ' Instantly , by a feat of dexterity , which was the admiration of all the company , and had been , annually , for some years past , the apoplectic butler , bringing his left hand from behind the small of his back , produced the bottle with the corkscrew already inserted ; uncorked it at a jerk ; and placed the magnum and the cork before his master with the dignity of conscious cleverness .
1	" It is so , little one . "
1	" So , " said <NAME> , " I must be taken as I have been made .
1	' Poor fellow , ' said <NAME> , tapping gently at his door , ' what can be the cause of all this ? ' <NAME> was hanging on her brother ' s arm .
1	<NAME> , who had been fuming and chafing until he was nearly wild , darted from his seat , and followed him : so closely , that before the door had swung upon its hinges after <NAME> ' s passing out , they stood side by side in the street together .
1	The available space in it was not much larger than a hackney-coach ; but no one could have wished the bar bigger , that space was so girt in by corpulent little casks , and by cordial-bottles radiant with fictitious grapes in bunches , and by lemons in nets , and by biscuits in baskets , and by the polite beer-pulls that made low bows when customers were served with beer , and by the cheese in a snug corner , and by the landlady ' s own small table in a snugger corner near the fire , with the cloth everlastingly laid .
1	I say , Sally , he is a yelping , insolent dog to all besides , and most of all , to me .
1	He can scarcely let Mr <NAME> ' s hand go , he is so congratulatory ; and he shakes the <NAME> ' s hand so heartily at the same time , that his voice shakes too , in accord with his arms , as it comes sliding from between his teeth .
1	The girl jumped up , with great alacrity ; poured it quickly out , but with her back towards him ; and held the vessel to his lips , while he drank off the contents .
1	How many ? ' ' Two , ' rejoined <NAME> .
1	But I ' ve no suspicions. ' <NAME> said which , Mr Wegg smokes and looks at the fire with a most determined expression of <NAME> ; as if he had caught that cardinal virtue by the skirts as she felt it her painful duty to depart from him , and held her by main force .
1	' A likely some one , _you_ , to come into anybody ' s thoughts in such an aspect ! ' he exclaimed .
1	All day long , and until seven or eight in the evening , <NAME> , at his own detached desk in the schoolroom , worked hard with pen , ink , ruler , books , and writing-paper , making out the bills ( as I found ) for last half-year .
1	He gave such a start when I put my hand upon his shoulder , that he made me start too .
1	But , while returning among those lanes of light , <NAME> becomes so very uncertain , both of foot and speech , that he half drops , half throws himself down , by one of the heavy pillars , scarcely less heavy than itself , and indistinctly appeals to his companion for forty winks of a second each .
1	Mr and <NAME> are of the company , and the <NAME> descry in Mrs Podsnap a fine woman .
1	As <NAME> blows his nose and coughs his cough of sympathy , a step is heard without .
1	But the heart is the bird .
1	I have no other information. " " No , to be sure. " " Now , whether , " pursued <NAME> , " he had used the child 's mother ill , or whether he had used the child 's mother well , <NAME> does n't say ; but she had shared some four or five years of the wretched life he described to us at this fireside , and he seems to have felt pity for her , and forbearance towards her .
1	<NAME> , my second ( ten and a half ) , is the child who contributed two and nine-pence to the <NAME> .
1	He had armed himself with an offensive weapon for the fatal night , and he had gone off early in the morning , after making preparations for departure .
1	Drawing forth two very small scraps of paper , he proceeded -- ' And now , gentlemen , but one word more .
1	The beautiful lady who had soothed and carressed her , in the very room in which her heart had been so wrung , was a spirit of promise to her .
1	My friend <NAME> has not fixed the positive remuneration at too high a figure , but he has made a great deal , in the way of extrication from the pressure of pecuniary difficulties , contingent on the value of my services ; and on the value of those services I pin my faith .
1	" Wy ? " says the patient , starting up in bed ; " I ' ve eat four crumpets , ev ' ry night for fifteen year , on principle. " " Well , then , you ' d better leave ' em off , on principle , " says the doctor .
1	<NAME> holes in his ears , a scar on the right side of his forehead , has been shot in the hind part of his legs , and is marked on the back with the whip. ' ' Two hundred and fifty dollars reward for my negro man <NAME> .
1	He feels very grateful to them for the interest they have in him , and for the kind promises they make ; but the power of speech is gone again , and he has much ado to keep his feet , even though leaning on his master ' s arm .
1	' <NAME> ! ' cried <NAME> , looking up .
1	' She is such a dear girl ! ' said <NAME> ; ' a little older than me , but the dearest girl !
1	<NAME> , M.P. , wishes to be informed ( with something of a second-hand air of seeing the <NAME> Gentleman at the head of the <NAME> in his place ) whether it is intended to be conveyed that the vanished person has been spirited away or otherwise harmed ?
1	The people who have been better off , and have paid rates for many years , are the first to sink when they come into the house ; and let me tell you , <NAME> , that three or four inches over one 's calculation makes a great hole in one 's profits : especially when one has a family to provide for , sir . '
1	Oh , pray stop them , Mr Quilp ! ' ' I ' ll stop ' em , ' cried <NAME> , diving into the little counting-house and returning with a thick stick , ' I ' ll stop ' em .
1	<NAME> , you see , and abstruse set of solid mahogany pigeon-holes , one for every letter of the alphabet .
1	" <NAME> , " said the boy , standing still to gaze at us .
1	<NAME> over , we produced a bundle of pens , a copious supply of ink , and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper .
1	<NAME> and <NAME> ' s warehouse was at the waterside .
1	Up , then , would come Mrs General ; taking all the colour out of everything , as <NAME> and <NAME> had taken it out of herself ; writing <NAME> and <NAME> , in Mr Eustace ' s text , wherever she could lay a hand ; looking everywhere for Mr Eustace and company , and seeing nothing else ; scratching up the driest little bones of antiquity , and bolting them whole without any human visitings -- like a Ghoule in gloves .
1	I saw the rooms that I was never to see again ; here , a door half open ; there , a door closed ; all the articles of furniture around .
1	' I am dull , but you couldn ' t have made me talk if you were. ' Some little touch of conscience answering this perception of her having gained a purpose , called bloom enough into Mrs <NAME> ' s face to make it look brighter as she sat smiling her best smile on her dear <NAME> , and shaking her head with an affectionate playfulness .
1	I think he must have gone to look for it .
1	Do n't let your sober face elate you , however ; you do n't know what it may come to .
1	Thus , although a room of modest situation -- for its windows gave on <NAME> ' s old corner -- and of no pretensions to velvet , satin , or gilding , it had got itself established in a domestic position analogous to that of an easy dressing-gown or pair of slippers ; and whenever the family wanted to enjoy a particularly pleasant fireside evening , they enjoyed it , as an institution that must be , in Mr <NAME> ' s room .
1	Personal faintness , and an overpowering personal candour , were the distinguishing features of Mrs. <NAME> ' s organisation .
1	' He gave us <NAME> last night to that degree that <NAME> gets up and makes him this speech across the table .
1	He again found <NAME> alone with <NAME> , and he again addressed the whole of his soothing speech to <NAME> , as if she were a prey to the liveliest and most affectionate anxieties .
1	Terrified by this alarming spectacle , <NAME> placed another shilling in each hand ; at the same time appealing to the law in flurried accents , and recounting her luggage this time with the two gentlemen in , who caused the total to come out complicated .
1	Indeed , he was fearful of something happening to Mr Pancks in the violent conflict that took place between the breath he jerked out of himself and the smoke he jerked into himself .
1	So far from asking you for interference , I merely wish to claim your strict neutrality. ' <NAME> going on to reply , she rests her eyes again , knowing her ears to be quite enough for the contents of so weak a vessel .
1	We was to be umble to this person , and umble to that ; and to pull off our caps here , and to make bows there ; and always to know our place , and abase ourselves before our betters .
1	" I 'm a-cleaning the upstairs back room , miss , " replies <NAME> .
1	At length , his eyes wandered to a little dirty window on the left , through which the face of the clerk was dimly visible ; that worthy chancing to look up , he beckoned him to attend .
1	The unwholesome air is so stained with this liquor that even the green eyes of the cat upon her shelf , as they open and shut and glimmer on the visitors , look drunk .
1	A garret , and a <NAME> garret without compromise , was <NAME> ' s room .
1	When is the day ? ' ' The day after to-morrow. ' ' Write round in the morning , and say that I have returned , and shall -- hum -- be delighted. ' ' May I walk with you up the stairs to your room , dear ? ' ' No ! ' he answered , looking angrily round ; for he was moving away , as if forgetful of leave-taking .
1	She had the misfortune to lose her husband when she had been married a few months .
1	' You can make almost any theme amusing to me , <NAME> , but not this. ' ' Well ! ' cried <NAME> , ' I am a little ashamed of it myself , and therefore let us change the subject. ' ' It is so deplorably underhanded , ' said <NAME> .
1	' " It is , is it ? " said my uncle .
1	' Here ' s a perfectly disinterested person , <NAME> dear , ' said the knowing <NAME> , ' come to talk with you , for your own sake and your brother ' s .
1	I tell you when it has come to this , I will tell it with my own lips , and will express myself throughout it .
1	It would be a splendid thing for me .
1	No , my Life ! ' ' Good-bye , dearest Pa. Good-bye ! ' ' Good-bye , my darling !
1	There is whispering and wondering all day , strict search of every corner , careful tracing of steps , and careful noting of the disposition of every article of furniture .
1	Traddles only smiled , and shook his head ( with his hair standing upright on the top of it ) , when I looked to him for an explanation ; so I took out my watch , and , as a last resource , counted off the five minutes .
1	There was no one with <NAME> but Mr F. ' s <NAME> , which respectable gentlewoman , basking in a balmy atmosphere of tea and toast , was ensconced in an easy-chair by the fireside , with a little table at her elbow , and a clean white handkerchief spread over her lap on which two pieces of toast at that moment awaited consumption .
1	' You ' ll consider yourself guardian , jointly with me , of this child , <NAME> , ' said my aunt .
1	No doubt I see this , because I know it is so ; but I am astray , and seem to see nothing .
1	<NAME> was shot by some villain on Friday , 6th inst. , in the evening , while sitting in a room in his own house in <NAME> .
1	<NAME> , you know it. ' ' I am happy to say , <NAME> , ' pursued <NAME> , at once with great delicacy and with great earnestness , ' that in your absence <NAME> has considerably improved .
1	They took a lodging in the house where I lived , for a week ; at the expiration of which time they were to start for <NAME> .
1	To whomsoever the head had originally belonged , <NAME> would have regarded it as a personal favour if he had not cut quite so many teeth .
1	Such breakfast as he had , he took at the comfortless public-house where he had parted from <NAME> on the occasion of their night-walk .
1	I so abhor , and from my soul detest that bad spirit , no matter by what class or sect it may be entertained , which would strip life of its healthful graces , rob youth of its innocent pleasures , pluck from maturity and age their pleasant ornaments , and make existence but a narrow path towards the grave : that odious spirit which , if it could have had full scope and sway upon the earth , must have blasted and made barren the imaginations of the greatest men , and left them , in their power of raising up enduring images before their fellow-creatures yet unborn , no better than the beasts : that , in these very broad-brimmed hats and very sombre coats—in stiff-necked , solemn-visaged piety , in short , no matter what its garb , whether it have cropped hair as in a <NAME> village , or long nails as in a <NAME> temple—I recognise the worst among the enemies of <NAME> and <NAME> , who turn the water at the marriage feasts of this poor world , not into wine , but gall .
1	The auspicious nuptials take place ; the newly married come home to this charming mansion ; the lady is received , let us suppose , by <NAME> .
1	If I felt at all confused at that early time in endeavouring to reconcile anything he said with anything I had thought about the duties and accountabilities of life ( which I am far from sure of ) , I was confused by not exactly understanding why he was free of them .
1	" And you know -- and I know -- that you have not sent her away for the reasons you have assigned , but for the purpose of separating her as much as possible from -- excuse my mentioning it as a matter of business -- any reproach and exposure that impend over yourself . "
1	What if his mother had an old reason she well knew for softening to this poor girl !
1	" You know that I am always with him to the full extent of the time allowed , and that I should be with him all day long , if I could .
1	Sure enough , before long the pony came trotting round the corner of the street , looking as obstinate as pony might , and picking his steps as if he were spying about for the cleanest places , and would by no means dirty his feet or hurry himself inconveniently .
1	' Mrs Boffin , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' is a highflyer at <NAME> .
1	This man pursued <NAME> closely , and professed to be devoted to her .
1	My uncle peeped out of the coach window as they emerged from the yard , and observed that the other mails , with coachmen , guards , horses , and passengers , complete , were driving round and round in circles , at a slow trot of about five miles an hour .
1	'You can say nothing to alter my resolution .
1	While he was there , my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door , and had exchanged <NAME> with a farm-laborer going home .
1	The servant-maid had ticked the two words ' Mr Clennam ' so softly that she had not been heard ; and he consequently stood , within the door she had closed , unnoticed .
1	'Yes , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
1	The curtain shook next moment , and a lady , raising it with a heavily ringed hand , dropped it behind her again as she entered .
1	It ' s a part of my character to be waited on ! ' He half filled the tumbler as he said it , and drank off the contents when he had done saying it .
1	Come ! ' and his teeth fairly shone again .
1	I regretted the necessity , but it must be done .
1	" What is that to me ? "
1	" And you are to go down at twelve ? "
1	Besides her consideration money , her daily contract included meals .
1	Holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed , he saw an alteration in the <NAME> 's hood and dress .
1	' My hand quite shakes. ' ' You were the life of the party last night , <NAME> ' am , you know , ' returned <NAME> , ' and you suffer for it , to-day , you see. ' Edith , who had beckoned <NAME> to the window , and was looking out , with her back turned on the toilet of her esteemed mother , suddenly withdrew from it , as if it had lightened .
1	' A charming subject of reflection for you , very charming .
1	So long as their progress was confined to the streets of <NAME> , the facetious <NAME> kept his professional green spectacles on , and conducted himself with becoming steadiness and gravity of demeanour ; merely giving utterance to divers verbal witticisms for the exclusive behoof and entertainment of <NAME> .
1	It was odd enough to see the change that came over <NAME> as <NAME> proceeded .
1	' When <NAME> got into the school here , ' he pursued , ' her father was as pleased as <NAME> .
1	There are a pair of scales , and it goes into one. ' ' Throw it into mine then , ' said <NAME> .
1	He had settled , within himself , that the child must necessarily pass through a certain routine of minor maladies , and that the sooner he did so the better .
1	As all partings foreshadow the great final one , so , empty rooms , bereft of a familiar presence , mournfully whisper what your room and what mine must one day be .
1	On the other hand , you ca n't admit but what it 's natural in us to be anxious with such a thing hanging over our heads .
1	<NAME> will be quite in a state , when she sees the present company ! ' said <NAME> , setting chairs .
1	' Yes , ' rejoined the one-eyed man .
1	If she had remained here , sir , she would have improved , no doubt . "
1	You want another dose ! ' said Mr Flintwinch .
1	" <NAME> , will you forgive me ?
1	I served you because I was proud ; because I was a lonely man with you , and there were no other drudges to see my degradation ; and because nobody knew , better than you , that I was a ruined man : that I hadn ' t always been what I am : and that I might have been better off , if I hadn ' t been a fool and fallen into the hands of you and others who were knaves .
1	The hearty old landlord was trying to look very cheerful and unconcerned , but failing signally in the attempt .
1	laughed <NAME> , 'what a lark that would be , would n't it , <NAME> ?
1	She looked away at the river , as she walked with her hands folded before her ; and that was all he could make of her without showing his face .
1	' I say again , I don ' t know what man he is .
1	It ' s like helping an outside passenger up , ven he ' s been pitched off a coach , and puttin ' your hand in his pocket , vile you ask him , vith a sigh , how he finds his-self , Sammy. ' With this figurative illustration of his meaning , <NAME> unclasped his pocket-book , and drew forth a dirty sheet of letter-paper , on which were inscribed various characters crowded together in remarkable confusion .
1	" Just as good as saw it , " he returned .
1	" Do n't you expect to see him ? " said I .
1	But if I tell you that the lightest touch of your hand makes my blood cold with antipathy ; that from the hour when I first saw and hated you , to now , when my instinctive repugnance is enhanced by every minute ' s knowledge of you I have since had , you have been a loathsome creature to me which has not its like on earth ; how then ? ' He answered with a faint laugh , ' Ay !
1	' I have been thinking , <NAME> , of placing my two boys at your school. ' ' It is not for me to say so , sir , ' replied <NAME> , ' but I don ' t think you could possibly do a better thing. ' ' Hem ! ' said the other .
1	" My little woman , why do you look at me in that way ?
1	It was tremendous. ' ' I always suffer for these triumphs afterwards , ' said Mrs. Wititterly .
1	It would n't put you out ? " I expressed the readiness I felt , and we went into the castle .
1	The amens of the dusty clerk appear , like <NAME> ' s , to stick in his throat a little ; but <NAME> helps him out , and does it with so much goodwill that he interpolates three entirely new responses of that word , never introduced into the service before .
1	<NAME> , for this poor place she showed an increasing love ; and to sit in it alone became her favourite rest .
1	<NAME> <NAME> hopes he will have the goodness to -- " I tell you , sergeant , I have nothing to say to you .
1	I say , how the <NAME> would bother 'em would n't he ? '
1	As they struck the bargain , <NAME> surveyed him with a painful interest .
1	He passes into a kind of relapse or into a swoon , and it is an hour before he opens his eyes , reclining on his faithful and attached old servant 's arm .
1	<NAME> <NAME> describes over and over again .
1	' The dead letters , of course , ' said the bagman .
1	' <NAME> , aye ? ' ' No , ' said <NAME> , before I could reply .
1	<NAME> goes out with an air of native gentility ; and <NAME> , to whom it is , on an emergency , as natural to be groom of the ceremonies as it is to be anything else , shows her downstairs , not without gallantry .
1	Why not , Mr Carker ? ' said the boy .
1	He always concluded by addressing <NAME> .
1	There are three there , <NAME> , with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on 'em : which is the old lady 's arms . '
1	Mrs. Rouncewell 's hands unquiet , as usual , on this reference .
1	' May I beg your pardon again , if I inquire what you mean , sir ? ' said <NAME> .
1	To recount all the delight and wonder which the circumstances just detailed awakened at <NAME> ' s , and all the things that were done , said , thought , expected , hoped , and prophesied in consequence , is beside the present course and purpose of these adventures .
1	He was fatter than ever .
1	The well-known shops , however , with their cheerful lights , did something for me ; and when I alighted at the door of the <NAME> ' s <NAME> , I had recovered my spirits .
1	At all events , I hope I have something impressible within me , which feels—deeply feels—the disinterestedness of your painfully laying your inner self bare , as a warning to me. ' <NAME> ' s steadiness of face and figure becomes so marvellous that his breathing seems to have stopped .
1	The gloomy Eugene too , is not without some kindred touch ; for , when that appalling <NAME> declares that if Another had survived , he should have gone down at the head of her list of lovers -- and also when the mature young lady shrugs her epaulettes , and laughs at some private and confidential comment from the mature young gentleman -- his gloom deepens to that degree that he trifles quite ferociously with his dessert-knife .
1	If you make a fool of me again , I 'll soon cure you , I warrant you ! '
1	' I am not going to tread upon forbidden ground , <NAME> , ' says <NAME> , when they have walked some distance and are turning ; ' you will understand in another moment that I can not help referring to—what shall I say ? —my infatuation. ' ' Had you not better avoid it , <NAME> ?
1	He was so very solicitous on this head that <NAME> gave him the strongest assurances that he did him no injustice .
1	' I have inquired at the door , <NAME> , every day , ' said <NAME> , ' twice a day , indeed , at first -- and tonight , presuming upon old acquaintance , and past transactions by which we have mutually benefited in some degree , I could not resist soliciting admission to your chamber .
1	" <NAME> ' t trouble yourself about the warming-pan. " The warming-pan !
1	<NAME> for deeper and heavier sorrow was yet to come .
1	No news came of old <NAME> .
1	I have not been advised with myself .
1	cries Judy with a stamp upon the ground .
1	' And the world shall deal by you as it does by me , till one or both of us shall quit it for a better .
1	They had had no respect for the old room high up , where the little bed had been ; he could hardly find a clear space there , to throw himself down , on the floor , against the wall , poor broken man , and let his tears flow as they would .
1	' Why , that leaves you fifty , ' retorted <NAME> .
1	' We are all so -- so happy now , my dear <NAME> ! ' says <NAME> , with a suspicious catching in her breath .
1	' That was before you began to lose your recollection , you know , ' said <NAME> quietly .
1	' How does she look now ? ' ' Quite happy , ' said <NAME> .
1	It ' s a triumph , too , to tear her away from a gallant young rival : a great triumph for an old man !
1	' You have so much the air of a kind nurse , ' said the lady , smiling on her , ' that you seem as if you had come to me from home. ' ' I am very glad of it. ' ' I was dreaming of home when I woke just now .
1	And you think that at no time of your father ' s life was my name of <NAME> ever familiar to him ? ' ' <NAME> , sir. ' He felt , from the tone in which she spoke , that she was glancing up at him with those parted lips ; therefore he looked before him , rather than make her heart beat quicker still by embarrassing her afresh .
1	Die who would , it would still remain the same ; these sights and sounds would still go on , as happily as ever .
1	Many of the lamps were already extinguished ; a few country waggons were slowly toiling on , towards <NAME> ; now and then , a stage-coach , covered with mud , rattled briskly by : the driver bestowing , as he passed , an admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner who , by keeping on the wrong side of the road , had endangered his arriving at the office , a quarter of a minute after his time .
1	Before we went , I wrote <NAME> a full statement of all that had happened , and <NAME> wrote me back a capital answer , expressive of his sympathy and friendship .
1	It not only doubles up Mrs. Smallweed 's head against the side of her porter 's chair and causes her to present , when extricated by her granddaughter , a highly unbecoming state of cap , but the necessary exertion recoils on <NAME> himself , whom it throws back into HIS porter 's chair like a broken puppet .
1	He took a paper-knife in his hand , turned it over , laid it down , took it up again , and even then had to look along the blade of it , considering how to go on .
1	<NAME> came home , and I soon had no doubt at all . "
1	Before the weak-eyed young man performed on the gong next morning , he came upstairs to <NAME> and told him he was to lie still , which <NAME> very gladly did .
1	Mr <NAME> was even graver than it was his custom to be , and quite silent .
1	He writes to this purpose on his slate , and Mrs. Rouncewell with a heavy heart obeys .
1	The cottage is not what it was .
1	You might have chanced to hear of your <NAME> on his bier , but for the friend I sent to fetch you .
1	* * * * * That same afternoon , the massive gray square tower of an old Cathedral rises before the sight of a jaded traveller .
1	" But in that he was influenced by passion , not by reason .
1	It was evident that very grave and eventful proceedings were on foot ; but various surmises were afloat , respecting their precise character .
1	What was said in this disappointing anti-climax , by the disciples of the <NAME> of <NAME> , except that it was something very voluble and loud , would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to <NAME> and her protector , though they had been all ears .
1	He looked up with a surly nod when his visitor came in .
1	Whatever prejudiced and unauthorised constructions your blind and envious wrath may put upon his character , it is a frank , good-natured character .
1	The space before the prison was cleared , and a few strong barriers , painted black , had been already thrown across the road to break the pressure of the expected crowd , when <NAME> and <NAME> appeared at the wicket , and presented an order of admission to the prisoner , signed by one of the sheriffs .
1	' A telling move with a good many , I dare say , but it won ' t put ME off my guard .
1	I was proud of his interest : deeply , fondly , gratefully attached to him .
1	' You have a good deal of intelligence for a little fellow , ' he said , with a grave smile that belonged to him , ' and you understood me very well , I see .
1	He was going away at the end of the half-year , if not sooner , and was more spirited and independent than before in my eyes , and therefore more engaging than before ; but beyond this I remember nothing .
1	Wheresoever the strong tide met with an impediment , his gaze paused for an instant .
1	" You may -- the memory of what is past half makes me hope you will -- have pain in this .
1	' My boy has been preserved and thrives , ' says old <NAME> , rubbing his hands .
1	I faltered , " I do n't know. " " Might a mere warmint ask whose property ? " said he .
1	He ' s so wrapped up in high life , that the least allusion to business or worldly matters -- like that woman just now , for instance -- quite distracts him ; but , as I often say , I think his disappointment a great thing for him , because if he hadn ' t been disappointed he couldn ' t have written about blighted hopes and all that ; and the fact is , if it hadn ' t happened as it has , I don ' t believe his genius would ever have come out at all. ' How much more communicative <NAME> might have become under more favourable circumstances , it is impossible to divine , but as the gloomy one was within ear-shot , and the fire wanted making up , her disclosures stopped here .
1	' You have one of those strollers ' children in the school. ' ' <NAME> , by name , ' said <NAME> , with something of a stricken look at his friend .
1	What more can I say for you than that I know you deserve her !
1	The evening grew more dull every moment , and a melancholy wind sounded through the deserted fields , like a distant giant whistling for his house-dog .
1	' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> ' s friend , closing the room-door , ' here is a young friend of mine whom we must assist .
1	If <NAME> had been worse paid for his office , or better qualified to discharge it , he would have considered these visits complimentary and agreeable ; but , holding the position of a handsomely-remunerated humbug , he resented them .
1	Our host , who was very attentive and anxious to make us comfortable , was a handsome middle-aged man , who had come to this town from <NAME> , in which part of the country he was ' raised. ' When I say that he constantly walked in and out of the room with his hat on ; and stopped to converse in the same free-and-easy state ; and lay down on our sofa , and pulled his newspaper out of his pocket , and read it at his ease ; I merely mention these traits as characteristic of the country : not at all as being matter of complaint , or as having been disagreeable to me .
1	My impression , certainly , has always been , that there was a mystery in the affair which she could explain if so inclined .
1	He little suspected with whose money .
1	In some villages , large painted boards were fixed up : warning all persons who begged within the district , that they would be sent to jail .
1	' Nearly half an hour. ' ' Well , I never saw such people in all my life as you are , for time , up here ! ' Mrs. Nickleby would exclaim in great astonishment ; ' I declare I never did !
1	<NAME> back as a die .
1	After a while I recognized the familiar way to <NAME> .
1	<NAME> pair for a curricle .
1	This was my homely thought , as I contemplated the box-tree .
1	' No , no , ' replied <NAME> .
1	Have you observed any gradual alteration in <NAME> ? ' I had observed it , and had often wondered whether she had too .
1	Every eye was fixed on <NAME> ' s face .
1	That is to say , you will now take your money affairs entirely into your own hands , and you will draw from <NAME> one hundred and twenty-five pounds per quarter , until you are in communication with the fountain-head , and no longer with the mere agent .
1	Mrs <NAME> was affected to tears .
1	We have but too much reason to suppose , my dear child , that if an effort had been made in time , in this family , a train of the most trying and distressing circumstances might have been avoided .
1	I told <NAME> I would make haste back and inquired of <NAME> as we went in whether there was not a gentleman with <NAME> .
1	<NAME> knows that better than <NAME> , though she taunts me because she has made me her dependent .
1	" I ask your pardon , sir , " said <NAME> with a step backward .
1	Perhaps because her appearance was not of a commercial cast , or perhaps because it occurred to him that his having taken her to wife might expose his judgment to doubt in the minds of customers , Mr <NAME> laid his commands upon her that she should hold her peace on the subject of her conjugal relations , and should no longer call him Jeremiah out of the domestic trio .
1	' Well , then , come along ! ' said I. I could not help being rather short with him , but he appeared not to mind it .
1	' Mrs <NAME> said so , sir , when she kep it from her , hoping as Our <NAME> would work round. ' ' But I hope he will ? ' said <NAME> , with a quick turn upon the messenger .
1	I see he is going to speak to you . "
1	Please to carve , <NAME> , for I can ' t. ' This sally ushers in the dinner .
1	exclaimed <NAME> , in strong indignation .
1	" Yes , we happened to meet oftener , " he returned .
1	There was one black , gloomy mass that seemed to follow him : not hurrying in the wild chase with the others , but lingering sullenly behind , and gliding darkly and stealthily on .
1	If I were , or could be , in your place , I should be satisfied of that .
1	' If anybody comes on office business , take their messages , and say that the gentleman who attends to that matter isn ' t in at present , will you ? ' said <NAME> .
1	We had previously looked into another chamber fitted all round with a great , bare , wooden desk or counter , whereon lay files of newspapers , to which sundry gentlemen were referring .
1	We have never been readers in our family .
1	For , it would seem that <NAME> must always be taken early ; though whether for any more distinctly stomachic reason than that , as the early bird catches the worm , so the early purl catches the customer , can not here be resolved .
1	' My picture , ' <NAME> proceeded , ' goes on to represent ( under correction from you , <NAME> ) , the true lover as ever impatient to be in the presence or vicinity of the beloved object of his affections ; as caring very little for his case in any other society ; and as constantly seeking that .
1	My husband died of want ; so many die of want ; so many more will die of want. " " Again , well ?
1	' My love for my dear child was a diseased love , but my mind was all unhealthy then .
1	" I am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself .
1	He is truly military , and full of anecdote .
1	<NAME> number four , under dreary pretences of being droll ( when it was very melancholy indeed ) , made the shallowest pretences of concealing pitfalls of knowledge , into which it was the duty of these babies to be smuggled and inveigled .
1	'This purse , ' cried the young lady .
1	' I ' ve a good sitiwation here , sir. ' ' If you change your mind at any time , ' returned <NAME> , ' come to me at my works , and you ' ll always find an opening in the lime-kiln. ' ' Thankee sir , ' said <NAME> .
1	I keep no money here ; but if you would rather <NAME> knew nothing of the matter , I will send it to you. " " Thank you , <NAME> ; I have not the least objection to receiving it from him. " She read me what she had written ; and it was direct and clear , and evidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the receipt of the money .
1	But I will not do that .
1	For , although an ingenious Allegory relating to a butcher , a three-legged stool , a dog , and a leg of mutton , this narrative consumed time ; and they were in great suspense .
1	Why , it is an idea , ' said <NAME> , with sarcastic dignity , ' the absurdity of which almost relieves its treachery. ' ' Pray , <NAME> , ' urged <NAME> , ' do not say such dreadful things. ' ' Dreadful things ! ' repeated <NAME> .
1	he ' s a clever one ! ' Mrs <NAME> went on to spread the upper sheet over the bed , and the blanket over that , and the counterpane over that , as if she had quite concluded her story .
1	' Little Dorrit , ' he said , taking her hand again , and speaking lower than he had spoken yet , so that even <NAME> in the small room could not hear him , ' another word .
1	Even when the lessons are done , the worst is yet to happen , in the shape of an appalling sum .
1	He did not retain it , but laid it gently down , took a candle , looked more closely at the injuries on the head , and at the pupils of the eyes .
1	' He were ett ' n and drinking—as large and as loud as a Hummobee. ' ' Thank you ! ' said the old woman , with infinite content .
1	' I have no doubt , ' returned Mr Carker , after an impressive pause , ' that wherever Gay is , he is much better where he is , than at home here .
1	I came all this way to see him in his new clothes. ' ' Ah what a pity ! ' cried <NAME> .
1	But , in my own defence -- ' ' Yes , ' cried <NAME> , looking round the room with a prophetic smile , ' that ' s what she ' s going to say .
1	" Because he ai n't well , I think , mother , " adds <NAME> .
1	Mr <NAME> thought he had passed my young gentleman on the bridge yonder .
1	' May the present moment , ' said <NAME> , sticking his fork into a large carbuncular potato , ' be the worst of our lives !
1	As <NAME> moves about to execute this order , it appears that he is lame , though able to move very quickly .
1	I found it quite a delightful place -- in front , the pretty avenue and drive by which we had approached ( and where , by the by , we had cut up the gravel so terribly with our wheels that I asked the gardener to roll it ) ; at the back , the flower-garden , with my darling at her window up there , throwing it open to smile out at me , as if she would have kissed me from that distance .
1	<NAME> <NAME> ! " ' " I am afraid my friends want you , <NAME> , " said the goblin , thrusting his tongue farther into his cheek than ever -- and a most astonishing tongue it was -- " I ' m afraid my friends want you , <NAME> , " said the goblin .
1	" I am looking about me. " Somehow , that pursuit seemed more in keeping with <NAME> 's <NAME> .
1	In this rough clothing , with a common mariner ' s telescope under his arm , and a shrewd trick of casting up his eye at the sky as looking out for dirty weather , he was far more nautical , after his manner , than <NAME> .
1	Still , she does not turn her head until she has landed on the other side .
1	<NAME> opened the long low window , and looked out upon the old blasted and blackened forest of chimneys , and the old red glare in the sky , which had seemed to him once upon a time but a nightly reflection of the fiery environment that was presented to his childish fancy in all directions , let it look where it would .
1	No doubt it would have been a thought more comfortable if the driving rain , which now poured down more soakingly than ever , had admitted of a window being opened , or if our number had been something less than thirty ; but there was scarcely time to think as much , when a train of three horses was attached to the tow-rope , the boy upon the leader smacked his whip , the rudder creaked and groaned complainingly , and we had begun our journey .
1	' I am quite rejoiced , Mr Carker , ' said the lady-mother , at breakfast , after another approving survey of him through her glass , ' that you have timed your visit so happily , as to go with us to-day .
1	" Yes , with <NAME> on it .
1	' " Quit the room , or you are a dead man , " said the ill-looking fellow with the large sword , drawing it at the same time and flourishing it in the air .
1	'If it be painful to him , ' she thought , 'to come back here , how painful it will be to me !
1	<NAME> , not being skilful in such matters , only fanned the flame in attempting to extinguish it .
1	He said , if that was n't law , he would be glad to know what was .
1	' Now , mark this chap ' s making <NAME> stand for <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> ! ' ' My feeling for <NAME> , ' pursued the Secretary , without deigning to notice him , ' is not one to be ashamed of .
1	Agreeing fur to mak one side unnat ' rally awlus and for ever right , and toother side unnat ' rally awlus and for ever wrong , will never , never do ' t .
1	' For what , ' says the good woman , ' must his feelings be , if he was to come upon any of the poor servants that he once deceived into thinking him immensely rich ! ' Cook is so struck by this moral consideration , that <NAME> improves it with several pious axioms , original and selected .
1	There is a dog , <NAME> , connected with -- but excuse me .
1	To think of your poor sister and her Rampages !
1	Being much flushed and excited , I tumbled my half-guinea out of my pocket in pulling the card out .
1	Mrs. Squeers , sir , was as partial to that lad as if he had been her own ; the attention , sir , that was bestowed upon that boy in his illness !
1	'Look down , ' said <NAME> , lowering the lantern into the gulf .
1	How the last faint traces of hope , the remotest glimmering of any good to be derived from his efforts in this den , faded from the mind of <NAME> as he looked in dismay around !
1	I will carry out your views , sir ; but , under protest. ' Mr Rugg then stated , not without prolixity , the heads of his protest .
1	The poor little old man knew some pale and vapid little songs , long out of date , about <NAME> , and <NAME> , and <NAME> being wounded by the son of <NAME> ; and for Mrs Plornish there was no such music at the Opera as the small internal flutterings and chirpings wherein he would discharge himself of these ditties , like a weak , little , broken barrel-organ , ground by a baby .
1	' <NAME> me , <NAME> , ' he proceeded , when their eyes met ; ' you have used some hard words , for which I do not doubt you have a justification in your mind , that I do not understand .
1	When she went to Mr Casby ' s , he was always there .
1	The woman burst into a fit of laughter , as if she thought this a joke , and tossed it back to me , nodded once , as slightly as before , and made the word ' Go ! ' with her lips .
1	' I shall do very well , I thank you. ' Mrs. Crupp , who had been incessantly smiling to express sweet temper , and incessantly holding her head on one side , to express a general feebleness of constitution , and incessantly rubbing her hands , to express a desire to be of service to all deserving objects , gradually smiled herself , one-sided herself , and rubbed herself , out of the room .
1	How do you do , my Lord ? ' ' Veway hot , <NAME> , ' said his Lordship .
1	That was the thing he had set his heart upon .
1	This made him almost grave .
1	It troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs , on that night of all nights in the year , and I asked the watchman , on the chance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed him a dram at the door , whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had perceptibly been dining out ?
1	' Hollo ! ' said <NAME> , ' I ought to know that ' ere head and them features ; the eyeglass , too , and the broad-brimmed tile !
1	But that she ever thought of it , or watched it , was a secret which she kept within her own young breast .
1	' There ' s something wrong ! ' ' How do you know it ? ' demanded <NAME> .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , sensible of having deserved well of his fellow-creatures , said , -- quite vivaciously , all things considered , -- " Well , Mrs. <NAME> , we 'll do our best endeavors ; let us have a cut at this same pie. " My sister went out to get it .
1	I have been away nearly eight years .
1	' I 'll tell you what it is , gentlemen , ' said he , 'we 're all afraid . '
1	<NAME> in company , gentlemen , in God ' s name .
1	When that was done , a moment ' s whisper despatched <NAME> to despatch somebody else to fill the basket again ; which soon came back replenished with new stores , from which a present provision of cooling drink and jelly , and a prospective supply of roast chicken and wine and water , were the first extracts .
1	But , there remained a broken country , bold and open , a little village at the bottom of the hill , a broad sweep and rise beyond it , a church-tower , a windmill , a forest for the chase , and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison .
1	He wouldn ' t seem so old , though , to them as didn ' t know him , for he was a little wanting here , ' touching his forehead ; ' nobody at home , you know , if you knocked ever so often. ' ' And you DID knock pretty often , I dare say ? ' muttered <NAME> .
1	' It hurts me so , ' cried the poor body , ' to see him come back alone .
1	I am tired to death of the matter . "
1	Once more she caught her arm , and covered her eyes with it ; and then was gone .
1	said a man , bursting out of a beer-shop , with a white dog at his heels ; 'young Oliver !
1	The strange boy whistled ; and put his arms into his pockets , as far as the big coat-sleeves would let them go .
1	I am too well aware that when , in the inscrutable decrees of <NAME> , you were reserved for me , it is possible you may have been reserved for one , destined , after a protracted struggle , at length to fall a victim to pecuniary involvements of a complicated nature .
1	I hope you have your health , and are enjoying yourself. ' There might have been a touch of impertinence in the last words ; on the other hand , it might have been but the native grace of Mr Fledgeby ' s manner .
1	" We went our several ways , " said <NAME> , " and had little in common even before we agreed to differ .
1	<NAME> is so shy as she gives it to him that they drop it between them and almost knock their foreheads together as they pick it up .
1	The shopkeepers of the town , although they had a very indistinct notion of the nature of the offence , could not but be much edified and gratified by this spectacle .
1	' I am afraid we must live expensively for the first week , ' returned <NAME> , with a groan , ' and then we must make up for it .
1	' Who brought him to you first ? ' pursued <NAME> ; ' and how , without me , could you ever have wound him in your net as you have ? ' ' The net is a large one , and rather full , ' said <NAME> .
1	Once out of it , there ' s no knowing when we may come back to it .
1	<NAME> , in the form of odds and ends of cold cream and pomatum , and also of hairpins , was freely distributed among the attendants .
1	' Doctors were called in -- great men who rolled up to my door in easy carriages , with fine horses and gaudy servants .
1	<NAME> is the path across the fields , leading to the old house where I was a little child !
1	For the reasons I have mentioned I would select you .
1	And now , in this night-watch , mingling with the flow of the river and with the rush of the train , came the questions into <NAME> ' s mind again : What could be in the depths of that mystery of <NAME> ' s ?
1	But , now that I remember , one of you has already been there , and can show the way .
1	The idea of daring to pretend to assert that you have eyes in your head , and yet ask me what ' s the matter ! ' ' Is it Mr Sparkler , dear ? ' ' Mis-ter Spark-ler ! ' repeated <NAME> , with unbounded scorn , as if he were the last subject in the <NAME> system that could possibly be near her mind .
1	If you 're not tired , <NAME> -- though I know it 's tiring to strangers -- will you tip him one more ?
1	Through these streets , <NAME> walked , dragging <NAME> after him ; now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole external character of some small public-house ; now jogging on again , as some fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his purpose .
1	Nothing but the respect and obligation I owe to you , sir -- ' As it was plain that <NAME> was bent on a complimentary harangue , unless he received a timely interruption , Mr Quilp politely tapped him on the crown of his head with the little saucepan , and requested that he would be so obliging as to hold his peace .
1	His long , fantastic legs which might have reached the ground , were cocked up , and crossed after a quaint , fantastic fashion ; his sinewy arms were bare ; and his hands rested on his knees .
1	His hair was thin and weak , which was partly attributable to his having never devoted much time to its arrangement , and partly to his having worn for five- and-twenty years the forensic wig which hung on a block beside him .
1	Mr Merdle himself was usually late on these occasions , as a man still detained in the clutch of giant enterprises when other men had shaken off their dwarfs for the day .
1	I tell you she has designs on Pa. And more than that , I tell you Pa considers her such a wonder , such a paragon of accomplishment , and such an acquisition to our family , that he is ready to get himself into a state of perfect infatuation with her at any moment .
1	The sergeant made some kind of report , and some entry in a book , and then the convict whom I call the other convict was drafted off with his guard , to go on board first .
1	' You ' ll soon get the better of it , dear , ' rejoined the friend .
1	Her innocent face looked back so brightly over his shoulder , as he walked away with her , singing her the song of the child ' s game : ' Who passes by this road so late ?
1	' Why , then , I ' ll tell you one , ' said <NAME> , throwing his pipe into the fire , and raising his voice .
1	As to a stocking , I didn ' t know such a thing by name .
1	Everybody else quickly vanishes too .
1	If my affection has been truly disinterested , <NAME> , let me prove it now ! ' Mr <NAME> shot back abruptly into the parlour , and said , wringing <NAME> by the hand : ' How-de-do ?
1	There is inquiry on foot , and pursuit .
1	The royal phantom also carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon , to which it had the appearance of occasionally referring , and that too , with an air of anxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which were suggestive of a state of mortality .
1	Mr and <NAME> , sitting side by side , with <NAME> withdrawn to an immeasurable distance , fell to discussing how they could best find their orphan .
1	Hosts of stars are visible to-night , though their brilliancy is eclipsed by the splendour of the moon .
1	Sometimes he stopped at the fire-place , and sometimes at the door , making believe that he was staring with all his might into shop-windows .
1	I doen ' t care , bless you !
1	I was smoking , and trying to suppress a rising tendency to shudder .
1	The moment my aunt was restored , she flew at <NAME> , and calling her a silly old creature , hugged her with all her might .
1	You see he has just rusticated long enough to excite curiosity , and not long enough for men to have forgotten that deuced unpleasant -- by-the-bye -- you know the rights of the affair , of course ?
1	She takes a chair , looking straight at him as on the last occasion .
1	' A very singular young man that , ' said the powdered-headed footman , looking after <NAME> , with a countenance which clearly showed he could make nothing of him .
1	'Then you 're a cruel man , ' said the matron vivaciously , as she held out her hand for the beadle 's cup ; 'and a very hard-hearted man besides . '
1	The man could not be more particular as to the time at which he saw her ( he got into dense confusion when he tried to be ) , than that it must have been before nine .
1	That ' s the last short speech , do you understand ? ' Silas , released , put his hand to his throat , cleared it , and looked as if he had a rather large fishbone in that region .
1	Blowed if I shouldn ' t have left out lakes , never having clapped eyes upon one , to my knowledge .
1	' I wonder that you presume to speak of impulses to me ' -- both the teachers assented -- ' I am astonished ' -- both the teachers were astonished -- ' I suppose it is an impulse which induces you to take the part of every grovelling and debased person that comes in your way ' -- both the teachers supposed so too .
1	' I beg pardon , ' said <NAME> , making a leg with his hat under his arm , as he addressed himself equally to both gentlemen ; ' a selfish precaution on my part , and not personally interesting to anybody but myself .
1	She and her father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime , and this woman ( the inveteracy of whose pursuit can not be described ) would wait to add that strength to her case , and make herself doubly sure .
1	'Do n't believe that , ' said <NAME> .
1	Mr <NAME> heard this account with a degree of admiration not altogether consistent with the project in which he had just concurred , but his friend attached very little importance to his behavior in this respect , probably because he knew that he had influence sufficient to control <NAME> ' s proceedings in this or any other matter , whenever he deemed it necessary , for the advancement of his own purposes , to exert it .
1	When you go downstairs , tell <NAME> so , and send her up to me ; and while I speak to her , let no one come -- not even aunt .
1	He said , perhaps , the best thing in the way of amends that could be said .
1	What more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview ?
1	Suddenly I came upon a pasteboard placard , beautifully written , which was lying on the desk , and bore these words : ' <NAME> CARE OF HIM .
1	The idea of being a kind of a widow , and never having been married !
1	Oh , my friends and fellow-countrymen , the slaves of an iron-handed and a grinding despotism !
1	He smiled as the mother retired down stairs ; but his face fell , as the daughter followed .
1	No songs of birds were in the air , no pleasant scents , no moving lights and shadows from swift passing clouds .
1	Then he drew his feet together , and made a low , grave bow , and then put out his left hand .
1	In these matrimonial dialogues they never addressed each other , but always some invisible presence that appeared to take a station about midway between them .
1	' Wait outside a few minutes , <NAME> , will you ? ' said <NAME> .
1	" What is the matter with you now ? "
1	A little owl could stare .
1	It happened that an old lord of great family , who was going to marry a young lady of no family in particular , came with the young lady , and the young lady ' s sister , to witness the ceremony of trying on two nuptial bonnets which had been ordered the day before , and <NAME> announcing the fact , in a shrill treble , through the speaking-pipe , which communicated with the workroom , <NAME> darted hastily upstairs with a bonnet in each hand , and presented herself in the show-room , in a charming state of palpitation , intended to demonstrate her enthusiasm in the cause .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , very apoplectic , still exhibits his deportment about town , still enjoys himself in the old manner , is still believed in in the old way .
1	Have I been honourable , sir ? ' ' Very , very ! ' ' Will you tell <NAME> I ' ve been honourable , sir ? ' ' I will indeed. ' ' There ' s my hand , sir , ' said <NAME> , ' and I ' ll stand by you forever ! ' After a hearty squeeze , he disappeared with the same cautious creak upon the stair , crept shoeless over the pavement of the yard , and , locking the gates behind him , passed out into the front where he had left his shoes .
1	Grandfather Smallweed inquires of <NAME> , <NAME> 's twin sister .
1	In the midst of her incoherence , she stops , looks at her daughter , cries out that her wits are going , and hides her face upon the bed .
1	I have a child who will soon call <NAME> by the name by which I call you .
1	' Did you ? ' <NAME> retorted .
1	No sense reported anything unusual there .
1	There they had been waiting for her , many and many a night , no doubt .
1	But he no more dreamed that <NAME> looked on <NAME> , as it were , from a new and far-off place ; that while his eyes often sought the lovely face , they seldom met its open glance of sisterly affection , but withdrew themselves when hers were raised towards him ; than he believed that it was <NAME> ' s ghost who sat beside him .
1	Lying down again with his eyes shut , he heard the Apothecary say , out of the room and quite a long way off -- or he dreamed it -- that there was a want of vital power ( what was that , <NAME> wondered ! )
1	However , I told him I was T. Copperfield , <NAME> , and he believed it , and gave me the letter , which he said required an answer .
1	This was her husband ' s verdict , and he justified it by telling her that she had begun her married life as the most endearing creature that could possibly be .
1	' It ' s the fine arts that bring me out of bed , <NAME> , ' returned the lady .
1	<NAME> <NAME> came to a squeezed house , with a ramshackle bowed front , little dingy windows , and a little dark area like a damp waistcoat-pocket , which he found to be number twenty-four , <NAME> , <NAME> .
1	It is a pleasant thing to see that the sun has been there ; to know that the air and light are on them every day ; to feel that they ARE children , and lead children ' s lives ; that if their pillows be damp , it is with the dews of <NAME> , and not with tears ; that the limbs of their girls are free , and that they are not crippled by distortions , imposing an unnatural and horrible penance upon their sex ; that their lives are spent , from day to day , at least among the waving trees , and not in the midst of dreadful engines which make young children old before they know what childhood is , and give them the exhaustion and infirmity of age , without , like age , the privilege to die .
1	There would be the dangerous villain : the man I hate : gone ; another secured in his place ; and my influence over the girl , with a knowledge of this crime to back it , unlimited . '
1	The breakfast ended in a perfect understanding .
1	How the time wears , I know not ; until I am recalled by my child-wife ' s old companion .
1	and he won ' t come in. ' ' Who ? ' cried Mr Dombey .
1	Stop him ! " The cattle came upon me with like suddenness , staring out of their eyes , and steaming out of their nostrils , " Halloa , young thief ! " One black ox , with a white cravat on , -- who even had to my awakened conscience something of a clerical air , -- fixed me so obstinately with his eyes , and moved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as I moved round , that I blubbered out to him , " I could n't help it , sir !
1	" I thank you for your preparation , " returns <NAME> after a silence , without moving hand , foot , or feature , " which I hope is not necessary ; though I give it credit for being well intended .
1	' Just keep your eye upon him for a few minutes , ' murmured <NAME> .
1	' I have brought your bread , <NAME> , ' said he ( they all spoke in <NAME> , but the little man was an <NAME> ) ; ' and if I might recommend you not to game -- ' ' You don ' t recommend the master ! ' said <NAME> , showing his teeth as he smiled .
1	' Take off your cap , child , ' said <NAME> , ' and let me see you. ' My mother was too much afraid of her to refuse compliance with this odd request , if she had any disposition to do so .
1	' I was a regular cunning sneak when I was at school .
1	Nearly two thousand pounds profit from him already though .
1	<NAME> ; isn ' t it ? ' ' Very , ' said <NAME> .
1	You will always be my solace and resource , as you have always been .
1	But according to my count , it 's ten times ten -- it 's a hundred o'clock .
1	' Well ; but I was speaking ironically , ' rejoined <NAME> .
1	interposed the nurse , hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle , the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction .
1	His linen ! ' said Mr Brass smiling fondly at the wall , ' his linen which was always of a particular colour , for such was his whim and fancy -- how plain I see his linen now ! ' ' You had better go on , sir , ' said <NAME> impatiently .
1	Something at which you can get your equal chance. ' Occasionally the game would wax very brisk indeed , and would be kept up with a smartness rendering such an encounter as this quite tame .
1	' <NAME> , stay , ' said <NAME> .
1	At last , the old woman and the niece came in , -- the latter with a head not easily distinguishable from her dusty broom , -- and testified surprise at sight of me and the fire .
1	' No , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , turning his oilskin cap round and round ; ' we ' re a doin ' pretty well , <NAME> ; we haven ' t no cause to complain in the worldly way , <NAME> .
1	And again , for anything I knew , the proffered information might have some important bearing on the flight itself .
1	or , ' said the <NAME> , raising his voice as much as to say , observe the point of this , ' is it The <NAME> ? ' ' Ned , ' said the old man , drawing <NAME> to his side , and taking his arm tenderly through his , ' I know .
1	But come in , come in ! ' The old man limped on before , and warning her of the downward step , which he achieved himself with no small difficulty , led the way into his little cottage .
1	' It is , ' replied the driver , rubbing himself as if he ached , after throwing the reins to the ostler .
1	' Good gracious , <NAME> , ' returned the <NAME> , ' I said tonight ' s a week , that I ' d come tonight , didn ' t I ?
1	On two or three occasions he was employed on business which took him to a distance , and had formerly been transacted by <NAME> .
1	Having revolved these things in his mind and arrived at this conclusion , he communicated to Mr Swiveller as much of his meditations as he thought proper ( <NAME> would have been perfectly satisfied with less ) , and giving him the day to recover himself from his late salamandering , accompanied him at evening to Mr Quilp ' s house .
1	While she sat weeping , it grew late , and dreary midnight tolled out from the steeples .
1	' Tell him I am sorry that we ever met. ' ' No more ? ' said <NAME> after a pause .
1	He always knew where the plump sister was .
1	He had risen , as his father had before him , in the course of life and death , from <NAME> to <NAME> , and for nearly twenty years had been the sole representative of the Firm .
1	<NAME> , if you let her in but once , only to look upon me for one moment as I lie here , I shall die . "
1	I believe -- at least I know -- that he was not rich .
1	Still , the average duration of human life is proved to have increased of late years .
1	Let him keep his eye on those chimneys , going on as straight as ever he can , and presently he 'll see 'em down a turning on the left , shut in by a great brick wall which forms one side of the street .
1	Could I ever be happy again , <NAME> ? ' Despite his vexation and concern , <NAME> could scarcely help smiling , as he rejoined , ' Now , do you think , mother , that such a result would be likely to ensue from the most cruel repulse ? ' ' Upon my word , my dear , I don ' t know , ' returned Mrs. Nickleby ; ' really , I don ' t know .
1	' You wanted the lord , did you ? ' he said , stopping short when he reached the door , as if a new light had broken in upon him , and confronting <NAME> again .
1	And still , through all this grotesque revival of what he remembered as having once been prettily natural to her , he could not but feel that it revived at sight of him , and that there was a tender memory in it .
1	' I made submission , being on the wrong side of the bolts and bars ; and as you were not the made man then that you are now , you were glad enough to take back a clerk who wasn ' t over nice , and who knew something of the trade you drove. ' ' You begged and prayed , and I consented , ' returned <NAME> .
1	While extinguishing the candles , <NAME> , quite as a matter of course took up the glass from which that honest gentleman had drunk , and coolly tossed it under the grate , where it fell shivering into fragments .
1	As I had never even heard of the first remedy , and always had the second in the closet , I gave Mrs. Crupp a glass of the second , which ( that I might have no suspicion of its being devoted to any improper use ) she began to take in my presence .
1	It ' s nat ' ral in young folk , <NAME> ' r <NAME> , when they ' re new to these here trials , and timid , like my little bird , -- it ' s nat ' ral. ' She clung the closer to him , but neither lifted up her face , nor spoke a word .
1	If I could be dyed black , and made <NAME> ' s slave , I should consider it a compliment .
1	With such rich golden hair , such soft blue eyes , and such a bright , innocent , trusting face !
1	Some despairing gingerbread that had been vainly trying to dispose of itself all over the country , and had cast a quantity of dust upon its head in its mortification , again appealed to the public from an infirm booth .
1	But let him look at me , in prison , and in bonds here .
1	All the little changes that had crept in when the Heeps were there , were changed again .
1	" You , is it , <NAME> ? " " It is , <NAME> .
1	After whom I remember nothing but an average equality of failure .
1	I shall do well enough , and so will my husband .
1	He stops in his rubbing and looks at her , with his hands on his knees .
1	I own to you , I am shaken , <NAME> , by <NAME> 's not having had the power to prevent this arrest. " " He may not have known of it beforehand , " said <NAME> .
1	I loved my darling so well that I was more concerned for their effect on her than on any one .
1	The company might have had other engagements , or they might have felt their inferiority , but in any case they dispersed by degrees , and not being replaced by other company , left their new patron in possession of the Break of Day .
1	I thought it possible that I could truly love one creature in the world , and not love the rest ; I thought it possible that I could truly mourn for one creature gone out of the world , and not have some part in the grief of all who mourned .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , I understood , was also a bright particular star ; but it was his misfortune to have his glory a little dimmed by the extraordinary lustre of <NAME> .
1	As I passed the steps of the portico , I encountered , at the corner , a woman ' s face .
1	" Will somebody give me a quart pot ? "
1	Not they , but they 'll be upon the minds of some of the young fellows , some of these days , and make 'em precious low-spirited .
1	You don ' t know him half as well as I do , <NAME> .
1	It was not until even the dusty cloud was no longer to be seen , that the gazers dispersed .
1	Would you allow me to look at it ?
1	When she answered fervently , she well knew that , she never forgot it , he touched upon his second and more delicate point -- the suspicion he had formed .
1	I never saw him afterwards , but I sometimes imagine that I descry a faint reflection of him in <NAME> .
1	It is that which makes me bold .
1	' Nobody dead , is there ? ' said <NAME> , alarmed at the horror in <NAME> ' s countenance .
1	They have all been witnesses of it , from day to day , from night to night , from week to week , from month to month .
1	<NAME> , ma ' am , ' said a servant , as that gentleman approached the presiding goddess , with his hat in his hand , and the brigand and troubadour on either arm .
1	' I am acquainted with my faults .
1	The iron country farther north is , I suppose , the congenial direction for a boy with these tendencies . "
1	I ' ll have it out of you in full , Boffin. ' ' Dear me ! ' cried that unfortunate gentleman .
1	That the recollection of your true consideration for her always , can never be forgotten by her .
1	The room was but small , and the clients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall ; the wall , especially opposite to <NAME> 's chair , being greasy with shoulders .
1	' Now , I may be wrong in my conclusions ; it is very likely that I am , but my individual impression is , that the gulf between my family and <NAME> may be traced to an apprehension , on the part of my family , that <NAME> would require pecuniary accommodation .
1	The captain being gone , we compose ourselves to read , if the place be light enough ; and if not , we doze and talk alternately .
1	It was constantly before him all at once .
1	They were yet in the ardour of their work , when the child , raising her head from the ground over which she bent , observed that the bachelor was sitting on the stile close by , watching them in silence .
1	In a kind of heedlessness , for which I can not blame myself enough , I have , I have no doubt , mentioned Mr Carker the <NAME> much oftener than was necessary ; and have allowed his name sometimes to slip through my lips , when it was against your expressed wish .
1	' For what did I say to myself arter having amused myself with that there stretch of a comic idea , as a sort of a playful game ?
1	' But I dare say I could scribble something now and then , that would suit you. ' ' We ' ll have a new show-piece out directly , ' said the manager .
1	' Because I could remember , when I was a child , ' said <NAME> , ' but that is very , very long ago , or at least it seems so .
1	And all that night the coffin stands ready by the old portmanteau ; and the lonely figure on the bed , whose path in life has lain through five and forty years , lies there with no more track behind him that any one can trace than a deserted infant .
1	' _I_ mean of the foreign man , ' said <NAME> .
1	Good-bye. ' The cordial face she lifted up to his to kiss him , was his home , his life , his universe , and yet it was a portion of his punishment and grief ; for in the cloud he saw upon it -- though serene and calm as any radiant cloud at sunset -- and in the constancy and devotion of her life , and in the sacrifice she had made of ease , enjoyment , and hope , he saw the bitter fruits of his old crime , for ever ripe and fresh .
1	But speaking of this trespass -- with apologies to <NAME> and <NAME> for the length at which I have pursued so dry a subject -- is there nothing for me from your men <NAME> and <NAME> ? "
1	<NAME> is honourably famous for its free schools , of which it has so many that no person ' s child among its population can , by possibility , want the means of education , which are extended , upon an average , to four thousand pupils , annually .
1	My father ( a farmer ) made a will and left his farm and stock and so forth to my mother for her life .
1	" And she might credit it .
1	' Are they well ? ' he asked .
1	But even to get the very doubtful and preliminary stage of making the appeal , seemed one of the least promising of human undertakings .
1	He had been clearing his head with a lotion of cold water , as a good preparative to providing hot water for the heads of the jury , and had been reading with the neck of his shirt thrown wide open that he might the more freely choke the opposite witnesses .
1	' I asked him to come. ' ' I am sorry to hear it .
1	What I said was low ; that 's what it was ; low .
1	When he has done so , he looks out again at the falling sleet and snow and listens again for the returning steps .
1	I lay myself open to detection , I know .
1	asked <NAME> , coaxing him , with her arms round his neck .
1	said she in reply to my inquiry .
1	' He works , ' he said , ' as bold as a man can .
1	That , he considered it plain that such price was stateable in a single expressive word , and that the word was , ' Halves ! ' That , the question then arose when ' Halves ! ' should be called .
1	And sometimes she would entreat her , with humility , to sit down on the chair beside her bed , and would look at her ( as she sat there brooding ) with a face that even the rose-coloured curtains could not make otherwise than scared and wild .
1	The sun was striking in at the great windows of the court , through the glittering drops of rain upon the glass , and it made a broad shaft of light between the two-and-thirty and the Judge , linking both together , and perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on , with absolute equality , to the greater Judgment that knoweth all things , and can not err .
1	' You don ' t show it , ' said <NAME> .
1	And at the same time there emerged from scores of bye-streets , lanes , and nameless turnings , innumerable people , carrying their dinners to the bakers ' shops .
1	Here is my little woman ! "
1	I told him what I had come for .
1	' You see , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> -- ' and I hope you see too , <NAME> -- there are many little ways in which I can be slightly useful to you , if you will make no stranger of me ; and in which I shall be delighted to be so .
1	Nor had she any symptoms of declining , in the course of the ensuing week , when the constitutional viands still continued to disappear in regular succession , notwithstanding that <NAME> studied her as attentively as ever , and occupied his usual seat between the black skirts and the fender , with unwavering constancy .
1	<NAME> , <NAME> , it would do us no harm to remember oftener than we do , that vices are sometimes only virtues carried to excess !
1	' Now , <NAME> , attend to what I am going to say , and promise and vow to be obedient. ' ' I promise and vow , my dear. ' ' You ask no questions .
1	" I have suspected it a long while -- fully known it a little while . "
1	Do you hear me say he struck me ? ' ' I hear , I hear , ' replied one of those who held him .
1	It sickened her , for blows fell heavily and cruelly on the quiet of the night .
1	Of her father ' s being groundlessly suspected , she felt sure .
1	If I must come backwards and forwards , ' mused the <NAME> with a dejected face , ' I may as well have something to come for. ' ' Something to come for ? ' screamed the old woman .
1	Is it fear or is it anger now ?
1	I stopped at the umble point of my learning , and says I , " Hold hard ! " When you offered to teach me <NAME> , I knew better .
1	The warm-hearted darling leaned across her cousin <NAME> and kissed me , and then looking up in his face , boldly said , " At all events , cousin <NAME> , I WILL thank you for the companion you have given me . "
1	The short-hand writers , the reporters of the court , and the reporters of the newspapers invariably decamp with the rest of the regulars when <NAME> and <NAME> comes on .
1	That ' s the general panoramic view. ' Having so held and waved the candle as that all these heterogeneous objects seemed to come forward obediently when they were named , and then retire again , Mr Venus despondently repeats , ' Oh dear me , dear me ! ' resumes his seat , and with drooping despondency upon him , falls to pouring himself out more tea .
1	<NAME> was at the breakfast-table to make the tea again , however ; and I had the melancholy pleasure of taking off my hat to her in the phaeton , as she stood on the door-step with <NAME> in her arms .
1	has been an effective Something , in the way of preventing me from turning to at <NAME> .
1	It was , to conceal what had occurred , from those who were going away ; and to dismiss them on their voyage in happy ignorance .
1	' Is my pa in , do you know ? ' asked <NAME> with dignity .
1	<NAME> at this in my hand .
1	" Disgrace never comes to <NAME> , " returns the housekeeper .
1	The old woman eyed him slily , and hitching her chair nearer his , and looking in at the parrot , who came down from the gilded dome at her call , said : ' Out of place now , <NAME> ? ' ' Never you mind , <NAME> , ' returned the <NAME> , shortly .
1	She ca n't know anything about me though , ' added <NAME> after a moment 's silence .
1	' I ' ll find him , I warrant you. ' With which assurance , <NAME> bounced into the dormitory , and , swinging his cane in the air ready for a blow , darted into the corner where the lean body of the drudge was usually stretched at night .
1	'Tell your governor that <NAME> and <NAME> is here , will you ? '
1	" Now , <NAME> , " he said to me as we walked quickly away .
1	And that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us , and that we must both be very proud of it , was a conclusion quite established in his own mind .
1	The <NAME> did not go to bed for a long time .
1	You will understand , then , that when your dear friend complimented me , he really condoled with me ; that when he soothed me under my vexations , he laid bare every smarting wound I had ; that when he declared my ' faithful swain ' to be ' the most loving young fellow in the world , with the tenderest heart that ever beat , ' he touched my old misgiving that I was made ridiculous .
1	Perhaps her admiration , such as it was , had originated long ago , when she first found anything that was beautiful appearing in the midst of the squalid fight of her existence .
1	You have long had a good model before you , in your cousin <NAME> .
1	Then would he come down to that house with a slap upon the table , and meet the honourable gentleman foot to foot .
1	' If you want to cheek us , pay your ochre at the doors and take it out. ' ' Kidderminster , ' said <NAME> , raising his voice , ' stow that ! —Sir , ' to <NAME> , ' I was addressing myself to you .
1	' Yet I have gained a wonderful power over her , too , let her be as much in earnest as she will ! ' The reflection brought back the yielding of her face and form as she had drooped under his gaze .
1	<NAME> , give me an old friend ' s arm upstairs ! ' <NAME> hastened to him .
1	After a few other preliminaries , equally brief , and having settled the road each party should take to avoid suspicion , they separated .
1	<NAME> , at which place the steamboats start for <NAME> ( or I should rather say at which place they call , for their wharf is at <NAME> , on the opposite shore ) , is situated in a delicious valley , through which the <NAME> river , in colour a very deep green , pursues its course .
1	Shortly afterwards , <NAME> appeared , looking lovely , <NAME> thought ; and attired in such a number of skirts that it was quite an excursion to walk round her .
1	But you have brought the elegant turn-out , my love ? ' ' No , Pa. ' ' You never can have walked , my dear ? ' ' Yes , I have , Pa. ' He looked so very much astonished , that <NAME> could not make up her mind to break it to him just yet .
1	This is not unselfish in me .
1	The upshot of it all was , that <NAME> was in raptures with him , and that they went upstairs to breakfast .
1	The old man listened with great attention , and when he had concluded , drew his arm eagerly through his own .
1	The dolls ' dressmaker sat in her corner behind the door , with her eyes on the ground and her hands folded on her basket , holding her crutch-stick between them , and appearing to take no heed of anything .
1	Meanwhile , <NAME> enjoyed unmolested the full flavour of the gold knob at the top of his cane , as he would have done to the end of the interview if <NAME> had not come home , and caused the conversation to turn to his favourite topic .
1	The first thing tomorrow morning , ' said old <NAME> ; ' and now good-bye , <NAME> , and God bless you ! ' Squeezing both the <NAME> ' s hands , with uncommon fervour , as he said it , the old man turned to <NAME> , folded hers in his own , and put them to his lips ; then hurried her out to the coach with very singular precipitation .
1	There was a gentleman in the coach who sat on the opposite seat and looked very large in a quantity of wrappings , but he sat gazing out of the other window and took no notice of me .
1	' Your people don ' t usually travel in character , do they ? ' said <NAME> , pointing to the dresses of the dogs .
1	I WON ' T confine myself to four -- eight , sixteen , two-and-thirty , rather than say anything calculated to overturn the <NAME> ' s plans. ' ' Wickfield ' s plans , ' said the <NAME> , stroking his face , and looking penitently at his adviser .
1	Where are you bound for ? " " For the <NAME> , I think , " said I .
1	" I am very sure , sir , " returned <NAME> , " that I speak for <NAME> too when I say that you have the strongest power over us both -- rooted in respect , gratitude , and affection -- strengthening every day . "
1	" I would recommend him to sacrifice it .
1	Nevertheless , Mr <NAME> played so well -- some games with the Major , and some with <NAME> , whose vigilance of eye in respect of Mr Dombey and <NAME> no lynx could have surpassed -- that he even heightened his position in the lady-mother ' s good graces ; and when on taking leave he regretted that he would be obliged to return to <NAME> next morning , <NAME> trusted : community of feeling not being met with every day : that it was far from being the last time they would meet .
1	' However , a sociable word or two on these mistakes became an easy introduction between us , and the weather was hot , and he helped me to a cool cabin on deck alongside his own , and his first school had been at <NAME> as mine had been , and he had learnt <NAME> as I had learnt it , and he had a little history of himself to relate -- God only knows how much of it true , and how much of it false -- that had its likeness to mine .
1	She was a spoilt child ; but how could she be otherwise ?
1	-- always repeating Mrs. <NAME> 's answer to us like an interpreter .
1	You ' ll begin to take charge at once , of all that ' s going on in the new house , will you ? ' ' Most willingly .
1	She looked round with an air of incertitude , and advanced towards the stairs .
1	I hope no bereavement has befallen her .
1	asks Mrs. Bagnet , stopping in her cheerful talk .
1	' Yes , and I am afraid I was seldom or never as good as I ought to have been , <NAME> .
1	' I shall not require the carriage at night , ' said <NAME> .
1	What devil possesses you ? ' ' Their name is <NAME> , ' she replied , uprearing her proud form as if she would have crushed him ; ' you and your master have raised them in a fruitful house , and they shall tear you both .
1	In the meantime Mr Toots , who had come upstairs after her , all unconscious of the effect he produced , announced himself with his knuckles on the door , and walked in very briskly .
1	Fortified by such encouragement , he could venture to say <NAME> ; and now <NAME> ' s mind was relieved .
1	' I don ' t know , ' replied <NAME> pettishly .
1	'It 's quite a cruelty , ' said <NAME> .
1	Here was a new inducement to dissipation , presented to that sport of circumstances , Mr Perch the Messenger !
1	' I hav ' n ' t got anything to do with the lodgings , ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> , and stream , and meadow , and summer days , shone brightly in her view , and there was no dark tint in all the sparkling picture .
1	You put it away somewhere , and you kept your own counsel where .
1	At about mid-day , we set out for the office of <NAME> and <NAME> , in <NAME> ' Commons .
1	He had charged himself with drink , for the playing out of his game , and was impatient to begin .
1	My handkerchief wo n't hurt you . "
1	<NAME> does go so far as to say , ' pursued the meekest of little men , much encouraged , ' that what such people miscall their religion , is a vent for their bad humours and arrogance .
1	She came to meet me with a smile of welcome and her hand extended , but seemed to change her mind in a moment and kissed me .
1	I thought he would be more glad if I came upon him with his breakfast , in that unexpected manner , so I went forward softly and touched him on the shoulder .
1	<NAME> , after several times running out , and in again , to mention such supplementary items as marmalade , eggs , watercresses , salted fish , and frizzled ham , ran across to <NAME> ' s without his hat , to give his various directions .
1	Sit down by the fire , and warm your -- your other one. ' The little counter being so short a counter that it leaves the fireplace , which would have been behind it if it had been longer , accessible , Mr Wegg sits down on a box in front of the fire , and inhales a warm and comfortable smell which is not the smell of the shop .
1	He saw her , and he said , in an undertone : ' <NAME> ! ' <NAME> fell upon his neck , with tears , and then he said , returning her embrace : ' My child , my child !
1	' But you ' re always bragging about something .
1	I wrote her a letter , of which he took charge , and he left us within half an hour of our arrival at our destination , on a delightful evening in the early summer-time .
1	Their tops are battered , and broken , and blackened with smoke ; and , here and there , some taller stack than the rest , inclining heavily to one side , and toppling over the roof , seems to meditate taking revenge for half a century ' s neglect , by crushing the inhabitants of the garrets beneath .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , ma ' am ; Mrs. Cluppins , ma ' am ; Mrs. Raddle , ma ' am. ' ' Which is Mrs. Cluppins ' s sister , ' suggested Mrs. Sanders .
1	The tone of society in <NAME> is one of perfect politeness , courtesy , and good breeding .
1	Yet , in spite of his early promise , all this vigilance and care could not make little Paul a thriving boy .
1	In this last respect , servants are the devil .
1	Suddenly a spasm shoots across her face and she turns deadly pale .
1	' An _unfortunate affray_ occurred in <NAME> county ( <NAME> .
1	He did not answer , and was to all appearances asleep .
1	I must not hear of such a sacrifice .
1	After groping about in the gallery for some time , attempting in the dim light to decipher the numbers on the different doors , he at length appealed to a pot-boy , who happened to be pursuing his morning occupation of gleaning for pewter .
1	' <NAME> was naturally a headlong , careless sort of dog , and he had had five tumblers of hot punch into the bargain ; so , although he was a little startled at first , he began to grow rather indignant when he saw the old gentleman winking and leering at him with such an impudent air .
1	' What do you suppose he meant ? ' ' Mas ' r <NAME> , ' he replied , ' I ' ve put the question to myself a mort o ' times , and never found no answer .
1	' To see you married , <NAME> -- to see you a dilluded wictim , and thinkin ' in your innocence that it ' s all wery capital , ' replied <NAME> .
1	' A few -- a very few -- will suffice , <NAME> , ' said the young man , drawing his chair towards her .
1	She has beauty still , and if it be not in its heyday , it is not yet in its autumn .
1	' But will you have the goodness just to call me that again , sir ? ' ' I didn ' t make use of the word in any invidious sense , ma ' am , ' replied <NAME> , growing somewhat uneasy on his own account .
1	I believe your intention is to perpetuate , and not to weaken , the ties between me and my other and far dearer self .
1	' In the course of the week , ' said <NAME> , ' we shall be happy to see <NAME> to tea .
1	When I got thy letter , I easily believen that what the yoong ledy sen and done to me , and what her brother sen and done to me , was one , and that there were a wicked plot betwixt ' em .
1	No ; you are strict , you are ; we must wait over twelve o ' clock , and get into Monday .
1	' They were poor -- they could not be otherwise when the man pursued such courses ; but the woman ' s unceasing and unwearied exertions , early and late , morning , noon , and night , kept them above actual want .
1	Let me have a word with you outside . '
1	One of you gentlemen has a servant called <NAME> ? ' ' Both , ' replied the notary .
1	Big Vig ' -- and the count was proceeding to enter <NAME> in his tablets , as a gentleman of the long robe , who derived his name from the profession to which he belonged , when Mrs. Leo <NAME> interposed .
1	I admired and loved him , and his approval was return enough .
1	' Still , so it was , ' continued Mrs. Micawber .
1	" _Do_ dozens come for that purpose ? " " <NAME> , " said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> <NAME> was in high feather and spirits , but a little nervous withal .
1	The commissary having been buried with all the decorations suitable to the service ( the whole team of proprieties were harnessed to his hearse , and they all had feathers and black velvet housings with his coat of arms in the corner ) , <NAME> began to inquire what quantity of dust and ashes was deposited at the bankers ' .
1	It was a good thought .
1	If I go farther , and observe that I can not readily conceive how ANY right of mine can be a minor point , I speak not so much in reference to myself as an individual as in reference to the family position I have it in charge to maintain . "
1	' What ' s this ? ' said the single gentleman thrusting out his head .
1	Those who were appointed of old to go to wicked kings and accuse them -- were they not ministers and servants ?
1	If your <NAME> said to Me -- I have given you his exact words , " Louisa , I want nothing ; I am better by myself " -- what do you think he ' d say to you ?
1	For certain , <NAME> looked that way , when a chill air came up , and when it passed on murmuring , as if it whispered something that made the phantom trees and water tremble -- or threaten -- for fancy might have made it either .
1	He drew in his head ; and <NAME> , left standing in the street , could hear the sash closed , as gently and carefully as it had been opened .
1	They let you off easily enough , " sneered <NAME> .
1	The preparations without doors had not been neglected either ; a nun of great personal attractions was telling her beads on the little portico over the door ; and a brigand with the blackest possible head of hair , and the clearest possible complexion , was at that moment going round the town in a cart , consulting the miniature of a lady .
1	I had when I first entered on it , and a good man he was .
1	" I covet nothing , " said <NAME> in the same light way .
1	How I persuaded myself that this was likely , I do n't know .
1	You gave me leave , at any time within a year , to renew the subject of our last discourse . '
1	he cried , upon his knees .
1	' It made ma cry when she knew it , ' interposed <NAME> , ' but we kept it from her for a long time ; and pa was very low in his spirits , but he is better now ; and I was very ill , but I am better too. ' ' Would you give your great-uncle Lillyvick a kiss if he was to ask you , <NAME> ? ' said the collector , with some hesitation .
1	' Dear me ! ' exclaimed the old lady .
1	Early in the afternoon , <NAME> walked direct from his own house into the country , to be taken up on the line by which he was to travel ; and at night the remaining two set forth upon their different course , encouraged by not seeing any face they knew .
1	A nephew whom they had brought up was a frequent visitor at the house , among many other visitors ; and he began to pay me attention .
1	After this , they went home .
1	We don ' t walk like that .
1	We went on our way upstairs after this episode ; and , as we were going up , we met a gentleman groping his way down .
1	says the coroner with a melancholy shake of the head .
1	And why , then , do men tread them ?
1	To her succeeded another lady , claiming to be a pauper , whose wealth was found wrapped up in little scraps of paper and old rag .
1	You ' ll be hurt. ' ' Wait one instant , <NAME> .
1	' Where shall we drive you , sir ? ' said the post-boy .
1	You know -- dear me , what a very elegant button this is , <NAME> !
1	And very much indebted for the omen .
1	' You will not take the air to-day , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
1	' And that ? ' inquired the dwarf , wheeling round and pointing straight at me .
1	the other man seemed to answer ; 'could I mistake him , think you ?
1	Perhaps you will sleep in your own room ?
1	As she would not hear of staying to dinner , lest she should by any chance fail to arrive at home with the grey pony before dark ; and as I apprehend <NAME> knew her too well to argue any point with her ; some lunch was provided for her there , and <NAME> went back to her governess , and <NAME> to his office .
1	'What if I did it ! '
1	I found <NAME> to be a middle-aged gentleman , with a short throat , and a good deal of shirt-collar , who only wanted a black nose to be the portrait of a pug-dog .
1	This is the third time of your hinting and threatening .
1	He had been married now a year ; and Mrs. <NAME> had never released him from her determined pity a moment .
1	In the heavy air of the room , and the heavy darkness that brooded in its remoter corners , I even had an alarming fancy that <NAME> and I might presently begin to decay .
1	Yielding at once to the impulse of her affection , timid at all other times , but bold in its truth to him in his adversity , and undaunted by past repulse , <NAME> , dressed as she was , hurried downstairs .
1	That done , she came softly back and stood by the side of my chair .
1	A man who had been soaked in water , and smothered in mud , and lamed by stones , and cut by flints , and stung by nettles , and torn by briars ; who limped , and shivered , and glared , and growled ; and whose teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin .
1	I urged upon him the necessity of its being dug up , and the paper being legally produced and established .
1	' Oh , don ' t you think he ' s changed ? ' said Mrs. Heep .
1	It is no mistake of mine , surely , to suppose that his having gained the priceless blessing of his life , is one cause of the animosity shown to him by his brother. ' ' You touch upon a subject that is never breathed between us ; not even between us , ' said <NAME> .
1	Only four of them passed .
1	In her own old place sat <NAME> , once more , looking ( but for her dress ) as if she had never left it .
1	Only one among them , one of the gentlemen belonging to the party of three , made advances towards conversation .
1	He made my heart ache very often. ' ' It is a good heart , ' said <NAME> , ' that disentangles itself from the close avocations of every day , to heed such things .
1	She is considered so ( I have heard ) among the clerks in the <NAME> , and it is a point more in their way than in mine .
1	' This good king had a queen , who eighteen years before , had had a son , who was called <NAME> .
1	But when these arrangements were completed and everything was in order , I paid a visit of a few hours to <NAME> , which something in the letter I had destroyed at <NAME> had induced me to decide upon in my own mind .
1	But <NAME> ' s solicitude to get to her father , and to carry the joyful tidings to him , and not to leave him in his jail a moment with this happiness in store for him and still unknown to him , did more for her speedy restoration than all the skill and attention on earth could have done .
1	I was sitting in front of the box one night with <NAME> , and <NAME> was in the place he liked best , behind <NAME> 's chair , when , happening to look down into the pit , I saw <NAME> , with his hair flattened down upon his head and woe depicted in his face , looking up at me .
1	' <NAME> ' nly not , ' replied <NAME> ; ' what ' s the good o ' flannel veskits to the young niggers abroad ?
1	I think -- I mean , he told us -- that he had been in practice three or four years and that if he could have hoped to contend through three or four more , he would not have made the voyage on which he was bound .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , do n't you say a word nor yet stir .
1	He awoke to this , and he awoke to more .
1	' It might have been better for <NAME> to have known some hardships , ' he says , defiantly .
1	All this time I had never been able to consider my own situation , nor could I do so yet .
1	Either the master or the manner of this remark , which was made very ruefully , delighted <NAME> so much , that his consequent shout of laughter roused the Jew from his reverie , and induced him to inquire what was the matter .
1	Through costly-coloured glass and paper-mended window , through cathedral dome and rotten crevice , it shed its equal ray .
1	I am not a coward , <NAME> , but to tell you a secret , I am a little afraid of Jack. ' ' No , no !
1	If <NAME> had not decided against falling in love with <NAME> ; if he had had the weakness to do it ; if he had , little by little , persuaded himself to set all the earnestness of his nature , all the might of his hope , and all the wealth of his matured character , on that cast ; if he had done this and found that all was lost ; he would have been , that night , unutterably miserable .
1	These windows had bright-red curtains , too , hung on slack strings across the lower panes ; so that it looked like the parlour of a <NAME> public-house , which had got afloat in a flood or some other water accident , and was drifting nobody knew where .
1	' My sister , you see , she ' s that fond of you and yourn , and that accustomed to think on ' y of her own country , that it wouldn ' t be hardly fair to let her go .
1	However , he was resolved to stick to the <NAME> ; and so the work of form-filling , corresponding , minuting , memorandum-making , signing , counter-signing , counter-counter-signing , referring backwards and forwards , and referring sideways , crosswise , and zig-zag , recommenced .
1	I say , ' Come in ! ' but someone taps again .
1	As the time so passed , this slinking business became a more and more precarious one .
1	He could detect a design upon it when nobody else had any perception of the fact .
1	That they do not very often want the means , may be gathered from the fact , that in <NAME> , 1841 , no fewer than nine hundred and seventy-eight of these girls were depositors in the <NAME> : the amount of whose joint savings was estimated at one hundred thousand dollars , or twenty thousand <NAME> pounds .
1	<NAME> to all this , the clattering on deck and down below ; the tread of hurried feet ; the loud hoarse shouts of seamen ; the gurgling in and out of water through the scuppers ; with , every now and then , the striking of a heavy sea upon the planks above , with the deep , dead , heavy sound of thunder heard within a vault ; —and there is the head-wind of that January morning .
1	Now , your inclinations are to be consulted .
1	' There , ' said <NAME> , holding the door open , and looking triumphantly round at <NAME> , ' there ' s a room ! ' <NAME> ' s face , however , betokened such a very trifling portion of satisfaction at the appearance of his lodging , that <NAME> looked , for a reciprocity of feeling , into the countenance of <NAME> , who , until now , had observed a dignified silence .
1	What is the matter ? ' ' <NAME> dare you , ' said the old man , turning round on <NAME> , ' how dare you do it ?
1	" He never finishes what he begins to say !
1	The church , the chapel , and the lecture-room , are the only means of excitement excepted ; and to the church , the chapel , and the lecture-room , the ladies resort in crowds .
1	The Father of the <NAME> condescended towards his brother as an amiable , well-meaning man ; a private character , who had not arrived at distinction .
1	'Here his is , coming down the street . '
1	It was her lord himself who became -- unlike the last theme in the mind , according to the observation of most philosophers -- the subject of Mrs Flintwinch ' s dream .
1	Now , what have you got to say to me , eh ? ' <NAME> made no reply ; for the little pink pocket-handkerchief was in full force .
1	I don ' t see why he shouldn ' t be .
1	said the beadle , raising his hand with a show of authority .
1	This he knows , and knowing , still offers me his hand .
1	He cast his despairing eyes downward towards the form from which it had proceeded , and , shuddering from head to foot , looked round .
1	The slight devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief that they would soon be reunited -- the little preparations for his speedy return , the setting aside of his chair and his books -- these , and the solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially , among the many unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of death -- were almost the only outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind .
1	still going on ; but where !
1	' I am thy poor friend , with all my heart and mind. ' [ Picture : <NAME> and <NAME> in the sick room ] The wounds of which she had spoken , seemed to be about the neck of the self-made outcast .
1	I made myself known to your sister .
1	His clothes were shabby , but he had an imposing shirt-collar on .
1	" Only hear that , <NAME> , " said Mrs. Cratchit .
1	I told you from the first , <NAME> , that I never give hopes .
1	Good-night. ' Again he turned towards the wicket , where the satellite , with his eye upon his chief , remained a dumb statue .
1	" Now that you have come , I think you will do something to help mamma , something to save papa !
1	I suppose the opening prospect confused me .
1	' You were always a favourite of hers , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' always were from the first .
1	The child looked round the room as she took her seat .
1	The cat remains where they found her , still snarling at the something on the ground before the fire and between the two chairs .
1	Say so over and over again , if you have the heart to think so. " " If you have the heart to be so , you mean , <NAME> , " said I , in a virtuous and superior tone ; " do n't put it off upon me .
1	And their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand , roared out lustily .
1	I have tried hard to think it not worth remembering , but I can not make so little of it .
1	They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin out , when some brighter genius proposed instead , its being escorted to its destination amidst general rejoicing .
1	' There ' s an unfortunate devil , who has got a friend on the poor side , that ' s glad to do anything of that sort .
1	' When we first spoke together , <NAME> , you told me that your sister had risen out of the disadvantages of your past lives as superior to you as the tower of <NAME> Cathedral is higher than the chimneys of <NAME> .
1	An exhausted composure , a worn-out placidity , an equanimity of fatigue not to be ruffled by interest or satisfaction , are the trophies of her victory .
1	She had not a good place , she said ; the wages were low , and the work was hard .
1	After bidding the old man good night , <NAME> retired to her poor garret , but had scarcely closed the door , when it was gently tapped at .
1	{ 206 } <NAME> TO THE <NAME> EDITION.—Or let him refer to an able , and perfectly truthful article , in <NAME> Foreign Quarterly Review_ , published in the present month of <NAME> ; to which my attention has been attracted , since these sheets have been passing through the press .
1	' When that was gone , sir , ' resumed <NAME> , ' and it did go , though I dribbled it out like so much blood , I had taken Mr Rugg into the secret .
1	A mere beast of the chase flying from hunters , he was still in his metempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur , the preparation of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men besides the cook in question .
1	With very little excuse for departing so abruptly , <NAME> left him , and , greatly disappointing the loiterers outside the house by telling them there was nothing the matter , got into the coach , and was driven to his own home .
1	So stimulated , the business was extremely brisk , and the articles in stock went off with the greatest celerity .
1	The stranger recognised his friends immediately ; and , darting forward and seizing <NAME> by the hand , dragged him to a seat with his usual impetuosity , talking all the while as if the whole of the arrangements were under his especial patronage and direction .
1	It was nearly nine o ' clock when he reached <NAME> .
1	He came into my mind as connected with his old chivalrous manner of mentioning my mother 's name and with what my guardian had informed me of his engagement to her sister and his unconscious connexion with her unhappy story .
1	Did she send here for you ? ' ' No .
1	O ye sun , moon , and stars , the great man !
1	On the grounds that you may take me where you will , and get me sworn to it .
1	" I am not quite myself , " returns the trooper ; " I have been a little put out , Mrs .
1	You may do anything with me if you only show me children .
1	The <NAME> , with an abashed and guilty air , immediately walked on tiptoe to the little parlour and locked himself in .
1	I tell you this , that you may know we knew enough of you to persuade Mr Boffin to let us lead you on , deluded , to the last possible moment , in order that your disappointment might be the heaviest possible disappointment .
1	At least I -- I should think he was. ' ' Georgiana , darling ! ' said <NAME> , holding up a forefinger , ' Take care ! ' ' Oh my goodness me ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , reddening .
1	He is pointing at an empty chair and at a stain upon the ground before it that might be almost covered with a hand .
1	The round of visits was made ; and <NAME> , with a discreet use of his blue coaching , came off triumphantly , though with a considerable accession of boredom .
1	Then would the noble lord , or right honourable gentleman , in whose department it was to defend the <NAME> Office , put an orange in his pocket , and make a regular field-day of the occasion .
1	That ' s nothing , <NAME> ! ' ' Truly , it ain ' t as much as one could sometimes wish it to be , my dear , ' he admitted , drawing his hand across his mouth .
1	' There ' s only one way in which money can be made of it , and that is by taking it to her .
1	He had just come home .
1	But the last item was long , long , long , in linking itself to the rest .
1	' <NAME> , ' exclaimed <NAME> , with glistening eyes : ' <NAME> and <NAME> , imagine <NAME> , when he was the smallest of juniors , diving for me , catching me , a big heavy senior , by the hair of the head , and striking out for the shore with me like a water-giant ! ' ' Imagine my not letting him sink , as I was his fag ! ' said <NAME> .
1	They asked me to be industrious and faithful , and I promised to be so .
1	How many times I went up and down the street , and round the square -- painfully aware of being a much better answer to the old riddle than the original one -- before I could persuade myself to go up the steps and knock , is no matter now .
1	' Now , boy ! ' said Mr Carker , putting his hand on young <NAME> ' s shoulder , and bringing him out into the middle of the room .
1	In a word , ' said the young lady , turning away , as her temporary firmness forsook her , 'there is a stain upon my name , which the world visits on innocent heads .
1	'Come near the fire , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
1	You to go before me ; you to go alone ; you to go , and I to remain !
1	' Oh Jeremiah ! ' cried <NAME> , waking .
1	' A word. ' I confronted <NAME> alone .
1	The house was no longer theirs .
1	Did he leave them here ?
1	' Was there ever such a -- !
1	We had a beautiful little dinner .
1	Now I ' ve took the liberty of coming here -- ' Won ' t you sit down ? ' said Mr Carker , smiling .
1	" Well , " he proceeds , throwing off his disappointment , " next and last , those plans of mine .
1	" Tony , " he says hurriedly to his astonished companion , " let us be quick in putting the things together and in getting out of this place .
1	As his fancy died out , I would no more have tried to strengthen any power I had , than I would have married him on his being forced to take me for his wife .
1	Have you dined with <NAME> yet ? " " Not yet. " " Well , " said <NAME> , " he 'll give you wine , and good wine .
1	Not to risk being done out of the sweat of my brow , by any chances , I should wish afore going further to be swore in. ' ' I am not a swearer in of people , man. ' The visitor , clearly anything but reliant on this assurance , doggedly muttered ' Alfred David. ' ' Is that your name ? ' asked <NAME> .
1	' " But I am not joking ; I was never farther from it , " remonstrated the baron .
1	' What can <NAME> think when he hears you ? ' ' Oh !
1	<NAME> <NAME> had made his unavailing expedition to <NAME> in the midst of a great pressure of business .
1	I won ' t hear of it .
1	As a black man never travels with a white one , there is also a negro car ; which is a great , blundering , clumsy chest , such as <NAME> put to sea in , from the kingdom of <NAME> .
1	There were more than two full hours yet to elapse before she could come , and in that interval , which seemed a long one , I must confess I was nervously anxious about my altered looks .
1	' What is it , <NAME> ? ' <NAME> was the questioner , and put an arm round the poor baby as he made a struggle .
1	' I should rob my family , ' he said , ' if I was to offer ninepence for it. ' This was a disagreeable way of putting the business ; because it imposed upon me , a perfect stranger , the unpleasantness of asking <NAME> to rob his family on my account .
1	' <NAME> me what you mean. ' ' Why , they say , ' replied the boy , looking up into her face , that you will be an <NAME> , before the birds sing again .
1	<NAME> <NAME> is my messenger and representative .
1	Some , to the fountain ; some , to the fields ; men and women here , to dig and delve ; men and women there , to see to the poor live stock , and lead the bony cows out , to such pasture as could be found by the roadside .
1	Under these circumstances I thought myself well rid of him for a shilling .
1	Oh , don ' t cry. ' ' I won ' t cry any more , ' said <NAME> .
1	' Why , don ' t you believe that you are kept here , as a cheap example , and a famous instance of the clemency of <NAME> and <NAME> , redounding to the credit of the illustrious <NAME> ? ' ' <NAME> , ' replied his brother , mildly , ' I have long believed that I am kept here for more kind and disinterested reasons. ' ' But you were going , ' said the Manager , with the snarl of a tiger-cat , ' to recite some <NAME> precept , I observed. ' ' Nay , <NAME> , ' returned the other , ' though the tie of brotherhood between us has been long broken and thrown away -- ' ' Who broke it , good Sir ? ' said the Manager .
1	All the time we were out , the two gentlemen smoked incessantly -- which , I thought , if I might judge from the smell of their rough coats , they must have been doing , ever since the coats had first come home from the tailor ' s .
1	When the executive perceived that <NAME> and his friends were disposed to resist the authority of the law , they very significantly turned up their coat sleeves , as if knocking them down in the first instance , and taking them up afterwards , were a mere professional act which had only to be thought of to be done , as a matter of course .
1	My opinion is " keep ' em at it " . ' ' My good madam , ' returned Mr Dombey , ' you have not acquired your reputation undeservedly ; and I beg you to believe , <NAME> , that I am more than satisfied with your excellent system of management , and shall have the greatest pleasure in commending it whenever my poor commendation -- ' Mr <NAME> ' s loftiness when he affected to disparage his own importance , passed all bounds -- ' can be of any service .
1	They made a path through booths and carriages and throngs of people , and never once stopped to look behind .
1	If they could be brought to me loose , to sort , I should hardly have the face to claim ' em as mine .
1	Gently <NAME> , gently. ' ' Strange sitivation for one o ' the family , ' observed <NAME> , hoisting the aunt into a chair .
1	So were his two companions .
1	They all open <NAME> ' s work .
1	There 'll he nobody but Ma to thank for it . "
1	Say what they are. ' ' Mr .
1	And if I knew him , and I might , I would go down on my knees to him , and take his hand and kiss it and ask him not to draw it away , but to leave it -- O to leave it for a moment -- and let my thankful tears fall on it ; for I have no other thanks to give him ! ' <NAME> had put his hand to her lips , and would have kneeled to him , but he gently prevented her , and replaced her in her chair .
1	' I am not aware of anything more , ' replied <NAME> .
1	I speak for myself , let me add , without including you .
1	Doctors were sent for , and soon came .
1	I had a good mind to ask an old man , in wire spectacles , who was breaking stones upon the road , to lend me his hammer for a little while , and let me begin to beat a path to <NAME> out of granite .
1	' He has got his discharge , by G -- ! ' said the man .
1	She looked at him now .
1	It ' s very gratifying to think that we should have been the means of introducing her into such society , and I ' m quite glad of it -- quite rejoiced -- for she certainly is an exceedingly well-behaved and good-natured little person .
1	By the merest accident , of course ! ' In effect , the swain was standing up in his gondola , card-case in hand , affecting to put the question to a servant .
1	He resumed where he had left off .
1	In the morning she was just the same , <NAME> .
1	It was not to be .
1	Mr Twemlow returning to his sofa , lays down his aching head on its slippery little horsehair bolster , with a strong internal conviction that a painful interview is not the kind of thing to be taken after the dinner pills which are so highly salutary in connexion with the pleasures of the table .
1	I couldn ' t learn a Latin Grammar when I was out , every day , with old Glubb .
1	They were always forgiving me , in their vanity and condescension .
1	Does he -- do they -- aunt ? ' <NAME> shook her head compassionately .
1	Therefore -- eh , <NAME> ? ' ' <NAME> , sir. ' ' Therefore , I call upon you both , to -- I think that ' s the course , <NAME> ? ' ' <NAME> , Sir. ' ' To -- to -- what , <NAME> ? ' said the magistrate pettishly .
1	He is fondest of her and most loving to her , when there is no creature by .
1	But there have been times since , in my manhood , many times there have been , when I have thought , Is it possible , among the possibilities of hidden things , that in the sudden rashness of the child and her wild look so far off , there was any merciful attraction of her into danger , any tempting her towards him permitted on the part of her dead father , that her life might have a chance of ending that day ?
1	' Mississes , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , with an alarming frown .
1	She made no reply , but still pressed forward .
1	The spy preserved the same relative distance between them , and followed : with his eye upon her .
1	' If it had been anyone but you , <NAME> , ' said I , turning away my head , ' I should not have minded it half so much .
1	<NAME> <NAME> passed , and <NAME> passed , and the sedan passed , and the bodyguard of specials passed , and <NAME> was still responding to the enthusiastic cheers of the mob , and waving his hat about as if he were in the very last extreme of the wildest joy ( though , of course , he had not the faintest idea of the matter in hand ) , when he was suddenly stopped by the unexpected appearance of <NAME> and <NAME> .
1	A sunburnt , quick , lithe , little man , though rather thickset .
1	<NAME> <NAME> ' s admiration seemed to increase her perplexity .
1	Kindly explain ; or if not kindly , justly. ' ' Oh , sir ! ' said <NAME> , raising her eyes to his , after a little struggle to forbear , ' is it generous and honourable to use the power here which your favour with Mr and <NAME> and your ability in your place give you , against me ? ' ' Against you ? ' ' Is it generous and honourable to form a plan for gradually bringing their influence to bear upon a suit which I have shown you that I do not like , and which I tell you that I utterly reject ? ' The late <NAME> could have borne a good deal , but he would have been cut to the heart by such a suspicion as this .
1	" Well , well , " says <NAME> , " you train him respectable , and he 'll be a comfort to you , and look after you in your old age , you know . "
1	Are you quite sure , Mr Rokesmith , that you have never had a disappointment in love ? ' ' Quite sure .
1	Oh , what shall I do , what shall I do !
1	<NAME> , ' said <NAME> , shaking him by the arm ; and his whisper was so audible now , that <NAME> felt it unnecessary to repeat his words ; ' you have not forgotten yourself , I hope ? ' ' No , sir , no , ' returned the <NAME> , showing his face , and shaking his head , and rubbing his hands in great agitation .
1	Their mode of bestowing the prisoners at night ( which is of general adoption ) differs from ours , and is both simple and effective .
1	I terrified them from the spot , and since that day have prowled by night -- the only period at which I can revisit the earth -- about the scenes of my long-protracted misery .
1	That is , in the long run .
1	And <NAME> , having his back to the door , would have known nothing of their apparition even then , but for seeing his Uncle spring out of his own chair , and nearly tumble over another .
1	It was a ragged head , the sandy hair of which , scrupulously parted on one side , and flattened down with pomatum , was twisted into little semi- circular tails round a flat face ornamented with a pair of small eyes , and garnished with a very dirty shirt collar , and a rusty black stock .
1	and yet it ' s like being tickled -- there ' s a pleasure in it too , sir ! ' ' Drink that , ' said the dwarf , who had by this time heated some more .
1	This lady had a basket with her , and she hadn ' t known what to do with it , for a long time , until she found that on account of my legs being short , it could go underneath me .
1	' What an infernal hole this is ! ' said <NAME> , breaking a long pause .
1	Now , the whole place was , or it should have been , quite as delightful a place as ever ; and yet it did not impress me in the same way .
1	' Perhaps you may not be aware , sir , ' said <NAME> , ' that I intruded upon him when he was over here in <NAME> .
1	He was a trifle above the middle size , and apparently rather weak in the legs ; but this circumstance by no means detracted from his own admiration of his top-boots , which he contemplated , in their elevated situation , with lively satisfaction .
1	A hard family likeness was on all these things .
1	' They are so beautiful ! ' said Mrs. <NAME> , sobbing .
1	<NAME> ( unless it be the power of intellect or virtue ) has ever the greatest attraction for the lowest natures ; and the mere defiance of the unconscious house-front , with his power to strip the roof off the inhabiting family like the roof of a house of cards , was a treat which had a charm for <NAME> .
1	At least I know I should be , if you were better acquainted with my character. ' ' Well , <NAME> , ' was the rejoinder .
1	<NAME> under such circumstances being not to be thought of , <NAME> is attended by her maid , who , impressed from her own bed for that purpose , extremely cold , very sleepy , and generally an injured maid as condemned by circumstances to take office with a cousin , when she had resolved to be maid to nothing less than ten thousand a year , has not a sweet expression of countenance .
1	<NAME> ! -- A head is held up , and the knitting-women who scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could think and speak , count One .
1	The dwarf ' s humour , as we know , was to have a fireside to himself ; and when he was disposed to be convivial , to enjoy himself alone .
1	As an emotion of the mind will express itself through any covering of the body , so the paleness which his situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek , showing the soul to be stronger than the sun .
1	' Indeed , ' said Mrs. Nickleby , ' I don ' t think she ever was better , since she had the hooping-cough , scarlet-fever , and measles , all at the same time , and that ' s the fact. ' ' Is that letter for me ? ' growled <NAME> , pointing to the little packet Mrs. <NAME> held in her hand .
1	She resumed her seat , and had scarcely done so , when the doubtful page darted into the room and announced , <NAME> , and <NAME> , and <NAME> , and <NAME> , all at one burst .
1	'Now listen to me , ' said the dying woman aloud , as if making a great effort to revive one latent spark of energy .
1	I never can , believe me .
1	' He knows best , ' meaning <NAME> , ' for he has always been at my elbow , whispering me .
1	After sipping his cognac to the end , he added : " Yes , <NAME> is going to be married .
1	I saw him stand uncovered in the bitter air , with a reverence for something .
1	' It is singular enough that I had intended to volunteer a full explanation this very day ; so , if you will give me another glass of wine , I will satisfy your curiosity. ' The decanters passed from hand to hand with unwonted briskness , and <NAME> , looking round on the faces of his friends with a cheerful smile , proceeded -- ' All the changes that have taken place among us , ' said <NAME> , ' I mean the marriage that _has _taken place , and the marriage that <NAME> take place , with the changes they involve , rendered it necessary for me to think , soberly and at once , upon my future plans .
1	At the <NAME> at <NAME> , they stopped to dine ; upon which occasion there was more bottled ale , with some more <NAME> , and some port besides ; and here the case-bottle was replenished for the fourth time .
1	' I must not make a martyr of myself , when I am one of so large a company. ' ' Relinquish it , or begin it all over again ? ' mused <NAME> .
1	" I looked in here , " he observes , " just before you , with the intention of giving this deceased man , whom I never saw alive , some employment at his trade of copying .
1	It might be worthwhile , sometimes , to inquire what <NAME> is , and how men work to change her , and whether , in the enforced distortions so produced , it is not natural to be unnatural .
1	The feeling which beset the child was one of dim uncertain horror .
1	It had a black canal in it , and a river that ran purple with ill-smelling dye , and vast piles of building full of windows where there was a rattling and a trembling all day long , and where the piston of the steam-engine worked monotonously up and down , like the head of an elephant in a state of melancholy madness .
1	Before they separated , however , that gentleman and <NAME> drew <NAME> aside with an air of some mystery ; and <NAME> , thrusting his forefinger between two of <NAME> ' s ribs , and thereby displaying his native drollery , and his knowledge of the anatomy of the human frame , at one and the same time , inquired -- ' I say , old boy , where do you hang out ? ' <NAME> replied that he was at present suspended at the <NAME> and <NAME> .
1	I comforted her and would have raised her , but she cried no , no ; she wanted to stay there !
1	I took the child to one kept by a man named <NAME> , and left it there .
1	' Of his general expectations here , ' assented Mr Carker , dumbly as before .
1	" Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield " , ' I repeated stoutly .
1	' " Unless he brings me back a lady , " ' said <NAME> , tracing out that part with his finger .
1	There is a lady , certainly , at Mrs. <NAME> ' s house , who is very clever , and whom I like to talk to -- <NAME> -- but I don ' t adore her. ' <NAME> laughed again at her own penetration , and told me that if I were faithful to her in my confidence she thought she should keep a little register of my violent attachments , with the date , duration , and termination of each , like the table of the reigns of the kings and queens , in the History of <NAME> .
1	The <NAME> , <NAME> , and Mr Toots are come ; the clergyman is putting on his surplice in the vestry , while the clerk walks round him , blowing the dust off it ; and the bride and bridegroom stand before the altar .
1	I was afraid of staying then to speak to either woman , lest I should bring her into trouble .
1	To this would succeed a labyrinth of bare passages and pillared galleries , with the family procession already preparing in the quadrangle below , through the carriages and luggage being brought together by the servants for the day ' s journey .
1	This consideration was very potent in many quarters , but nowhere more so than among the young clerks and partners who had never been in the slightest danger of overdoing it .
1	They allowed a very liberal table to <NAME> and Mrs. Pocket , yet it always appeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have boarded in would have been the kitchen , -- always supposing the boarder capable of self-defence , for , before I had been there a week , a neighboring lady with whom the family were personally unacquainted , wrote in to say that she had seen Millers slapping the baby .
1	When I had ordered everything I wanted , I directed my steps towards <NAME> 's , and , as I approached that gentleman 's place of business , I saw him standing at his door .
1	Who passes by this road so late ?
1	Every town-gate and village taxing-house had its band of citizen-patriots , with their national muskets in a most explosive state of readiness , who stopped all comers and goers , cross-questioned them , inspected their papers , looked for their names in lists of their own , turned them back , or sent them on , or stopped them and laid them in hold , as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning <NAME> and <NAME> , of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , or Death .
1	' Wery desp ' rate ch ' racter , your Wash-up , ' replied <NAME> .
1	But he had not spoken out of his own will and desire ; and he felt it in his heart a noble return for his late injurious treatment to be faithful to the last to those who had repudiated him .
1	You belong , as it were , to the place , and in a manner represent it towards a stranger .
1	At first my face was so strange to me that I think I should have put my hands before it and started back but for the encouragement I have mentioned .
1	That it is a great work to have cut you away from father ' s life , and to have made a new and good beginning .
1	The coming to a town -- people busy in the markets ; light carts and chaises round the tavern yard ; tradesmen standing at their doors ; men running horses up and down the street for sale ; pigs plunging and grunting in the dirty distance , getting off with long strings at their legs , running into clean chemists ' shops and being dislodged with brooms by ' prentices ; the night coach changing horses -- the passengers cheerless , cold , ugly , and discontented , with three months ' growth of hair in one night -- the coachman fresh as from a band-box , and exquisitely beautiful by contrast : -- so much bustle , so many things in motion , such a variety of incidents -- when was there a journey with so many delights as that journey in the waggon !
1	When we are at home here , of an evening , and shut the outer door , and draw those curtains -- which she made -- where could we be more snug ?
1	Not an ill wind , I hope ? ' ' No , ' replied my aunt .
1	Having , as it were , taken formal possession of his clerkship in virtue of these proceedings , he opened the window and leaned negligently out of it until a beer-boy happened to pass , whom he commanded to set down his tray and to serve him with a pint of mild porter , which he drank upon the spot and promptly paid for , with the view of breaking ground for a system of future credit and opening a correspondence tending thereto , without loss of time .
1	As I have grown older , I think I have had experience of some other houses doing business on the principle of <NAME> and <NAME> !
1	During this whole time the whelp moved about with <NAME> like his shadow , assisting in all the proceedings .
1	A fine full-coloured young woman , Mr Clennam , with very dark hair and very dark eyes .
1	' It ' s not long , sir , ' said she to <NAME> , ' and perhaps you wouldn ' t mind just jotting it down. ' The old man willingly put on his spectacles , and , standing at the little desk in the corner where <NAME> filed her receipts and kept her sample phials ( customers ' scores were interdicted by the strict administration of the <NAME> ) , wrote out the copy in a fair round character .
1	In a very little time <NAME> comes down and tells him that <NAME> will join him directly and place herself under his protection to accompany him where he pleases .
1	But why my Uncle shouldn ' t write to you , when he so clearly intended to do so , or how he should die abroad , and you not know it through some other hand , I can not make out. ' Captain <NAME> observed , with a shake of his head , that <NAME> himself hadn ' t made it out , and that he was a man as could give a pretty taut opinion too .
1	You have hardly ever told me of your own life , in all this lapse of time ! ' ' What should I tell ? ' she answered , with her radiant smile .
1	What changes , <NAME> , even in my small world !
1	Not that he ever said anything , or did anything , openly importing hostility ; I only noticed that he always beat his sparks in my direction , and that whenever I sang <NAME> , he came in out of time .
1	" And if you keep it under your skirts like that , who 's to help tumbling ?
1	In such a case I could show you reasons , I think , which would induce you to yield it . '
1	The son of my old friend <NAME> , of <NAME> , is a born fool , Sir. ' Here the <NAME> laughed till he was almost black .
1	But when he substituted her father for herself , and told her how he would ride in his carriage , and how great and grand he would be , her tears of joy and innocent pride fell fast .
1	The dolls ' dressmaker went no more to the business-premises of <NAME> and Co. in <NAME> Mary Axe , after chance had disclosed to her ( as she supposed ) the flinty and hypocritical character of Mr Riah .
1	The brother and sister of his false favourite had no such relief ; everything in their history , past and present , gave his delinquency a more afflicting meaning to them .
1	cried a loud , hoarse voice , as soon as they set foot in the passage .
1	The old woman , with her wrinkled face close to the bars of the stove , puffing at the dull embers which had not yet caught the wood ; Squeers stooping down to the candle , which brought out the full ugliness of his face , as the light of the fire did that of his companion ; both intently engaged , and wearing faces of exultation which contrasted strongly with the anxious looks of those behind , who took advantage of the slightest sound to cover their advance , and , almost before they had moved an inch , and all was silent , stopped again .
1	' He has never had occasion to acquire such little arts .
1	I get on. " " You do n't get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions , " answered <NAME> , with a careless air ; " I wish you would keep to that .
1	' Oh Mr Clennam you insincerest of creatures , ' said <NAME> , ' I perceive already you have not lost your old way of paying compliments , your old way when you used to pretend to be so sentimentally struck you know -- at least I don ' t mean that , I -- oh I don ' t know what I mean ! ' Here <NAME> tittered confusedly , and gave him one of her old glances .
1	Fortunately , however , the papers with his agents here being all sealed up and locked up , as he left them when he providentially came to <NAME> , the affairs are in that state of order that they can wait until my brother <NAME> recovers his health in <NAME> , sufficiently to come over , and administer , or execute , or whatever it may be that will have to be done. ' ' He couldn ' t have a better nurse to bring him round , ' Mr <NAME> made bold to opine .
1	After a short pause of repose , <NAME> -- in the absence of the little servant who , it seemed , retired to the bosom of her family on Sunday afternoons -- washed up the tea-things , in a trifling lady-like amateur manner that compromised none of us .
1	'He is not in danger , I hope ? '
1	And thus it came to pass , that <NAME> declared , in the parlour after supper , to wit , and twenty minutes before eleven o ' clock p.m. , that he had never been so happy in all his days .
1	said Mrs. Bagnet , continuing to grumble on good-humouredly .
1	<NAME> after passage did he explore ; room after room did he peep into ; at length , as he was on the point of giving up the search in despair , he opened the door of the identical room in which he had spent the evening , and beheld his missing property on the table .
1	' <NAME> ' t go on posturing like a Deaf and <NAME> , ' said the ingenious Fledgeby , ' but express yourself like a <NAME> -- or as nearly as you can. ' ' I had had sickness and misfortunes , and was so poor , ' said the old man , ' as hopelessly to owe the father , principal and interest .
1	For the young man himself , he rioted abroad for a brief term , living by his wits -- which means by the abuse of every faculty that worthily employed raises man above the beasts , and so degraded , sinks him far below them .
1	Well , all I can say is , <NAME> , that I quite love the poor girl ; and that if she was twice as indifferent-looking , and twice as awkward as she is , I should be only so much the more her friend , and that ' s the truth of it. ' In fact , <NAME> had conceived an incipient affection for <NAME> , after witnessing her failure that morning , and this short conversation with her superior increased the favourable prepossession to a most surprising extent ; which was the more remarkable , as when she first scanned that young lady ' s face and figure , she had entertained certain inward misgivings that they would never agree .
1	' But whether it is all true , or partly true , or entirely false , I am wholly unable to say .
1	Little <NAME> came out wonderfully , told various comic stories , and sang a serious song which was almost as funny as the anecdotes .
1	They are gone , and I resume the journey of my story .
1	In pursuance of my intention of referring to my own fictions only when their course should incidentally connect itself with the progress of my story , I do not enter on the aspirations , the delights , anxieties , and triumphs of my art .
1	So subdued I was by those tears , and by their breaking out again in the course of the quiet walk , that when I was on the coach , and it was clear of the town , I deliberated with an aching heart whether I would not get down when we changed horses and walk back , and have another evening at home , and a better parting .
1	I put it in my mouth for safety , and though my hands trembled a good deal , had just tied the card on very much to my satisfaction , when I felt myself violently chucked under the chin by the long-legged young man , and saw my half-guinea fly out of my mouth into his hand .
1	As it approached , which it did very rapidly , it laboured with increased energy ; and , after knocking at the door , it sounded as if it were stooping down and snorting in at the keyhole .
1	I will not be put down .
1	There was an anxiety even in her hopefulness that made me doubtful if I had done right in approaching the subject .
1	The old man and the child dwelt alone together .
1	' He cut her face right open , and pounded her in the most brutal manner , when she took him ; but she never loosed her hold till he was locked up .
1	<NAME> was pretty sure to be there expecting me , and we went on together through the frosty air and gathering fog towards the twinkling lights of the town .
1	Upon the <NAME> ' s door-steps one day , <NAME> stood with a fluttering heart , and with his small right hand in his father ' s .
1	I take it as a compliment .
1	The lady modestly hesitated to reply , lest there should be any impropriety in holding an interview with <NAME> , with closed doors .
1	' I dare say you can stoop to pick it up , after what you have stooped to here. ' ' I have stooped to nothing but this , ' <NAME> answered as he took it from the ground ; ' and this is mine , for I have earned it by the hardest of hard labour. ' ' You ' re a pretty quick packer , I hope , ' said Mr Boffin ; ' because the sooner you are gone , bag and baggage , the better for all parties. ' ' You need have no fear of my lingering. ' ' There ' s just one thing though , ' said Mr Boffin , ' that I should like to ask you before we come to a good riddance , if it was only to show this young lady how conceited you schemers are , in thinking that nobody finds out how you contradict yourselves. ' ' Ask me anything you wish to ask , ' returned <NAME> , ' but use the expedition that you recommend. ' ' You pretend to have a mighty admiration for this young lady ? ' said Mr Boffin , laying his hand protectingly on <NAME> ' s head without looking down at her .
1	' Does no other profession occur to you , which a young man of your figure and address could take up easily , and see the world to advantage in ? ' asked the manager .
1	' " Still wasting the precious hours , " said the monk at length , turning to the eldest sister as he spoke , " still wasting the precious hours on this vain trifling .
1	' I have every reason to believe , my dear -- indeed I may say I know , ' returned <NAME> , ' that he is wealthy .
1	' Here we are , a breakfasting you see ! ' <NAME> did <NAME> see that anybody was breakfasting , except <NAME> ; but he bowed with all becoming reverence , and looked as cheerful as he could .
1	Mrs Veneering in the same moment relinquishes baby to <NAME> ; presses her aquiline hands upon her brow , to arrange the throbbing intellect within ; orders out the carriage ; and repeats in a distracted and devoted manner , compounded of <NAME> and any self-immolating female of antiquity you may prefer , ' We must work. ' Veneering having instructed his driver to charge at the <NAME> in the streets , like the Life-Guards at <NAME> , is driven furiously to <NAME> , <NAME> ' s .
1	<NAME> , ' said the elder lady , ' this is not a fit conversation for the servants to overhear .
1	Now , in barge and boat ; and now ashore among the osiers , or tramping amidst mud and stakes and jagged stones in low-lying places , where solitary watermarks and signals of strange shapes showed like spectres , <NAME> worked and toiled .
1	' So my son took , of his own will , and on no compulsion , to the course in which he can always , when it is his pleasure , outstrip every competitor , ' she pursued .
1	The suddenness with which he dropped it , when he perceived that it was useless to him ; the malice , insolence , and hatred , he revealed ; the leer with which he exulted , even at this moment , in the evil he had done -- all this time being desperate too , and at his wits ' end for the means of getting the better of us -- though perfectly consistent with the experience I had of him , at first took even me by surprise , who had known him so long , and disliked him so heartily .
1	No ; he said confidently , no !
1	I have n't had the letter more than a quarter of an hour . "
1	The result of that conference was , that <NAME> again withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys ; this time resolved , if his door were broken in ( he was a small <NAME> man of retaliative temperament ) , to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet , and crush a man or two below .
1	The water rose and rose as the sluice poured in , dispersing the scum which had formed behind the lumbering gates , and sending the boat up , so that the sculler gradually rose like an apparition against the light from the bargeman ' s point of view .
1	' A kind office , ' said the little gentleman , nodding to <NAME> as she curtseyed to him .
1	I am very sorry to have done a man wrong , particularly when it can ' t be undone .
1	The ladies agreed that it _was _ very strange , but were unanimously of opinion that it must be very important , or <NAME> & <NAME> would never have sent ; and further , that the business being urgent , she ought to repair to <NAME> & <NAME> ' s without any delay .
1	Do you know that since the change in our fortunes , though I appear to myself to have dreamed more than before , I have always dreamed of myself as very young indeed !
1	The painter hadn ' t made the scar , but I made it ; and there it was , coming and going ; now confined to the upper lip as I had seen it at dinner , and now showing the whole extent of the wound inflicted by the hammer , as I had seen it when she was passionate .
1	Or would it worry you just now ? " " <NAME> me by all means .
1	Some of the windows had been walled up ; of those that remained , all the lower were rustily barred .
1	<NAME> in the <NAME> A beautiful landscape , with the corn bright in it , but not abundant .
1	And when Our <NAME> gets his breathing again , I turns again , and we all goes on together. ' <NAME> had gradually expanded with his description into a stare and a vacant grin .
1	When I went out to the <NAME> , I charged Mrs. Crupp with particular directions to leave the windows open , that my sitting-room might be aired , and purged of his presence .
1	" If , as a honest tradesman , my wenturs goes wrong to-night , I shall make sure that you 've been praying again me , and I shall work you for it just the same as if I seen you do it. " The dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head .
1	Old Mr <NAME> was the first to stretch out his hand , and inquire how he felt .
1	Thus , even while he trembled , and turned burning hot at the idea of speedy death , he fell to counting the iron spikes before him , and wondering how the head of one had been broken off , and whether they would mend it , or leave it as it was .
1	He 's game enough now , I 'll engage .
1	But , despite the punch and the manager , who told a variety of stories , and smoked tobacco from a pipe , and inhaled it in the shape of snuff , with a most astonishing power , <NAME> was absent and dispirited .
1	You need n't bring any , William. " I went on with my breakfast , and <NAME> continued to stand over me , staring fishily and breathing noisily , as he always did .
1	All this time , my leg and foot were in the air .
1	<NAME> took a chair at some distance ; then , another chair a little nearer ; then , moved a little nearer still ; then , nearer again , and finally sat himself on the same sofa , and laid his hand on <NAME> ' s arm .
1	I knowed old <NAME> , sir .
1	<NAME> , to this wretched hour I am ignorant of both .
1	<NAME> <NAME> was firm ; nobody in his world was to be so firm as <NAME> ; nobody else in his world was to be firm at all , for everybody was to be bent to his firmness .
1	After half an hour ' s cooling in the churchyard , I saw the chariot coming back .
1	These institutions were established , no doubt , upon the principle that those who had so large a share in making the laws , would certainly respect them .
1	<NAME> <NAME> gently pressed her hand to his lips , and sank upon the sofa .
1	Never shall I forget the repulsive sight that met my eye when I turned round .
1	Those fellows who were here one night .
1	' I made mention of no names , and I wish to make mention of no names , ' said <NAME> , with a portentous look .
1	" Pooh ! " said he , sluicing his face , and speaking through the water-drops ; " it 's nothing , <NAME> .
1	' I _will_ speak , ' cried the man ; ' I will not be turned out .
1	Even its comforts were limited to its being dry and warm , and having a snug though faded fireside .
1	To make them wear iron collars by day and night , and to worry them with dogs , are practices almost too ordinary to deserve mention .
1	You know <NAME> , the <NAME> , across the lane .
1	Does that look as if I cared for her ?
1	His words at the time ( I was then an infant , but so deep was their impression on me , that I committed them to memory ) were : Then farewell my trim-built wherry , <NAME> and coat and badge farewell !
1	He did it , whether or no .
1	It had only been , as I thought , of less assistance than the horses in getting us on , and it had often aided them .
1	I was obliged to hurry away ; I was kept out late ; and I felt all night such pangs of remorse as made me miserable .
1	" There is another point of view , " he continues , " in which the case presents itself .
1	I will do no more .
1	If you want to cram for anything , I should be troubled to recommend you to a better adviser than <NAME> Bounderby. ' To a more agreeable adviser , or one from whom he would be more likely to learn , <NAME> could never be recommended .
1	' She is a curate ' s daughter , ' said <NAME> ; ' one of ten , down in <NAME> .
1	' My dear , ' said <NAME> , ' if you will mention to Copperfield what our present position is , which I have no doubt he will like to know , I will go and look at the paper the while , and see whether anything turns up among the advertisements. ' ' I thought you were at <NAME> , ma ' am , ' I said to Mrs. Micawber , as he went out .
1	For , a rush from scanty feeding to generous feeding , and from what you may call messing to what you may call method , do require a power of constitution which is not often found in youth , particular when undermined by boarding-school ! ' It will be seen that the <NAME> now openly pitted herself against <NAME> , as one whom she had fully ascertained to be her natural enemy .
1	Do you hear him ? ' ' I believe you are right , mother , ' replied Alice , in a low voice .
1	' I beg to ask my son , from motives of -- ah -- curiosity , ' Mr <NAME> observed , with a decided change in his manner , ' how he becomes possessed of this -- hum -- timely information ? ' ' It ' s not a long story , sir , ' returned <NAME> , <NAME> , ' and you shall have it out of hand .
1	Her manner was more winning than she had cared to let it be to me before , and I thought I saw <NAME> 's influence in the change .
1	I declare here ' s some one else .
1	The meek man was afraid we must take it as proved , because there were the Inquests and the <NAME> ' s returns .
1	Stretching forth her trembling fingers as she spoke , the old creature shook them exultingly before her face , and fumbling in her pocket , brought out an old time-discoloured tin snuff-box , from which she shook a few grains into the outstretched palm of her companion , and a few more into her own .
1	Put that clock aboard a ship an ' pack it off to <NAME> , an ' the time will go on just the same .
1	I had a delightful letter from her , only this morning. ' ' And in short , my dear friend , ' said I , ' you feel as blest as you deserve to feel ! ' ' Oh !
1	The suite of rooms on the ground-floor were lighted up , and a military band was playing in the hall .
1	It may have been a weakness , but if so , it was equally the weakness , I believe , of King Frederick of Prussia. ' These remarks being offered to Mr <NAME> , who had not the courage to come out for single combat , but lurked with his chest under the table and his eyes cast down , <NAME> proceeded , in a voice of increasing sternness and impressiveness , until she should force that skulker to give himself up .
1	He only knew that it was quite correct ; that everything had happened so ; that there he was , alone again , when all the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays .
1	When they were all drawn back , it was found to be locked , and worst of all , the key was gone .
1	I remember that I thought it , in form , more like a riding-habit with the superfluous skirt cut off , than anything else .
1	Where does your sister live ? ' ' Why , she is not settled yet , Mr Headstone .
1	" Well , sir , " says the trooper , looking into his hat after another disconcerted pause , " I am sorry not to have given you more satisfaction .
1	Are we never to be permitted to forget ?
1	He will love and honour you as I will .
1	At any hour later than sunset , and not least at that hour when most of the people who have anything to eat at home are going home to eat it , and when most of those who have nothing have hardly yet slunk out to beg or steal , it was a deserted place and looked on a deserted scene .
1	And not in the same hand , perhaps ?
1	" Settled in the law , " said I .
1	That he is bound to make an effort .
1	No , because he has never seen him , ' rejoined <NAME> ; ' but if we were to bring them together , who knows , <NAME> , but <NAME> , properly introduced , would serve his turn almost as well as little Nell or her grandfather -- who knows but it might make the young fellow ' s fortune , and , through him , yours , eh ? ' ' Why , the fact is , you see , ' said Mr <NAME> , ' that they HAVE been brought together. ' ' Have been ! ' cried the dwarf , looking suspiciously at his companion .
1	<NAME> <NAME> had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries , with the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a cabin-boy without any friends ; and was returning to the workhouse to communicate the result of his mission ; when he encountered at the gate , no less a person than <NAME> , the parochial undertaker .
1	" This , " returned <NAME> , " is as it should be .
1	She is very much alone .
1	It was of no avail .
1	He had a brown hat on his head , and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his neck : with the long frayed ends of which he smeared the beer from his face as he spoke .
1	the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind , and make the heart beat violently , and the breath come thick , by the force of the images they conjure up before it ; the desperate anxiety _to be doing something_ to relieve the pain , or lessen the danger , which we have no power to alleviate ; the sinking of soul and spirit , which the sad remembrance of our helplessness produces ; what tortures can equal these ; what reflections or endeavours can , in the full tide and fever of the time , allay them !
1	The cat leaped down and ripped at a bundle of rags with her tigerish claws , with a sound that it set my teeth on edge to hear .
1	' There ' s perils and dangers on the deep , my beauty , ' said the <NAME> ; ' and over many a brave ship , and many and many a bould heart , the secret waters has closed up , and never told no tales .
1	' <NAME> tells me , <NAME> , ' he eagerly began on coming in -- but stopped when he saw her face .
1	He shall not bully me -- he shall not bully me .
1	His money always as good as the bank -- always. ' As Mrs. <NAME> said this , she applied her handkerchief to her eyes , and went out of the room to get the receipt .
1	If you ' ll believe me I ' ve found that fellow , in the commonest little matters of the office that have been trusted to him , blurting out the truth , though expressly cautioned .
1	To his matter-of-fact home , which was called <NAME> , <NAME> directed his steps .
1	' What came of that , I needn ' t say .
1	It warn ' t much -- execution for nine pound nothin ' , multiplied by five for costs ; but hows ' ever here he stopped for seventeen year .
1	The day was in its prime , the day was in its wane , and still , uneasy in mind and body , she slept on ; unconscious of her strange bed , of the noise and turmoil in the street , and of the light that shone outside the shaded window .
1	<NAME> , a choleric gentleman , who had taken the fourth place on that seat , flew into a most violent passion , and said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such villainous company , and that it was poisonous , and pernicious , and infamous , and shameful , and I do n't know what else .
1	<NAME> , all up with <NAME> ! ' His running on , in this way , had afforded <NAME> an opportunity of recovering his presence of mind , which at once suggested to him the necessity of removing , as far as possible , the schoolmaster ' s misgivings , and leading him to believe that his safety and best policy lay in the preservation of a rigid silence .
1	The father is like his own father , a weak wretched trembling creature , falling to pieces , never sober .
1	You may stare and shiver .
1	' She looks upon me as mere child , sir .
1	" Disappointed , miss , " said <NAME> , peeping through the curtain .
1	Mr <NAME> had uncovered on looking in at the door , and remained so .
1	" Now we 're all right again .
1	" Orlick there ? " " Ah ! " he answered , slouching out .
1	' Lord bless you ! ' said <NAME> , resuming his pipe , ' a man must take the fat with the lean ; that ' s what he must make up his mind to , in this life .
1	<NAME> opinion has knotted the lash , heated the branding-iron , loaded the rifle , and shielded the murderer .
1	Of course , she has remained here ever since .
1	Now , take this paper that <NAME> has carried about him .
1	It was a more difficult task to take leave of the inmates of <NAME> , from whom they had received so much hospitality and kindness .
1	It was the sign of the regeneration of the human race .
1	The dinner and dessert being three hours long , the bashful Member cooled in the shadow of <NAME> faster than he warmed with food and drink , and had but a chilly time of it .
1	I 'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea. " Sydney <NAME> , who , with <NAME> , had been lost in amazement at this turn of the business , here requested <NAME> to moderate and explain himself .
1	At such times , a stranger , looking from one of the wooden bridges thrown across it at <NAME> , will see the inhabitants of the houses on either side lowering from their back doors and windows , buckets , pails , domestic utensils of all kinds , in which to haul the water up ; and when his eye is turned from these operations to the houses themselves , his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene before him .
1	Though always somewhat formal , in his dress , in imitation of the great man whom he served , he stopped short of the extent of Mr <NAME> ' s stiffness : at once perhaps because he knew it to be ludicrous , and because in doing so he found another means of expressing his sense of the difference and distance between them .
1	Either of us might be accused of it , you know. " " Only neither of us is , " I remarked .
1	Shall we terminate our conference for the night ? " " A moment more. " " An hour , if you please. " " Sir , " said the nephew , " we have done wrong , and are reaping the fruits of wrong. " " _We_ have done wrong ? " repeated the <NAME> , with an inquiring smile , and delicately pointing , first to his nephew , then to himself .
1	I see her and her husband , their course done , lying side by side in their last earthly bed , and I know that each was not more honoured and held sacred in the other 's soul , than I was in the souls of both .
1	' Well , but the <NAME> of <NAME> !
1	After breakfast she took me to her own home , and a beautiful little home it was .
1	We feared there must be something the matter , but he resolutely denies it. ' ' No , no , ' said <NAME> , colouring beneath <NAME> ' s gaze ; ' there is really nothing .
1	As the words were spoken , they passed through the wall , and stood upon an open country road , with fields on either hand .
1	No search had been made up here , for the tide had been running strongly down , at that time of the night of <NAME> , and the likeliest places for the discovery of a body , if a fatal accident had happened under such circumstances , all lay—both when the tide ebbed , and when it flowed again—between that spot and the sea .
1	' My country rounds , ' she added at length , ' brought me to <NAME> , <NAME> , the night before last .
1	It is the last bottle of the old Madiera .
1	After dinner , we went down to the railroad again , and took our seats in the cars for <NAME> .
1	He catches at it , thinks he ' ll make sure of the contents of the pockets anyhow , in case he should be parted from it , bends right over the stern , and in one of these heavy squalls , or in the cross-swell of two steamers , or in not being quite prepared , or through all or most or some , gets a lurch , overbalances and goes head-foremost overboard .
1	It was not only a constraint upon the child ' s mind , but even upon the natural grace and freedom of her actions .
1	The little play of feature that his face presented , was cut deep into it , in a few hard curves that made it more like work ; and he had certain notches in his forehead , which looked as though <NAME> had been about to touch them into sensibility or refinement , when she had impatiently thrown away the chisel , and said : ' I really can not be worried to finish off this man ; let him go as he is. ' With too great length of throat at his upper end , and too much ankle-bone and heel at his lower ; with an awkward and hesitating manner ; with a shambling walk ; and with what is called a near sight—which perhaps prevented his observing how much white cotton stocking he displayed to the public eye , in contrast with his black suit—Mr .
1	Betwixt you and me , ma'am , ' returned <NAME> , 'that 's the great principle ; and that 's the reason why , if you look at any cases that get into them owdacious newspapers , you 'll always observe that sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese .
1	<NAME> <NAME> wants to speak to you .
1	' I decline to name it , sir , ' returned <NAME> , suddenly turning loud and sharp .
1	" As if it was not a favour to be protected from the lamp-iron ! " " It is always as the good patriot says , " observed the functionary .
1	<NAME> was the first , and walked by himself smoking .
1	He caught them in his unoccupied hand , and holding them , and still clasping the border of her shawl , said hurriedly : ' But I see thee , <NAME> , setten by the bed .
1	Her mother died when she was a baby , and her father denied her nothing .
1	Remembering , however , that in the <NAME> debates , whether on the life of that nation ' s body or the life of its soul , the question was usually all about and between <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , or <NAME> or Stiltstalking , and nobody else ; he said nothing on the part of mob , bethinking himself that mob was used to it .
1	If the question concerned an outfit for <NAME> , <NAME> would know all about it and would be quite excited .
1	They kept him , many times , from what did him real harm .
1	Armed men and women flocked out of the Quarter so fast , and drew even these last dregs after them with such a force of suction , that within a quarter of an hour there was not a human creature in <NAME> <NAME> 's bosom but a few old crones and the wailing children .
1	<NAME> , <NAME> , I am sorely grieved to see in you more traces of a character as sullen , angry , and wild , as the night now closing in .
1	'Because of <NAME> 's account of him , the said <NAME> . '
1	' I wish you ' d show me the palm of your hand , ' said <NAME> .
1	' One winter ' s evening , about five o ' clock , just as it began to grow dusk , a man in a gig might have been seen urging his tired horse along the road which leads across <NAME> , in the direction of <NAME> .
1	<NAME> , out of date , withdrawing from attention , able to afford it .
1	It was as haggard a view of life as a man need look upon .
1	' Character portraits , oh yes -- they ' re not real military men , you know. ' ' No ! ' ' Bless your heart , of course not ; only clerks and that , who hire a uniform coat to be painted in , and send it here in a carpet bag .
1	The <NAME> , in course of time achieving what he feels to be due to himself in bringing to a dignified conclusion several quarrels he has on hand with the pastrycook ' s men , announces breakfast .
1	I ceased to draw back , and we went straight to the best parlour , where she left me .
1	'It 's a cold ride from <NAME> , ma'am ; and I always find that spirits comes home warmer to the feelings . '
1	<NAME> <NAME> , sitting in the twilight by the open window , enjoys his wine .
1	' I suppose so , ' said <NAME> , looking at <NAME> .
1	Besides ; if you are not filial , sir , if you discard that duty , you are at least -- hum -- not a <NAME> ?
1	' Here , you <NAME> , give me that box out of the straw ! ' This was addressed to the gipsy , who crawled into the low tent on all fours , and after some rummaging and rustling returned with a cash-box , which the man who had spoken opened with a key he wore about his person .
1	' Open the window , ' said the sick man .
1	<NAME> looks at him inquiringly , repeating the name .
1	" I admit it most fully and freely , " said I .
1	<NAME> stepped forward to hand her to the Pill-Box which was at the service of all the Pills in <NAME> Court <NAME> ; and she got into that vehicle with distinguished serenity , and was driven away .
1	There was nothing very inviting in the object , but Mr <NAME> was wrapt in a brown study , and sat contemplating it with far greater attention than , in a more conscious mood , he would have deigned to bestow upon the rarest exotic .
1	I was tired of reading , and dead sleepy ; but having leave , as a high treat , to sit up until my mother came home from spending the evening at a neighbour ' s , I would rather have died upon my post ( of course ) than have gone to bed .
1	' Ah ! ' Mrs <NAME> curled the little finger of her left hand as who should say , ' I have caught you .
1	There was a bright moon , but it was behind the clouds .
1	A gentleman from <NAME> ' ' Bring him up here ! ' Mr <NAME> muttered , as if he deemed that unnecessary ; but , turning to Mr Dorrit , said , ' Mrs Clennam .
1	In her bower she was , but not alone , for besides the old lady her mother of whom mention has recently been made , there were present some half-dozen ladies of the neighborhood who had happened by a strange accident ( and also by a little understanding among themselves ) to drop in one after another , just about tea-time .
1	They put him into a great chair they had among them , and which they had taken either out of the Court itself , or one of its rooms or passages .
1	<NAME> Jobling is buttoned up closer than mere adornment might require .
1	And I will say , ' added Mr <NAME> , ' to his ill-looking face , that in my opinion the world would be no worse for his slipping out of it altogether. ' ' Your opinion is not asked , ' answered <NAME> .
1	A great deal of laughter ensued , and Mrs. <NAME> volunteered to humour him , so she took a slight sip out of her glass .
1	<NAME> ( so self-named ) was the unfortunate child who had fallen downstairs , who now interrupted the correspondence by presenting himself , with a strip of plaster on his forehead , to exhibit his wounded knees , in which <NAME> and I did not know which to pity most -- the bruises or the dirt .
1	When a porter had put his luggage in the coach , and received his fare , he turned round and was gone ; and before my uncle had well begun to wonder what had become of him , half a dozen fresh ones started up , and staggered along under the weight of parcels , which seemed big enough to crush them .
1	They were immediately admitted into the lodge .
1	Mrs General consequently found her means so much diminished , that , but for the perfect regulation of her mind , she might have felt disposed to question the accuracy of that portion of the late service which had declared that the commissary could take nothing away with him .
1	But , it was only the pleasanter to turn to <NAME> and to <NAME> , whose great forbearance shone more brightly than before , if that could be , contrasted with this brazen pretender .
1	He took the same occasion of inviting them to a comprehensive entertainment , to be given to the whole College in the yard , and at which he signified he would have the honour of taking a parting glass to the health and happiness of all those whom he was about to leave behind .
1	" We thought that , perhaps , " said I , hesitating , " it is right to begin with the obligations of home , sir ; and that , perhaps , while those are overlooked and neglected , no other duties can possibly be substituted for them . "
1	<NAME> <NAME> , don ' t you hear a knock ? ' ' I ' ll answer the door in one moment , <NAME> , ' replied the clerk .
1	Besides you -- you ' re disappointed , <NAME> , and , not knowing what you say , expose yourself. ' ' Yes , you pitiful dastard , ' retorted the lovely damsel , ' I understand you .
1	' Not a button , ' said <NAME> .
1	Two peculiarly blunt knocks or pokes at the door , as if the dead man arriving on his back were striking at it with the soles of his motionless feet .
1	rejoined <NAME> ; 'that was done by <NAME> , that was . '
1	I am not a bad compiler , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , preserving the same air of cheerful confidence in all he said , ' but I have no invention at all ; not a particle .
1	Yes , verily , my lords and gentlemen and honourable boards , adapting your Catechism to the occasion , and by <NAME> ' s help so you must .
1	' Of <NAME> and <NAME> , in the wine trade , ' he replied .
1	Better far than all the <NAME> put together know him. ' Mrs. Tope ' s care has spread a very neat , clean breakfast ready for her lodger .
1	This resistance only infuriated <NAME> the more ; who , dropping on his knees , began to assail the animal most furiously .
1	<NAME> <NAME> ' dresses at ' the <NAME> ; has been bowed to for the <NAME> , in mistake ; has even been spoken to in the street as <NAME> , under the impression that he was the <NAME> come down unexpectedly , without his chaplain .
1	He rightly judged that , at first at all events , they would go in a contrary direction from their late companion .
1	Especially as you have no call to be told how to value yourself , my dear. ' Colouring a little under this compliment , <NAME> returned , ' I hope sir , you don ' t think me vain ? ' ' Not a bit , my dear , ' said Mr Boffin .
1	And however far off that may be , I will never tire of trying .
1	' Very , very , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , without moving a muscle of his face .
1	My brother <NAME> , ' said the old man admiringly , ' is fit company for monarchs ; but not so your uncle , my dear .
1	One of these papers was a letter to this girl <NAME> ; the other a will . '
1	Yet he said it with so much meaning , too , that I felt he as perfectly understood <NAME> to be my benefactress , as I understood the fact myself .
1	But by this time , his doubts were all removed .
1	" <NAME> is the best policy , " is it ?
1	She and her husband had worked too , and had brought their simple faith and honour clean out of dustheaps .
1	The lady says what ' s right .
1	<NAME> Leicester is not aware that any client of <NAME> has been in need of his assistance .
1	A Shoal of <NAME> 35 .
1	I have ever since connected the feeling with that spot and time and with everything associated with that spot and time , to the distant voices in the town , the barking of a dog , and the sound of wheels coming down the miry hill .
1	On one occasion , when an execution had just been put in , coming home through some chance as early as six o ' clock , I saw her lying ( of course with a twin ) under the grate in a swoon , with her hair all torn about her face ; but I never knew her more cheerful than she was , that very same night , over a veal cutlet before the kitchen fire , telling me stories about her papa and mama , and the company they used to keep .
1	I am far from sure that I believed there was anything hopeful in it , but my mind was thoroughly made up that it must be carried into execution .
1	Now , considered as an abstract circumstance , there was no more obvious cause or reason why <NAME> should take the trouble of muffling this particular knocker , than there would have been for his muffling the knocker of any nobleman or gentleman resident ten miles off ; because , for the greater convenience of the numerous lodgers , the street-door always stood wide open , and the knocker was never used at all .
1	She felt unwilling , almost unable , to go on to her own chamber ; and turning into the drawing-rooms , where the clouded moon was shining through the blinds , looked out into the empty streets .
1	' You , injured by his haughty temper !
1	How are you gettin ' on , and how is the chandlery bis ' ness likely to do ?
1	I have been no lover of this lady ' s .
1	<NAME> stands amazed in the disk of light , like a ragged figure in a magic-lantern , trembling to think that he has offended against the law in not having moved on far enough .
1	'Not a penny , ' replied the girl , waving her hand .
1	The very wedding looked dismal as they passed in front of the altar .
1	When he turned round again with a composed countenance , his subordinate still stood in the same place , and the dolls ' dressmaker sat behind the door with a look of horror .
1	Then came the night -- dark , dismal , silent night .
1	A day passed away and his mother was not there ; another flew by , and she came not near him ; a third evening arrived , and yet he had not seen her -- , and in four-and-twenty hours he was to be separated from her , perhaps for ever .
1	It was for me to smile .
1	' <NAME> , aye , ' said the little man ; ' that ' s a matter of opinion , you know , and we won ' t dispute about terms ; because of course you can ' t be expected to view these subjects with a professional eye .
1	<NAME> asserted the family gentility , and his own , by coming out in the character of the aristocratic brother , and loftily swaggering in the little skittle ground respecting seizures by the scruff of the neck , which there were looming probabilities of some gentleman unknown executing on some little puppy not mentioned .
1	The man who was seated there , was tall and dark , and wore a large cloak .
1	" Yes , ma'am ; I could do that , if I was wanted. " " Since this house strikes you old and grave , boy , " said <NAME> , impatiently , " and you are unwilling to play , are you willing to work ? " I could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had been able to find for the other question , and I said I was quite willing .
1	Still I cried very much , not only in the fullness of my heart after reading the letter , not only in the strangeness of the prospect -- for it was strange though I had expected the contents -- but as if something for which there was no name or distinct idea were indefinitely lost to me .
1	But we always calls him <NAME> just the same .
1	She stopped , and reddened again .
1	<NAME> , I have an inexpressible desire to find service with a young lady who is good , accomplished , beautiful .
1	This was merely intended as a tribute to the animal 's abilities , but it was an appropriate remark in another sense , if <NAME> had only known it ; for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen , claiming to be out-and-out Christians , between whom , and <NAME> ' dog , there exist strong and singular points of resemblance .
1	May I ask a question , <NAME> , before I go ? " " I think you may take that liberty , " the <NAME> answered , smiling .
1	And he was -- honourable and manful -- for two year going on , and we was just the same at home here as afore. ' <NAME> ' s face , which had varied in its expression with the various stages of his narrative , now resumed all its former triumphant delight , as he laid a hand upon my knee and a hand upon <NAME> ' s ( previously wetting them both , for the greater emphasis of the action ) , and divided the following speech between us : ' All of a sudden , one evening -- as it might be tonight -- comes little Em ' ly from her work , and him with her !
1	With many adieus and good wishes , <NAME> went his way .
1	She rose too , and he took leave with all humility .
1	As <NAME> said this , with the becoming indignation of an ill-used man ; and as <NAME> felt that it rather tended to convey a reflection on the honour of the parish ; the latter gentleman thought it advisable to change the subject .
1	I wanted to be cutting at those trees in the forest of difficulty , under circumstances that should prove my strength .
1	' Now for the shore—who ' s for the shore ? ' — ' These gentlemen , I am sorry to say. ' They are away , and never said , <NAME> b ' ye .
1	' Pretty well ! ' echoed <NAME> .
1	Try easy now. ' He tried easy now ; but the luck resisted ; wouldn ' t come .
1	' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , laughing boisterously , ' they dean ' t put too much intiv ' em .
1	But we preserved an unbroken silence .
1	It was after much consideration of this fact , and much pondering over such an unfortunate combination of circumstances , that a bright idea occurred to the <NAME> .
1	' Assuredly. ' ' Why , I have not mentioned , <NAME> , ' said I , a little embarrassed , ' that <NAME> is rather difficult to -- I would not , for the world , say , to rely upon , because she is the soul of purity and truth -- but rather difficult to -- I hardly know how to express it , really , <NAME> .
1	My child is always dangerous , more or less .
1	' " " It 's pity , " said I , scornfully , as I finished my interrupted breakfast , " that the man did not say what he had done and would do again. " " Squires of the <NAME> ! " <NAME> was now addressing the landlord , " and <NAME> !
1	I had never laughed and cried in all my life , I dare say -- not even to her -- more freely than I did that morning .
1	For not one moment after I have ceased to speak , will I stay here ! ' He turned upon her with his ugliest look , and gripped the table with his hand ; but neither rose , nor otherwise answered or threatened her .
1	You are to be a proctor .
1	But she joined in the forfeits , and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet .
1	The quantity of walking exercise I took , was not in this respect attended with its usual consequence , as the disappointment counteracted the fresh air .
1	Mr Morfin , as an officer of inferior state , inhabited the room that was nearest to the clerks .
1	The anxiety of his mind , and the numerous meditations which <NAME> had awakened , prevented his share of the mortar of punch producing that effect upon him which it would have had under other circumstances .
1	" Why this , " returns <NAME> , not able to be very conciliatory at first , " is <NAME> , who has obliged me in that matter of ours , you know . "
1	He might as well have been born with a yard and a half of it , and a remnant over . "
1	" <NAME> will give us a good deal of trouble -- " " It is the character of such a mind , <NAME> , " <NAME> interrupts him , " TO give trouble .
1	' I know he is , ' rejoined <NAME> .
1	It may prevent some persons laying under suspicion alonger me. " " You can say what you like , " returned the sergeant , standing coolly looking at him with his arms folded , " but you have no call to say it here .
1	he said , rising and pushing back his chair .
1	' If you was to take and show that man the buoy at the <NAME> , ' said <NAME> in the same tone , ' and ask him his opinion of it , <NAME> ' r , he ' d give you an opinion that was no more like that buoy than your Uncle ' s buttons are .
1	<NAME> had stopped , not for the first time by many times , to look about him and suffer what he saw to sink into his soul , as the shadows , looked at , seemed to sink deeper and deeper into the water .
1	We went down on the next day but one , and we found her in the room where I had first beheld her , and it is needless to add that there was no change in <NAME> .
1	' And thank this gentleman , ' interposed the old man , ' but for whose care I might have lost my little girl to-night. ' ' No , no , master , ' said <NAME> , ' that won ' t do , that won ' t. ' ' What do you mean ? ' cried the old man .
1	These crawling things had fascinated my attention , and I was watching them from a distance , when <NAME> laid a hand upon my shoulder .
1	' I don ' t know , ' replied <NAME> , in the same tone .
1	She does not even know my name. ' ' I ' ll ask it for all that .
1	Women work hard in these parts .
1	Why , if I was to say to them , " I ' m told your friend <NAME> is a base wretch , " they ' d laugh at me. ' ' They will laugh no more at us , I take it , ' said <NAME> , advancing .
1	" Never you mind for me , miss .
1	I can act with philosophy in such a case as that .
1	Our new shoes had come home , but we hadn ' t put ' em on .
1	I have a good deal to say to you. ' ' What papers are those ? ' inquired <NAME> , as the little man deposited on the table a small bundle of documents tied with red tape .
1	These have been his relations towards me .
1	<NAME> for your nurture of him , moan for your corruption of him , moan for your loss of him , moan for mine ! ' She clenched her hand , and trembled through her spare , worn figure , as if her passion were killing her by inches .
1	<NAME> on in the night , <NAME> opened his eyes .
1	Begging your pardon , <NAME> , ' said Mr Perch , hesitating at the door , ' he ' s rough , <NAME> , in appearance. ' ' Never mind .
1	It has not yet come to my sister ' s knowledge that we have found it out , but we have .
1	' She is fond of having other children noticed and caressed by the teachers , and those whom she respects ; but this must not be carried too far , or she becomes jealous .
1	But this put me into such a tremble lest they should detain me there that she soon recalled her words and compromised for a rest of half an hour .
1	' Of course you like dancing ? ' ' Oh no , I don ' t , ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> was many miles too near , and we reached it many hours too soon ; but <NAME> came to himself a little short of it , and said , ' You must come in , <NAME> , and rest ! ' and I consenting , we had sandwiches and wine-and-water .
1	Is there no devil to help me ? ' Swiftly , there glided again into his brain the figure he had raised that night .
1	But no temperature made the melancholy mad elephants more mad or more sane .
1	' Oh , you disgraceful old chap ! ' The very breathing of the figure was contemptible , as it laboured and rattled in that operation , like a blundering clock .
1	And I know brickmakers go about working at piecework in different places .
1	The service over , and the clergyman withdrawn , Mr Dombey looks round , demanding in a low voice , whether the person who has been requested to attend to receive instructions for the tablet , is there ?
1	His manner is the gravely impressive manner of a man who has not committed himself in life otherwise than as he has become the victim of a tender sorrow of the heart .
1	So much the more weight shall I attach to the pledge I require from you , when it is unreservedly given. ' The young man twice or thrice essayed to speak , but failed .
1	" So am I , they tell me . "
1	When you come in , sir , I was just putting it to my fellow-partner , ' towards whom he turned , ' to say to <NAME> upon his word and honour , whether he ' d ever been of this opinion long ago , or not .
1	Mrs. <NAME> was so much affected on this particular occasion , that , assisting <NAME> to his hat after breakfast , and being then alone with him in the hall , she imprinted a chaste kiss upon his hand , murmured ' My benefactor ! ' and retired , overwhelmed with grief .
1	What does it matter whether such a blighted life as mine comes to an end , now , next week , or next year ?
1	The victim cried , but in a subdued manner as if she feared to raise her voice , and <NAME> , comforting herself with a pinch of snuff , ascended the stairs , just as <NAME> had safely reached the office .
1	<NAME> looked at me a little frightened .
1	There was a red brick house with a small paved courtyard in front , which anybody might have known belonged to the attorney ; and there was , moreover , another red brick house with <NAME> blinds , and a large brass door-plate with a very legible announcement that it belonged to the surgeon .
1	Two or three mighty stacks of chimneys , and a few large dark rooms which had escaped being walled and subdivided out of the recognition of their old proportions , gave the Yard a character .
1	Shall I tell you more ?
1	It ' s my business to see it .
1	If that house has failed , and he the first to bring the news ! -- Is the coach there ? ' ' Yes , yes , ' said <NAME> , startled by the fierce tone of the inquiry .
1	So many hundred Hands in this <NAME> ; so many hundred horse <NAME> .
1	' The duty done , and act of reparation performed , which can alone enable me to contemplate my fellow mortal , I shall be known no more .
1	It was the journey ' s fitting end , and might have been the end of everything ; it was so ruinous and dreary .
1	' Do you mean to tell me , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , folding his arms emphatically , and turning half-round to the jury , as if in mute assurance that he would bother the witness yet -- ' do you mean to tell me , <NAME> , that you saw nothing of this fainting on the part of the plaintiff in the arms of the defendant , which you have heard described by the witnesses ? ' Certainly not , ' replied <NAME> ; ' I was in the passage till they called me up , and then the old lady was not there. ' ' Now , attend , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , dipping a large pen into the inkstand before him , for the purpose of frightening <NAME> with a show of taking down his answer .
1	They look very , very like that sort of thing .
1	' <NAME> know , ' said <NAME> .
1	It remained thus , until the first warning bell began to ring .
1	I work hard , and read Law insatiably .
1	" The house is yonder , " <NAME> exclaimed .
1	He , and his old canvas frock , and his loose stockings , and all his poor tatters of clothes , had , in a long seclusion from direct light and air , faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchment-yellow , that it would have been hard to say which was which .
1	There was a faint light in a chamber window not far off , and <NAME> ran towards that house to ask their way .
1	<NAME> , when he was sufficiently cool , proceeded with his letter .
1	' Stop a minute , ' said <NAME> ; ' I wos a-going to say , he always brings now , a flat bottle as holds about a pint and a half , and fills it vith the pine-apple rum afore he goes avay. ' ' And empties it afore he comes back , I s ' pose ? ' said <NAME> .
1	Certainly not. ' This dumb-show , taking place during the whole time of the invalid ' s breakfast , and the invalid himself , pale and emaciated , performing no small part in the same , it may be fairly questioned whether at any meal , where no word , good or bad , was spoken from beginning to end , so much was expressed by gestures in themselves so slight and unimportant .
1	You see me at my greatest disadvantage .
1	Almost in an instant afterwards , as I leaned back in my seat , he looked in , with his lighted lantern in his hand , an excited and quite different man .
1	' What ' s the matter ? ' said the short dark man .
1	Returning to the <NAME> with which burden , he was descried coming round into the court , by the wary young Blight watching from the window : who instantly closed the outer door , and left the miserable object to expend his fury on the panels .
1	" <NAME> 's your mother ? " " There , sir ! " said I .
1	In about a quarter of an hour Mr Chuckster ( with a pen behind his ear and his face inflamed with wine ) appeared at the door , and condescending to address Kit by the jocose appellation of ' Young Snob , ' informed him that the visitors were coming out .
1	In the hunted air of the people there was yet some wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay .
1	' I hope they are , ' said <NAME> , fixing his eyes upon his friend .
1	<NAME> among the undertakers and the equipages and the calves of so many legs all steeped in grief , <NAME> sits concealed in one of the inconsolable carriages and at his ease surveys the crowd through the lattice blinds .
1	There was one piece of gold among it , and an emergency might come when its worth to them would be increased a hundred fold .
1	The solicitors ' wives , and the wine-merchant ' s wife , headed another grade ( the brewer ' s wife visited the <NAME> ) ; and Mrs. <NAME> , the post- office keeper , seemed by mutual consent to have been chosen the leader of the trade party .
1	Now , I 'll tell you what I have got for supper , <NAME> .
1	While these observations were being exchanged between <NAME> and <NAME> ; and while the boy in the gray livery , marvelling at the unwonted prolongation of the dinner , cast an anxious look , from time to time , towards the glass door , distracted by inward misgivings regarding the amount of minced veal which would be ultimately reserved for his individual cravings ; there rolled soberly on through the streets of <NAME> , a private fly , painted of a sad green colour , drawn by a chubby sort of brown horse , and driven by a surly-looking man with his legs dressed like the legs of a groom , and his body attired in the coat of a coachman .
1	Here <NAME> bowed grimly to <NAME> , while <NAME> and <NAME> glanced mutual distrust out of the corners of their eyes .
1	Come. ' Down they sat to breakfast , but it was evident , notwithstanding the boasting of <NAME> , that he laboured under a very considerable degree of nervousness , of which loss of appetite , a propensity to upset the tea-things , a spectral attempt at drollery , and an irresistible inclination to look at the clock , every other second , were among the principal symptoms .
1	To exclude the cold , one half of this door was fast closed , and the other was opened but a very little way .
1	He rather congratulated himself on his prudence when the single gentleman , without notice or explanation of any kind , double-locked the door .
1	Of course you gentlemen hardly failed to observe that he was towing by the neck and arms. ' They had helped to release the rope , and of course not .
1	At <NAME> ' s time of life it was not to be expected that she should examine herself very closely on the congruity or stability of her position in Mr <NAME> ' s house .
1	It appeared on the whole , to <NAME> herself , that this same society in which they lived , greatly resembled a superior sort of <NAME> .
1	If <NAME> comes home on account of ill health , he must not be allowed to go back , and we must endeavour to make some more suitable and fortunate provision for him in this country. ' Mrs. <NAME> was so overcome by this generous speech -- which , I need not say , she had not at all expected or led up to -- that she could only tell the Doctor it was like himself , and go several times through that operation of kissing the sticks of her fan , and then tapping his hand with it .
1	' Of course I am , ' replied <NAME> haughtily .
1	It was rather expensive at first , in consequence of the increase in the undertaker 's bill , and the necessity of taking in the clothes of all the paupers , which fluttered loosely on their wasted , shrunken forms , after a week or two 's gruel .
1	The fellow , by his agent , or secretary , or somebody , writes to me 'Sir <NAME> , <NAME> , presents his compliments to <NAME> , and has to call his attention to the fact that the green pathway by the old parsonage-house , now the property of <NAME> , is <NAME> 's right of way , being in fact a portion of the park of <NAME> , and that <NAME> finds it convenient to close up the same . '
1	Perhaps you ' ll kindly let me have it , and I ' ll trot off to my work. ' ' I let you have it ? ' said <NAME> , turning his head towards her ; for he had been sitting blinking at the light , and feeling his cheek .
1	' And not a wery sure one , neither , ' added <NAME> ; ' I got reg ' larly done the other day. ' ' No ! ' said his father .
1	<NAME> eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them , and their hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty , and all awry with howling , and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of sleep .
1	Be seated , <NAME> , I beg , <NAME> .
1	Do you imagine that I bestow a thought on it , or suppose you could do any harm to that low place , which money would not pay for , and handsomely ?
1	Mr Dombey , Sir. ' <NAME> bowed .
1	And what ' s going to be undertook for that unfortunate young woman , <NAME> , now ? ' ' You touch a point that my thoughts have been dwelling on since yesterday , ' said I , ' but on which I can give you no information yet , <NAME> .
1	' I congratulate you , <NAME> , ' said Mr <NAME> , who had meditated this neat address while coming along , ' on the day. ' Mrs <NAME> thanked him with a magnanimous sigh , and again became an unresisting prey to that inscrutable toothache .
1	Then is she kind and cruel , stately and unassuming , various , beautifully wilful .
1	Let ' s have a good ' un ! ' ' Hurrah ! ' ' Noo then , ' said <NAME> , ' let ' s have yan more to end wi ' , and then coot off as quick as you loike .
1	O yeth , to be thure !
1	When <NAME> was summoned to the couch , <NAME> , attentive to all that happened , slipped behind that wicked shadow—a sight in the horror of his face , if there had been eyes there for any sight but one—and whispered in his ear .
1	The child who had been her little friend came there , almost as soon as it was day , with an offering of dried flowers which he begged them to lay upon her breast .
1	Did the honourable <NAME> allude to him ?
1	said <NAME> , pausing near the door .
1	She said no more at the time ; but she presently stopped and looked at me again ; and presently again ; and after that , looked frowning and moody .
1	It was evident that the three daughters had grown up as they could and had had just as little haphazard instruction as qualified them to be their father 's playthings in his idlest hours .
1	It is the fate of a lonely old man , that those about him should form new and different attachments and leave him .
1	In my child ' s name , if not in my own , I make the admission in the fullest manner , at the same time reserving -- ha -- shall I say my personal dignity ?
1	But soon the steeples called good people all , to church and chapel , and away they came , flocking through the streets in their best clothes , and with their gayest faces .
1	" What 's the matter with the cat ? "
1	And I mean to be paid high , Mr Venus , I promise you. ' ' You speak quite revengefully , Mr Wegg. ' ' Revengefully , sir ?
1	said a little ugly hump-backed man : opening the door so suddenly , that the doctor , from the very impetus of his last kick , nearly fell forward into the passage .
1	She was alarmed by an occurrence in the house which might have alarmed a stronger person , and was made ill by the distress and agitation .
1	That ' s what your daughter wants .
1	' Do you pretend to believe , ' Mrs Lammle resumes , sternly , ' when you talk of my marrying you for worldly advantages , that it was within the bounds of reasonable probability that I would have married you for yourself ? ' ' Again there are two sides to the question , <NAME> .
1	' I ain ' t a man of many words , but I take it very kind of you to be so friendly , and above-board .
1	Be good -- deserve it -- and abide by <NAME> 's instructions. " She looked at me , and looked at <NAME> , and <NAME> 's countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile .
1	" Besides , it 's not as if I was an accomplished girl who had any right to give herself airs , " said <NAME> .
1	It was a hard parting , though it was not for long .
1	A waiter showed me into the coffee-room ; and a chambermaid introduced me to my small bedchamber , which smelt like a hackney-coach , and was shut up like a family vault .
1	He is calling again ! ' ' It may be the last time we shall ever meet on earth , ' said <NAME> , ' it may be better for me that we should never meet more. ' ' For both , for both , ' replied <NAME> , not heeding what she said .
1	If it don ' t act well , or don ' t quite accord with our mutual convenience , he can easily go to the right-about .
1	The word <NAME> , besides , gives a pretty form to the lips .
1	He passed his handkerchief across his forehead , took off his spectacles , wiped them , and put them on again ; and his voice had recovered its wonted softness of tone when he said -- ' What have you there , <NAME> ? ' ' Called at the post-office just now , and found this here letter , as has laid there for two days , ' replied <NAME> .
1	Placing a strong emphasis on the last word , he suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a ghastly grin , and , nodding his head , left the room .
1	All this while , <NAME> , with his pipe in his mouth , walked up and down , complacently admiring , but never interfering ; in which condition , indeed , as to the business and his domestic affairs , he walked up and down through life .
1	I am staying at the house of papa ' s agent , <NAME> , in <NAME> , <NAME> .
1	' Better there than here , ' said a third voice aloud -- <NAME> ' s , though she did not move .
1	' <NAME> ' t be afeard , mun , ' he said ; ' tak ' eneaf to carry thee whoam .
1	Let me go my way , all of ye .
1	A blunderbuss and two swords hung above the chimney-piece , for the terror of evil-doers , but the blunderbuss was rusty and shattered , and the swords were broken and edgeless .
1	" You will lose the disinterested part of your Don Quixote character , " said <NAME> to <NAME> over her shoulder again , " if you only redress the wrongs of beauty like this .
1	Never , since I have been here ! "
1	What could I do , but kiss away her tears , and tell her how I doted on her , after that !
1	'This young lady , ' the gentleman began , 'has communicated to me , and to some other friends who can be safely trusted , what you told her nearly a fortnight since .
1	I name one week from this day , for a last final visit on my part ; when you will unconditionally accept it or reject it , with its train of consequences .
1	' I fully understands my instructions , do I , <NAME> ? ' inquired <NAME> .
1	When it is better for the happiness of all parties that no visiting should take place , ( as in the case of our brother <NAME> , and his establishment ) that is quite different. ' I intimated that my aunt would be proud and delighted to make their acquaintance ; though I must say I was not quite sure of their getting on very satisfactorily together .
1	' Fine night , sir. ' ' Very much so indeed , ' replied <NAME> , as the waiter placed a small decanter of brandy , and some hot water before him .
1	<NAME> and patience , hope and patience ! ' These words were uttered in too low a tone to reach the ears of the young men .
1	I look from <NAME> , in his Sunday neckcloth , to the pulpit ; and think what a good place it would be to play in , and what a castle it would make , with another boy coming up the stairs to attack it , and having the velvet cushion with the tassels thrown down on his head .
1	We all got up then ; and my mother said hurriedly that , as it was so late , and <NAME> and <NAME> approved of early hours for young people , perhaps I had better go to bed .
1	We must break it to get it through into the cage .
1	It was ratified only the other day .
1	I went out of my senses immediately ; became a mere driveller next day , on receipt of a little lace-edged sheet of note-paper , ' Favoured by papa .
1	'Yer know , Work'us , ' continued <NAME> , emboldened by <NAME> 's silence , and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity : of all tones the most annoying : 'Yer know , Work'us , it ca n't be helped now ; and of course yer could n't help it then ; and I am very sorry for it ; and I 'm sure we all are , and pity yer very much .
1	If we had been waited on by any boat , I should have run in to shore , and have obliged her to go on , or to make her purpose evident .
1	' <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , ' horrible. ' A low tap was heard at the room door .
1	' Yes , <NAME> , ' she said , when that young lady had concluded .
1	Her bosom was heaving in a distressful manner that I greatly pitied , but I thought it better not to speak .
1	Mr Lightwood , here has been a wicked cruel murder .
1	' Well , good-bye , then , ' said the old gentleman .
1	You summon no energy and purpose .
1	' Welcome misery , welcome houselessness , welcome hunger , rags , tempest , and beggary !
1	" Well , well , my dear , " said <NAME> , " we wo n't go into that now .
1	But permit me to set you right on one point .
1	Shall I make any more apologies , <NAME> ? ' ' Not one , ' replied that gentleman .
1	' <NAME> much so , for our peace , perhaps , my dear , ' returned her mother ; ' but we won ' t complain .
1	I am always afraid of inconveniencing busy men , being an idle man. ' ' I should not have thought so , from your appearance. ' ' No ?
1	He would go on with a musing repetition of the title of his old firm twenty thousand times , and at every one of them , would turn his head upon his pillow .
1	It was due to the uniform he wore , to demand this explanation .
1	While he thus walked up and down with his eyes on the ground , <NAME> , in the chair from which she had risen to receive him , sat listening anew .
1	But I say this , fearing you may want money to save your own blood from exposure and disgrace -- make as much as you can ! ' <NAME> shook his head , but looked at him thoughtfully too .
1	'We are all weak creeturs , ' said <NAME> .
1	A miniature painter lived there , for there was a large gilt frame screwed upon the street-door , in which were displayed , upon a black velvet ground , two portraits of naval dress coats with faces looking out of them , and telescopes attached ; one of a young gentleman in a very vermilion uniform , flourishing a sabre ; and one of a literary character with a high forehead , a pen and ink , six books , and a curtain .
1	" I am sorry to say I am . "
1	' Is that all ? ' ' Theer ' s yet a something else , ' he returned , ' if I can say it , <NAME> ' r Davy. ' We walked on , farther than we had walked yet , before he spoke again .
1	There was another long pause .
1	On the shelving bank of the river , among the slimy stones of a causeway -- not the special causeway of the <NAME> , which had a landing-place of its own , but another , a little removed , and very near to the old windmill which was the denounced man ' s dwelling-place -- were a few boats ; some , moored and already beginning to float ; others , hauled up above the reach of the tide .
1	He could not have said how many , or when ; but he saw in the faces of his pupils that they had seen him in that state , and that they were possessed by a dread of his relapsing .
1	I think that will cure her , my boy .
1	There are no ends of ways of leaving here .
1	Except when a constrained and singular reserve crept over her ; and then she seemed ( but <NAME> hardly understood this , though she could not choose but notice it , and think about it ) as if she were humbled before <NAME> , and ill at ease .
1	More unfortunately still , she had relations .
1	But these flights of fancy seldom burnished the brass plate of <NAME> and <NAME> ' s Offices into a tablet of golden hope , or shed a brilliant lustre on their dirty skylights ; and when the <NAME> and <NAME> talked about <NAME> and masters ' daughters , <NAME> felt that he understood his true position at <NAME> and <NAME> ' s , much better than they did .
1	In regard of the other <NAME> , the nondescript lodged in the same house with herself and uncle .
1	I a ' most think you ' re like the wulturs , pardner , and scent ' em out. ' He spoke in a dropped voice , and with more than one glance at <NAME> who had pulled on her hood again .
1	is there no chord in your heart that I can touch !
1	Above all the noise we made , I heard them running up the stairs , and crying out -- I heard my mother crying out -- and <NAME> .
1	' How can you be so thankless to your best friend , <NAME> ?
1	' Then why DO you wait ? ' said <NAME> .
1	More than once or twice , more than twice or thrice , say half a dozen times , he took his stick from the arm on which he nursed it , and hit a straight sharp rap at the air with its head .
1	He came near me no more ; but devoted himself to an old gentleman in long gaiters , to meet whom a pint of special port seemed to come out of the cellar of its own accord , for he gave no order .
1	Call him Trotwood , certainly , ' said <NAME> .
1	' <NAME> ' was evidently the idol of her life ; never to be shaken on his pedestal by any commotion ; always to be believed in , and done homage to with the whole faith of her heart , come what might .
1	There he found Mr Rugg .
1	' If you please , sir , would you have the goodness to walk in , and speak to <NAME> ? ' ' <NAME> sent you for me ? ' I inquired .
1	Not only was I soon as well known on the <NAME> as the postmen on that beat , but I pervaded <NAME> likewise .
1	I pointed out to my darling how this could scarcely be , because <NAME> had come to her cousin <NAME> 's house and had known us all there , and because he had always liked <NAME> , and <NAME> had always liked him , and -- and so forth .
1	Look at him ! ' ' Well , I _am_ looking at him , ' said <NAME> .
1	' If there is a gentleman in this party , ' said <NAME> , looking round and scarcely able to make his white lips form the words , ' he will acquaint me with the name and residence of this man. ' There was a dead silence .
1	It was very hard , but I turned back , though with a heavy heart , and began laboriously and methodically to plod over the same tedious ground at a snail ' s pace ; stopping to examine minutely every speck in the way , on all sides , and making the most desperate efforts to know these elusive characters by sight wherever I met them .
1	said <NAME> , chafed into perfect defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his regrets ; " cause it ca n't come out in the 'dictment ; 'cause nobody will never know half of what he was .
1	<NAME> is prettier , thought the good Minor Canon frequently , when taking his seat at table opposite his long-widowed mother .
1	As they stole farther and farther in by slight and scarcely perceptible degrees , and with such caution that they scarcely seemed to breathe , the old hag and <NAME> little dreaming of any such invasion , and utterly unconscious of there being any soul near but themselves , were busily occupied with their tasks .
1	said the doctor , laying <NAME> gently down again .
1	<NAME> , my dear friend , pardon ! ' <NAME> could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses , and perhaps would not have done so , but for the corroborative testimony afforded by the smiling countenance of <NAME> , and the bodily presence , in the background , of <NAME> and the pretty housemaid ; who appeared to contemplate the proceedings with the liveliest satisfaction .
1	I wish I could doubt the evidence of my senses , but their depositions are unimpeachable .
1	Appealing to <NAME> , would be rather a rum course .
1	Look sharp with the light , or I shall knock my brains out against something in this confounded hole . '
1	Do I ? ' ' Yes , ' she answered with a smile .
1	I merely wish that we should -- ha -- understand each other .
1	' Because you understand , ' resumed the <NAME> , coming back again to enforce this charge upon his mind , ' there may be , for anything I can say , a chase ; and I might be took while I was waiting , if you didn ' t show yourself smart with the door. ' Rob again assured the Captain that he would be prompt and wakeful ; and the Captain having made this prudent arrangement , went home to Mrs <NAME> ' s for the last time .
1	He had been crouching for a spring at the moment when his master caught him .
1	' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , suddenly appearing before him , ' where ' s my bedroom ? ' <NAME> stared at his master with the most emphatic surprise ; and it was not until the question had been repeated three several times , that he turned round , and led the way to the long-sought apartment .
1	Would you wish the gentleman to be shown in , ma ' am ? ' ' I don ' t know who it can be , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , wiping her mouth and arranging her mittens .
1	And if ever in my life I saw a love that nothing but death could change , I saw it then before me .
1	' It would have been much more satisfactory to those who wish to think well of their fellow creatures , and much more becoming in you , if you had shown some proper feeling , in time , for the little child that is now going to be prematurely deprived of its natural nourishment .
1	But <NAME> could not say where <NAME> was gone , except that it was in <NAME> , and no one could say , she remembered , unless it were Mr Toots .
1	There might have been much more envy in politer places .
1	If I were to plead anything in mitigation of the preposterous fancy that a bad design will sometimes claim to be a good and an expressly religious design , it would be the curious coincidence that it has been brought to its climax in these pages , in the days of the public examination of late Directors of a <NAME> .
1	Accordingly , with a clean white apron tied over her gown , and her curl-papers tucked up under a straw bonnet , -- both articles of dress being provided from the <NAME> 's inexhaustible stock , -- <NAME> prepared to issue forth on her errand .
1	For it seemed that <NAME> had a dreadful Uncle , who not only volunteered examinations of him , in the holidays , on abstruse points , but twisted innocent events and things , and wrenched them to the same fell purpose .
1	Again , only this morning at breakfast .
1	It had begun to grow dark , and I had shut the window ( I had been lying , for the most part , with my head upon the sill , by turns crying , dozing , and looking listlessly out ) , when the key was turned , and <NAME> came in with some bread and meat , and milk .
1	This old man wears a hat , a thumbed and napless and yet an obdurate hat , which has never adapted itself to the shape of his poor head .
1	" There can be no more favourable time than the present , <NAME> , " says <NAME> after they have broodingly made out the four sides of the square , " for a word or two between us upon a point on which we must , with very little delay , come to an understanding . "
1	On purpose to annoy me , for he knows how I doat upon them ! ' A grisly little fiction concerning her lovers is <NAME> ' s point .
1	" The <NAME> , called <NAME> , " said the first .
1	As , ' Supposing I was to be favoured with an order from Mr Boffin , my dear friend , it would be worth my while ' -- to do a certain thing that I hope might not prove wholly disagreeable to your feelings .
1	As he mounted , the call or song began to sound in his ears again , and , looking above , he saw the face of the little creature looking down out of a Glory of her long bright radiant hair , and musically repeating to him , like a vision : ' Come up and be dead !
1	A rickety table , with spare bundles of papers , yellow and ragged from long carriage in the pocket , ostentatiously displayed upon its top ; a couple of stools set face to face on opposite sides of this crazy piece of furniture ; a treacherous old chair by the fire-place , whose withered arms had hugged full many a client and helped to squeeze him dry ; a second-hand wig box , used as a depository for blank writs and declarations and other small forms of law , once the sole contents of the head which belonged to the wig which belonged to the box , as they were now of the box itself ; two or three common books of practice ; a jar of ink , a pounce box , a stunted hearth-broom , a carpet trodden to shreds but still clinging with the tightness of desperation to its tacks -- these , with the yellow wainscot of the walls , the smoke-discoloured ceiling , the dust and cobwebs , were among the most prominent decorations of the office of Mr <NAME> .
1	' Excuse me , ' said the gentleman hastily .
1	But he could as easily have changed a clear sky by looking at it in surprise , as affect her .
1	<NAME> <NAME> ! " ' The goblin grinned a broader grin than before , as he said , " Well , <NAME> , what do you say to this ? " ' The sexton gasped for breath .
1	I call Mr Nickleby to witness the course I intend to pursue with you. ' ' Pray don ' t call me to witness anything , ma ' am , ' said <NAME> .
1	' A lady ! ' says <NAME> , pluming his ruffled feathers .
1	<NAME> was the substance of <NAME> ' s discoveries concerning him , made that rainy Sunday afternoon and afterwards .
1	" Oh ! " she replied , glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us , " because I -- I am afraid he likes me. " " Did he ever tell you he liked you ? " I asked indignantly .
1	On my imparting this discovery in confidence to <NAME> , she informed me that her brother dealt in lobsters , crabs , and crawfish ; and I afterwards found that a heap of these creatures , in a state of wonderful conglomeration with one another , and never leaving off pinching whatever they laid hold of , were usually to be found in a little wooden outhouse where the pots and kettles were kept .
1	' I never thought you had told us anything but the truth , ' said <NAME> , soothing him .
1	By degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me , as to ask my advice in reference to his own affairs .
1	The client , with his dejection insensibly relieved and his vague hopes rekindled , takes pen and ink and writes the draft , not without perplexed consideration and calculation of the date it may bear , implying scant effects in the agent 's hands .
1	<NAME> , wines , all the accessories we wanted , and all of the best , were given out by our host from his dumb-waiter ; and when they had made the circuit of the table , he always put them back again .
1	In good time Mr <NAME> ' s mansion was gained again , and again there was a noise of tongues in the library .
1	" What are you going to do to me ? " " I 'm a going , " said he , bringing his fist down upon the table with a heavy blow , and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force , -- " I 'm a going to have your life ! " He leaned forward staring at me , slowly unclenched his hand and drew it across his mouth as if his mouth watered for me , and sat down again .
1	<NAME> has made the very houses prematurely old .
1	" He is not in the way to do so now , my dear , " replied my guardian .
1	Over all the legal neighbourhood there hangs , like some great veil of rust or gigantic cobweb , the idleness and pensiveness of the long vacation .
1	'He hung about , not to come over here afore dark , but he 'll be here soon , ' replied <NAME> .
1	There , snuff and cigars , and <NAME> pipes and flutes , and violins and violoncellos , divide the supremacy between them .
1	The first , are those more moderate and rational owners of human cattle , who have come into the possession of them as so many coins in their trading capital , but who admit the frightful nature of the Institution in the abstract , and perceive the dangers to society with which it is fraught : dangers which however distant they may be , or howsoever tardy in their coming on , are as certain to fall upon its guilty head , as is the Day of Judgment .
1	There was a great stage , too , looking very clean and smooth after the streets ; and there were people upon it , talking about something or other , but not at all intelligibly .
1	The bewildered butler gazed from them towards <NAME> , and from <NAME> towards <NAME> , with a most ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity .
1	' I don ' t wish to be complimented upon it , I thank you ; but I think I have an idea , ' <NAME> announced , after taking a jog-trot or two across the room , so unexpected and unaccountable that they all stared at him , doubtful whether he was choking or had the cramp— ' I _think_ I have an idea .
1	" <NAME> , " said I , " you place great confidence in me , but I fear you will not take advice from me ? "
1	Why do you take and choke a cove who has never done you any harm , neither of you ?
1	In the garden there was not a weed to be seen , and to judge from some dapper gardening-tools , a basket , and a pair of gloves which were lying in one of the walks , old Mr <NAME> had been at work in it that very morning .
1	If in violation of your mother ' s sentiments , you had condescended to allow yourself to be patronized by the <NAME> , and if you had come from those halls of slavery -- ' ' That ' s mere nonsense , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
1	' Not I , indeed , ' returned <NAME> .
1	' You ' re a dutiful and affectionate little boy , you are , ain ' t you , ' said <NAME> , ' to come a-bonnetin ' your father in his old age ? ' ' <NAME> should I know who you wos ? ' responded the son .
1	' No , <NAME> , ' cried <NAME> , interrupting him , and rubbing his hands in an ecstasy .
1	He would have clasped the little figure closer , but he saw that the eyes appealed to him not to be moved .
1	" Only I , " returns the trooper , " but as I know it , do me one more good turn and pull my hat over my eyes . "
1	Mr <NAME> ' s companion resumed the conversation .
1	' Sad experience , you know , brother-in-law. -- Kate , my dear , put that down in the next letter to <NAME> , or remind me to do it if I write. ' <NAME> paused for a few moments , and seeing that he had now made pretty sure of the mother , in case the daughter objected to his proposition , went on to say : ' The situation that I have made interest to procure , ma ' am , is with -- with a milliner and dressmaker , in short. ' ' A milliner ! ' cried Mrs. Nickleby .
1	That is not my name .
1	Still I was forced to wait for a start , and I wasn ' t so lucky as to get a start .
1	It was the night of a little party at the <NAME> ' s , which was given on the occasion of <NAME> ' s departure for <NAME> , whither he was going as a cadet , or something of that kind : <NAME> having at length arranged the business .
1	For yourselves you speak , and not for Alice , or for me. " ' The sisters , as with one accord , cried that their lot was cast together , and that there were dwellings for peace and virtue beyond the convent ' s walls .
1	The damsel held her peace , however , when an early messenger bore the request of <NAME> Koeldwethout next morning , and modestly retired to her chamber , from the casement of which she watched the coming of the suitor and his retinue .
1	Then , <NAME> sat up and took a long look at his figure , and then cried : ' Hi -- I -- i !
1	' Well , <NAME> , well ! ' said he , in an easy way though ill at ease with himself ' don ' t be unhappy , don ' t be reproachful. ' ' I can not help being unhappy , but I do not mean to be reproachful .
1	<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> walked at a good smart pace in front ; and <NAME> , whose legs were not so long as his master 's , ran by the side .
1	I believe you are right , ' said <NAME> , -- ' more than a mile off -- not far from the church -- lying partly on the roadside , and partly on the path , upon his face .
1	The wood is quite fresh where it gave way .
1	' Have you a good memory ? ' ' I don ' t know , ' said <NAME> , shaking his head sorrowfully .
1	As we were riding along this morning , I observed a little incident between two youthful pigs , which was so very human as to be inexpressibly comical and grotesque at the time , though I dare say , in telling , it is tame enough .
1	' Now , ' said <NAME> , ' for the little plan I have in my mind to bring this about ; because , I haven ' t offered myself even to the father yet , I should have told you .
1	'Well , then , ' rejoined <NAME> , ' I would n't .
1	<NAME> ' t stop to say one word to me , but go .
1	Completely worked round , haven ' t you ? ' ' Yes , deary , ' said <NAME> , laying aside her shawl .
1	' Containing a position which I deny , ' interrupted he of the dirty countenance .
1	' Come , come , <NAME> , ' urged <NAME> , at his side .
1	after it was given out so ' tickerlerly , that <NAME> wasn ' t to be made free with ! ' exclaimed <NAME> .
1	May be a humble one !
1	Here , after gradually failing in loftier hopes , he had " read " with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them , and had refurbished divers others for special occasions , and had turned his acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction , and on such means , added to some very moderate private resources , still maintained the house I saw .
1	" Why , indeed , sir , unless it is to cool her down ! "
1	I stole it in my heart when she first showed it me hanging round her neck ; and the child 's death , perhaps , is on me besides !
1	He can ' t go too soon .
1	It ' s no fault of mine .
1	Out of so large a number of females , many of whom were only then just verging upon womanhood , it may be reasonably supposed that some were delicate and fragile in appearance : no doubt there were .
1	Each was bowed down and broken .
1	Then a horse was found ; and she got another man to ride for life or death to the railroad , and send a message to <NAME> , which she wrote and gave him .
1	Her beautiful serene eyes met mine as she came towards me .
1	It was not until he had delighted in them for some time , that he wondered who had sent them ; and opened his door to ask the woman who must have put them there , how they had come into her hands .
1	' You deserve to have a house of your own ; don ' t you , poor pa ? ' ' I don ' t deserve it better than another , my dear. ' ' At any rate I , for one , want it more than another , ' said <NAME> , holding him by the chin , as she stuck his flaxen hair on end , ' and I grudge this money going to the Monster that swallows up so much , when we all want -- Everything .
1	He might not be so gently dealt with outside as he is there .
1	After a few moments ' silence , it had relaxed into its usual weak condition .
1	sounded all over the <NAME> .
1	' Is fork , sir , fork , ' replied Mr Swiveller slapping his pocket .
1	About something relating to <NAME> , he believed .
1	I have no more. ' ' May I hope to prove them all ? ' said Mr Dombey , with solemn gallantry , laying down a drawing he had held , and motioning towards the harp .
1	' Not for the world , ' rejoined <NAME> .
1	You might have knocked me down on the flat of my back , sir , with the feather of a pen , I assure you , when Mrs. <NAME> said so .
1	They ' re all done by one hand ; a little hand it is , not so old as yours , but a very clever one. ' As the schoolmaster said this , he saw that a small blot of ink had been thrown on one of the copies , so he took a penknife from his pocket , and going up to the wall , carefully scraped it out .
1	But <NAME> has spared you this , R.W. , whatever it may have thought proper to inflict upon her ! ' Here Mrs <NAME> burst into tears .
1	' However , ' said Mrs. Nickleby , drying her tears , ' this has nothing to do -- certainly nothing whatever to do -- with the gentleman in the next house. ' ' I should suppose that the gentleman in the next house has as little to do with us , ' returned <NAME> .
1	He would have raised his hands and besought her for pardon , but she caught them in her own , and put them down , hurriedly .
1	All further inquiries were superseded by the appearance of old <NAME> , who , running upstairs and just recognising <NAME> , passed at once into <NAME> ' s room .
1	It ' s a name , <NAME> , ' said the Major firmly , as if he defied Mr Dombey to contradict him , and would feel it his painful duty to bully him if he did , ' that is known and honoured in the <NAME> possessions abroad .
1	I shall never be an old man ; and if your hand placed me in the grave , and I could think , before I died , that you would come and look upon it sometimes with one of your kind smiles , and in the summer weather , when everything was alive -- not dead like me -- I could go to that home almost without a tear. ' ' Why do you talk thus , poor boy , if your life is a happy one with me ? ' said <NAME> .
1	They were very glad to set the chair down , and give a good round loud double-knock at the street door .
1	For on his beginning to review , with the vivacity natural to himself and to his situation , the leading points in his own affairs , he soon discovered that the <NAME> had relapsed into his former profound state of mind ; and that while he eyed him steadfastly from beneath his bushy eyebrows , he evidently neither saw nor heard him , but remained immersed in cogitation .
1	Do you know they would be ruined to pay off my old scores ?
1	At that time , it seemed to him , he first finally resigned the dying hope that had flickered in nobody ' s heart so much to its pain and trouble ; and from that time he became in his own eyes , as to any similar hope or prospect , a very much older man who had done with that part of life .
1	' There ' s a vooden leg in number six ; there ' s a pair of <NAME> in thirteen ; there ' s two pair of halves in the commercial ; there ' s these here painted tops in the snuggery inside the bar ; and five more tops in the coffee-room. ' ' Nothing more ? ' said the little man .
1	And so shall somebody else too .
1	The elder <NAME> was in bed , I found , and <NAME> was milling his chocolate , which a melancholy little boy who was an apprentice -- it seemed such a curious thing to be apprenticed to the trade of dancing -- was waiting to carry upstairs .
1	I have thought sometimes ; ' Sissy very timid here ; ' that perhaps I tried to learn too much , and that if I had asked to be allowed to try a little less , I might have— ' ' No , <NAME> , no , ' said <NAME> , shaking his head in his profoundest and most eminently practical way .
1	I have told you already , so don ' t fly in the face of Providence by attempting to deny it ! ' ' Hush !
1	I mistrust that by his coming back of his own accord , and showing himself innocent before them all , some one would be confounded , who—to prevent that—has stopped him , and put him out of the way. ' ' That is a dreadful thought , ' said <NAME> , turning pale .
1	He is a cordial young fellow , and we will have him to meet the brother and sister at dinner .
1	' Ye -- yes , ' returned old <NAME> , rubbing his hands slowly , and considering the matter half aloud , as something pensive in the bright eyes looking at him arrested his attention .
1	I ' ll take the opportunity , if you please , of entering your name in our Callers ' <NAME> for the day. ' Young <NAME> made another great show of changing the volume , taking up a pen , sucking it , dipping it , and running over previous entries before he wrote .
1	<NAME> <NAME> makes a hurried remark to the effect that they may be doing the deceased a service , that he hopes so .
1	Whether or no , I wo n't be prayed agin , I tell you .
1	Even in my father 's time , we did a world of wrong , injuring every human creature who came between us and our pleasure , whatever it was .
1	' My name is <NAME> , ' said the gentleman .
1	' But , <NAME> bless me ! ' cried Mr Meagles , rubbing his hands with a relish , ' it was an uncommonly pleasant thing being in quarantine , wasn ' t it ?
1	But read the rest , Jo. " " The rest , eh , <NAME> ? " said <NAME> , looking at it with a slow , searching eye , " One , two , three .
1	The patriarchal Mr Casby then rose with the air of having done it himself , and blandly followed : leaving his daughter , as she followed in her turn , to remark to her former lover in a distracted whisper ( which she very much enjoyed ) , that they had drained the cup of life to the dregs ; and further to hint mysteriously that the late Mr F. was at the bottom of it .
1	As he led them into the drawing-room , the recollection of the scene which had taken place there seemed to occur to him , for he cast a curious look at <NAME> , who bestowed upon it no other acknowledgment than a careless smile .
1	" And you , being a good man , can pass it as such , and forgive and pity the dreamer , and be lenient and encouraging when he wakes ? "
1	I knew this to be a weakness which must be overcome , but I had always said to myself that I would begin afresh when I got to where I now was .
1	So the doctor , breathing low , and closely watching , asks himself .
1	' You have been used to eaves-dropping .
1	Let us see the state of the case .
1	But <NAME> held her sacred purpose , unsuspected and unaided : and studied only how to bring her father to the understanding that she loved him , and made no appeal against him in any wandering thought .
1	That <NAME> bottle was found by my noble benefactor and yours , after he entered on possession of the estate .
1	<NAME> saw surprise and curiosity in the faces flitting past her ; saw long shadows coming back upon the pavement ; and heard voices that were strange to her asking her where she went , and what the matter was ; and though these frightened her the more at first , and made her hurry on the faster , they did her the good service of recalling her in some degree to herself , and reminding her of the necessity of greater composure .
1	This awful demonstration was headed by that determined woman Mrs MacStinger , who , preserving a countenance of inexorable resolution , and wearing conspicuously attached to her obdurate bosom a stupendous watch and appendages , which the <NAME> recognised at a glance as the property of <NAME> , conducted under her arm no other than that sagacious mariner ; he , with the distraught and melancholy visage of a captive borne into a foreign land , meekly resigning himself to her will .
1	" But for <NAME> 's modesty , " said <NAME> , " I would take leave to correct him and say three distinguished men . "
1	She has an extensive acquaintance at <NAME> among appalling old gentlemen with thin legs and nankeen trousers , and is of high standing in that dreary city .
1	You have a noble nature , and <NAME> 's love may make you worthier every day . "
1	' You are fevered and ill. ' <NAME> waved his hand carelessly , and concealing the indisposition he really felt , now that the excitement which had sustained him was over , took a hurried farewell of <NAME> , and left him .
1	inquired <NAME> : anxious to encourage any symptoms of good-humour in the unwelcome visitors .
1	' Two witnesses to it ; <NAME> knows the nature of an oath , he does ; we shall have you there , sir .
1	Give us ' old. ' A shilling passes ; and , in that spirit of confidence which should pervade all business transactions between principals of honour , this piece of business is considered done .
1	This devil whom you make an angel of .
1	Mouldering away before our eyes .
1	But then quickly added , reading <NAME> ' s face : ' No .
1	They followed the girl up some steep corner-stairs without meeting any one , and stopped in the dark while she went on for a candle .
1	I was young , I was accomplished , I was good-looking , I was independent -- by God I was , child ! -- and people sought me out , and envied me .
1	<NAME> , being present , then named , in furtherance of a suggestion she had previously offered to the <NAME> , <NAME> .
1	Some say she really is , or was , a party to a suit , but no one knows for certain because no one cares .
1	' Have a chop ! ' ' Not for the world , my good sir ! ' cried <NAME> , stopping him on his way to the bell ; ' appetite and myself , <NAME> , have long been strangers. ' <NAME> was so well pleased with his new name , and appeared to think it so obliging in <NAME> to confer it upon him , that he shook hands with him again , and laughed rather childishly .
1	' Will you have some of this ? ' said the fat boy , plunging into the pie up to the very ferules of the knife and fork .
1	Who was it whose least word did what his utmost means could not ?
1	<NAME> <NAME> glanced with a troubled eye at us and grudgingly nodded assent .
1	' This happy idea , brave sir , ' <NAME> resumed after drinking , ' was a happy idea for several reasons .
1	A doleful place to be born and bred in , <NAME> ? ' ' Yes indeed , sir ! ' ' If she had constantly thought of herself , and settled with herself that everybody visited this place upon her , turned it against her , and cast it at her , she would have led an irritable and probably an useless existence .
1	I may find a use for it one day .
1	At that point , my convict became so frantically exasperated , that he would have rushed upon him but for the interposition of the soldiers .
1	" Repression is the only lasting philosophy .
1	We do not appear to understand each other yet .
1	To be sure , it was a deserted place , down to the pigeon-house in the brewery-yard , which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high wind , and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea , if there had been any pigeons there to be rocked by it .
1	I have a settled purpose. ' ' And a good one , I hope , ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> looked at it -- it was the picture that resembled <NAME> -- as if it were a living thing ; and with a wicked , silent laugh upon his face , that seemed in part addressed to it , though it was all derisive of the great man standing so unconscious beside him .
1	These are the corporate beggars .
1	Having achieved this feat , he sighed again , and applied himself assiduously to the pie .
1	I see , ' said the stranger , half aside , ' negus too strong here -- liberal landlord -- very foolish -- very -- lemonade much better -- hot rooms -- elderly gentlemen -- suffer for it in the morning -- cruel -- cruel ; ' and he moved on a step or two .
1	It 's as good as another . "
1	There 's more where that come from .
1	The discussions ended in our hiring for him , by the month , a neat little furnished lodging in a quiet old house near <NAME> .
1	The child sat watching and thinking of these things , until the phantom in her mind so increased in gloom and terror , that she felt it would be a relief to hear the old man ' s voice , or , if he were asleep , even to see him , and banish some of the fears that clustered round his image .
1	" I certainly sha n't hold my hand , when I can get anything in it by reaching it out , for the sake of such a man as He was , I promise you , <NAME> , " returned the woman coolly .
1	' <NAME> , my dear boy , ' said Mr Meagles , on the evening of the following day , ' Mother and I have been talking this over , and we don ' t feel comfortable in remaining as we are .
1	How long was I to bear this ?
1	I have supposed the head to be all-sufficient .
1	'At your service , ma'am , ' said <NAME> , who had been stopping outside to rub his shoes clean , and to shake the snow off his coat ; and who now made his appearance , bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a bundle in the other .
1	'Well , ' said the undertaker 's wife , when <NAME> had finished his supper : which she had regarded in silent horror , and with fearful auguries of his future appetite : 'have you done ? '
1	I don ' t think he can be worse. ' The child asked his leave to prepare breakfast , and her grandfather coming down stairs , they all three partook of it together .
1	The stranger walked boldly up to , and returned with , the master of the ceremonies ; a little introductory pantomime ; and the stranger and Mrs. <NAME> took their places in a quadrille .
1	Do that again , boys. ' The two combatants went to work afresh , and chopped away until the swords emitted a shower of sparks : to the great satisfaction of Mr Crummles , who appeared to consider this a very great point indeed .
1	There is no such place in that part now ; but it remained there for many years , looking with a baulked countenance at the wilderness patched with unfruitful gardens and pimpled with eruptive summerhouses , that it had meant to run over in no time .
1	She listened with great attention , and with a face that often changed , but had the same purpose in all its varying expressions .
1	Let it deceive them , then , a little longer ; it can not deceive them too much. " Madame <NAME> looked superciliously at the client , and nodded in confirmation .
1	<NAME> <NAME> relieved his father with dutiful interest , and reported No job in his absence .
1	If you ' ll give me a look-in in the forenoon , you shall know what I have heerd ; but tell the young woman from <NAME> ' en <NAME> , that it ' s over .
1	<NAME> , ma ' am , work ; we must all work .
1	At the same time there came from a workshop across a little yard outside the window , a regular sound of hammering that kept a kind of tune : RAT -- tat-tat , <NAME> -- tat-tat , <NAME> -- tat-tat , without any variation .
1	A few dull courts and narrow ways brought us to the sky-lighted offices of <NAME> and <NAME> ; in the vestibule of which temple , accessible to pilgrims without the ceremony of knocking , three or four clerks were at work as copyists .
1	But he told me to-night that he wished to do so in the morning. ' ' Ah !
1	The lady was not young and fresh from the hand of <NAME> , but was young and fresh from the hand of her maid .
1	Polly then put out her light , locked the house-door , delivered the key at an agent ' s hard by , and went home as fast as she could go ; rejoicing in the shrill delight that her unexpected arrival would occasion there .
1	" I beg your pardon , miss ! "
1	Some of the drivers are blacks , some whites .
1	But what was really in his mind , was the weak figure with its strong purpose , the thin worn shoes , the insufficient dress , and the pretence of recreation and enjoyment .
1	' Well , <NAME> , how have you got on without me all day ?
1	His mind would run upon that spot .
1	' You dropped down upon me. ' ' I dropped down upon you , then , you ill-conditioned man , ' ( <NAME> chuckled at having forced her to adopt his phrase , ) ' for having been needlessly significant to <NAME> that morning .
1	' But I am acquainted with these chaps , ' said <NAME> .
1	I know she is here with me. ' ' Then , ma ' am , ' said Mr Meagles , ' allow me to make known to you that I shall be happy to have her back , and that my wife and daughter will be happy to have her back .
1	' Who ' s that ? ' cried a stout old man , who was putting on a nightcap as if he were going to bed in a vault .
1	" Yes , <NAME> , " said he with a gentle seriousness , " it is to be forgotten now , to be forgotten for a while .
1	His forehead was narrow , his face wide , his head large , and his nose all on one side , as if <NAME> , indignant with the propensities she observed in him in his birth , had given it an angry tweak which it had never recovered .
1	This paper I part with now .
1	But few people noticed her at those times , in the garb she wore : or if they did , believed that she was tutored to excite compassion , and passed on .
1	He recognized the friends the instant they reappeared , but their reappearance had no effect on his composure .
1	As the sisters reached the porch , he quickened his pace , and called upon them to stop .
1	He determined to see her , cost what it might ; but here an insurmountable objection presented itself , for whether the explanatory ' over that way , ' and ' down there , ' of <NAME> , meant three miles off , or thirty , or three hundred , he could in no wise guess .
1	It appeared incredible that the coat and waistcoat could be seen by mortal eyes without the <NAME> ; but he certainly was not in them , otherwise his legs -- the houses in <NAME> Place not being lofty -- would have obstructed the street door , which was perfectly clear .
1	A few strange faces in the streets ; a few other faces , half strange and half familiar , once the faces of <NAME> children , now the faces of men and women who come back from the outer world at long intervals to find the city wonderfully shrunken in size , as if it had not washed by any means well in the meanwhile .
1	It came upon me as the close of the benignant history I had been pursuing , and I felt that I had but one thing to do .
1	Will you take a drop o ' somethin ' this mornin ' , <NAME> ? ' <NAME> acquiesced in this agreeable proposal ; and having deposited his book in his coat pocket , accompanied <NAME> to the tap , where they were soon occupied in discussing an exhilarating compound , formed by mixing together , in a pewter vessel , certain quantities of <NAME> <NAME> and the fragrant essence of the clove .
1	' Well , well , ' said <NAME> , smiling as good men smile when they compassionate their own weakness or that of their fellow-creatures , ' this is wide of the bull ' s-eye .
1	His recent despondency , not to say despair , was gone in a moment .
1	But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he hoisted it up and made it fast ; smiling as he did so , with a relish and not merely mechanically .
1	' Take ' em away , take ' em away to the Fondling ! ' With these awful remarks , <NAME> sat himself down in a chair , and defied the nurse , who made the best of her way into the adjoining room , and returned with a stream of matrons : declaring that <NAME> had spoken blasphemy against his family , and must be raving mad .
1	' After a time , ' pursued the boy , trying to draw away her hand , ' the kind angels will be glad to think that you are not among them , and that you stayed here to be with us .
1	He held it up , and looked round , everywhere , expecting to see her crouching in some corner ; but the room was empty .
1	I don ' t know that , ' said <NAME> .
1	A rumour just lived in the village -- had a faint and bare existence there , as its people had -- that when the knife struck home , the faces changed , from faces of pride to faces of anger and pain ; also , that when that dangling figure was hauled up forty feet above the fountain , they changed again , and bore a cruel look of being avenged , which they would henceforth bear for ever .
1	It was a very genteel entertainment , very handsomely served .
1	In such a very hard manner and with eyes so particularly green that <NAME> 's natural gravity is much deepened by the contemplation of that venerable man .
1	We had half-an-hour ' s talk , all together ; and I asked her about the twins , who , she said , were ' grown great creatures ' ; and after <NAME> and <NAME> , whom she described as ' absolute giants ' , but they were not produced on that occasion .
1	She specially applied here at the house to be admitted , as not regularly belonging to our town , and—yes , you are right , <NAME> , you are right. ' ' Now , stop a bit ! ' cried <NAME> , once more .
1	But she hardly ever spoke -- I question if she ever did -- without making some mention of him .
1	When this was at last done , and addressing <NAME> as " General , " she gave him her arm , to the great entertainment of some idlers who were looking on , he was so discomposed and begged me so respectfully " not to desert him " that I could not make up my mind to do it , especially as <NAME> was always tractable with me and as she too said , " <NAME> , my dear , you will accompany us , of course . "
1	You know this lady ( for she _is_ a lady ) , Mrs. Sparsit ? ' ' I have already had the honour— ' ' Very well .
1	I acted on Mrs. Crupp ' s opinion , and gave the order at the pastry-cook ' s myself .
1	She ' s deep , <NAME> , deep , but <NAME> is deeper .
1	I made a mistake ; we are all liable to mistakes ; I wo n't do so any more , and I 'll become such a lawyer as is not often seen .
1	For example : you couldn ' t for your life be a gentleman ; I couldn ' t for my life be otherwise .
1	What can you two be together ?
1	The astonished and dismayed Rob staring after them , saw that they stopped , and fell to earnest conversation very soon ; and more than once observed a darkly threatening action of the younger woman ' s hand ( obviously having reference to someone of whom they spoke ) , and a crooning feeble imitation of it on the part of Mrs <NAME> , that made him earnestly hope he might not be the subject of their discourse .
1	' The question , ' returned <NAME> , with a sort of joyful affability , ' why I didn ' t mention sooner , that I had found something .
1	Upon which law-writer there was an inquest , and which law-writer was an anonymous character , his name being unknown .
1	I was very much afraid of him again , now that he had worked himself into this fierce hurry , and I was likewise very much afraid of keeping away from home any longer .
1	He , self-important , unbending , formal , austere .
1	Is it unusual , unsophisticated , primitive ? ' ' It ' s delightful indeed , sir , ' replied the lawyer .
1	And I intend always doing it. ' ' You are a long-headed fellow , Fledgeby. ' ' May be , or may not be .
1	' It is entirely a private and personal matter , that has brought me here , <NAME> , ' continued <NAME> , faltering , ' and <NAME> -- ' ' Here ! ' interposed the <NAME> , as an assurance that he was at hand , and might be relied upon .
1	And if we were all Englishmen present , I would say , ' added Mr Podsnap , looking round upon his compatriots , and sounding solemnly with his theme , ' that there is in the Englishman a combination of qualities , a modesty , an independence , a responsibility , a repose , combined with an absence of everything calculated to call a blush into the cheek of a young person , which one would seek in vain among the <NAME> of the Earth. ' Having delivered this little summary , Mr Podsnap ' s face flushed , as he thought of the remote possibility of its being at all qualified by any prejudiced citizen of any other country ; and , with his favourite right-arm flourish , he put the rest of <NAME> and the whole of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> nowhere .
1	The old man , sometimes by his side and sometimes with the child , lent his aid to both , went here and there on little patient services , and was happy .
1	She ' s far away , she ' s far away !
1	Proud I am sure to have the honour !
1	' <NAME> fellow. ' ' Oh , it ' s worse than foolish ; it ' s downright sneaking , you know , ' replied <NAME> , nibbing the pen with a contemptuous face .
1	Here ' s a young lady as wants to take that opinion , in regard of my friend <NAME> ' r ; likewise my t ' other friend , <NAME> , which is a character for you to come within hail of , being a man of science , which is the mother of invention , and knows no law .
1	<NAME> , who had been giving me my first lesson in all-fours , was trying to recollect a scheme of telling fortunes with the dirty cards , and was printing off fishy impressions of his thumb on all the cards he turned .
1	' Tis for that. ' ' Well , well , ' said he .
1	Is there none in this room ?
1	He says , no varnish can hide the grain of the wood ; and that the more varnish you put on , the more the grain will express itself .
1	" <NAME> , " said he , " we wo n't talk about 'poor dreams ; ' you know more about such things than I , having much fresher experience of that kind .
1	He was contented , you will say .
1	So far all goes well with us -- much , much better than it has of late gone with many poor souls .
1	'Not a bit of it , ' replied <NAME> .
1	If he had given any utterance to his , and they were prophetic , they would have been these : " I see <NAME> , and <NAME> , <NAME> , The <NAME> , the <NAME> , the Judge , long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of the old , perishing by this retributive instrument , before it shall cease out of its present use .
1	' Finish by telling me how your father left you , <NAME> .
1	And yet , I was perverse enough to feel a chill and disappointment in receiving no welcome , and rattling , alone and silent , through the misty streets .
1	When I had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but a fallen-down grape-vine and some bottles , I found myself in the dismal corner upon which I had looked out of the window .
1	'No , ' said <NAME> ; 'to hear you repeat it , if you will -- finally repeat it !
1	Perhaps her mind had not got quite so far as the ceremony yet , but was lagging on the way there .
1	You are hasty in thinking that I mean to check you .
1	It became a part of my life , and as inseparable from my life as my own head .
1	' How could I help myself ?
1	' I think I am , Trot. ' She looked so steadfastly at me : with a kind of doubt , or pity , or suspense in her affection : that I summoned the stronger determination to show her a perfectly cheerful face .
1	per cent. -- for every sovereign told another -- there would not be one piece of money in all the heap which wouldn ' t represent ten thousand mean and paltry lies , told , not by the money-lender , oh no !
1	You ' re in a fright , and don ' t know what you say or mean .
1	But he is master of his own actions ; and upon that point ( which is not at all material ) I can ' t speak positively. ' The difference between papa ' s being master of his own actions and Mr <NAME> ' s being nothing of the sort , was forcibly expressed by <NAME> in her manner of stating the case .
1	Throws some Light upon <NAME> ' s <NAME> ; but whether for <NAME> or Evil the <NAME> must determine After an anxious consideration of the painful and embarrassing position in which he was placed , <NAME> decided that he ought to lose no time in frankly stating it to the kind brothers .
1	' I am very little hurt , I assure you. ' ' Then you are not dead ! ' ejaculated the hysterical lady .
1	Three o ' clock , and half-past three , and they had passed over <NAME> .
1	The city is rich in public institutions and in <NAME> churches and charities , but it is mainly in the prospect from the site of the <NAME> Government <NAME> , and from the <NAME> , that its surpassing beauty lies .
1	To <NAME> ' s , <NAME> now betook himself according to appointment ; and to <NAME> he related how , last night , some young blustering blade , whom he had never seen , forced his way into his house , and tried to frighten him from the proposed nuptials .
1	' There ' s inconveniency in it , but the novelty gives it a sort of relish , too ! ' <NAME> !
1	" And she is of so aristocratic a disposition -- " " Yes , ma'am , " I said again , with the same object as before .
1	It is extraordinary how long a man may look among the crowd without discovering the face of a friend , but it is no less true .
1	I ain ' t a goin ' to be drownded and not paid for it ! ' <NAME> looked at him , as though he were claiming to be a Ghost .
1	<NAME> stood at <NAME> ' s elbow .
1	said the nurse , picking up the cork of the green bottle , which had fallen out on the pillow , as she stooped to take up the child .
1	' You have heard <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , turning to me .
1	Lastly , the fastidious lady , finding there was a solitary gentleman inside , had a small lamp lighted which she carried in reticule , and being after much trouble shut in , the horses were put into a brisk canter and the coach was once more in rapid motion .
1	' After all , you haven ' t said what you mean to do yourself , <NAME> .
1	Some of the neighbours threw up their windows , and called across the street to each other that old <NAME> ' s housekeeper must have dropped down dead .
1	" <NAME> is very attractive to you , seeing how indifferently you have prospered there , " he observed then , turning his calm face to his nephew with a smile .
1	" Of course you may , cousin <NAME> . "
1	Occasionally , when we stop to change , some two or three half-drunken loafers will come loitering out with their hands in their pockets , or will be seen kicking their heels in rocking-chairs , or lounging on the window-sill , or sitting on a rail within the colonnade : they have not often anything to say though , either to us or to each other , but sit there idly staring at the coach and horses .
1	It did not pass away , as weightier things had done ; but came uppermost again , and yet again , and many times that day , and often afterwards .
1	' Asides which , ' adds the boy , ' there ain ' t no family of Winkses. ' ' I think there must be. ' ' Yer lie , there ain ' t .
1	He slowly shook the shadow off , and turned to her .
1	A hard one to me , but it is a necessary one .
1	The punch was ready-made in a red pan in the bedroom ; a little table , covered with a green baize cloth , had been borrowed from the parlour , to play at cards on ; and the glasses of the establishment , together with those which had been borrowed for the occasion from the public-house , were all drawn up in a tray , which was deposited on the landing outside the door .
1	Without further preface he conducted them into his little school-room , which was parlour and kitchen likewise , and told them that they were welcome to remain under his roof till morning .
1	Mr Carker then handed him out of the room ; and <NAME> , keeping his round eyes fixed upon his patron to the last , vanished for the time being .
1	This was one of the consequences of getting into good society .
1	<NAME> is , that being thoroughly waked , they get up wery quietly , and walk away ! ' ' Beg your pardon , sir , ' said <NAME> , suddenly breaking off in his loquacious discourse .
1	I had cut the connexion .
1	Go back again. ' ' No mistake , ' returned <NAME> .
1	As there is no doubt they were .
1	Your necessities are greater than mine . "
1	The blood has not flushed into his face so suddenly and redly for many a long year as when he recognizes <NAME> .
1	There was none of the noise and clamour of a schoolroom ; none of its boisterous play , or hearty mirth .
1	' I fear , ' said <NAME> , hesitating , ' that mama -- my mother , I mean -- is waiting for me. ' ' You needn ' t make the least apology , my dear , ' said <NAME> , smiling sweetly as she spoke ; ' I dare say she is a very respectable old person , and I shall be quite -- hem -- quite pleased to know her. ' As poor Mrs. <NAME> was cooling -- not her heels alone , but her limbs generally at the street corner , <NAME> had no alternative but to make her known to <NAME> , who , doing the last new carriage customer at second-hand , acknowledged the introduction with condescending politeness .
1	" Well , " returns his wife , considering , " <NAME> seems to me to be getting not a little impatient and restless .
1	This was a very wise resolution , but he was prevented from putting it in practice by a new source of anxiety and uneasiness .
1	A very well conducted family indeed , the Chiveries .
1	Nothing else that he knows on .
1	What did I tell you when we came away from <NAME> that time ?
1	If he won ' t listen to reason , we must do it against his will , and show him that we are determined to exert our authority .
1	What do you suppose ruined me , now ? ' ' Wy , ' said <NAME> , trimming the rush-light , ' I s ' pose the beginnin ' wos , that you got into debt , eh ? ' ' <NAME> owed a farden , ' said the cobbler ; ' try again. ' ' Well , perhaps , ' said <NAME> , ' you bought houses , wich is delicate English for goin ' mad ; or took to buildin ' , wich is a medical term for bein ' incurable. ' The cobbler shook his head and said , ' Try again. ' ' You didn ' t go to law , I hope ? ' said <NAME> suspiciously .
1	I claimed a share in the profits of some business I brought to you , and , as I persisted , you arrested me for an old advance of ten pounds , odd shillings , including interest at fifty per cent , or so. ' ' I remember something of it , ' replied <NAME> , carelessly .
1	Resigning himself to which condition with a perfectly satisfied manner , <NAME> begs the favour of another cup of coffee .
1	I never speak to him at such an hour .
1	' I am particular in describing how my uncle walked up the middle of the street , with his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets , gentlemen , because , as he often used to say ( and with great reason too ) there is nothing at all extraordinary in this story , unless you distinctly understand at the beginning , that he was not by any means of a marvellous or romantic turn .
1	I always say the same of you. ' ' That ' s " Curse <NAME> with all my heart ! " then , if you do , ' thought <NAME> , as <NAME> hurried out .
1	But I shall get on best at <NAME> , where there 's more room for a weed than there is here ; and the dear old lady will be made happy besides .
1	<NAME> and I know our duty to each other better , I pray Heaven ! ' ' Oh ! ' said <NAME> , nodding her head thoughtfully .
1	I 'm always writing for Ma .
1	He seized it with the same rapid impatience which had characterised his speech , and hastily made his way to the other side of the screen .
1	' It is my fate , ' said <NAME> , unfeignedly sobbing , but doing even that , with a shadow of the old expression of doing something genteel ; ' it is my fate , gentlemen , that the finer feelings of our nature have become reproaches to me .
1	' I did this for years ; long , long years they were .
1	It seemed as if there were moments when he could by no means have sworn but that the old man was an ancient retainer of his , who had been meritoriously faithful .
1	She is in her pride tonight. ' And as she spoke , she struck her hand upon her beautiful bosom , as though she would have beaten down herself .
1	' You claim to have one plain motive in all you do yourself .
1	Was it on a Monday morning , when the butcher-boy had been to our house for orders , and bought a ballad of me , which , being unacquainted with the tune , I run it over to him ? ' ' <NAME> , <NAME> , right !
1	' Who could have told you that I took another service at <NAME> , and that they afterwards moved all the way here ?
1	So that whether twenty <NAME> made a <NAME> , or hic haec hoc was troy weight , or a verb always agreed with an ancient <NAME> , or three times four was <NAME> a bull , were open questions with him .
1	You do not know of what service it might be .
1	" It 's no fault of yours , sir ; but you shall judge .
1	There ' s the <NAME> promoted to that living at four hundred and fifty pounds a year ; there are our two boys receiving the very best education , and distinguishing themselves as steady scholars and good fellows ; there are three of the girls married very comfortably ; there are three more living with us ; there are three more keeping house for the <NAME> since Mrs. <NAME> ' s decease ; and all of them happy. ' ' Except -- ' I suggest .
1	" -- Even in them I am shocked , for the credit of <NAME> , to be constrained to inform you that the party has not triumphed without being put to an enormous expense .
1	I have been called picturesque myself .
1	It is the light of <NAME> . "
1	There ' s only one avenue to the <NAME> left often now , and I shall have to stop up that to-night with a pair of gloves .
1	What is it ? " " News from the other world ! " " How , then ? " cried madame , contemptuously .
1	Such a confusion of tongues , before the circumstances were related , and the proofs disclosed !
1	' Fine mornin ' , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , senior .
1	Shake hands with it on .
1	They always went on agen me about the Devil .
1	" I must beg you , my Lady , " he says while doing so , " to remain a few moments , for this individual of whom I speak arrived this evening shortly before dinner and requested in a very becoming note " -- <NAME> , with his habitual regard to truth , dwells upon it -- " I am bound to say , in a very becoming and well-expressed note , the favour of a short interview with yourself and MYself on the subject of this young girl .
1	What shall we do ? ' ' Have you no scheme on foot that will bring in anything ? ' Mr <NAME> plunged into his whiskers for reflection , and came out hopeless : ' No ; as adventurers we are obliged to play rash games for chances of high winnings , and there has been a run of luck against us. ' She was resuming , ' Have you nothing -- ' when he stopped her .
1	I was in this family before you were born .
1	' Oh dear , Mrs. <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' while <NAME> is making that punch to drink happy returns in , do let <NAME> go through that figure dance before <NAME> Lillyvick. ' ' No , no , my dear , ' replied Mrs. <NAME> , ' it will only worry my uncle. ' ' It can ' t worry him , I am sure , ' said <NAME> .
1	Is not this a pretty fellow to talk as big as you have heard him now ? ' ' And as I heard him last night , ' said <NAME> ; ' as I heard him last night when he sneaked into my house , and -- he !
1	' This is more than _I_ knew of him , ' she said , giving it back .
1	Some remembrance of old Valentines , wherein a cherub , less appropriately attired for a proverbially uncertain climate , had been seen conducting lovers to the altar , might have been fancied to inflame the ardour of his timber toes .
1	' It ' s quite an accident. ' ' So much the better , <NAME> ; these accidental parties are always the pleasantest , ' said the dwarf , rubbing his hands so hard that he seemed to be engaged in manufacturing , of the dirt with which they were encrusted , little charges for popguns .
1	We will not wake her. ' ' Let us not talk of her in her sleep , but as she used to be when you were journeying together , far away -- as she was at home , in the old house from which you fled together -- as she was , in the old cheerful time , ' said the schoolmaster .
1	I disgrace nobody and cumber nobody ; that 's something .
1	At length , when the lark came headlong down , with an accumulating stream of song , and dropped among the green wheat near him , rippling in the breath of the morning like a river , he sprang up from his reverie , and looked round with a sudden smile , as courteous and as soft as if he had had numerous observers to propitiate ; nor did he relapse , after being thus awakened ; but clearing his face , like one who bethought himself that it might otherwise wrinkle and tell tales , went smiling on , as if for practice .
1	You are high spirited by right and by nature , my Blandois ! ' To such soothing murmurs did this gentleman smoke out his cigar and drink out his bottle of wine .
1	' I would not have had them here , for the world . '
1	' <NAME> , you are inconsiderate : you expect too much of your sister .
1	Is it possible , I wonder , that there was any analogy between the case of the <NAME> population and the case of the little Gradgrinds ?
1	My <NAME> says she has been " bored to death . "
1	Thirdly , that this deed had been , with others , stolen from one who had himself obtained or concealed it fraudulently , and who feared to take any steps for its recovery ; and that he ( <NAME> ) knew the thief .
1	They set off Florence very much , to his fancy ; but not himself .
1	I have been throwed , all sorts of styles , all my life ! "
1	Thus , in the midst of the mud and at the heart of the fog , sits the <NAME> Chancellor in his <NAME> of Chancery .
1	' I asked one of your references , and he said you were pious. ' ' Well , sir , I hope I am a little in that line , ' replied <NAME> .
1	In a happy compromise between her two states of existence , she had already become , with her workbasket before her , the equably vivacious companion with a slight judicious flavouring of information , when the <NAME> announced herself .
1	<NAME> <NAME> 's great-aunt conquered a confirmed habit of living into which she had fallen , and <NAME> became a part of our establishment .
1	He had secretly interposed against this confiding young man , for no better real reason than because the young man ' s ways were not his ways .
1	" Yes , " repeated the stranger , looking round at the rest of the company with his right hand extended towards the witness , <NAME> .
1	Yes , yes , yes. ' ' Your position , my dear <NAME> , is now a fine one .
1	In one of its chambers , so repulsive a place that even the obtrusive stare blinked at it , and left it to such refuse of reflected light as it could find for itself , were two men .
1	And now , the grand chain riveted to the last link , the discreet automaton ceased , and the sixteen , two and two , took a walk among the furniture .
1	<NAME> cake , covered with <NAME> , silver , and true-lovers ' knots .
1	I was nearly going away without the pie , but I was tempted to mount upon a shelf , to look what it was that was put away so carefully in a covered earthenware dish in a corner , and I found it was the pie , and I took it in the hope that it was not intended for early use , and would not be missed for some time .
1	It would seem as if there never was a book written , or a story told , expressly with the object of keeping boys on shore , which did not lure and charm them to the ocean , as a matter of course .
1	" I turned her gently over , placed my hands upon her breast to calm her and keep her down , and looked into her face .
1	We are always appearing , and disappearing , and swearing , and interrogating , and filing , and cross-filing , and arguing , and sealing , and motioning , and referring , and reporting , and revolving about the <NAME> and all his satellites , and equitably waltzing ourselves off to dusty death , about costs .
1	He had reached the old house at last -- how hot the room was .
1	' Demnition pleasant , and a tip-top sawyer. ' ' And what said he ? ' asked <NAME> , knitting his brows .
1	Indeed there is nothing in the world I would n't do to show how much . "
1	They are not at home .
1	Her thought at such times may be condensed into the two words that oftenest did duty together in all her conversations : ' My Sept ! ' They were a good pair to sit breakfasting together in <NAME> Canon Corner , <NAME> .
1	O Tom , tell me the truth ! ' ' I don ' t know what you mean , <NAME> ! ' ' As you lie here alone , my dear , in the melancholy night , so you must lie somewhere one night , when even I , if I am living then , shall have left you .
1	<NAME> enthroned herself upon a couch by the fire ; and Mr Carker , with his hat in his hand and his eyes bent upon the carpet , stood before her , at some little distance .
1	From what we have said of this young gentleman , and the natural admiration the reader will immediately conceive of his character , it may perhaps be inferred that he is to be the hero of the work which we shall presently begin .
1	I know not where to go .
1	<NAME> , sure of foot and strong of will , had so pressed onward , that the year enjoined by the old Instrument-maker , as the term during which his friend should refrain from opening the sealed packet accompanying the letter he had left for him , was now nearly expired , and <NAME> began to look at it , of an evening , with feelings of mystery and uneasiness .
1	In the girls ' school , reading was proposed ; and as I felt tolerably equal to that art , I expressed my willingness to hear a class .
1	It was plain enough , nevertheless , as <NAME> had said ; over a lime-splashed gateway in the corner , within which <NAME> kept a ladder and a barrel or two .
1	He had come into the office of the station , from its interior , in an unsettled way , immediately after <NAME> had gone out to the train ; and he had been hurriedly reading the printed bills and notices on the wall .
1	Why have I never heard until the day before yesterday of your suffering yourself to be cooped up in jail ?
1	You hag , you cat , you dog , you brimstone barker ! "
1	' Only a gentleman and his wife , Miss. ' ' And who are they ?
1	Calls a house a rookery when there ' s not a rook near it , and takes the birds on trust , because he sees the nests ! ' ' Mr .
1	" <NAME> , " said <NAME> then , raising her blue eyes tenderly to his face , " after what our cousin <NAME> has said , I think no choice is left us .
1	' You are the <NAME> who married the widow of my late nephew , <NAME> , of <NAME> ! -- Though why <NAME> , I don ' t know ! ' ' I am , ' said <NAME> .
1	But I have an interest in the little creature , and a respect for her that I can not express to you .
1	' Yes , <NAME> , since you put it in that shape , I have got another berth , ' cried <NAME> , backing more and more ; ' a better berth than I ' ve got here , and one where I don ' t so much as want your good word , <NAME> , which is fort ' nate for me , after all the dirt you ' ve throw ' d at me , because I ' m poor , and can ' t afford to stand in my own light for your good .
1	' I assure you , my dear , ' said Mr Boffin , ' that on the celebrated day when I made what has since been agreed upon to be my grandest demonstration -- I allude to <NAME> says the cat , <NAME> quack says the duck , and Bow-wow-wow says the dog -- I assure you , my dear , that on that celebrated day , them flinty and unbelieving words hit my old lady so hard on my account , that I had to hold her , to prevent her running out after you , and defending me by saying I was playing a part. ' Mrs <NAME> laughed heartily again , and her eyes glistened again , and it then appeared , not only that in that burst of sarcastic eloquence Mr <NAME> was considered by his two fellow-conspirators to have outdone himself , but that in his own opinion it was a remarkable achievement .
1	My guardian did not seek to dissuade me , and I went .
1	For , believe me , I speak the truth ; the most abject poverty , the most wretched condition of human life , with a pure and upright mind , would be happiness to that which you must undergo as the wife of such a man as this ! ' <NAME> before <NAME> ceased to speak , the young lady buried her face in her hands , and gave her tears free way .
1	asked <NAME> , in a low voice , of <NAME> .
1	' There is no date to that , is there ? ' inquired a juror .
1	<NAME> , sir , I am sure , ' said <NAME> , beginning to regard himself in quite a new light .
1	' <NAME> ' s hollow down by the flare is not there now .
1	I never have any money .
1	' You might have knowed that the gentleman wanted the door shut , without being told , I think. ' Mr Short obeyed , observing under his breath that his friend seemed unusually ' cranky , ' and expressing a hope that there was no dairy in the neighbourhood , or his temper would certainly spoil its contents .
1	It is laborious , is it not ? ' ' The labour is so pleasant , ' she returned , ' that it is scarcely grateful in me to call it by that name. ' ' Nothing good is difficult to you , ' said I .
1	The supper was ready laid , the chairs were drawn round the table , bottles , jugs , and glasses were arranged upon the sideboard , and everything betokened the approach of the most convivial period in the whole four-and-twenty hours .
1	' The veil that has long been interposed between Mrs. Micawber and myself , is now withdrawn , ' said <NAME> ; ' and my children and the <NAME> of their Being can once more come in contact on equal terms. ' As we were all very grateful to him , and all desirous to show that we were , as well as the hurry and disorder of our spirits would permit , I dare say we should all have gone , but that it was necessary for <NAME> to return to her father , as yet unable to bear more than the dawn of hope ; and for someone else to hold <NAME> in safe keeping .
1	After very anxious scrutiny , he came out of his retreat , and went briskly down the street as if he were going away altogether ; then , suddenly turned about , and went , at the same pace , and with the same feint , up the street .
1	Perhaps we may resume this -- ha -- interesting conversation , ' said Mr Dorrit , ' at another time ; unless it should be , what I hope it is not -- hum -- in any way disagreeable to -- ah -- Mrs General. ' ' Mr Dorrit , ' said <NAME> , casting down her eyes as she rose with a bend , ' must ever claim my homage and obedience. ' Mrs General then took herself off in a stately way , and not with that amount of trepidation upon her which might have been expected in a less remarkable woman .
1	He carried the child over , and before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss .
1	But I want some reading -- some fine bold reading , some splendid book in a gorging Lord-Mayor ' s-Show of wollumes ' ( probably meaning gorgeous , but misled by association of ideas ) ; ' as ' ll reach right down your pint of view , and take time to go by you .
1	They were making late hay , somewhere out of town ; and though the fragrance had a long way to come , and many counter fragrances to contend with among the dwellings of the poor ( may God reward the worthy gentlemen who stickle for the <NAME> as part and parcel of the wisdom of our ancestors , and who do their little best to keep those dwellings miserable !
1	'And so be able to retire on your property , and do the gen-teel : as I mean to , in the very next leap-year but four that ever comes , and the forty-second Tuesday in Trinity-week , ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> <NAME> comes all this way to beg for money , and you , who are so grand and great , having got it , are going to let him have it , as a great favour and obligation. ' <NAME> turned up the old face for a moment , in which there was a sharp understanding of the reference conveyed in these words : but it was a young and childish face immediately afterwards , when he slipped down from his father ' s knee , and ran to tell Florence not to cry any more , for he was going to let young Gay have the money .
1	One evening , a holiday night with them , <NAME> and her grandfather went out to walk .
1	<NAME> flew swiftly by , and summer came .
1	Failing those desired results , it was to remain in my possession. ' Some trouble was in the young man ' s face , and some indecision was in the action of his hand , as <NAME> , looking steadfastly at him , gave him the ring .
1	Now you 're a-going to poll-pry and question according to custom -- I know what you 're a-going to be up to .
1	But the vapor of a limekiln would come between me and them , disordering them all , and it was through the vapor at last that I saw two men looking at me .
1	' <NAME> ' s , up <NAME> way ? ' Mr Wegg admits that he is bound for that port .
1	no mistake about that , ' said a very red-faced man , behind a cigar .
1	Yes , <NAME> thought she had better go with me .
1	I should speak of foreign dancers , and the <NAME> End of <NAME> , and May Fair , and lords and ladies and honourables. ' ' I trust , sir , ' rejoined Mrs. Sparsit , with decent resignation , ' it is not necessary that you should do anything of that kind .
1	The fashionable intelligence says so for the comfort of the <NAME> , and it knows all fashionable things .
1	But all happiness has an end -- hence the chief pleasure of its next beginning -- and as it was now growing late , they agreed it was time to turn their faces homewards .
1	" Why , there 's not much air to be got here ; and what there is , is not very freshening , " Weevle answers , glancing up and down the court .
1	" Then it was your young man who came for me .
1	The <NAME> of My Resolution XIV .
1	The name of Mr Tite <NAME> has been mentioned to me as representing some highly influential interest among his creditors .
1	' Sir. ' Stay here. ' <NAME> seemed uncertain .
1	' I beg your pardon , ' said the <NAME> , looking up with an air of abstraction .
1	But , when she suffered it to break loose , it was only for a moment .
1	' <NAME> , you amaze me , ' cried <NAME> .
1	' I will have a respectful , prompt , and ready bearing towards myself , ' he continued , ' and towards <NAME> , and towards your mother .
1	It was evening when I arrived , much fatigued by the journey I had so often made so easily .
1	'You have some papers , ' said <NAME> advancing , 'which were placed in your hands , for better security , by a man called <NAME> . '
1	You must not think my visit all friendly and disinterested , <NAME> , for -- I am afraid I may be cruelly prejudiced -- I do not like to let papa go away alone , with him. ' ' Does he exercise the same influence over <NAME> still , <NAME> ? ' Agnes shook her head .
1	' I don ' t display camels myself , I am above them : I am a more solid man ; but these camels have basked in the light of my countenance , and how dare you , sir , insinuate to me that I have irradiated any but unimpeachable camels ? ' The camels are polishing up in the <NAME> ' s pantry for the dinner of wonderment on the occasion of the <NAME> going to pieces , and Mr Twemlow feels a little queer on the sofa at his lodgings over the stable yard in <NAME> , <NAME> ' s , in consequence of having taken two advertised pills at about mid-day , on the faith of the printed representation accompanying the box ( price one and a penny halfpenny , government stamp included ) , that the same ' will be found highly salutary as a precautionary measure in connection with the pleasures of the table. ' To whom , while sickly with the fancy of an insoluble pill sticking in his gullet , and also with the sensation of a deposit of warm gum languidly wandering within him a little lower down , a servant enters with the announcement that a lady wishes to speak with him .
1	<NAME> <NAME> couldn ' t bear the climate , my dear .
1	says <NAME> slightly , " we have n't got much good out of <NAME> .
1	' No , my son , ' he resumed , with a snap of his fingers .
1	' Address your observations to me , sir , ' interposed <NAME> ; ' I alone am to blame , if anybody be. ' ' Oh !
1	It was a great dim , shabby pile , with high old oaken pews , among which about a score of people lost themselves every Sunday ; while the clergyman ' s voice drowsily resounded through the emptiness , and the organ rumbled and rolled as if the church had got the colic , for want of a congregation to keep the wind and damp out .
1	It might be almost anything. ' ' Those are the letters. ' Mr Flintwinch , who had been observantly pausing all this time with a cup of tea in his hand , and his mouth open ready to swallow the contents , began to do so : always entirely filling his mouth before he emptied it at a gulp ; and always deliberating again before he refilled it .
1	<NAME> up everybody else , and welcome .
1	As we advanced , I began to feel misgivings that my companion lost confidence .
1	' We are thankful to come here for rest , sir , ' said <NAME> .
1	The river has washed away its banks , and stately trees have fallen down into the stream .
1	" Somebody 's been making free here ! "
1	' Is he as soft as ever ?
1	I used to think there were so many whom you might have married , who would not have brought such charge and trouble on you , and who would have made your home a worthier home .
1	<NAME> , who had been engaged in a manner in which every reader may imagine for himself or herself , was hurrying downstairs in obedience to his angry summons , when he encountered a new surprise .
1	<NAME> <NAME> returned no other reply than by taking the little <NAME> in her arms , and making his cockade perfectly flat and limp with her caresses .
1	It was too much for Mrs. <NAME> , who immediately rose .
1	But it was much more hard to be compelled to doubt either her father or <NAME> , so affectionate and dear to her , and to think of her love for each of them , by turns , with fear , distrust , and wonder .
1	If <NAME> would have the distinguished goodness to occupy the other salon especially reserved for him , for but five minutes , all would go well .
1	Not that he has any suspicions , but that he may as well know what they are up to in there .
1	' Hold your tongue , sir , ' said <NAME> .
1	" No , sir , " I said , " I do n't think I shall , " really not seeing on consideration why I should be .
1	Most solemnly. ' ' Nor let the <NAME> touch me , not yet so much as look at me ! ' with another struggle .
1	" Six months , a year ! " " Not so long as that , " said I .
1	Had these been such , their imprisoned rays of light would have taken flight that moment , and they would have been as dull as lead .
1	She bore him company with her pride , resentment , hatred , all as plain to him as her beauty ; with nothing plainer to him than her hatred of him .
1	Then came the <NAME> , who complained that these same people _would_ get drunk , and showed in tabular statements that they did get drunk , and proved at tea parties that no inducement , human or <NAME> ( except a medal ) , would induce them to forego their custom of getting drunk .
1	What can I do to save him , sir ? '
1	<NAME> Leicester rises , adjusts her scarf about her , and returns to his seat .
1	' Of course there is. ' ' Who do you mean ? ' said <NAME> , in the same mysterious manner .
1	' By a slip from <NAME> , <NAME> , we learn that the <NAME> .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , my amiable subject , you will get your money .
1	Let his foe follow him , and find him for himself , but not through me !
1	There was a Mrs <NAME> lived at <NAME> before me , and perhaps you ' re mistaking me for her .
1	' But why did you tell her ?
1	' This is a good beginning , ' he said bitterly .
1	' Why , confound the woman , ' exclaimed <NAME> , ' she IS sentimental !
1	The little picture was so instantaneously dissolved by our going in , that one might have doubted whether it had ever been .
1	She had in part suspected , and in part discovered , the main facts of the cruel story , of her husband 's share in it , and my being resorted to .
1	<NAME> , I wo n't be smothered any more .
1	The rattle of the harness was the chink of money , and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even <NAME> 's , with all its foreign and home connection , ever paid in thrice the time .
1	I took the tablets from her hand , and it trembled again , and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the pencil was attached , and put it in mine .
1	These inquiries proved very harassing to R. W. who , besides being a little disturbed by wine , was in perpetual terror of committing himself by the utterance of stray words that would betray his guilty foreknowledge .
1	The cook and housemaid screamed .
1	<NAME> would insist upon carrying the basket , and <NAME> would insist upon carrying it herself , which gave rise to a struggle , in which <NAME> captured the basket and the bandbox likewise .
1	' Is there anybody at home ?
1	" Now , little housewife , " said my guardian , looking at his watch , " I was strictly timed before I came upstairs , for you must not be tired too soon ; and my time has waned away to the last minute .
1	There are always on board ship , a Sanguine One , and a Despondent One .
1	I wos married fust , that vay myself , <NAME> , and <NAME> wos the consekens o ' the manoover. ' ' You give me no great encouragement to conclude what I have to say , ' observed <NAME> , ' but I had better do so at once .
1	'That 's not the point , ' said the doctor , mysteriously .
1	Why has Mr Headstone gone from us in that way ? ' ' He asked me -- you know he asked me -- to be his wife , Charley. ' ' Well ? ' said the boy , impatiently .
1	How are you ? ' ( very shortly . )
1	Mrs Gowan ' s door was attended by a family servant of several years ' standing , who had his own crow to pluck with the public concerning a situation in the Post-Office which he had been for some time expecting , and to which he was not yet appointed .
1	You see me looking on you now , and you can read the warmth of passion for you that is breathing in my face. ' Not a curl of the proud lip , not a flash of the dark eye , nothing but the same intent and searching look , accompanied these words .
1	Would you ? " and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite unparalleled within my limited experience .
1	' Oh ! ' thought <NAME> , ' that this slender chance might not be lost , and that I might prevail , if it were but for one week ' s time and reconsideration ! ' ' You are charged with some commission to me , sir , ' said <NAME> , presenting herself in great agitation .
1	A damp mist rose from the river , and the marshy ground about ; and spread itself over the dreary fields .
1	I had never been shown my mama 's grave .
1	His latent uneasiness had been , that bad aims were being worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments , and that he who could not fail to know that he was better than they , was not there , trying to do something to stay bloodshed , and assert the claims of mercy and humanity .
1	She wanted no strengthening in her firmness ; but if she had had need of any , she would have derived it from his kindling face .
1	' And so I told her , both last night and today. ' ' You told her truth , ' said <NAME> , ' and did well to do so ; though I must say , at the same time , that if I had a daughter , and my freedom , pleasure , nay , my very health and life , depended on her taking a husband whom I pointed out , I should hope it would not be necessary to advance any other arguments to induce her to consent to my wishes. ' <NAME> looked at <NAME> as if to see whether he spoke in earnest , and having nodded twice or thrice in unqualified assent to what had fallen from him , said : ' I must go upstairs for a few minutes , to finish dressing .
1	' At seven , ' says <NAME> , looking at his plain old silver watch -- the very watch he once took a wheel out of , at school , to make a water-mill .
1	This led me to speculate whether any of them ever tumbled down , and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face , -- a disagreeable turn of thought , suggesting other and more objectionable approaches up my back .
1	' Well , <NAME> , ' said Dr Lumbey , ' this makes six .
1	I don ' t go there on purpose , you know , but I happen to be in the neighbourhood very often ; and when I find myself there , why -- why I call. ' ' Nat ' rally , ' observed the <NAME> .
1	A dozen times did he softly turn the handle of some bedroom door which resembled his own , when a gruff cry from within of ' Who the devil ' s that ? ' or ' What do you want here ? ' caused him to steal away , on tiptoe , with a perfectly marvellous celerity .
1	The gentleman who was against him had to speak first , and being in dreadfully good spirits ( for he had , in the last trial , very nearly procured the acquittal of a young gentleman who had had the misfortune to murder his father ) he spoke up , you may be sure ; telling the jury that if they acquitted this prisoner they must expect to suffer no less pangs and agonies than he had told the other jury they would certainly undergo if they convicted that prisoner .
1	<NAME> , when evening came , he took a way to his lodgings that led through fields , with any design of finding <NAME> in those fields , is not so certain as that she regularly walked there at that hour .
1	The <NAME> occupied two floors of a large stiff house , where several callings purported to be pursued by day , but whereof little was audible any day , and which was shunned by all of them at night .
1	And I took him down to the churchyard , and set him on a certain tombstone there , and he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the memory of <NAME> , late of this <NAME> , and Also <NAME> , <NAME> of the Above .
1	Mrs <NAME> , overpowered by her feelings as a mother , sinks on her sofa in the <NAME> attitude , when the clatter of the chariot wheels is lost , and sheds several tears .
1	" <NAME> and I have talked about it again and again , " <NAME> pursued , " and the dear little thing begged me only this evening , with tears in her eyes , to say to you that , if you will live with us when we come together , she will do her best to make you happy , and to convince her husband 's friend that he is her friend too .
1	'If you knew what I am sometimes , you would pity me , indeed .
1	<NAME> dismiss that from your consideration .
1	I had taken care to have it well understood in <NAME> Britain when my birthday was .
1	Secondly , we owe the Veneerings a grudge , and we owe all other people the grudge of wishing them to be taken in , as we ourselves have been taken in .
1	' He bites. ' ' Eh , <NAME> , eh ? ' pursued the client .
1	In my weakness and entire dependence on him , the dear fellow had fallen into the old tone , and called me by the old names , the dear " old Pip , old chap , " that now were music in my ears .
1	While you are here , I must stipulate that you are always known as -- say as <NAME> -- an ordinary name , and convenient .
1	Under ordinary circumstances , I should scruple to entreat the indulgence of <NAME> and <NAME> , but- ' ' I can only say for myself , ' said my aunt , ' that I will drink all happiness and success to you , <NAME> , with the utmost pleasure. ' ' And I too ! ' said <NAME> , with a smile .
1	In three days ' time he was able to sit in an easy-chair , well propped up with pillows ; and , as he was still too weak to walk , Mrs. <NAME> had him carried downstairs into the little housekeeper 's room , which belonged to her .
1	And yet a clearer-minded man don ' t walk. ' In spite of his respect for <NAME> , <NAME> could not help inwardly rejoicing at the absence of this sage , and devoutly hoping that his limpid intellect might not be brought to bear on his difficulties until they were quite settled .
1	" It 's true enough , " he said , going before us with the lantern , " that they call me the <NAME> and call my shop Chancery .
1	" You 're not tall enough to reach the tub ! "
1	' An addition to our little <NAME> , <NAME> , ' said the <NAME> ; ' Mr <NAME> ' s son. ' Young <NAME> blushed again ; and finding , from a solemn silence which prevailed , that he was expected to say something , said to <NAME> , ' How are you ? ' in a voice so deep , and a manner so sheepish , that if a lamb had roared it couldn ' t have been more surprising .
1	In this state , the waiter ' s dismal intelligence about the ships immediately connected itself , without any effort of my volition , with my uneasiness about <NAME> .
1	' I am in no difficulty , ' exclaimed <NAME> , ' and in no hurry .
1	Let me put your shawl tidy .
1	In which case , we might not only know the fact , but might know from <NAME> what the terms of the communication were. ' ' I see ! ' cried Rosa .
1	Thus reasoned <NAME> , and in pursuance of this reasoning he and his friend soon afterwards repaired to <NAME> ' s , there to execute a plan of operations concerted by <NAME> himself , avowedly to promote his friend ' s object , and really to attain his own .
1	When I opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild morning , all of a leaden hue ; when I walked from room to room ; when I sat down again shivering , before the fire , waiting for my laundress to appear ; I thought how miserable I was , but hardly knew why , or how long I had been so , or on what day of the week I made the reflection , or even who I was that made it .
1	" My dear , I do n't know it , " said I .
1	" Now , " said <NAME> , gliding away the instant I touched her cheek , " you are to take care that I have some tea , and you are to take me to Richmond. " Her reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us , and we were mere puppets , gave me pain ; but everything in our intercourse did give me pain .
1	' <NAME> , Mr Rokesmith , I can ' t say what I consider them , ' returned the young lady .
1	He was very fond of reading the papers , very fond of making fancy-sketches with a pencil , very fond of nature , very fond of art .
1	Very glad indeed to have the pleasure .
1	' I am charmed , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' let me assure you , with <NAME> .
1	Not I , I hope ! ' ' You hope , indeed !
1	Can I hope that she will still remain the same <NAME> as of old ?
1	' I hope that ' s <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> .
1	There was a cut upon his forehead , and they had been wetting his hair , which lay bedabbled and entangled on the pillow .
1	He asked her , after short consideration , why she supposed so .
1	And very amiable he looked , and a very low bow he made , as he advanced , and setting himself down at the nearest table , ordered something to drink of the grinning <NAME> .
1	All right ! ' But appearing to be incensed by imaginary contradiction , or other ill-usage , Mr F. ' s <NAME> , instead of relapsing into silence , made the following additional proclamation : ' I hate a fool ! ' She imparted to this sentiment , in itself almost <NAME> , so extremely injurious and personal a character by levelling it straight at the visitor ' s head , that it became necessary to lead Mr F. ' s <NAME> from the room .
1	And not the least amazing circumstance connected with her being vaguely the town talk is that people hovering on the confines of <NAME> 's high connexion , people who know nothing and ever did know nothing about her , think it essential to their reputation to pretend that she is their topic too , and to retail her at second-hand with the last new word and the last new manner , and the last new drawl , and the last new polite indifference , and all the rest of it , all at second-hand but considered equal to new in inferior systems and to fainter stars .
1	Sometimes she wondered , with a swelling heart and rising tear , whether she was proficient enough in anything to surprise him when they should become companions .
1	Why , I think that sometimes. ' ' You are laughing , <NAME> .
1	We will behold , and minutely examine , a scene so interesting to every Englishman. ' ' We will , ' was the animated cry of three voices .
1	That the mother and father , unknown to one another , were dwelling within so many miles , furlongs , yards if you like , of one another .
1	A part of the <NAME> , indeed , contained so much public spirit and private virtue that not even this strong leverage could move it to good fellowship with a tainted accuser .
1	As it was , she merely stipulated , " If you bring the boy back with his head blown to bits by a musket , do n't look to me to put it together again. " The sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies , and parted from <NAME> as from a comrade ; though I doubt if he were quite as fully sensible of that gentleman 's merits under arid conditions , as when something moist was going .
1	' Play ! ' suddenly cried the bowler .
1	He could not tell me that ; he saw me , and over my shoulder he saw the man .
1	The quick eye of the <NAME> detected his helplessness immediately , and now , as she afterwards observed , she felt she had got him .
1	And it takes away the hunger as well as wittles , deary. ' She hands him the nearly-emptied pipe , and sinks back , turning over on her face .
1	" No more did n't I of mine , " cries Guster .
1	Every word he uttered had a force that no other grace could have imparted to it .
1	' There ' s a friend he took to very much at last .
1	But he thought it better not to ask the question ; and walked back to the shop : thinking over all he had seen and heard .
1	Why , how old are you ? ' ' I don ' t know. ' Mr <NAME> opened his eyes very wide , and appeared thoughtful for a moment ; then , bidding the child mind the door until he came back , vanished straightway .
1	She had never been quite at her ease with him , and received him with some little embarrassment as he seated himself near her table .
1	I believe your father is acquainted with his daughter <NAME> ' s writing .
1	The child answered that that was not its name ; it was a garden -- his brother ' s .
1	Mrs <NAME> and <NAME> repaired to the drawing-room , where that excellent mother considered it incumbent on her to shed a few irrepressible tears , supposed to be forced from her by her daughter ' s felicity ; and which she was still drying , very gingerly , with a laced corner of her pocket-handkerchief , when her son-in-law appeared .
1	And may my prayers go up to Heaven that ' twill be a happiness to her , and a comfort , and a honour , all her life !
1	" You said , dear guardian , when we spoke of <NAME> before <NAME> left us , that you thought he would give a long trial to another country .
1	The good brothers and <NAME> occupied some time in discussing the probability of his return ; and , when it became apparent that he would not come back , they hesitated whether or no to send after him .
1	But , that it was hopeless to question him on that one reserved point , <NAME> , with his small eyes too near together , saw full well .
1	The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about , until they rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady , who were seated in a corner .
1	I ' m a going to seek my Em ' ly .
1	' I doubt , ' said <NAME> , ' if he can be here till next day. ' ' Then I will come next night too , ' said <NAME> .
1	' A hard case it has been , and a hard case it is on <NAME> , ' he finished by saying , with all the honest feeling the topic roused in him .
1	' And what I recommend you for the present , is , don ' t talk , <NAME> .
1	This was very disagreeable to a guilty mind .
1	Whether they turned into it on his movement or on hers matters little .
1	Her feelings were so much excited on the occasion , that she found it indispensable to afford them this relief , even without having the comfort of any audience or sympathy whatever .
1	' <NAME> , the pipkin ! ' <NAME> drew forth , from the same hiding-place , a small brass pipkin , which <NAME> observed he prided himself upon , particularly because it looked so business-like .
1	There was something in this .
1	" How much ? " " Only two sets of them. " " Give me the worst first. " " There they are , <NAME> .
1	I wish I could think it was only manner -- I hope it may be -- ' ( Here the affectionate relative heaved a deep sigh , and shook her head despondingly ) .
1	Then is there a singular kind of parallel between her and the little glass chandeliers of another age embellishing that assembly-room , which , with their meagre stems , their spare little drops , their disappointing knobs where no drops are , their bare little stalks from which knobs and drops have both departed , and their little feeble prismatic twinkling , all seem <NAME> .
1	' Would you not like to be rich NOW , my darling ? ' ' How can you ask me such a question , <NAME> dear ?
1	Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there , a whisper on one happy slave and a wave of the hand on another , <NAME> affably passed through his rooms to the remote region of the Circumference of <NAME> .
1	But he sat and looked at her , notwithstanding , for nearly two hours , as she sat looking at the fire , until he was again called out .
1	In the evening I started , by that conveyance , down the road I had traversed under so many vicissitudes .
1	At last , the top of the staircase was gained , and they stopped for the third time .
1	You are , we will say in round numbers , twenty years of age ; <NAME> is , we will say in round numbers , fifty .
1	Approaching nearer and nearer , the bargeman became <NAME> , in rough water-side second-hand clothing .
1	Accompanying <NAME> to the gate , she as closely watched what followed .
1	Come then ! " <NAME> recalled soon afterwards , and to the end of her life remembered , that as she pressed her hands on <NAME> 's arm and looked up in his face , imploring him to do no hurt to <NAME> , there was a braced purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes , which not only contradicted his light manner , but changed and raised the man .
1	Nothing of any kind was missing .
1	There is little enough in the high tide of the day , but there is next to none at night .
1	He can not do so , she tells him , too plainly or too briefly .
1	' For a young man , Mr <NAME> is not a very great walker ; and I observe that he generally falls tired , and requires a good long rest , when he has come as far as this .
1	There was no wind to make a ripple on the foul water within the harbour , or on the beautiful sea without .
1	Where am I to wait for her ?
1	He meant to be clear of the town very early ; before the Hands were in the streets .
1	'And your reasons , <NAME> , ' he said , at length , in a low voice ; 'your reasons for this decision ? '
1	Before you answer , keep this hat well in your mind and also this walking-stick. ' ' I am willing , <NAME> , to come to terms. ' ' Willing won ' t do , <NAME> .
1	I can speak to no one else about him , but poor Kit .
1	You do n't mean to set up for a new character with <NAME> after all these years , I hope ? "
1	' But what ' s the use of tapping ? ' he said , ' She ' ll never hear .
1	<NAME> profusion is in the shops : particularly in the articles of currants , raisins , spices , candied peel , and moist sugar .
1	' No , thank you , ' said Mr Toots , ' it ' s all quite right .
1	It was the peculiarity of the nuptials that they were all Bride .
1	' <NAME> down , <NAME> , ' said Mr Toots .
1	Expressive signs of what made them poor , were not wanting ; the tax for the state , the tax for the church , the tax for the lord , tax local and tax general , were to be paid here and to be paid there , according to solemn inscription in the little village , until the wonder was , that there was any village left unswallowed .
1	I asked if the brickmaker 's wife were ill , but <NAME> said no .
1	' I ask you , <NAME> , are you frightened ?
1	' No , of course not , ' he assented .
1	You ' d persuade me if you could , that you are a poor Jew .
1	I am very sorry I intruded , I am sure .
1	' <NAME> ' t be alarmed , my dear , ' he said , gently ; ' I am not angry with you .
1	His countenance had , perhaps for years , become so set in its contentious expression that it did not soften , even now when he was quiet .
1	What do you mean ? ' ' I merely mean that as I shall have many dealings with this lady , if she will kindly allow me , I will not trouble her with such forms , ' said <NAME> .
1	Oliver reached the stile at which the by-path terminated ; and once more gained the high-road .
1	I couldn ' t bear to have anything of that sort going on with myself .
1	' We ' ll go and look at ' em. ' Away we went .
1	<NAME> constitution has much to do with the development of such facts , no doubt ; but in this case , appetite carried it hollow over the tender passion ; Mr Dombey being very cool and collected , and the Major fretting and fuming in a state of violent heat and irritation .
1	<NAME> need to show that this detested family name had long been anathematised by <NAME> , and was wrought into the fatal register .
1	I am seldom called upon to put my young friends into mourning ; not into real mourning , that is ; Court mourning they are rather proud of .
1	Whether Mr Dombey , wrapped in his own greatness , was at all aware of this , or no , there had not been wanting opportunities already for his complete enlightenment ; and at that moment it might have been effected by the one glance of the dark eye that lighted on him , after it had rapidly and scornfully surveyed the theme of his self-glorification .
1	The seats , instead of stretching from end to end , are placed crosswise .
1	' No , I won ' t go so far as to say that , ' urged the cherub , a little remonstrant against the very decisive and unpitying tone ; ' but he mightn ' t have suited <NAME> , or <NAME> mightn ' t have suited him , or fifty things , whereas now I hope she can choose for herself. ' ' Has she -- as you place the confidence in me of speaking on the subject , you will excuse my asking -- has she -- perhaps -- chosen ? ' faltered the Secretary .
1	Let it be her -- not you -- that sees my fallen child ! ' He walked a little in front of us , and kept before us for some minutes .
1	Hearing a footstep and the rustle of a dress , the <NAME> turned with a palpitating remembrance of the dreadful Mrs MacStinger , at the instant when <NAME> made a motion with her hand towards him , reeled , and fell upon the floor .
1	This reflection would make the Captain profoundly melancholy , until the return of Mr Toots ; when he would fall to his cards again , with many side winks and nods , and polite waves of his hook at <NAME> , importing that he wasn ' t going to do so any more .
1	' I don ' t know what it may be , I don ' t know what it may not be , ' said <NAME> ; ' it ' s some secret in which your uncle is concerned , but what , I ' ve not yet been able to discover , although I have my strong suspicions .
1	<NAME> had one truly noble idea of general public business , which was , to let everything go on in its own way ; of particular public business , <NAME> had the other truly noble idea that it must all go his way -- tend to his own power and pocket .
1	' I say nothing of his plea for claiming my confidence .
1	In whatever state she walked away , she certainly did not walk back again .
1	<NAME> , <NAME> , this long while !
1	During the day , his bedstead turns up against the wall , and leaves more space for him to work in .
1	This was the result of his day ' s anxiety , and this was the decision he put in practice when the day closed in .
1	She shook her head as if she had not derived all the comfort she had fondly expected from this interview , but thanked him nevertheless for the trouble he had kindly taken .
1	I promise you nothing , ' said the dolls ' dressmaker , dabbing two dabs at him with her needle , as if she put out both his eyes .
1	' You may see him now , ' said she , ' if you ' ll condescend to take a peep. ' With these mysterious words , she preceded the visitor into a little parlour behind the shop , with a little window in it commanding a very little dull back-yard .
1	But , perhaps , she little thinks how I would retort upon her if I married her son .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , open your eyes , that ' s a love !
1	O , good citizens , if you would have so much compassion for us ! " There was but a gaoler left , along with two of the four men who had taken him last night , and <NAME> .
1	You may be aware , <NAME> -- and , possibly , you may be aware too , <NAME> -- that a little distance has interposed itself between me and some of my friends , and that where I used to visit a good deal , I do not visit now. ' Polly , who , with a woman ' s tact , understood this at once , expressed as much in a little look .
1	This was , when he was asked a Parliamentary question on any one topic , to return an answer on any other .
1	Will you oblige me by giving it the calmest and coolest perusal , and by discussing the subject afterwards with me , in the tone and spirit in which alone it ought to be discussed ?
1	At this sally , the boys laughed .
1	It was lost upon <NAME> , who was stooping at the moment to tie the boot-lace which the dog had torn .
1	" Why did you not tell me , Mrs .
1	That did not extend to me , she told me in a gush of love and confidence ( at that time , I had known her something less than five minutes ) ; if they were all like <NAME> , it would be quite another thing .
1	But something has been -- You feel quite strong to-day , don ' t you ? ' ' <NAME> strong. ' The hand he held crept up a little nearer his face .
1	' You don ' t know who he is !
1	Where ' s that there fresh lad , that nothing couldn ' t tire nor put out , and that sparkled up and blushed so , when we joked him about <NAME> ' s <NAME> , that he was beautiful to look at ?
1	Indeed , the excitement extended itself over the whole street , and groups of ladies might be seen standing at the doors , ( some in the interesting condition in which Mrs. <NAME> had last appeared in public , ) relating their experiences of similar occurrences .
1	His colour changed though , when , without a pause , it came on through the heavy door , and passed into the room before his eyes .
1	" You acted noble , my boy , " said he .
1	He would have been more and more sensible of what was wanting in his home .
1	Then our brother was drawn -- swiftly -- to drunkenness .
1	I am afraid you ' ll find me very dull .
1	<NAME> ! ' We gave him three times three , and another , and a good one to finish with .
1	' But about these boys of yours ; you wanted to speak to me ? ' ' Yes , ' replied <NAME> .
1	They were now by an avenue of trees .
1	This was done and said with a comical mixture of jest and earnest , and , leading to a great amount of laughter , made them very merry indeed .
1	The train calls at stations in the woods , where the wild impossibility of anybody having the smallest reason to get out , is only to be equalled by the apparently desperate hopelessness of there being anybody to get in .
1	I hope they will manage their little income. ' ' Oh !
1	' I am not very likely to , ' rejoined <NAME> .
1	You hold your life on the condition that to the last you shall struggle hard for it .
1	<NAME> <NAME> ' s brow darkened during the recital .
1	But now she soothed him with gentle and tender words , smiled at his thinking they could ever part , and rallied him cheerfully upon the jest .
1	" You are very poor , ai n't you ? "
1	He had not previously uttered a word .
1	<NAME> hustled him into a little noisy and rather dirty machinery , in a by-comer , and made him Member of <NAME> for <NAME> : one of the respected members for ounce weights and measures , one of the representatives of the multiplication table , one of the deaf honourable gentlemen , dumb honourable gentlemen , blind honourable gentlemen , lame honourable gentlemen , dead honourable gentlemen , to every other consideration .
1	She wean ' t be a bride in a hurry , I reckon. ' ' For shame , <NAME> , ' said Mrs. <NAME> ; with an acute perception of the joke though , being a bride herself .
1	At another time , he would be rumbled up out of his soundest sleep , in the dead of the night ; at another , would be kept at his post eight-and-forty hours on end .
1	Wery good indeed , Samivel. ' <NAME> nodded his head an extraordinary number of times , in the excess of his gratification , and waited in a listening attitude for <NAME> to resume his statement .
1	Utterly preposterous as his cravat was , and as his collars were , I was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look .
1	One Dowager , <NAME> calls it lip-salve .
1	When he cared to talk , he talked well ; but , the cloud of caring for nothing , which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness , was very rarely pierced by the light within him .
1	" Not much of that , sir , though that HAS happened .
1	But , at last , we came to the door of his cell ; and <NAME> , looking through a little hole in it , reported to us , in a state of the greatest admiration , that he was reading a <NAME> .
1	And he wondered about it , in some broken expressions , several times , in the short remainder of our walk ; and only seemed to forget it when the light of fire and candle shone upon us , seated warm and merry , at table .
1	' " Stay , love , " cried the young lady .
1	Plashwater Weir <NAME> ! ' The bargeman stopped , and looked back .
1	says <NAME> , who likes nothing better than to model his conversation on forensic principles .
1	The joy attended <NAME> through his struggle with <NAME> on the brink of the orchestra and the grave , and slackened no more until he had tumbled the king off the kitchen-table , and had died by inches from the ankles upward .
1	' The dear young friend to whom he presents me , may be a comfort to me at some time , he says .
1	Having made various ineffective attempts to fit the parcel ( which was some two feet square ) into the crown thereof , <NAME> took it under his arm , and after putting on his fingerless gloves with great precision and nicety , keeping his eyes fixed upon <NAME> all the time , he adjusted his hat upon his head with as much care , real or pretended , as if it were a bran-new one of the most expensive quality , and at last departed on his errand .
1	' And yet so pretty , so pretty ! ' And added presently , as he walked to and fro in his room .
1	For example , these ravishing ear-rings and this necklace so superb to correspond , were what one called a love-gift .
1	He lets him take the newspaper up to him in bed ; he gives him the crusts of his toast to eat ; he sends him on little errands about the house ; he tells him to come to me for sixpences .
1	While the attorney was thus engaged , the dwarf was groping under the table , muttering desperate imprecations on himself , and mankind in general , and all inanimate objects to boot , which suggested to Mr Brass the question , ' what ' s the matter ? ' ' The key , ' said the dwarf , looking viciously about him , ' the door-key -- that ' s the matter .
1	<NAME> <NAME> took no heed of me when I went into the parlour where he was , but sat by the fireside , weeping silently , and pondering in his elbow-chair .
1	' Ah , <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> .
1	What place is this , to which the squalid street conducts us ?
1	" I am not at all tired , my dear , " said I , " and would much prefer to go out . "
1	' Now then. ' There was a sharp whirring noise , that made <NAME> start back as if he had been shot himself .
1	To a poor one most . "
1	' More shame for you , ' retorted the nurse .
1	<NAME> and ventilation , drainage and water-service , all of the primest quality .
1	<NAME> is a great favourite of mine , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , ' as indeed he is of most people .
1	Revived by soup , <NAME> discourses mildly of the <NAME> with <NAME> and <NAME> .
1	Well-inquired. ' ' But I do say , ' proceeded <NAME> , ' that I am taken from among my trophies of anatomy , am called upon to exchange my human warious for mere coal-ashes warious , and nothing comes of it .
1	It is in the hands of my solicitor .
1	' It seems improbable because it is improbable , ' his friend returned .
1	' A <NAME> turns his face , after washing it well , to the <NAME> , when he says his prayers ; these good people , after giving their faces such a rub against the World as to take the smiles off , turn with no less regularity , to the darkest side of <NAME> .
1	of the honour of his alliance .
1	This was prudent , for in point of fact , the dwarf , knowing his disposition , was lying in wait at a little distance from the sash armed with a large piece of wood , which , being rough and jagged and studded in many parts with broken nails , might possibly have hurt him .
1	<NAME> you good-night , ladies. ' To the great relief of Mrs. Sanders , <NAME> was allowed to depart without any reference , on the part of the hostess , to the pettitoes and toasted cheese ; to which the ladies , with such juvenile assistance as <NAME> could afford , soon afterwards rendered the amplest justice -- indeed they wholly vanished before their strenuous exertions .
1	I shall tell her , in no more wureds than I speak to you , what it ' s the price on ; and that I ' m gone , and past receiving of it back. ' I told him that I thought it would be right to do so -- that I was thoroughly convinced it would be , since he felt it to be right .
1	No human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind , in the scared blank wonder of his face .
1	The whole court , adult as well as boy , is sleepless for that night , and can do nothing but wrap up its many heads , and talk of the ill-fated house , and look at it .
1	Then , I considered , when I had got safe back again , this was a nice thing to have done !
1	' Mr Lightwood , ' pursued her husband , ' as chance has brought us face to face at last -- which is not to be wondered at , for the wonder is , that , in spite of all my pains to the contrary , chance has not confronted us together sooner -- I have only to remind you that you have been at my house , and to add that I have not changed my residence. ' ' Sir ' returned <NAME> , with a meaning glance towards <NAME> , ' my position is a truly painful one .
1	How they said , ' Bagstock , your friend <NAME> now , what is the view he takes of such and such a question ?
1	<NAME> at him while I ask the way , ' said <NAME> .
1	I lodge at one Mr <NAME> ' s , at Holloway. ' Mr <NAME> stared again .
1	' O , nowhere in particular , ' replied <NAME> , a little put out as it seemed by the question ; ' I ' m only anxious that you should think me so , and do me justice .
1	<NAME> went on to say with considerable hesitation and reluctance that there was one thing more she wished us to know , and felt we ought to know , and which she hoped would not offend us .
1	' He sought the pig with all the ardour of their early friendship -- but , alas !
1	' Son of Bitherstone of <NAME> .
1	All that night , the bell was never silent for five minutes at a time ; and after every ring the vessel reeled again , sometimes beneath a single blow , sometimes beneath a dozen dealt in quick succession , the lightest of which seemed more than enough to beat in her frail keel , as though it had been pie-crust .
1	For your very great politeness , I am sure , ' said <NAME> ; with an irony which no more affected my aunt , than it discomposed the cannon I had slept by at <NAME> .
1	<NAME> could not but assent again .
1	put his horses into a canter and took us forward at such a rate , uphill though it was , that the wheels sent the road drift flying about our heads like spray from a water-mill .
1	When she , cast out of home , come here to me , and dropped upon them planks , her wownded heart was broke .
1	When we got outside the door , <NAME> informed me that <NAME> , being now ' a little nearer ' than he used to be , always resorted to this same device before producing a single coin from his store ; and that he endured unheard-of agonies in crawling out of bed alone , and taking it from that unlucky box .
1	' Do it ! ' The <NAME> was so impressed by the possession of his tremendous secret -- by the fact of <NAME> Dombey being at that moment under his roof , while the innocent and unconscious <NAME> sat opposite to him -- that a perspiration broke out on his forehead , and he found it impossible , while slowly drying the same , glazed hat in hand , to keep his eyes off Mr Toots ' s face .
1	What a strange peculiarity on the part of Mr Meagles , and where should we find another such case !
1	Now pray remark , <NAME> , and Mr Sols , the depth of my wife ' s penetration .
1	There is no man in this world on whom I could so rely for right guidance , as on you .
1	This is our sitting-room , -- just such chairs and tables and carpet and so forth , you see , as they could spare from home .
1	He started back at least three feet , gazed for a moment , and then shot off as hard as he could go : his excessively little tail vibrating with speed and terror like a distracted pendulum .
1	he had never played with three thorough-paced female card-players before .
1	So <NAME> quenched her wonder in her gratitude whenever it broke out , and soon subdued it .
1	The closing of the door recalled him to himself .
1	You ' ve heard of my Clown and hith dog being thuppothed to have morrithed ? ' He addressed <NAME> , who answered ' Yes. ' ' Well , <NAME> , ' he returned , taking off his hat , and rubbing the lining with his pocket-handkerchief , which he kept inside for the purpose .
1	He had been brought down to <NAME> , from <NAME> , by an eminent Philanthropist , and why ?
1	But under this difficulty , as under all the other difficulties of my journey , I seemed to be sustained and led on by my fanciful picture of my mother in her youth , before I came into the world .
1	' She ' s got hold o ' some inwention for grown-up people being born again , <NAME> -- the new birth , I think they calls it .
1	But it 's a weak chance if he 'd come , sir ! "
1	It was a dull evening , for <NAME> drew his wine , when it came round , quite as a matter of business , -- just as he might have drawn his salary when that came round , -- and with his eyes on his chief , sat in a state of perpetual readiness for cross-examination .
1	Does the old man look like a long-liver ? ' ' He don ' t look like it , ' said <NAME> shaking his head , ' but these old people -- there ' s no trusting them , <NAME> .
1	It still wanted ten minutes to the hour when he had ascended the staircase on which <NAME> ' s chambers were .
1	Stumbled against them. ' ' The people ? ' ' Yes .
1	I don ' t wish to discourage you , but I should certainly say that , of her case , <NAME> and Fogg are far better judges than any of us can be. ' ' It ' s a vile attempt to extort money , ' said <NAME> .
1	He stopped just as his eminently practical friend , still accompanied by the two young culprits , entered the room .
1	' I dare say I didn ' t make myself very clear , ' he went on , ' nor you neither .
1	To offer it or hint at it would be to drive him to an extremity , if nothing else did . "
1	NOW lift me , my love. ' <NAME> very softly raised the weather-stained grey head , and lifted her as high as <NAME> .
1	How much are you out of pocket ?
1	I don ' t know her ! ' I knew her .
1	" And so , <NAME> , " says <NAME> of the shooting gallery after several turns in silence , " you were dreaming of the country last night ? "
1	' Is it no harm to have a constant hallooing and hooting under one ' s very nose , distracting one from business , and making one grind one ' s teeth with vexation ?
1	Pictures of demolished streets and altered houses , as they formerly were when the occupant of the chair was familiar with them , images of people as they too used to be , with little or no allowance made for the lapse of time since they were seen ; of these , there must have been many in the long routine of gloomy days .
1	I have wronged thee , <NAME> , but I will right thee yet , I will indeed .
1	' I promise , ' said <NAME> .
1	' This proceeding is more absurd than the other. ' ' I think it would be best to take it in , ' replied <NAME> ; ' it would serve him right to take it in and keep it , wouldn ' t it ? ' ' It would , ' said <NAME> ; ' shall I ? ' ' I think it the most proper course we could possibly adopt , ' replied <NAME> .
1	That a letter should be written to <NAME> early next morning , and forwarded per <NAME> , requesting his consent to <NAME> and <NAME> ' s remaining at <NAME> , for the purpose and with the object already assigned , and begging an answer by the next coach -- , if favourable , the aforesaid parties to remain accordingly , and if not , to return to <NAME> immediately on the receipt thereof .
1	You separated yourself from my affairs .
1	But no such day had ever dawned on Mr Dombey , or his wife ; and the course of each was taken .
1	Has this letter any connexion with dear little <NAME> ?
1	You haven ' t seen a beadle lately ? ' ' As an Englishman who has been more than twenty years in <NAME> , no. ' ' Then , ' said Mr Meagles , laying his forefinger on his companion ' s breast with great animation , ' don ' t you see a beadle , now , if you can help it .
1	<NAME> , baffled by his Nephew in his late Design , hatches a Scheme of Retaliation which <NAME> suggests to him , and takes into his Counsels a tried Auxiliary The course which these adventures shape out for themselves , and imperatively call upon the historian to observe , now demands that they should revert to the point they attained previously to the commencement of the last chapter , when <NAME> and <NAME> were left together in the house where death had so suddenly reared his dark and heavy banner .
1	By-and-bye , they went into the house .
1	Say the next day ! ' I said the next day ; and he put on his great-coat and lighted his cigar , and set off to walk home .
1	If the truth has come out , as it plainly has in a manner that there ' s no standing up against -- and a very sublime and grand thing is <NAME> , gentlemen , in its way , though like other sublime and grand things , such as thunder-storms and that , we ' re not always over and above glad to see it -- I had better turn upon this man than let this man turn upon me .
1	" Then the possibility or probability -- for such it must be considered -- of your never being disturbed in possession of those effects lately belonging to a lone old man who seemed to have no relation in the world , and the certainty of your being able to find out what he really had got stored up there , do n't weigh with you at all against last night , <NAME> , if I understand you ? "
1	<NAME> <NAME> ' s world was peopled with profligates , and he acted accordingly .
1	' O , it was excellent ! —I wouldn ' t dance with you , you know. ' Edwin scarcely seems to see the force of this ; begs to know if he may take the liberty to ask why ?
1	As to <NAME> , <NAME> 's brother , I am really afraid to say what he did at school in ciphering , but I think it was decimals .
1	Even had it not been so , the dear old china shepherdess would have worried herself to death with fears for her son , and with general trepidation occasioned by their having such an inmate .
1	" Why , I must get a lodging of some sort , " said <NAME> , pondering .
1	The furniture was all very solid and good , like his watch-chain .
1	You are -- hum -- quite accurate , I have no doubt .
1	There were the piles of city roofs and chimneys , more free from smoke than on week-days ; and there were the distant masts and steeples .
1	I walked out once , <NAME> , during a conversation between two brothers , to which , in the beginning , young <NAME> was a party .
1	' Oh , my dear <NAME> , ' cried <NAME> , wringing her hands as she ran up to embrace her , ' to think that you and <NAME> should be ruined !
1	I must do the best I can , for the present , I suppose. ' In spite of himself , he appeared abashed by my aunt ' s indignant tears , and came slouching out of the garden .
1	Here he is ! -- He looks quiet. ' With these words , which had the effect of causing the harmless <NAME> painful agitation , Mr Fledgeby withdrew to his former post , and the old man entered the counting-house .
1	He was not so honest , he was not so manly , he was not so good-humoured ; he substituted cunning for their simplicity , and passion for their safe solid sense .
1	At first , I had to shut some gates after me , and now and then to stand still while the cattle that were lying in the banked-up pathway arose and blundered down among the grass and reeds .
1	Go at once I must , it stands to reason ; because I can ' t live without breathing freely ; and I can ' t breathe freely until <NAME> is out of this Marshalsea .
1	'Wounded desperate , miss , ' replied <NAME> , with indescribable complacency .
1	<NAME> , sitting by , looked down at the dark eyelashes lying wet on the flushed cheeks , and looked with gentleness and pity , for she knew the truth .
1	" The first until we meet to-morrow , the second as a farewell to this theme between us for ever . "
1	Now , <NAME> -- after you , ma ' am. ' Mrs <NAME> hesitated , but Mr <NAME> insisted .
1	' Now , if old <NAME> had entertained the most remote or distant idea of the state of the affections of <NAME> , he would just have razed the school-room to the ground , or exterminated its master from the surface of the earth , or committed some other outrage and atrocity of an equally ferocious and violent description ; for he was a terrible old fellow , was <NAME> , when his pride was injured , or his blood was up .
1	I will go , upon your invitation. ' ' Why , when I invite you to my house , ma ' am , ' said <NAME> , opening his eyes , ' I should hope you want no other invitation. ' ' No , indeed , sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit , ' I should hope not .
1	Perhaps it was so likened by the lonely <NAME> , standing on the brink of the lock .
1	' The young lady of whom you speak is , as you know , <NAME> , shortly to be married , ' said <NAME> , gravely ; ' therefore your admiration , if it be of that special nature which you seem to indicate , is outrageously misplaced .
1	It ' s so comfortable to sit here and feel that you might be weighed , measured , magnified , electrified , polarized , played the very devil with : and never know how. ' Nothing short of the wonderful <NAME> , combined with the occasion ( which rendered it desirable to improve and expand <NAME> ' s mind ) , could have ever loosened his tongue to the extent of giving utterance to this prodigious oration .
1	' And if I could deny her when the tears was on her face , <NAME> ' r <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , tenderly adjusting it on the rough palm of his hand , ' how could I deny her when she give me this to carry for her -- knowing what she brought it for ?
1	She surmised , she said , that Mr <NAME> had lost better and higher opportunities by marrying his pretty wife ; and Love in a cottage , painting pictures for dinner , was so delightfully interesting , that she begged her papa to give him the commission whether he could paint a likeness or not : though indeed both she and <NAME> knew he could , from having seen a speaking likeness on his easel that day , and having had the opportunity of comparing it with the original .
1	' Humph ! ' retorted <NAME> , looking at the fire .
1	He saw nothing of it , for before he looked at her , she had again cast down her eyes !
1	Before turning to retrace his steps , he stopped upon the margin , to look down at the reflected night .
1	A housekeeper would be acceptable over yonder at the <NAME> , for instance .
1	' May I take the liberty to say something ? ' ' You may , ' <NAME> graciously conceded .
1	We alighted at one of the entrances to the Square she had mentioned , where I directed the coach to wait , not knowing but that we might have some occasion for it .
1	His recital ended , <NAME> insisted upon his young friend ' s stripping off his coat and allowing whatever injuries he had received to be properly tended .
1	Within , there were two glasses of rum and milk prepared , and two biscuits .
1	She withdrew her hand timidly from his arm as we stopped to speak to them , and blushed as she gave it to <NAME> and to me .
1	Every street was a sawpit , and there were no top-sawyers ; every passenger was an under-sawyer , with the sawdust blinding him and choking him .
1	<NAME> <NAME> had re-counted the teaspoons , re-weighed the sugar-tongs , made a closer inspection of the milk-pot , and ascertained to a nicety the exact condition of the furniture , down to the very horse-hair seats of the chairs ; and had repeated each process full half a dozen times ; before he began to think that it was time for Mrs. Corney to return .
1	<NAME> , <NAME> ! ' As the ruin of <NAME> tottered off whimpering , and wiping its eyes with a gingerly remembrance of rouge in their neighbourhood , the old woman hobbled another way , mumbling and counting her money .
1	The stranger did not recognize me , but I recognized him as the gentleman I had met on the stairs , on the occasion of my second visit to <NAME> .
1	In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional people who had had , for a few years , some vague misgiving in them that things in general were going rather wrong .
1	The murdered person was a woman , -- a woman a good ten years older , very much larger , and very much stronger .
1	I can ' t say more than that for ' em. ' ' I ' ll take this man myself , sir , ' said Mr Inspector to <NAME> .
1	P'raps they would n't do it if I wos to go myself .
1	' Well , sir , I have been thinking that if you were in waiting in the garden behind , alone -- ' ' Alone , ' said <NAME> .
1	' How ? ' was <NAME> ' s inquiry , in a low and slow voice , after a silence .
1	He appeared to have a very extraordinary and miscellaneous connection , and very odd calls he made , some at great rich houses , and some at small poor ones , but all upon one subject : money .
1	' It may be , or may not be , ' said Mr Boffin , ' just as you view it .
1	'When a man 's his own enemy , it 's only because he 's too much his own friend ; not because he 's careful for everybody but himself .
1	Mr <NAME> , after mentally calculating his engagements to a nicety , replied that he should look in at from two minutes before six and seven minutes past ; and the man disappearing with this feeble consolation , <NAME> took a greasy memorandum-book from his pocket and made an entry therein .
1	And now to see him after all , and in a prison too !
1	A brown sunburnt gentleman , who appears in some inaptitude for sleep to be wandering abroad rather than counting the hours on a restless pillow , strolls hitherward at this quiet time .
1	" Why have you told my story to so many persons ? "
1	So there ain ' t no other character ; ain ' t there , my lad ? ' Walter briskly waved his hand in the negative .
1	' Very bad , ' said the landlord .
1	I wish your ladyship good day , and am much obliged to you all the same . "
1	' You ' ll go home very soon , you will .
1	Look to your feet , <NAME> , for we shall try your boots .
1	Since leaving home , they had halted here and there for necessary refreshment , and had frequently been delayed , especially in the night time , by waiting for fresh horses .
1	' <NAME> ? ' repeated the other , with a wide show of his teeth .
1	'You seem out of humour , <NAME> . '
1	<NAME> had fallen on him in its place .
1	Not of late years , ' replied the <NAME> , with a flourish of his hand .
1	In his better days , before he had become enfeebled by dissipation and emaciated by disease , he had been in the receipt of a good salary , which , if he had been careful and prudent , he might have continued to receive for some years -- not many ; because these men either die early , or by unnaturally taxing their bodily energies , lose , prematurely , those physical powers on which alone they can depend for subsistence .
1	He felt the more resigned to it , forasmuch as <NAME> enjoyed herself completely , and <NAME> was delighted .
1	And it was not a contest of politeness , or by any means a matter of form , for she knew very well that her husband wished to enter the house in this order , that he might have a favourable opportunity of inflicting a few pinches on her arms , which were seldom free from impressions of his fingers in black and blue colours .
1	I am not very old , you may say .
1	His nose once brought to it , shall be held to it by these hands , Mr Venus , till the sparks flies out in showers. ' With this agreeable promise <NAME> stumped out , and shut the shop-door after him .
1	' Have I startled you ? ' he asked .
1	Here on the head of an empty barrel stood on end were an ink-bottle , some old stumps of pens , and some dirty playbills ; and against the wall were pasted several large printed alphabets in several plain hands .
1	As the old man , <NAME> , sat by , helping her in such small ways as he could , he found it difficult to make out whether she really did realize that the deceased had been her father .
1	And write too , I shouldn ' t wonder ? ' ' Yes , ma ' am , ' said the child , fearful of giving new offence by the confession .
1	After a careful consideration of these , and an elaborate estimate of his resources , he had come to the conclusion to select that sum which represented the amount with compound interest to two years , fifteen calendar months , and fourteen days , from that date .
1	<NAME> bowed and stepped forward .
1	I might have known it from what I have seen of your strength of character .
1	Now do they note down , in the watches of the night , how the neighbourhood of <NAME> was yesterday , at about midnight , thrown into a state of the most intense agitation and excitement by the following alarming and horrible discovery .
1	' Yes , sir , ' returned <NAME> ; ' but <NAME> has come back , and he begs the favour of a word. ' As he held the door open with his hand , <NAME> looked at me , and looked at <NAME> , and looked at the dishes , and looked at the plates , and looked at every object in the room , I thought , -- yet seemed to look at nothing ; he made such an appearance all the while of keeping his red eyes dutifully on his master .
1	I openly say , unpalatable as it may be , that I consider <NAME> 's affairs in a very bad way , that I consider <NAME> C. himself in a very bad way , and that I regard this as an exceedingly ill-advised marriage .
1	With a pitiful and plaintive look for her wayward sister ; for her idle brother ; for the high blank walls ; for the faded crowd they shut in ; for the games of the prison children as they whooped and ran , and played at hide-and-seek , and made the iron bars of the inner gateway ' Home. ' Wistful and wondering , she would sit in summer weather by the high fender in the lodge , looking up at the sky through the barred window , until , when she turned her eyes away , bars of light would arise between her and her friend , and she would see him through a grating , too .
1	I have derived inexpressible comfort from it .
1	But I am going down tomorrow morning to Mr Dombey , at <NAME> , and if <NAME> can entrust me with any commission , need I say how very happy I shall be ? ' <NAME> immediately divining that <NAME> would desire to write a letter to her father , proposed to return , and besought Mr Carker to come home and dine in his riding gear .
1	I saw <NAME> lay her beads down .
1	What should I have lost ?
1	My love to you ! ' Some of the fog that hung about old <NAME> seemed to have got into his throat ; for he spoke huskily .
1	Had her attractions been manifested first to him -- or <NAME> ?
1	A railroad yonder , see , where two stout horses trot along , drawing a score or two of people and a great wooden ark , with ease .
1	If you ever read this letter , <NAME> , I am likely to be dead .
1	The patient figures at work were swarthy with the filings of iron and steel that danced on every bench and bubbled up through every chink in the planking .
1	I had been afraid until then to say a word about the play .
1	Oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to ; and <NAME> proceeded to load the pistol , with great nicety and deliberation .
1	I am so beset and hemmed in , that they are not only all struck with fear , but , like the beasts in the fable , have their fling at me now , though time was , and no longer ago than yesterday too , when they were all civility and compliance .
1	Thinks it long enough for <NAME> .
1	Finally , there was a parlour for guests to sit in and sup in , where a table was already laid , and where a blazing fire shone red and high .
1	Your mother-in-law may ha ' been too much for me , or a thousand things may have happened by the time you next hears any news o ' the celebrated <NAME> o ' the <NAME> .
1	The coat was wide-skirted ; and in that respect like _the_ coat , but , oh how different !
1	' It seemed at first as if it was only <NAME> that he objected to meet .
1	It ' s a sensible and proper thing indeed , what Mrs <NAME> has said ! ' exclaimed the old lady .
1	' I am not here by accident , ' he added after a lengthened silence ; 'nor have I heard all this to-night , for I knew it yesterday -- only yesterday .
1	But , then , the thought darted across his mind that it was barely eleven o'clock ; and that many people were still in the streets : of whom surely some might be found to give credence to his tale .
1	These young ladies -- not supposed to have been actually christened by the names applied to them , though always so called in the family from the places of their birth in barracks -- are respectively employed on three-legged stools , the younger ( some five or six years old ) in learning her letters out of a penny primer , the elder ( eight or nine perhaps ) in teaching her and sewing with great assiduity .
1	' My dear girl ! ' ' You frightened me. ' ' Most unintentionally , but I am as sorry as if I had meant to do it .
1	At last , after much fruitless inquiry , <NAME> , followed by the coach and <NAME> , found a man who had once resided in that vanished land , and who was no other than the master sweep before referred to , grown stout , and knocking a double knock at his own door .
1	Can I have a word with you ? ' ' <NAME> .
1	Two cognovits -- take care of them .
1	' She ought not to be alone here ; ought she , <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> , anxiously .
1	' Very seasonable. ' ' Seasonablest veather I ever see , sir , ' rejoined <NAME> .
1	And they do say , <NAME> and <NAME> , ' lowering his voice , ' that he ' s taken a dislike to her , and that she ' s left , unnoticed , among the servants , and that his mind ' s so set all the while upon having his son in the <NAME> , that although he ' s only a baby now , he is going to have balances struck oftener than formerly , and the books kept closer than they used to be , and has even been seen ( when he thought he wasn ' t ) walking in the <NAME> , looking at his ships and property and all that , as if he was exulting like , over what he and his son will possess together .
1	" And , again and again , I am glad to see you , Watt !
1	This figure was the first to perceive that <NAME> was looking on ; upon which he winked to the <NAME> , and entreated him , with mock gravity , not to wake the gentleman .
1	<NAME> <NAME> with it !
1	The lady stepped lightly aside , and snatching the young man ' s sword from his hand , before he had recovered his balance , drove him to the wall , and running it through him , and the panelling , up to the very hilt , pinned him there , hard and fast .
1	" And it is a remarkable example of the confusion into which the present age has fallen ; of the obliteration of landmarks , the opening of floodgates , and the uprooting of distinctions , " says <NAME> with stately gloom , " that I have been informed by <NAME> that Mrs. Rouncewell 's son has been invited to go into <NAME> . "
1	' Oh , <NAME> , ' says <NAME> , ' when I looked in to have a little lesson with the children just now , I got the message that you left for me ; and as soon as I could recover my spirits at all , I came on after you .
1	'That it wo n't do ; so it 's no use a-trying it on , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> .
1	At length he went back again , and took the road which leads from <NAME> to <NAME> .
1	<NAME> nodded , and <NAME> the elder gave vent to an extraordinary sound , which , being neither a groan , nor a grunt , nor a gasp , nor a growl , seemed to partake in some degree of the character of all four .
1	You have too much feeling. ' ' We have all our faults , ' said <NAME> , weeping and shaking her head .
1	' You can ' t be trusted for a moment .
1	And this was the first passage of <NAME> ' s first love .
1	" Well , sir , " says <NAME> , " this man with me is the other party implicated in this unfortunate affair -- nominally , only nominally -- and my sole object is to prevent his getting into trouble on my account .
1	All this , <NAME> , although himself somewhat of an impetuous gentleman : knowing his friend 's peculiarities , bore with great good humour ; as <NAME> , at tea , was graciously pleased to express his entire approval of the muffins , matters went on very smoothly ; and <NAME> , who made one of the party , began to feel more at his ease than he had yet done in the fierce old gentleman 's presence .
1	' I am sure I shall have a good one in that case. ' To see how Miss Squeers tossed her head , and the corn-factor flattened his nose , while this conversation was carrying on !
1	<NAME> Jarndyce I had perhaps less reason to be surprised than either of my companions , having never yet enjoyed an opportunity of thanking one who had been my benefactor and sole earthly dependence through so many years .
1	<NAME> at parting recapitulated to the old man all that she had said before , and bound him to their compact .
1	He has not a large business , but he is a very respectable man .
1	I had hoped , ' said <NAME> , looking round with a mournful smile , ' to have seen you three gentlemen , one day or another , with your legs under the mahogany in my humble parlour in the <NAME> .
1	' Your object being only to see her again , ' said <NAME> , ' you could effect it at any time you chose by that means. ' Lord <NAME> acknowledged the hint with a great many squeezes of <NAME> ' s hard , horny hand , and whispering that they would now do well to close the conversation , called to <NAME> that he might come back .
1	" Not in season ! " says I .
1	'Oh , you know , <NAME> , he must be mad , ' said Mrs. Sowerberry .
1	They left you , you say -- at those races , as I understand .
1	' Let me see then , ' resumed Mr Boffin , with his hand to his chin .
1	If he lives till it turns , he ' ll hold his own till past the flood , and go out with the next tide. ' We remained there , watching him , a long time -- hours .
1	<NAME> <NAME> kissed her hand , retired to the window , and pulling out his pocket-handkerchief , had a mental wrestle with himself .
1	Oh deep , exhaustless , mighty well of love , in which so much was sunk !
1	'Not one little peep , miss ? '
1	Concurrently with this measure ( the description of which cost Mr Rugg innumerable wry faces and great uneasiness in his limbs ) , he would address a letter to all the creditors , exonerating his partner in a solemn manner , informing them of the stoppage of the <NAME> until their pleasure could be known and his partner communicated with , and humbly submitting himself to their direction .
1	Mrs. Rouncewell confirms all this , not without personal pride , reserving only the one point of affability .
1	' <NAME> , ' said the <NAME> , in persuasive accents .
1	" 'You see , monsieur , I am going to use them , ' I replied , and said no more .
1	During the bustle of preparation at the railway , Mr Dombey and the <NAME> walked up and down the platform side by side ; the former taciturn and gloomy , and the latter entertaining him , or entertaining himself , with a variety of anecdotes and reminiscences , in most of which <NAME> was the principal performer .
1	It can never be a solitary one to you and me .
1	However , we must take it as it comes .
1	Equally , when he lay still and staring , he would repeat it for hours without cessation , but then , always in a tone of subdued warning and horror .
1	There 's not a fork or a spoon in the collection , " said <NAME> , " that I did n't cry over , last night after the box came , till I could n't see it. " " I am highly gratified , " said <NAME> , " though , upon my honour , I had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance invisible to any one .
1	' Men are not born able seamen .
1	Let me first see that he is in visiting order . '
1	It is certain that Mr Toots , by some remote and roundabout road , had got to that point , and that there he made a stand .
1	<NAME> is in a new situation , and his prospects are very good indeed .
1	As I knew it would be miserable at home , and as the nights were dark and the way was dreary , and almost any companionship on the road was better than none , I made no great resistance ; consequently , we turned into <NAME> 's just as the street and the shops were lighting up .
1	' <NAME> , ' returned the <NAME> , after staring at him and the rest for a long time , without speaking , ' I ' m gone about and adrift .
1	I loved my wife dearly , and I was happy ; but the happiness I had vaguely anticipated , once , was not the happiness I enjoyed , and there was always something wanting .
1	A great many more iniquities of a similar nature might have been disclosed , only the toast being all eaten , the tea having got very weak , and <NAME> holding out no indications of meaning to go , <NAME> suddenly recollected that he had a most pressing appointment with the shepherd , and took himself off accordingly .
1	He had driven his mistress to her old house in <NAME> , where she had been met by Mr Carker -- <NAME> stood upon the very spot where she had seen him coming down .
1	' <NAME> him -- ' ' What ? ' ' Such dreadful words , ' said <NAME> .
1	" <NAME> , " said I , " do you remember , when we were overtaken by the thunder-storm , <NAME> 's speaking to you of her sister ? "
1	' It is remarkable too , ' thought <NAME> : ' if it had been " Kate " or " <NAME> , " I should not have been so much surprised : but " little <NAME> ! " ' The wine coming at the moment prevented his finishing the sentence .
1	' Why , no doubt everybody has heard it noticed ! ' <NAME> in truth was no unreasonable inference ; seeing that Mr <NAME> would probably be the last person , in any assemblage of the human species , to receive an impression from anything that passed in his presence .
1	He now said he would ' go and look up Mr Rugg ' , from whom his excited state of mind appeared to require another back ; and bundling up his papers , and exchanging one more hearty shake of the hand with <NAME> , he went at full speed down-stairs , and steamed off .
1	How <NAME> received the announcement I am unable to say ; for I was afraid to look at him just then , lest <NAME> 's sharpness should detect that there had been some communication unknown to him between us .
1	" Only , if this is a private room specially ordered for the occasion , I should think the public room must be a _very _comfortable one ; " with this , my uncle sat himself down in a high-backed chair , and took such an accurate measure of the gentleman , with his eyes , that <NAME> and <NAME> could have supplied him with printed calico for a suit , and not an inch too much or too little , from that estimate alone .
1	At mid-day following he reappeared at the <NAME> , in the character , not new to him , of a witness before a <NAME> ' s <NAME> .
1	Traddles accordingly did so , over the banister ; and <NAME> , not a bit changed -- his tights , his stick , his shirt-collar , and his eye-glass , all the same as ever -- came into the room with a genteel and youthful air .
1	He do n't get no iron rust here ! " II .
1	Afterwards , when <NAME> came to reflect on what had passed , he was so very much impressed by the strength of <NAME> 's anxiety on this point that in telling me generally of his first visit to <NAME> 's Inn he particularly dwelt upon it .
1	Do you think I would tell you so or come to you like this , if it were not the case ? ' <NAME> looked at him more closely .
1	While he smoked out his cigar in peace , she made his bed , and put the small room in order for his repose .
1	The weather is so very bad down in <NAME> that the liveliest imagination can scarcely apprehend its ever being fine again .
1	' I object on principle , ' said <NAME> , ' as a biped -- ' ' As a what ? ' asked Mr Boffin .
1	' Coarse person ! ' said <NAME> , ' you anticipate my meaning , though in odious language. ' Here Mrs <NAME> rested her elbow on the little table at her side , and suffering her wrist to droop in what she considered a graceful and becoming manner , dangled her fan to and fro , and lazily admired her hand while speaking .
1	Nelly , kneeling down beside the box , was soon busily engaged in her task , and accomplishing it to a miracle .
1	Such an ugly villain too ! " said <NAME> .
1	The <NAME> Reverend the <NAME> will please to bear in mind that I have seen the world. ' Here <NAME> gets a little behind the <NAME> , to inspect his coat-buttons .
1	I do n't know what may happen if I am carried beyond myself at last !
1	' His daughter has gone to fetch him , but I can ' t wait ; therefore , if you please , I will leave a message for him with you. ' ' You see , my friend , ' <NAME> put in , ' we are the kind of people who know the value of time , and you are the kind of people who don ' t know the value of time. ' ' I have not , ' retorted <NAME> , after surveying him from head to foot , ' the honour of knowing _you_ , —but if you mean that you can make more money of your time than I can of mine , I should judge from your appearance , that you are about right. ' ' And when you have made it , you can keep it too , I should think , ' said <NAME> .
1	I have saved him. " VII .
1	It is my duty to attend to your interests with a cool head , and I can quite understand that to your excited feelings I may appear , at such times as the present , insensible .
1	She had laughed and welcomed them , and made far too much of the dog , far , far , too much -- that is to say , supposing there had been any third person looking on who loved her .
1	I awmust think it be the very star ! ' They lifted him up , and he was overjoyed to find that they were about to take him in the direction whither the star seemed to him to lead .
1	' Why , she complains of suffering from the fright of last night , ' said the lady .
1	It was a sort of march ; but when the <NAME> put out his right foot , he gravely turned upon his axis , with a semi-circular sweep towards the left ; and when he put out his left foot , he turned in the same manner towards the right .
1	" This is a truly sad time , Mr .
1	' I 'll fetch him directly , ' said Mrs. Mann , leaving the room for that purpose .
1	Nor had Flora the least signs of seclusion upon her , notwithstanding her recent declaration ; but , on the contrary , was wonderfully smart , and enjoyed the ceremonies mightily , though in a fluttered way .
1	Yes ; I knew that <NAME> was looking out for me. ' ' Do you keep a cat down there ? ' asked <NAME> .
1	' I suppose , ' he added , turning to <NAME> , ' he ' ll say next , that my story about the queer client we had , when I was in an attorney ' s office , is not true either -- I shouldn ' t wonder. ' ' I shan ' t venture to say anything at all about it , seeing that I never heard the story , ' observed the owner of the <NAME> decorations .
1	She was still doing this , five minutes afterwards .
1	It 's a fight to get back again .
1	' " Damn you , " said I , starting up , and rushing upon him ; " I killed her .
1	I deserve the reproach , which is very just indeed .
1	They were a full half-hour in conference .
1	But I ' ll tell you what I do see , <NAME> , ' glancing up at the windows ; ' I see the light of fire and candle in your mother ' s room ! ' ' And what has that to do with it ? ' ' Why , sir , I read by it , ' said Mr Flintwinch , screwing himself at him , ' that if it ' s advisable ( as the proverb says it is ) to let sleeping dogs lie , it ' s just as advisable , perhaps , to let missing dogs lie .
1	' Come in , my love , ' said <NAME> .
1	Not six—but what believes as he has doon his duty by the rest and by himseln .
1	Now softer , and now louder , now inaudible , now ringing very slowly over bad ground , now brisk and merry , it came on ; until with a loud shouting and lashing , a shadowy postillion muffled to the eyes , checked his four struggling horses at his side .
1	He has the constitution of a rhinoceros , the digestion of an ostrich , and the concentration of an oyster .
1	The lock of hair that had escaped and curled loosely over her brow , the traces of tears yet scarcely dry , the flushed cheek , the look of sorrow , all fired some dormant train of recollection in the old man ' s breast ; and the face of his dead brother seemed present before him , with the very look it bore on some occasion of boyish grief , of which every minutest circumstance flashed upon his mind , with the distinctness of a scene of yesterday .
1	<NAME> gracious , such a woman ! ' <NAME> shook his head with great solemnity , as though to imply that he supposed she must have been rather a dazzler .
1	said <NAME> , folding his hands .
1	The boat came close to the bank again , and before she had had any more time for consideration , she and her grandfather were on board , and gliding smoothly down the canal .
1	' Well ? ' ' Well , ' said the cobbler , ' he left five thousand pound behind him. ' ' And wery gen-teel in him so to do , ' said <NAME> .
1	It was either you or the schoolmaster -- one of you , or the two between you -- that got the forged letter done ; remember that !
1	" A fog , miss , " said the young gentleman .
1	Why , my limbs only made my breath shorter when I used ' em .
1	Like his impudence ! ' said <NAME> .
1	There was the same enforced composure on her face , that there had been when she was dressing ; and the wreath upon her head encircled the same cold and steady brow .
1	And it was such vapouring all about his ears , like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head , added to a latent uneasiness in his mind , which had already made <NAME> restless , and which still kept him so .
1	It is in the present mode .
1	' It ' s tolerably clear to _me_ , ' said <NAME> , ' that the little puss can get small good out of such companionship. ' ' Are you speaking of young <NAME> , <NAME> ? ' ' Yes , ma ' am , I ' m speaking of Louisa. ' ' Your observation being limited to " little puss , " ' said Mrs. Sparsit , ' and there being two little girls in question , I did not know which might be indicated by that expression. ' ' Louisa , ' repeated <NAME> .
1	' But oh , my friends and brothers !
1	' Then , if you please , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' have the goodness to turn the cushion .
1	<NAME> <NAME> is only a baronet , but there is no mightier baronet than he .
1	In this yard a wash of sheets and table-cloths tried ( in vain , for want of air ) to get itself dried on a line or two ; and among those flapping articles was sitting in a chair , like the last mariner left alive on the deck of a damp ship without the power of furling the sails , a little woe-begone young man .
1	Rob the <NAME> discharged himself of his duty with so much exactness and judgment , when thus put to the proof , that the <NAME> presented him , at divers times , with seven sixpences , in token of satisfaction ; and gradually felt stealing over his spirit the resignation of a man who had made provision for the worst , and taken every reasonable precaution against an unrelenting fate .
1	Then , the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready to go down into the village , roused him .
1	<NAME> ' s part in the pageant was humble enough , her duties being limited to holding articles of costume until <NAME> was ready to try them on , and now and then tying a string , or fastening a hook-and-eye .
1	Next day , too , when we all go in a flock to see the house -- our house -- <NAME> ' s and mine -- I am quite unable to regard myself as its master .
1	<NAME> is but a poor calling .
1	The hysterics called up <NAME> .
1	I shall be very glad tomorrow morning to think that I saw you again , but now I almost wish you hadn ' t come. ' <NAME> was about to return a cheerful reply , when he was greatly disconcerted by the sudden apparition of Mrs. Grudden , who it seemed had declined to attend the supper in order that she might rise earlier in the morning , and who now burst out of an adjoining bedroom , habited in very extraordinary white robes ; and throwing her arms about his neck , hugged him with great affection .
1	The steamer for <NAME> and the steamer for <NAME> would start from <NAME> at about nine on Thursday morning .
1	In the meantime , Mrs. <NAME> kept unwinking watch and ward .
1	As he passed along towards <NAME> , he stopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror , and slightly altered the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat , and his coat-collar , and his wild hair .
1	I think he would not be much the better for the mother .
1	Other professional men go out of town .
1	' I ' m thinking how old you must be , ' said <NAME> .
1	' The same mistake presents itself to me , in one shape or other , at every turn , ' said brother Charles .
1	Sure as the morning came , it found him lingering near the house to ask if she were well ; and , morning , noon , or night , go where she would , he would forsake his playmates and his sports to bear her company .
1	But it left a little figure visible upon a lonely shore , and <NAME> was always staring at it .
1	So the doctors ordered him off .
1	' No , no , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , arresting his hand , ' A lady .
1	' Twenty pound ten better , ' repeated <NAME> , ' than you did that day when I first introduced myself .
1	' You see and hear this foolish creature .
1	' <NAME> short in the waist , ain ' t it ? ' said the stranger , screwing himself round to catch a glimpse in the glass of the waist buttons , which were half-way up his back .
1	' I beg your parding , young man , ' said Mrs. Raddle , in a cold perspiration of anger .
1	cried the doctor , as usual , all in a bustle .
1	I will hear no more. ' He did not speak again until they had walked some half-a-mile in silence , when he gravely broke out with : ' What would your best friends say , <NAME> ?
1	' Where are you , <NAME> ? ' ' Here , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
1	But after twenty-one years the defendant ' s wife died , and he very soon afterwards , at the age of seventy-eight , married a very young woman : which caused some anxiety to his two sons , whose poignant expressions of this feeling so exasperated their father , that he in his resentment executed a will to disinherit his eldest son , and in his fit of anger showed it to his second son , who instantly determined to get at it , and destroy it , in order to preserve the property to his brother .
1	With the funeral clang that it sounded into <NAME> ' s heart , his sense of weakness returned .
1	A moment more , and <NAME> came clattering along the passage , with the noise of all the nails in his boots condensed into every separate nail .
1	' I didn ' t seek it of him , poor lad .
1	' But people think more of it than people think. ' <NAME> returned , with an uncomfortable feeling in so very slight a courtesy being unusual , <NAME> that all !
1	There were small gardens in front which , being wholly neglected in all other respects , served as little pens for the dust to collect in , until the wind came round the corner and blew it down the road .
1	I parted with the secret , even while I was angry with myself for doing so .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , moving towards the staircase-foot , watches her as she goes up the steps the old man came down to his grave , past murderous groups of statuary repeated with their shadowy weapons on the wall , past the printed bill , which she looks at going by , out of view .
1	I hope it is not self-indulgent to shed these tears as I think of it .
1	Never mind ; send some bread -- only a loaf of bread and a cup of water .
1	I ' ll carry them myself. ' Not ceasing to talk and bustle , in a state of great excitement , Mr <NAME> directed the removal and arrangement of the books , appearing to be in some sort beside himself until they were all deposited on the floor , and the cab was dismissed .
1	' So he thinks ; but he ' s used to call this his own , because it ' s the one first left to him ; the one that was his legacy when it was all he took under the will. ' ' When he shows his light , ' said <NAME> , keeping watch upon his dusky figure all the time , ' drop lower and keep closer. ' He went on again , and they followed again .
1	As to <NAME> , he conceives it utterly impossible that anything can be wanting , in any direction , by any one who has the good fortune to be received under that roof ; and in a state of sublime satisfaction , he moves among the company , a magnificent refrigerator .
1	' Upon my soul , <NAME> , she ' s a perfect beauty -- a -- a picture , a statue , a -- a -- upon my soul she is ! ' ' Well , ' replied <NAME> , shrugging his shoulders and manifesting an indifference , whether he felt it or not ; ' that ' s a matter of taste ; if mine doesn ' t agree with yours , so much the better. ' ' Confound it ! ' reasoned the lord , ' you were thick enough with her that day , anyhow .
1	And when I got downstairs , oh , how I cried !
1	I have no more to say .
1	' I am glad to hope that there is nobody to blame for this one , -- nobody to answer for it. ' ' Ha ! ' said he ; ' that ' s a comfortable reflection .
1	" Then I may say at once that I am glad of it , because it is on that subject that I am anxious to be understood .
1	" Really , sir , I think she might , " said Mrs. Blinder , getting her heavy breath by painful degrees .
1	" Him that I ' ve know ' d so intimate so many years , and like so much .
1	I rather feel it to be so .
1	All through the night the wind blows , and abates not .
1	Following them , he discovered , to his surprise , that they repaired to various low lodging-houses , and taverns kept by broken gamblers , to more than one of whom <NAME> was known , and that they were in pursuit -- so he found by inquiries when they had left -- of an old woman , whose description exactly tallied with that of deaf Mrs Sliderskew .
1	<NAME> Jasper proving willing to speak for Mrs. Tope , <NAME> , who had sent up his card , was invited to ascend the postern staircase .
1	The gaping salmon and the golden mullet lying on the slab seem to turn up their eyes sideways , as they would turn up their hands if they had any , in worshipping admiration .
1	<NAME> <NAME> emerges from behind the cherubim ' s leg , when all is quiet , and comes slowly down from the gallery .
1	Mr <NAME> was far from quarrelling , in his own breast , with the manner of his beautiful betrothed .
1	And whereas , in his own schoolmaster clothes , he usually looked as if they were the clothes of some other man , he now looked , in the clothes of some other man or men , as if they were his own .
1	' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , compassionating his follower ' s confusion and embarrassment .
1	" I shall do it better for the wish , " he answered ; " it will make me enter on these new duties as on another sacred trust from you . "
1	Little <NAME> thanked her , and said , shyly , bread-and-butter and tea was all she usually -- ' Oh nonsense my dear child I can never hear of that , ' said <NAME> , turning on the urn in the most reckless manner , and making herself wink by splashing hot water into her eyes as she bent down to look into the teapot .
1	I must tell you that as to this , I have felt , ever since I have been away , an anxiety which I am very anxious to relieve .
1	It is very doubtful whether <NAME> knows how to laugh .
1	There yet remained a slight scar upon his face , and whenever he was recognised , as he was almost every minute by people sauntering in and out , he made a restless effort to conceal it with his glove ; showing how keenly he felt the disgrace he had undergone .
1	What ' s behind me ? ' He carried his finger slowly down to the wrist , and round the wrist , and affected to look at the back of the hand for what was behind him .
1	We were twelve boarders , and there were two Miss Donnys , twins .
1	For many years the persistent <NAME> has been pointing , with no particular meaning , from that ceiling .
1	I have said so to Venus. ' ' You certainly have , sir , ' said <NAME> .
1	I was afraid you might be going away and hardly thinking of me ; ' and again she gave him her little hand so freely and so faithfully that <NAME> held it for some moments in his own , and could not bear to let it go .
1	He was a dreadful old man to look at , in a filthy flannel waistcoat , and smelling terribly of rum .
1	<NAME> again turned to her maid and took counsel with her in a low voice , while Rob the round-eyed , mindful of his patron ' s secret charge , looked on and listened .
1	I saw a figure like myself lying dressed in my clothes on a bed .
1	She had risen , as the nurse said , and the lashes of her eyes were wet with tears .
1	He only took it under his arm , however , and marched out of the office in profound silence .
1	<NAME> him that if , in his own present , he can find a reason to think less bitterly of me , I asked him to do so .
1	" And I never saw him ! "
1	He lent it at ten , and thought that pretty high .
1	Now , the <NAME> has got its gentleman again , through me .
1	' I have done nothing to found any very strong claim upon your eloquence , I am sure. ' ' He might have been burnt to death , if it hadn ' t been for you , sir , ' simpered <NAME> .
1	It was called <NAME> , <NAME> 's <NAME> ; and I had no other guide to <NAME> 's <NAME> than the <NAME> Rope-walk .
1	' Indeed ! ' said <NAME> , surprised .
1	And I get too much of Mrs. <NAME> 's first and second . "
1	If you do , I can put her in the way of getting one .
1	The second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime , in the first scene of which , it pained me to suspect that I detected <NAME> with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric countenance and a shock of red curtain-fringe for his hair , engaged in the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine , and displaying great cowardice when his gigantic master came home ( very hoarse ) to dinner .
1	I never saw a sight so pitiful as this before !
1	I have little hope that my poor boy will ever read these words , or gladden your eyes with the sight of his frank face any more. " No , no ; no more , ' said <NAME> , sorrowfully meditating ; ' no more .
1	' Oh , you ' ve woke up , at last , have you ? ' said <NAME> .
1	I am the person you inquired for . '
1	And so he went on , content to read the book of her heart from the page first presented to him , little dreaming of the story that lay hidden in its other leaves , and murmuring within himself that at least the child was happy .
1	' O , you Fool ! ' said Mrs. Sparsit , when she was alone at her supper .
1	The journey seemed endless ; street after street was entered and left behind ; and still they went jolting on .
1	' You seem to be sorry , Rosa. ' ' I am sorry for the poor old place .
1	And I noticed as I kissed my dear that she lay with one hand under her pillow so that it was hidden .
1	I was afraid to be seen speaking with him , lest it should be thought I did him harm , and tempted him to evil , and corrupted him : or lest I really should .
1	That he was afraid the soles of his boots were not fit for walking , as they were a good deal worn when he came in ; and that he would thank me very much to have them mended , ready. ' Those boots had been taken off his feet , and put away with the rest of his clothes , two years before !
1	There was some company in the room , and <NAME> said to me as she joined it , " You are to go and stand there boy , till you are wanted. " " There " , being the window , I crossed to it , and stood " there , " in a very uncomfortable state of mind , looking out .
1	" I goes out to work , sir , " returns <NAME> .
1	And that I thus became immeshed in the web he had spun for my reception ? " ' <NAME> ' s enjoyment of his epistolary powers , in describing this unfortunate state of things , really seemed to outweigh any pain or anxiety that the reality could have caused him .
1	He came of rich people down in <NAME> , who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead .
1	Or what avails a curse or blessing from a man like you ?
1	' That ain ' t no word for it .
1	It being Saturday night , I found the landlord looking rather grimly at these records ; but as my business was with <NAME> and not with him , I merely wished him good evening , and passed into the common room at the end of the passage , where there was a bright large kitchen fire , and where <NAME> was smoking his pipe in company with <NAME> and a stranger .
1	' Why , that ' s the very thing , ' replied <NAME> , as though his thoughts were about them at that moment .
1	What , surely must I understand ? " " That I can not wish to renew that chance intercourse with you of long ago , under these different circumstances .
1	<NAME> <NAME> was still indulging in the same extraordinary gestures , and the cracking of his fingers sounded louder that ever .
1	Not <NAME> our Manager , <NAME> -- the other <NAME> ; the <NAME> -- <NAME> !
1	Some young children sported among the tombs , and hid from each other , with laughing faces .
1	She was a pretty , very diminutive , plump woman of from forty to fifty , with handsome eyes , though they had a curious habit of seeming to look a long way off .
1	<NAME> at the expiration of the quarter of an hour , went down to breakfast .
1	' Please to be seated , sir , ' said Mrs. Sparsit .
1	At this hour , just as evening is closing in , you will see them roaming towards bed by scores , eating their way to the last .
1	<NAME> will go regularly between us , and when the time comes you may be certain I shall be ready .
1	A quainter corner than the corner where the <NAME> lived , was not to be found in <NAME> .
1	Though all unseen , and unsuspected by the pupils , <NAME> even pervaded the school exercises .
1	You must look to this , and see that her heart does not grow heavy among these solemn ruins .
1	" You get me a file. " He tilted me again .
1	" If they are not in that room , they are gone , and can be pursued and brought back , " said <NAME> to herself .
1	You were going to say , that I , who know the story of <NAME> ' s life -- ' ' May think it pride in me , ' she continued , ' when I say that I am proud of him !
1	' And what have they made you sensible of ? ' <NAME> ' s play of eyes between the two holds good throughout the dialogue , to the end .
1	'And always put this in your pipe , Nolly , ' said the <NAME> , as the Jew was heard unlocking the door above , 'if you do n't take fogels and tickers -- ' 'What 's the good of talking in that way ? '
1	Day after day , and night after night , found her still by the pillow of the unconscious sufferer , still anticipating his every want , still listening to those repetitions of her name and those anxieties and cares for her , which were ever uppermost among his feverish wanderings .
1	' A mistake , a mistake ! ' Turning away , he sat down with a heavy sigh in the faded chair again .
1	When I left the <NAME> for good , I asked for them , and brought them away with me .
1	<NAME> , <NAME> , was balancing himself on two legs of an office stool , spearing a wafer-box with a penknife , which he dropped every now and then with great dexterity into the very centre of a small red wafer that was stuck outside .
1	Now , he started up , every minute , and with gasping mouth and burning skin , hurried to and fro , in such a paroxysm of fear and wrath that even they -- used to such sights -- recoiled from him with horror .
1	He never made the representation , on the contrary seemed to laugh the idea to scorn ; but it did happen that , with all his pains to depreciate himself , he was always in the superior position .
1	Where ' s your feminine tenderness ? ' ' You thankless dog ! ' gasped <NAME> .
1	" She in all respects deserves it , " says my Lady .
1	This evening he will be casually looking into the iron extinguishers at the door of <NAME> 's house in town ; and to-morrow morning he will be walking on the leads at <NAME> , where erst the old man walked whose ghost is propitiated with a hundred guineas .
1	" I do not even know , " said I , speaking low as he took his seat at the table , " by what name to call you .
1	My rambles , <NAME> , are over. ' ' How do I know that ' ere , sir ? ' argued <NAME> .
1	At a place where she worked , answered <NAME> , blushing .
1	It gave him little surprise , however ; for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life , and thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried out in this .
1	We have , at the present moment , one hundred and seventy families , <NAME> , averaging five persons in each , either gone or going to the left bank of the <NAME> . "
1	It was as stately and as dark as ever , when he went by and glanced up at its frowning front .
1	' I ' ll be even with you. ' ' Approach me again , you -- you -- you <NAME> of infamy , ' gasped <NAME> , ' and if your head is human , I ' ll break it .
1	If there was any word of comfort that would be a solace to her in her dying hour , and only I possessed it , I wouldn ' t part with it for <NAME> itself. ' The mere vehemence of her words can convey , I am sensible , but a weak impression of the passion by which she was possessed , and which made itself articulate in her whole figure , though her voice , instead of being raised , was lower than usual .
1	I don ' t complain of him. ' As she said it , with her eyes upon the fire-glow , there was an instantaneous escape of distress into her face .
1	A thick , yellow liquor defiles them , which is offensive to the touch and sight and more offensive to the smell .
1	<NAME> looked at him for the reason .
1	For my part , I could have gone through a good deal ( though I was much less brave than <NAME> , and nothing like so old ) to have won such a recompense .
1	We will not detain you. ' ' I thank you , sir , ' said <NAME> .
1	We wouldn ' t mind then , when there comes stormy weather. -- -Not for our own sakes , I mean .
1	<NAME> was at first inclined to be surprised that the <NAME> should attach importance to conversations apparently so trivial ; but feeling assured that they must have some hidden purpose , he set himself to consider what it was likely to be .
1	Deep ditches , double drawbridge , massive stone walls , eight great towers , cannon , muskets , fire and smoke .
1	There is no lack of comfortable furnished apartments in <NAME> , and no difficulty in finding some that are proportionate to very slender finances ; but the former were too good , and the latter too bad , and they went into so many houses , and came out unsuited , that <NAME> seriously began to think he should be obliged to ask permission to spend the night in the theatre , after all .
1	<NAME> was the first to change .
1	I rarely heard from <NAME> , and never from <NAME> : but two or three parcels of made or mended clothes had come up for me , consigned to <NAME> , and in each there was a scrap of paper to the effect that <NAME> trusted D. C. was applying himself to business , and devoting himself wholly to his duties -- not the least hint of my ever being anything else than the common drudge into which I was fast settling down .
1	There is a curse on it , and on all this land. " " And you ? " said the uncle .
1	He wore a very precise shirt-frill , and carried a pair of first-rate spectacles on his forehead , and a tremendous chronometer in his fob , rather than doubt which precious possession , he would have believed in a conspiracy against it on part of all the clocks and watches in the <NAME> , and even of the very Sun itself .
1	'Speak out , my friend , if you have anything to say .
1	He said no more , and there was silence for some quarter of an hour until supper appeared .
1	He was as good-natured a dancing-master as ever danced to the <NAME> , and he kept his word .
1	One was the flippant contempt with which the guests evidently regarded her uncle , and the other , the easy insolence of their manner towards herself .
1	The very intelligence that shone in her deep blue eye , and was stamped upon her noble head , seemed scarcely of her age , or of the world ; and yet the changing expression of sweetness and good humour , the thousand lights that played about the face , and left no shadow there ; above all , the smile , the cheerful , happy smile , were made for <NAME> , and fireside peace and happiness .
1	bawled <NAME> , calling in a state of great excitement , up the staircase ; 'here 's one of the thieves , ma'am !
1	' You are not so old , <NAME> , are you , that you ' ll leave your mistress yet ? ' said <NAME> .
1	" They 're wot 's left , <NAME> , " says Jo , " out of a sov-ring as wos give me by a lady in a wale as sed she wos a servant and as come to my crossin one night and asked to be showd this 'ere ouse and the ouse wot him as you giv the writin to died at , and the berrin-ground wot he 's berrid in .
1	Is n't there bright eyes somewheres , wot you love the thoughts on ? " O Estella , <NAME> !
1	There was something in the manner of this simple courtesy : almost defiant , and giving it the character of being rendered on compulsion , or as a matter of traffic to which she was a reluctant party again not lost upon that same observer who was smiling round the board .
1	His spirit shone through his son , to whom he had always preached of " going out " early in life and whom he made a clerk in a sharp scrivener 's office at twelve years old .
1	If <NAME> had not arrived at that wise decision firmly to restrain himself from loving <NAME> , he would have lived on in a state of much perplexity , involving difficult struggles with his own heart .
1	This flabby lump of mortality that we work so hard at with such patient perseverance , yields no sign of you .
1	I was not angry with them ; I was more afraid of them , as if I were cast away among creatures with whom I had no community of nature .
1	So far as it was developed , it had been my happiness to form it .
1	No one remained now but the excitable Jew , who had already raised the skirts of <NAME> 's coat to his lips several times .
1	' " Now then ! " said a voice , as my uncle felt a hand on his shoulder , " you ' re booked for one inside .
1	' Well , <NAME> , ' said Mrs. Crummles , who was seated there in full regal costume , with the phenomenon as the <NAME> in her maternal arms , ' next week for <NAME> , then for Winchester , then for -- ' ' I have some reason to fear , ' interrupted <NAME> , ' that before you leave here my career with you will have closed. ' ' Closed ! ' cried Mrs. Crummles , raising her hands in astonishment .
1	We have done all that -- we know the worst of it ; we have got to the bottom , we can ' t fall , and what have we found ?
1	Well , supposing <NAME> is one of them ? " " Why then , " said the turnkey , grinning again , " he knows what <NAME> is. " " Yah ! " cried <NAME> , suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious way , " you 're dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do with my principal , you know you are .
1	'Perhaps I am , ' replied <NAME> ; ' I should think you was rather out of sorts too , unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots about , as you do when you blab and -- ' 'Are you mad ? '
1	He smoked his pipe as we went along , and sometimes stopped to clap me on the shoulder .
1	I mustn ' t be put upon , as a numble person , too much .
1	As to <NAME> and me , whom he had wrapped up with great care , the night being sharp and frosty , we trembled from head to foot .
1	It being a cold night , the <NAME> wore his hat , as , indeed , was often his custom within doors .
1	Monsieur the <NAME> indicates me with his finger , standing near our little fountain , and says , 'To me !
1	<NAME> <NAME> had hooked him in the coat collar with the handle of his umbrella , and was hanging on at the other end with all his might and main .
1	As she started up , and they all three looked at one another , it became a noise of clamouring voices and of the stir of feet ; then all the windows were heard to be hastily thrown up , and shouts and cries came floating into the house from the river .
1	" The dearest friend I have ! "
1	" Well , sir , " says <NAME> , holding his hat at the side of his head in his deference towards his best customer , " I was wishful to say a word to you , sir . "
1	" What is to be told to <NAME> ?
1	' The only question is , whether the gentleman , being on the ground , must not be considered , as a matter of form , to be the individual who insulted our friend , <NAME> , yesterday evening , whether he is really that individual or not ; ' and having delivered this suggestion , with a very sage and mysterious air , the man with the camp-stool took a large pinch of snuff , and looked profoundly round , with the air of an authority in such matters .
1	in quick reply to a gesture of dissent from the housekeeper .
1	' My dear Kate , if you will allow me to speak , ' said Mrs. Nickleby , ' I shall take the liberty of explaining to this lady -- ' ' I think it is almost unnecessary , mama. ' And notwithstanding all the frowns and winks with which Mrs. <NAME> intimated that she was going to say something which would clench the business at once , <NAME> maintained her point by an expressive look , and for once Mrs. <NAME> was stopped upon the very brink of an oration .
1	' The great petition that I make to you ( there is another which grows out of it ) , the great supplication that I address to your merciful and gentle heart , is , that you will not disclose this to <NAME> until I am dead .
1	' Come in , ' said <NAME> .
1	However , if he won ' t lead , I can ' t follow .
1	' That ' s injury enough. ' ' I wish I could undo it , James. ' ' I wish you could and would. ' During this conversation , <NAME> had looked from one brother to the other , with pain and amazement .
1	Besides , that lonely girl with the dark hair runs in my head .
1	A bran-new <NAME> , redolent of fresh mortar and size , and fronting nothing at all , had taken for its sign The <NAME> ; but that might be rash enterprise -- and then it hoped to sell drink to the workmen .
1	Have I bought and sold with you , and helped you in my way of business , schoolboy , sneak , and what not , and do you tell me to go along ?
1	" Now , <NAME> , " he began , " the word I have to say relates to <NAME> . "
1	how to know the charm in its beginning !
1	When I had gone down-stairs , I turned back that I might be a little bit more company to him yet , and looked in at the door , and said , " Father dear , shall I take <NAME> ? " <NAME> shook his head and said , " No , <NAME> , no ; take nothing that ' s known to be mine , my darling ; " and I left him sitting by the fire .
1	" Us two being now alone , " resumed <NAME> , " and me having the intentions and abilities to stay not many minutes more , I will now conclude -- leastways begin -- to mention what have led to my having had the present honor .
1	Show me some way through the world -- some humble path that I may take alone , and labour in , and sometimes think of you as one who will protect and care for me as for a sister !
1	There was a good fire in the room , and a breathless smell of warm black crape -- I did not know what the smell was then , but I know now .
1	Do you remember one night when I came with <NAME> to your lodging in <NAME> ?
1	' That night I almost gave up my mystery , though I suspected no one , could offer no information , knew absolutely nothing save that the murdered man was not I , but <NAME> .
1	The cat expands her wicked mouth and snarls at him .
1	Presently , there stalked into this apartment , a grim old <NAME> , with eyes as hard , and dull , and cold , as the great round metal buttons on his coat and waistcoat ; a sort of calm goblin .
1	Gentlemen , we ' ve port , sherry , cigars , and most excellent champagne .
1	I ' m quick to take this fright , I know , and my head is summ ' at light with wearying and watching. ' ' There , there , there ! ' returned <NAME> .
1	I had never known before how short life really was and into how small a space the mind could put it .
1	But , it beckoned him back in his sleep , and showed itself in shining forms .
1	There was a guard in the hut , and they challenged , and the sergeant answered .
1	But the turnpike-man gave him a meal of bread and cheese ; and the old lady , who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part of the earth , took pity upon the poor orphan , and gave him what little she could afford -- and more -- with such kind and gentle words , and such tears of sympathy and compassion , that they sank deeper into <NAME> 's soul , than all the sufferings he had ever undergone .
1	The rest of the <NAME> property being left to <NAME> ' s father , I could at any time , without unsettling more than the two sums , have made a pretence of finding it .
1	But I expect a judgment .
1	' Do stop all night ! ' ' I couldn ' t indeed , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , who was almost dead from nausea and the closeness of the room .
1	" No , I do n't say that it was so , mother , but that I made it out to be so .
1	Also how she had seen a countess and a lord some days before , and how the lord " was much about as tall as <NAME> ; " at which <NAME> pulled up his collars so high that you could n't have seen his head if you had been there .
1	But , does <NAME> feel still , as on the night when she knew that Mr Dombey would return to offer his alliance , that <NAME> knows her thoroughly , and reads her right , and that she is more degraded by his knowledge of her , than by aught else ?
1	' No , <NAME> ' s-delight , ' said <NAME> , ' I am not afeard .
1	' Ye-yes ; oh , yes , ' replied <NAME> .
1	Two persons. ' ' To be sure , they didn ' t buy anything , ' cried the boy .
1	Nor did she feel safe until she had set a mile or two of by-road between herself and the marketplace , and had crept into a copse , like a hunted animal , to hide and recover breath .
1	I would not lose her now , for all the treasures of the world .
1	It is she who should reproach ; not I .
1	Your sex have such a surprising animosity against one another when you do differ .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , aunt ; my friend <NAME> whom I have spoken to you about , regarding -- you know , aunt. ' And here <NAME> , who was not at the moment extraordinarily sober , added the word ' <NAME> , ' in what was meant to be a whisper , but which was an especially audible and distinct tone of speech which nobody could avoid hearing , if anybody were so disposed .
1	After dinner , her son took his turn ; and when <NAME> , himself , and I were left alone together , leered at me , and writhed until I could hardly bear it .
1	so do I. I see it all afore me , upon my soul I do , <NAME> .
1	' Help your mother to get breakfast , <NAME> .
1	The candle was drawn back , and the face disappeared .
1	' No , not all of you , ' said the strange man emphatically .
1	<NAME> ' t suppose that I complain about that , because I always said to myself , " It is very natural ; poor dear <NAME> is making his way in the world , and has a wife to tell his cares and troubles to , and children now to play about him , so God bless him and them , and send we may all meet together one day where we shall part no more. " But what do you think , <NAME> , ' said the miniature painter , brightening up and clapping her hands , ' of that very same brother coming up to <NAME> at last , and never resting till he found me out ; what do you think of his coming here and sitting down in that very chair , and crying like a child because he was so glad to see me -- what do you think of his insisting on taking me down all the way into the country to his own house ( quite a sumptuous place , <NAME> , with a large garden and I don ' t know how many fields , and a man in livery waiting at table , and cows and horses and pigs and I don ' t know what besides ) , and making me stay a whole month , and pressing me to stop there all my life -- yes , all my life -- and so did his wife , and so did the children -- and there were four of them , and one , the eldest girl of all , they -- they had named her after me eight good years before , they had indeed .
1	The speeches , judging from the little I could hear of them , were certainly adapted to the occasion , as having that degree of relationship to cold water which wet blankets may claim : but the main thing was the conduct and appearance of the audience throughout the day ; and that was admirable and full of promise .
1	He stood for a moment at his own hall door , looking sedately at the elegant equipage as it rattled away .
1	There an ' t another chap in the school but that boy as would have died exactly at the end of the quarter : taking it out of me to the very last , and then carrying his spite to the utmost extremity .
1	But as the Jew , looking back , waved his hand to intimate that he preferred being alone ; and , moreover , as the little man could not very easily disengage himself from the chair ; the sign of the <NAME> was , for a time , bereft of the advantage of <NAME> 's presence .
1	This was said in such a hearty tone , and the voice was so exactly what it should have been from such a speaker , and there was such a cordiality in the manner , that <NAME> was emboldened to speak again .
1	The idea ! ' said Mrs. Nickleby , drawing herself up , ' niece to the <NAME> of Paving ! ' ' Pray , mama , come away ! ' whispered <NAME> .
1	' You appear to feel it so , ' rejoined <NAME> , smiling at the clerk , who was literally red-hot .
1	Suddenly he stood still , and asked <NAME> point-blank if he knew where she was ?
1	But really , when I hear it remarked in several companies , and in very good company , that however worthy of a foreigner , it is not worthy of the spirit of an Englishman to remain in the <NAME> when the glorious liberties of his island home admit of his removal to the <NAME> , I thought I would depart from the narrow professional line marked out to me , and mention it .
1	' Ha , ha ! ' cried Mr Slum , ' you ' re giving way , you ' re coming down .
1	" What do you mean ? " said I , half suspecting him to be mad .
1	' It strikes you in the same light , ' said <NAME> , with perfect calmness .
1	' Perhaps not , ' said <NAME> ; ' and you bring me back to the question , with an apology for digressing .
1	My brother was a thoughtless , inconsiderate man , Mrs. Nickleby , and nobody , I am sure , can have better reason to feel that , than you. ' This appeal set the widow upon thinking that perhaps she might have made a more successful venture with her one thousand pounds , and then she began to reflect what a comfortable sum it would have been just then ; which dismal thoughts made her tears flow faster , and in the excess of these griefs she ( being a well-meaning woman enough , but weak withal ) fell first to deploring her hard fate , and then to remarking , with many sobs , that to be sure she had been a slave to poor <NAME> , and had often told him she might have married better ( as indeed she had , very often ) , and that she never knew in his lifetime how the money went , but that if he had confided in her they might all have been better off that day ; with other bitter recollections common to most married ladies , either during their coverture , or afterwards , or at both periods .
1	That night I knew he had a false and thankless heart .
1	' As I ' ve told you , <NAME> , I ' ve the best of friends .
1	" Do n't scold the old lady .
1	The lamps looked pale , and shook as if they were cold .
1	<NAME> did not see that ; but felt it incumbent on her to continue talking .
1	The light cart in which the <NAME> usually made his perambulations being gaily dressed with flags and streamers , and the <NAME> placed therein , contemplating the miniature of his beloved as usual , <NAME> was accommodated with a seat beside him , decorated with artificial flowers , and in this state and ceremony rode slowly through the town every morning , dispersing handbills from a basket , to the sound of drum and trumpet .
1	Her tears sprung forth beneath it , as she sunk upon her knees , and laid her aching head and streaming hair upon the pillow by its side .
1	The old lime-tree walk was like green cloisters , the very shadows of the cherry-trees and apple-trees were heavy with fruit , the gooseberry-bushes were so laden that their branches arched and rested on the earth , the strawberries and raspberries grew in like profusion , and the peaches basked by the hundred on the wall .
1	But first she searched her pocket and found that her money was all gone -- not a sixpence remained .
1	' You ' ll excuse my saying , sir , ' returned my aunt , ' that I think it would have been a much better and happier thing if you had left that poor child alone. ' ' I so far agree with what <NAME> has remarked , ' observed <NAME> , bridling , ' that I consider our lamented Clara to have been , in all essential respects , a mere child. ' ' It is a comfort to you and me , ma ' am , ' said my aunt , ' who are getting on in life , and are not likely to be made unhappy by our personal attractions , that nobody can say the same of us. ' ' No doubt ! ' returned <NAME> , though , I thought , not with a very ready or gracious assent .
1	It was the momentary yielding of a nature that had been disappointed from the dawn of its perceptions , but had not quite given up all its hopeful yearnings yet .
1	'Well , and what if he did , you little ungrateful wretch ? '
1	Not go as I have said ? "
1	But <NAME> couldn ' t get happily out of it .
1	Does she know your son ? ' ' <NAME> up together , sir , ' said <NAME> .
1	' The monk -- even the monk -- could bear with some grief here ; for it was long since these sisters had met , and there were furrows in their blanched faces which years could never plough .
1	I was a good-enough-tempered man once , I believe .
1	<NAME> reviving the notion of the ball , would be scouted as a malignant idiot .
1	' So your name ' s <NAME> , eh ? ' said <NAME> .
1	' There is abundance of incident , sprightly dialogue , strongly-marked characters -- ' ' -- All unavailing without a strict observance of the unities , sir , ' returned <NAME> .
1	Six of those last-named little promissory notes , all due on the same day , <NAME> , and all intrusted to me ! ' ' It ' s very gratifying , isn ' t it ? ' said <NAME> , holding his plate for some more minced veal .
1	You see I am informed of the circumstances ? " " Such is the fact , certainly , " said <NAME> .
1	' I wished you to see the <NAME> for yourself , <NAME> , that you might judge whether I ' m a liar ; and now I ' ll see <NAME> ' s window for myself , that we may know whether he ' s at home. ' With that , he crept away .
1	' How his ideas flow , don ' t they ? ' ' Wonderful , ' replied <NAME> ; ' they comes a-pouring out , knocking each other ' s heads so fast , that they seems to stun one another ; you hardly know what he ' s arter , do you ? ' That ' s the great merit of his style of speaking , ' rejoined <NAME> .
1	' In-deed ! ' rejoined <NAME> , cringing excessively .
1	" I am , " said <NAME> ; " but it 's a secret. " I assured him of my keeping the secret , and begged to be favored with further particulars .
1	It was the figure of an old man with a bowed head , wearing a large brimmed low-crowned hat , and a long-skirted coat .
1	' Gentlemen , ' said the coach-horser , ' rather than disturb the harmony of this delightful occasion , perhaps <NAME> will oblige the company. ' ' Raly , gentlemen , ' said <NAME> , ' I ' m not wery much in the habit o ' singin ' without the instrument ; but anythin ' for a quiet life , as the man said wen he took the sitivation at the lighthouse. ' With this prelude , <NAME> burst at once into the following wild and beautiful legend , which , under the impression that it is not generally known , we take the liberty of quoting .
1	Hold me , somebody , while I laugh it out . '
1	The warm blaze alone defied it , and leaped and sparkled merrily .
1	The lawn , the soft , smooth slope , the flower-garden , the clumps of trees where graceful forms of ash and willow are not wanting , the conservatory , the rustic verandah with sweet-smelling creeping plants entwined about the pillars , the simple exterior of the house , the well-ordered offices , though all upon the diminutive scale proper to a mere cottage , bespeak an amount of elegant comfort within , that might serve for a palace .
1	" And that same man , remember , " pursued the gentleman , throwing his finger at <NAME> heavily , -- " that same man might be summoned as a juryman upon this very trial , and , having thus deeply committed himself , might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon his pillow , after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly try the issue joined between Our Sovereign Lord the King and the prisoner at the bar , and would a true verdict give according to the evidence , so help him God ! " We were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate <NAME> had gone too far , and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet time .
1	<NAME> had given me his arm and was taking me away when <NAME> came up .
1	I will if I can .
1	It came upon him in a moment of inspiration , as he was smoking an early pipe in <NAME> Place after breakfast ; and it was worthy of the tobacco .
1	' I play my game to the end in spite of words ; and Death of my Body and Death of my Soul !
1	' Not a very old prisoner _that_ !
1	that ' s all , is it ? ' said <NAME> .
1	That , hereupon he had ascertained , through the registers on the table , that his son-in-law was among the living prisoners , and had pleaded hard to the <NAME> -- of whom some members were asleep and some awake , some dirty with murder and some clean , some sober and some not -- for his life and liberty .
1	' Isn ' t it ? ' Mr <NAME> acquiesced ; ' but I want one ; and I know you have got several little wedding keepsakes about , with scissors and tweezers and such things in them .
1	Looking round , he beholds the young man of the name of <NAME> , much discomfited and not presenting a very impressive letter of introduction in his manner and appearance .
1	<NAME> has lighted his lantern , by drawing from the cold , hard wall a spark of that mysterious fire which lurks in everything , and , guided by this speck , they clamber up among the cobwebs and the dust .
1	What was <NAME> ' s affright and wonder when , at sight of her , with her tearful face , and outstretched arms , <NAME> recoiled and shrieked !
1	' Rather cool in a Secretary -- and <NAME> ' s lodger -- to make me the subject of his jealousy ! ' That <NAME> ' s daughter should be so contemptuous of Pa ' s lodger was odd ; but there were odder anomalies than that in the mind of the spoilt girl : spoilt first by poverty , and then by wealth .
1	' You talk big , you do , but things look pretty black against yourself , to my thinking .
1	" Mrs. <NAME> has not the appearance , <NAME> , of a lady who has had two former husbands ? "
1	But do n't you fret yourself on that score .
1	<NAME> will be given before you as to the circumstances attending that death , and you will give your verdict according to the -- skittles ; they must be stopped , you know , beadle ! -- evidence , and not according to anything else .
1	says <NAME> , greedily curious .
1	Perhaps you wished to speak to me , sir. ' ' No , sir , I didn ' t do that , either. ' ' Perhaps you may have nothing to say to me now , sir , ' said Mr Cheggs fiercely .
1	<NAME> <NAME> turns up the gas and coughs behind his hand , modestly anticipating profit .
1	I had no apprehension whatever of my real danger ; but I was conscious that there might be danger for others , if others were compromised by possessing the knowledge that I possessed .
1	And I am ashamed of you , sir , ' said Mrs. <NAME> , lastly , ' for your slanders and suspicions .
1	' Oh , no , I ' m sure it wouldn ' t , ' replied the clerk , moving a little more into the centre of the doorway .
1	he cried impatiently , stamping his foot upon the ground .
1	A maid of honour of the court of Charles the <NAME> , with large round eyes ( and other charms to correspond ) , seems to bathe in glowing water , and it ripples as it glows .
1	Only I ' ll take it as a favour if you ' ll part company for the present .
1	I saw , directly , in his mother ' s face , that she knew from himself what he had done .
1	Come on , and do n't stand preaching there . '
1	' Why couldn ' t you let me be ! ' said <NAME> , ' when I was contented ?
1	As he now appeared in his doorway , towelling his hands , <NAME> got on his great-coat and stood by to snuff out the candles .
1	' I couldn ' t help it. ' ' Couldn ' t help it ! ' cried <NAME> .
1	Every night my Lady casually asks her maid , " Is <NAME> come ? "
1	' And you have a distance before you , and will walk faster without me. ' Being by this time close to <NAME> , they resolved , in consequence , to take that way over the <NAME> , and they left her ; <NAME> giving her his hand at parting , and she thanking him for his care of her brother .
1	I am in a counting-house , and looking about me. " " Is a counting-house profitable ? " I asked .
1	The last I saw of him , his head was bent over his knee and he was working hard at his fetter , muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his leg .
1	Everything of father ' s had gone wrong that night , and he hadn ' t pleased the public at all .
1	' Stay here of course , ' the child had said in answer to my question , ' I always do ! ' What could take him from home by night , and every night !
1	As if her life were an enchanted vision , there arose out of her solitude ministering thoughts , that made it fanciful and unreal .
1	I recalled , too , that the one-eyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of his being turned out .
1	We never knew a person , she wrote ; but to think that <NAME> should seem to be so different from what she had been thought to be , was a Moral ! -- that was her word .
1	The weather was warm , and the people were sitting at their doors , or strolling in their little gardens as he passed , enjoying the serenity of the evening , and their rest from labour .
1	' If you are quite determined , come ! ' But she had to take her farewell of the male part of the company yet , and every one of them had to unfold his arms ( for they all assumed the professional attitude when they found themselves near <NAME> ) , and give her a parting kiss—Master <NAME> excepted , in whose young nature there was an original flavour of the misanthrope , who was also known to have harboured matrimonial views , and who moodily withdrew .
1	At last I done it .
1	I considered , after some hours were gone , if my tears were really hard to flow now , as they seemed to be , what , in connexion with my loss , it would affect me most to think of when I drew near home -- for I was going home to the funeral .
1	' Admirably groomed , <NAME> ' -- Mr <NAME> is patting the pony -- ' does you great credit -- amazingly sleek and bright to be sure .
1	But he may tell the truth , for his own purpose , and for this occasion only. ' ' It doesn ' t look like it. ' ' HE doesn ' t , ' said <NAME> .
1	' Come , sir , ' she said , with a cruel pleasure in repeating the stab , ' I will be as open with you as you can desire .
1	Mr <NAME> sat on a stool with a foot on the rail of another stool , and his hat on .
1	The younger brother stood apart .
1	The grass was green above the dead boy ' s grave , and trodden by feet so small and light , that not a daisy drooped its head beneath their pressure .
1	This affords charming food for contemplation .
1	Then they fell to work upon the supper in earnest ; and there was <NAME> , that foolish <NAME> , declaring that she could not eat more than two , and wanting more pressing than you would believe before she would eat four : though her mother and <NAME> ' s mother made up for it pretty well , and ate and laughed and enjoyed themselves so thoroughly that it did <NAME> good to see them , and made him laugh and eat likewise from strong sympathy .
1	Some time elapses in the present instance before the old gentleman is sufficiently cool to resume his discourse , and even then he mixes it up with several edifying expletives addressed to the unconscious partner of his bosom , who holds communication with nothing on earth but the trivets .
1	They sat wondering , in silence ; or , if they exchanged a few words , spoke in whispers , as if they were afraid to hear the sound of their own voices .
1	But the horses is off .
1	As I trusted that I might have sufficient influence with <NAME> to prevent her taking any very rash step if I fully accepted the confidence she was so willing to place in me , poor girl , I proposed that she and I and <NAME> should go to the academy and afterwards meet my guardian and <NAME> at <NAME> 's , whose name I now learnt for the first time .
1	I got away from him , without knowing how I did it , and mended the fire in the room where we had been together , and sat down by it , afraid to go to bed .
1	The consequence was , that <NAME> had the double mortification of being an indispensable part of the circle when <NAME> and his friends were there , and of being exposed , on that very account , to all Mrs. Wititterly ' s ill-humours and caprices when they were gone .
1	I wish her to know , and perhaps you will tell her ? ' ' Do you think , at your sister ' s age -- ' hinted <NAME> .
1	And when <NAME> regularly answered , ' No , <NAME> , nothing of the sort , ' the trembling of <NAME> ' s lip would be repeated in <NAME> ' s face , and her eyes would follow <NAME> with compassion to the door .
1	' When I was last here , ' I faltered , ' Miss <NAME> told me he was sailing here and there .
1	Changed as he is , and inexpressibly blest and thankful as I always am to know it , the old sorrowful feeling of compassion comes upon me sometimes with such strength that I want to put my arms round his neck , tell him how I love him , and cry a little on his breast .
1	It is more than probable , I think , that the gentleman may not relish my company ; and although I am the dusty figure you see , I am too proud to thrust myself into his. ' ' Lord love you , ' said the landlord , ' it ' s only <NAME> ; HE isn ' t particular. ' ' Is he not ? ' asked <NAME> , on whose mind , to tell the truth , the prospect of the savoury pudding was making some impression .
1	' Well then , the way was this .
1	Nor did he ever again face the doughty Mrs Pipchin , under <NAME> ' s roof .
1	He had nothing with him but his boat , and came on apace .
1	Confound you sit down ! ' <NAME> dropped into the chair nearest the door , and Mr <NAME> walked up and down the room ; rapidly at first ; then , more slowly .
1	I reproach myself , most bitterly , for having been so unfortunate as to cause the dissension that occurred , although I did so , I assure you , most unwittingly and heedlessly. ' ' Well ; that ' s not all you have got to say surely , ' exclaimed <NAME> as <NAME> paused .
1	People turned round and looked at him ; he made no gesture , caught nobody ' s eye , let them pass away , and others come on and be succeeded by others , and took no notice .
1	<NAME> ( who , if he had ever been an object of interest in his life , had been one that day ) accompanied them , joining sometimes one group and sometimes the other , as brother <NAME> , laying his hand upon his shoulder , bade him walk with him , or <NAME> , looking smilingly round , beckoned him to come and talk with the old friend who understood him best , and who could win a smile into his careworn face when none else could .
1	Of <NAME> laughing gaily ; and of <NAME> being so fond of Agnes that she will not be separated from her , but still keeps her hand .
1	To pass , <NAME> , from the ensign to the captain . "
1	But , the other of the two , being angry likewise , struck the man in like manner with his arm ; the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly alike , that I then first perceived them to be twin brothers .
1	It was idle to say more , so I proposed that we should join <NAME> and <NAME> , who were a little in advance , and I gave up <NAME> in despair .
1	' I have not the smallest doubt it ' s the fame of the phenomenon -- that ' s the man ; him in the great-coat and no shirt-collar .
1	Mr Feeder in a black coat was at the bottom .
1	Although she sometimes asked a question , she never seemed to expect a reply , but rambled on as if she were in the habit of doing so when no one but herself was present .
1	" ' I may as well see one real chair , as two or three complete sets of false ones , " said <NAME> , bringing out his head from under the bedclothes .
1	There is the registrar below the judge , in wig and gown ; and there are two or three maces , or petty-bags , or privy purses , or whatever they may be , in legal court suits .
1	We had a doleful parting , and when I took my place by <NAME> 's side , I felt that that was my place henceforth while he lived .
1	He drank deeply of it , and throwing his aching limbs upon the bank , sank into a delicious trance .
1	And let you never speak a word more in his favour , or you ' ll disown your own father , likewise , and what your father says of him he ' ll have to come to say of you .
1	Such d ' licious broth and wine !
1	My Lady , " in naming whom he always made a courtly gesture as if particularly to exclude her from any part in the quarrel , " is expected , I believe , daily .
1	<NAME> <NAME> had quite dignity enough for two ; supposing even that the stranger had been more familiar : so he drank his gin-and-water in silence , and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance .
1	You have been drawing pretty freely here ; your name occurs pretty often in <NAME> 's cash-book ; but you are in debt , of course ? " " I am afraid I must say yes , sir. " " You know you must say yes ; do n't you ? " said <NAME> .
1	Now , <NAME> , " -- <NAME> looked firmly at me as if he knew I was not going to agree with him ; -- " your sister is a fine figure of a woman. " I could not help looking at the fire , in an obvious state of doubt .
1	She felt she must do that , or he might suspect the truth .
1	' How goes the world this forenoon , gentlemen ?
1	There could not be fewer than five hundred people , and they were dancing like five thousand demons .
1	The latter character carried it hollow at this period of the voyage , and triumphed over the <NAME> at every meal , by inquiring where he supposed the <NAME> ( which left <NAME> a week after us ) was _now_ : and where he supposed the ' <NAME> ' steam-packet was _now_ : and what he thought of sailing vessels , as compared with steamships _now_ : and so beset his life with pestilent attacks of that kind , that he too was obliged to affect despondency , for very peace and quietude .
1	<NAME> had caught up , by the rusty nozzle , an old pair of bellows , which were just undergoing a flourish in the air preparatory to a descent upon the head of <NAME> , when <NAME> , with an earnest gesture , stayed his arm , and , taking another step in advance , came so close behind the schoolmaster that , by leaning slightly forward , he could plainly distinguish the writing which he held up to his eye .
1	The baby-preference that even I have heard of as common among children , has never had its innocent resting-place in my breast .
1	<NAME> W. had better have come here , and <NAME> too .
1	Little Dorrit with amazement , saw this , and observed that they exchanged quick looks .
1	Oliver wondered what picking the old gentleman 's pocket in play , had to do with his chances of being a great man .
1	' My pet , if you please .
1	Everybody thought he ' d gone out of town. ' ' And how was he found out at last ? ' inquired <NAME> .
1	You may have heard some account of her ? ' ' I think I have , ' he answered , ' if her name was Higden. ' ' Her name was <NAME> .
1	' And if she knew ! ' She knew that he was shaking the house by his walking to and fro ; and she declared it another of the miseries of being poor , that you couldn ' t get rid of a haunting Secretary , stump -- stump -- stumping overhead in the dark , like a Ghost .
1	There is a great crowd bearing down upon us , <NAME> , and I see them -- by the Lightning. " He added the last words , after there had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window .
1	' The fact is , ' resumed <NAME> , ' that before I left the country , where I have been for some time past , I undertook to deliver a message to you. ' ' Ay , ay ? ' said <NAME> .
1	This modesty of mine directed my attention to the marine-store shops , and such shops as <NAME> ' s , in preference to the regular dealers .
1	( I really don ' t like the notion of his going wandering at large , he is so extremely liable to be run over .
1	At the time when , to have been a tumbler in the mud of the streets , would have been a godsend to me , a prize in the lottery to me , you were at the <NAME> Opera .
1	<NAME> said it to me , but I had not spoken .
1	' Upon my soul , they ' re perfect .
1	And this was the feature of the conversation which impressed <NAME> , as a man not used to it , very disagreeably : making him doubt if it were quite right to sit there , silently hearing a great nation narrowed to such little bounds .
1	' Oh , <NAME> ' en <NAME> , <NAME> ' en <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> , making her chin rigid , and shaking it in unison with what , but for the weakness of her sex , might be described as her fist .
1	It won ' t do. ' ' No , ' said Mr Boffin , with his voice still dropped , ' it really won ' t .
1	We hope to have , before long , a board of fact , composed of commissioners of fact , who will force the people to be a people of fact , and of nothing but fact .
1	They ' ve got two children , tho we ' re thtrong in the <NAME> bithnith and the <NAME> dodge .
1	" Well ; he may be. " " Is , I assure you , " said the spy ; " though it 's not important. " " Though it 's not important , " repeated <NAME> , in the same mechanical way -- " though it 's not important -- No , it 's not important .
1	As I think the circumstances back , I hear the rain splashing on the stone pavement of the passage , which was not under cover .
1	To know what member of what brilliant and distinguished circle accomplished the brilliant and distinguished feat of joining it yesterday or contemplates the no less brilliant and distinguished feat of leaving it to-morrow gives him a thrill of joy .
1	In the autumn of the year , <NAME> and <NAME> were creeping up to the highest ridges of the Alps .
1	I had my box brought alongside me in a barrow. " " Are you here for good ? " " I ai n't here for harm , young master , I suppose ? " I was not so sure of that .
1	He interested you very much. ' ' Well , my dear , ' returned <NAME> , giving her a squeeze , ' it ' s kind of you to find that reason out , and I hope it may have been so , and indeed to a certain extent I believe it was so , but I am afraid not to the whole extent .
1	This old gentleman , or the <NAME> ? "
1	Now , my dear <NAME> , " drawing his arm soothingly round her waist , " I hear them moving in the next room , and <NAME> and I , as two formal folks of business , are anxious not to lose the final opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear .
1	We parted , overwhelmed with grief ; and I think <NAME> enjoyed herself completely .
1	" First , " said my guardian , " can we do anything for your personal comfort , <NAME> ? "
1	Out of the rottenness of these things , there has sprung up in <NAME> a sect of philosophers known as Transcendentalists .
1	' Any news of the young gentleman who is so important to us all ? ' asked <NAME> , with his whole regiment of teeth on parade .
1	The attention of the company was then directed , by a natural transition , to the little girl who had had the audacity to burn her hair off , and who , after receiving sundry small slaps and pushes from the more energetic of the ladies , was mercifully sent home : the ninepence , with which she was to have been rewarded , being escheated to the <NAME> family .
1	Altogether I was lost in amazement , and sat staring at her , quite oblivious , I am afraid , of the laws of politeness .
1	' You wouldn ' t mind my cutting out something while we are at tea , would you ? ' she asked her Jewish friend , with a coaxing air .
1	And yet I have exactly the same objection to both of them. ' ' Oh , <NAME> ! ' retorted <NAME> , as if she were giving him up for a bad job , as she used to give up herself .
1	<NAME> <NAME> was in great force , and looked astonishingly young .
1	Like other assemblies , these entertainments afford a fruitful topic of conversation among the ladies for some days ; and the gentlemen are so anxious to shine on these occasions , that they have been sometimes found ' practising their steps ' in private , to cut a more distinguished figure in the dance .
1	<NAME> , " said <NAME> , " only cried and said he hoped we might get on better than he and <NAME> had got on .
1	She was hurt too , at the same time , and lay insensible for some days ; bright as her eyes are , now .
1	The countenance of <NAME> fell , and anxiety overspread his features .
1	It seems to strike your fancy , dear . '
1	The expected guests are rather select than numerous , being <NAME> and Mrs. Chadband and no more .
1	And -- if you 'll excuse my saying so much -- I should hardly have thought you did yourself , sir . "
1	Do let us resolve ourselves into a <NAME> of the whole <NAME> !
1	That she should struggle against the fascinating influence of his delightful art -- delightful nature I thought it then -- did not surprise me either ; for I knew that she was sometimes jaundiced and perverse .
1	The Chief <NAME> had signified , in return , that he had no objection to look on at the most expensive thing in that way that could be done ; and the day of the dinner was now come .
1	Or " One stone terrace ( cracked ) , one gondola in distance , one <NAME> senator 's dress complete , richly embroidered white satin costume with profile portrait of <NAME> Jogg the model , one Scimitar superbly mounted in gold with jewelled handle , elaborate <NAME> dress ( very rare ) , and <NAME> . "
1	The bridegroom , to whom the pen was handed first , made a rude cross for his mark ; the bride , who came next , did the same .
1	He departed on his errand , however , and immediately returned , ushering in its object .
1	Unconscious of this prediction , <NAME> continued to occupy precisely the same ground in reference to the Doctor and to Mrs. Strong .
1	It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand ; and , in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem , had its dress trimmed with summer flowers .
1	After a delay of two or three hours , the young ladies were informed that their services would be dispensed with until further notice , and at the expiration of two days , the name of <NAME> appeared in the list of bankrupts : <NAME> received an intimation per post , on the same morning , that the business would be , in future , carried on under the name of <NAME> , and that her assistance would no longer be required -- a piece of intelligence with which Mrs. <NAME> was no sooner made acquainted , than that good lady declared she had expected it all along and cited divers unknown occasions on which she had prophesied to that precise effect .
1	' It created an immense sensation .
1	In a short restless interval of sensibility , or partial sensibility , I made out that he asked for you to be brought to sit by him .
1	" Oh , <NAME> , my dear , so much the worse , so much the worse ! "
1	' <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> in her voice of warning , ' Ma ' s chair ! ' Mr <NAME> flew to the excellent lady ' s back , and followed her up close chair in hand , as she stalked to the banquet .
1	' I couldn ' t forgive myself at such a time as this , Mr Walter , ' said <NAME> , ' and when there ' s so much serious distress to think about , if I rested hard on anyone , especially on them that little darling <NAME> speaks well of , but I may wish that the family was set to work in a stony soil to make new roads , and that <NAME> went in front , and had the pickaxe ! ' <NAME> then took breath , and went on faster than before , as if this extraordinary aspiration had relieved her .
1	I turned directly , came back , and looked again .
1	This fellow is pigeon-hearted and light-headed .
1	But she uttered no sound , and her breathing was no slower .
1	All this , I say , is yesterday ' s event .
1	Every boy was there , but every boy was afraid to speak , so <NAME> glared along the lines to assure himself ; and every eye drooped , and every head cowered down , as he did so .
1	And when we came at last to the five thousand cheeses ( canes he made it that day , I remember ) , my mother burst out crying .
1	' I mean of the foreign man , ' <NAME> explained .
1	' I can ' t bear to look at you .
1	' Ask , you dog. ' Not caring to venture within range of such missles again , the boy discreetly sent in his stead the first cause of the interruption , who now presented herself at the door .
1	<NAME> , that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground was my sister , that husband was my sister 's husband , that unborn child was their child , that brother was my brother , that father was my father , those dead are my dead , and that summons to answer for those things descends to me ! '
1	<NAME> would come , however , in spite of her , when the carrier ' s horse pleased -- and did .
1	You do me the favour to follow , and to comprehend ? ' She kept her eyes fixed upon him with a frown .
1	Ugh ! -- to prevent my crying out , and then cruelly assaulted me. ' ' With this ? ' asked <NAME> , showing the pieces of cane .
1	chatters Grandfather Smallweed , swallowing his rage .
1	We might have been a party of <NAME> , the conversation assumed such a sanguine complexion .
1	I will pray for them , and believe that they will arrive .
1	' <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> ? ' Miss <NAME> repeated as she panted from stair to stair , ' where have I heard that name ?
1	And if you were shown a flock of birds , unable to fly , and were set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage , you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers ; would you not ? " " It is true , madame. " " You have seen both dolls and birds to-day , " said <NAME> , with a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent ; " now , go home ! " <NAME> .
1	What monstrous phantoms , bred of despondency and doubt , and born and reared in solitude , have stalked upon the earth , making creation ugly , and darkening the face of <NAME> !
1	It was a harder day ' s journey than yesterday ' s , for there were long and weary hills to climb ; and in journeys , as in life , it is a great deal easier to go down hill than up .
1	I dreamt that it was this morning , and you and I had been talking as we have been this minute ; that I went upstairs , for the very purpose for which I am going now ; and that as I stretched out my hand to take <NAME> ' s , and lead her down , the floor sunk with me , and after falling from such an indescribable and tremendous height as the imagination scarcely conceives , except in dreams , I alighted in a grave. ' ' And you awoke , and found you were lying on your back , or with your head hanging over the bedside , or suffering some pain from indigestion ? ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> will read it for her , and tell her what to do .
1	<NAME> <NAME> then caned <NAME> for being discovered in tears , instead of cheers , on account of <NAME> ' s departure ; and went back to his sofa , or his bed , or wherever he had come from .
1	As the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness , he endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then ; so he listened attentively to a great many stories she told him , about an amiable and handsome daughter of hers , who was married to an amiable and handsome man , and lived in the country ; and about a son , who was clerk to a merchant in the <NAME> <NAME> ; and who was , also , such a good young man , and wrote such dutiful letters home four times a-year , that it brought the tears into her eyes to talk about them .
1	The person who does copying . "
1	I ha ' dun ' t not once , not twice—twenty time ! ' Every line in his face deepened as he said it , and put in its affecting evidence of the suffering he had undergone .
1	' Over and over again. ' ' Just like me !
1	It shall be paid thee back with gallant interest one day , but all the money that comes into thy hands , must be mine -- not for myself , but to use for thee .
1	When we had been there half an hour or so , the case in progress -- if I may use a phrase so ridiculous in such a connexion -- seemed to die out of its own vapidity , without coming , or being by anybody expected to come , to any result .
1	To all appearance , almost in the dark : I have done all I could do to be lost .
1	This is marriage , <NAME> ; and <NAME> bless you both , in it , for a pair of babes in the wood as you are ! ' My aunt said this in a sprightly way , and gave me a kiss to ratify the blessing .
1	As soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was shot with gray , I got up and went downstairs ; every board upon the way , and every crack in every board calling after me , " Stop thief ! " and " Get up , Mrs. Joe ! " In the pantry , which was far more abundantly supplied than usual , owing to the season , I was very much alarmed by a hare hanging up by the heels , whom I rather thought I caught , when my back was half turned , winking .
1	" Good day , citizeness. " " Good day , citizen. " This mode of address was now prescribed by decree .
1	I am not the dirt under <NAME> ' s feet , yet -- not quite yet , ' said <NAME> , as if she expected to become so , about the day after to-morrow .
1	Arrived at the usurer ' s house , he found the windows close shut , the dingy blinds drawn down ; all was silent , melancholy , and deserted .
1	<NAME> has no such advantage .
1	Mr <NAME> came and sat down on the other side of her , and she felt the fraternal railing come behind her , and apparently stretch on to include <NAME> .
1	<NAME> stood arrested on the spot , and if he had awakened then , must have remained there .
1	Mrs. Bumble , seeing at a glance , that the decisive moment had now arrived , and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or other , must necessarily be final and conclusive , no sooner heard this allusion to the dead and gone , than she dropped into a chair , and with a loud scream that <NAME> was a hard-hearted brute , fell into a paroxysm of tears .
1	He was pinched in , and swelled out , and got up , and strapped down , as much as he could possibly bear .
1	They never could have led a happy life together ; but nothing could have made it more unhappy , than the wilful and determined warfare of such elements .
1	' You know forty-seven songs , ' said the man , with a gravity which admitted of no altercation on the subject .
1	Would you be so good as look arter her , <NAME> , for a minute ? ' Mrs. Gummidge nodded and disappeared .
1	Among the wretched creatures before him whom he must single out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had been an offender against the laws ; who , after repeated imprisonments and punishments , had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of years ; and who , under circumstances of great violence and daring , had made his escape and been re-sentenced to exile for life .
1	No man spoke , but the steersman held up his hand , and all softly backed water , and kept the boat straight and true before it .
1	' He stands up to you like -- like a -- why I don ' t know what he don ' t stand up to you like .
1	Take it ! ' The old woman uttered a moan as the money was restored , but without in any other way opposing its restoration , hobbled at her daughter ' s side out of the yard , and along the by-street upon which it opened .
1	'You will , ' said <NAME> , after a pause , 'take some money from me , which may enable you to live without dishonesty -- at all events until we meet again ? '
1	Three buck shots of a heavy load , took effect ; one going through his mouth , one into the brain , and another probably in or near the brain ; all going into the back part of the neck and head .
1	We desire that , too ; that he may not by any chance be made her prey again .
1	I hardly understand you. ' ' What will you take to be paid out ? ' said the butcher .
1	For what 's a door-chain when she 's got one always up ?
1	And with that , <NAME> would utter a melodious chirrup , and cry ' <NAME> ; ' and <NAME> , who , for any sign of life he had previously given , might have been a wooden or stuffed representation of a blackbird indifferently executed , would come to the side of the cage in three small jumps , and , thrusting his bill between the bars , turn his sightless head towards his old master -- and at that moment it would be very difficult to determine which of the two was the happier , the bird or <NAME> .
1	They bore the trying spectacle in silence , until the mysterious visitor was at a safe distance ; when they burst into pebbles and yells , and likewise into reviling dances , and in all respects buried the pipe of peace with so many savage ceremonies , that , if Mr <NAME> had been the chief of the Cripplewayboo tribe with his war-paint on , they could scarcely have done greater justice to their education .
1	' Very sensitive ; that ' s a pity .
1	We are to be married whenever we can , and then I shall go to Pa at the office and write to <NAME> .
1	You may depend upon it , it would have a superb effect . '
1	As to our table , you wo n't find that bad , I hope , for it will be supplied from our coffee-house here , and ( it is only right I should add ) at your expense , such being <NAME> 's directions .
1	<NAME> , I beg your pardon ; this is my friend <NAME> .
1	I neither wish to spare myself nor to be spared .
1	' And Mr Sloppy , whenever you come to my house , be sure you never go away without having had a good dinner of meat , beer , vegetables , and pudding. ' This still further brightened the face of affairs ; for , the highly sympathetic <NAME> , first broadly staring and grinning , and then roaring with laughter , <NAME> and <NAME> followed suit , and <NAME> trumped the trick .
1	' <NAME> has gone to get a book or two he wants , and will probably be back before me .
1	There were also an elderly lady from the back-parlour , and one more young lady , who , next to the collector , perhaps was the great lion of the party , being the daughter of a theatrical fireman , who ' went on ' in the pantomime , and had the greatest turn for the stage that was ever known , being able to sing and recite in a manner that brought the tears into Mrs. <NAME> ' s eyes .
1	I would n't lend anybody a sixpence. " " Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances , I should say. " " You should say , " repeated <NAME> .
1	In the grammar of Mrs Merdle ' s verbs on this momentous subject , there was only one mood , the <NAME> ; and that <NAME> had only one Tense , the Present .
1	It may not be the same . '
1	' But I am in the humour , and I must be humoured , <NAME> , because after all I am a poor little thing , and have had a hard day with my bad child .
1	'Well , ' said the robber , grasping <NAME> 's wrist , and putting the barrel so close to his temple that they touched ; at which moment the boy could not repress a start ; 'if you speak a word when you 're out o'doors with me , except when I speak to you , that loading will be in your head without notice .
1	The barrier between Mr Dombey and his wife was not weakened by time .
1	Then he asked me to fetch some of the stuff he used , for the little hurt he had had , and to get it at the best place , which was at the other end of town from there ; and then , after kissing me again , he let me go .
1	' You , you won ' t be angry with me now .
1	He has been doing so ever since it fell dark .
1	<NAME> , no less steadily , kept them in sight .
1	Another game , with a similar result , was followed by a revoke from the unlucky <NAME> ; on which the fat gentleman burst into a state of high personal excitement which lasted until the conclusion of the game , when he retired into a corner , and remained perfectly mute for one hour and twenty-seven minutes ; at the end of which time he emerged from his retirement , and offered <NAME> a pinch of snuff with the air of a man who had made up his mind to a <NAME> forgiveness of injuries sustained .
1	It ' s no fun , ' said <NAME> , ' unless we take them by surprise .
1	" Why , my darling , " said I , " what a goose you must take me for !
1	says the master , walking towards him without his coat and waistcoat , and looking more soldierly than ever in his braces .
1	The stream , like a sullied looking-glass in a gloomy place , reflected the clouds heavily ; and the low banks leaned over here and there , as if they were half curious , and half afraid , to see their darkening pictures in the water .
1	Mr Dombey goes upon a journey 21 .
1	<NAME> <NAME> got his arm securely round the daughter 's waist , and held her ; for he felt that she was sinking .
1	" Better to be a rational creature , " he added then , after ringing a small bell on the table , " and accept your natural destiny .
1	Do you know what would become of the <NAME> in that case ?
1	" I am sure I am much obliged to you for your good opinion , " returns the stationer with his cough of modesty , " but -- " " That 's what YOU are , you know , " says <NAME> .
1	" Why , what 'll you do with a half-holiday , if you get it ? " said <NAME> .
1	' Well , <NAME> , sir , ' said brother <NAME> , who was always spokesman , ' now the young folks are happy , sir. ' ' You didn ' t keep ' em in suspense as long as you said you would , though , ' returned <NAME> , archly .
1	' You are thoughtful today , <NAME> ! ' ' Agnes , shall I tell you what about ?
1	He may kill me for it if he likes , or if he dares , but if I am here I 'll give him up .
1	You will revive yet. " ' " Never again , <NAME> ; never again , " said the dying woman .
1	You ' ll know our light porter again ? ' ' Yes , sure , ' said <NAME> .
1	' Come in , come in , whoever you be : I can ' t see you till I light a match , yet I seem to know the sound of your speaking .
1	' You had better refresh your memory , sir , ' said <NAME> , with a threatening look .
1	<NAME> is the best authority possible , sir , " said <NAME> , " and I have it from <NAME> 's communication to a friend and brother Sheep over a bottle of wine , that the arrest has taken place .
1	' If ever one mortal had reason to be penetrated with love and reverence for another : with such attachment as would make the hardest service in his behalf a pleasure and delight : with such grateful recollections as must rouse the utmost zeal and fidelity of his nature : those are the feelings which I should entertain for you , and do , from my heart and soul , believe me ! ' ' I do believe you , ' replied the old gentleman , ' and I am happy in the belief .
1	Never shall I forget the lonely sensation of first lying down , without a roof above my head !
1	' I am the brother of the young lady who has been the subject of conversation here , ' said <NAME> .
1	Could the man <NAME> , in a moment of remorse , have divulged some secret conspiracy for his assassination ?
1	His eyebrows , which had been in the highest degree portentous , smoothed their rugged bristling aspect , and became serene ; his eyes , which had been nearly closed in the severity of his mental exercise , opened freely ; a smile which had been at first but three specks -- one at the right-hand corner of his mouth , and one at the corner of each eye -- gradually overspread his whole face , and , rippling up into his forehead , lifted the glazed hat : as if that too had been aground with <NAME> , and were now , like him , happily afloat again .
1	As it met his , the nose came down over the moustache and the moustache went up under the nose .
1	<NAME> ' s the matter ? ' ' Aha ! ' replied the old gentleman , ' I began to be afeerd that you ' d gone for a walk round the <NAME> , Sammy. ' ' Come , ' said <NAME> , ' none o ' them taunts agin the wictim o ' avarice , and come off that ' ere step .
1	A minute ' s silence , and he murmured the burden of some roaring song .
1	' And yet with such a true and gallant spirit , ' pursued <NAME> .
1	Our people grumbled at this , as people do in such cases ; but suffered the boat to be towed off with the whole freight aboard nevertheless ; and away we went down the canal .
1	I have no other trust , than that I have been with her since she came home , and that she has given me her confidence .
1	' That sort of people. -- -Are they really animals and clods , and beings of another order ?
1	He replied to their salutations in the same way ; but bestowed no closer recognition until he reached the further end of the alley ; when he stopped , to address a salesman of small stature , who had squeezed as much of his person into a child 's chair as the chair would hold , and was smoking a pipe at his warehouse door .
1	On the Sunday morning we all set forth to walk to the little church in the park .
1	' Oh , <NAME> , when ? ' ' Now , ' said <NAME> .
1	' <NAME> , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> senior , taking off his upper coat , and seating himself with his accustomed gravity .
1	<NAME> <NAME> has wealthy friends who would coin their very hearts to save her in such a strait as this .
1	' Then where _are_ you going , pretty one ? ' ' Now I come to think of it , I don ' t know , ' said <NAME> .
1	But though her glance took sharp cognizance of the sleeper , it was sharp too for the waking man ; and when he touched her hand with his , and in spite of all his caution , made a chinking , golden sound , it was as bright and greedy as a raven ' s .
1	<NAME> , and gloomy , and black , in truth it was , and sullen and dark were the rooms , once so bustling with life and enterprise .
1	Besides which , she is so charmingly ugly , ' relapsing into languor .
1	In fact , Mrs. <NAME> was about to solace herself with a cup of tea .
1	It is most unfortunate for me that I wish you to see me at my best , and that I know you see me at my worst. ' She moved slowly on when he paused , and he moved slowly on beside her .
1	The matron looked , from the little kettle , to the beadle , who was moving towards the door ; and as the beadle coughed , preparatory to bidding her good-night , bashfully inquired whether -- whether he would n't take a cup of tea ?
1	Upon my word and honour I think you can hardly know your own feelings better than I imagine them .
1	These five year I ha ' paid her .
1	More impracticable men and boys persist in walking into <NAME> 's sleep and terrifying him with unaccountable questions , so that often when the cock at the little dairy in <NAME> Street breaks out in his usual absurd way about the morning , <NAME> finds himself in a crisis of nightmare , with his little woman shaking him and saying " What 's the matter with the man ! "
1	Mrs <NAME> attributed certain views of furthering the marriage to my friend here , in conversation with me before it took place ; and I endeavoured to undeceive her .
1	I was very hot , and the voice I heard was very unlike mine , when I said , ' It is , sir ! ' ' If I am not mistaken , ' said <NAME> , as <NAME> brought a parcel of letters out of her reticule , tied round with the dearest bit of blue ribbon , ' those are also from your pen , <NAME> ? ' I took them from her with a most desolate sensation ; and , glancing at such phrases at the top , as ' My ever dearest and own Dora , ' ' My best beloved angel , ' ' My blessed one for ever , ' and the like , blushed deeply , and inclined my head .
1	' " During the year she has attained great dexterity in the use of the manual alphabet of the deaf mutes ; and she spells out the words and sentences which she knows , so fast and so deftly , that only those accustomed to this language can follow with the eye the rapid motions of her fingers .
1	Then , confounding that time with the later days of the many footsteps , he would be amazed at their number , and begin to count them as he followed her .
1	To whom it is no matter what living waters run high or low , reflect the heavenly lights and darknesses , produce their little growth of weeds and flowers , turn here , turn there , are noisy or still , are troubled or at rest , for their course has one sure termination , though their sources and devices are many .
1	" I can not consent to hear another word , sir , " I returned , " Unless you get up from the carpet directly and go and sit down at the table as you ought to do if you have any sense at all . "
1	As it rested on one picture in particular , <NAME> hardly seemed to breathe , his sidelong scrutiny was so cat-like and vigilant , but the eye of his great chief passed from that , as from the others , and appeared no more impressed by it than by the rest .
1	As the whispers became louder , which they did from that time every minute , they became more threatening .
1	' I surprise you , sir ? ' he said , with a quick change to a submissive manner .
1	But he ' s worth a dozen men , and I let him say of me whatever he likes in consequence -- he knows that. ' In return for this complimentary address , a very gruff hoarse voice bade Mr Groves ' hold his noise and light a candle. ' And the same voice remarked that the same gentleman ' needn ' t waste his breath in brag , for most people knew pretty well what sort of stuff he was made of. ' ' Nell , they ' re -- they ' re playing cards , ' whispered the old man , suddenly interested .
1	<NAME> has been out a dozen times , looking for you , <NAME> .
1	cried the Dodger at this moment , ' I heard the tinkler . '
1	And he and <NAME> led the way .
1	His protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they proceeded in their search without making any discovery ; and , now , he gave vent to several very grim laughs , and confessed it could only have been his excited imagination .
1	Mr <NAME> replied by taking from his pocket a small and very greasy parcel , slowly unfolding it , and displaying a little slab of plum-cake extremely indigestible in appearance , and bordered with a paste of white sugar an inch and a half deep .
1	' Leave your nephew here , for the present .
1	This , my young companion -- ' ' Stop a bit , ' interposed <NAME> .
1	" Oh , yes , you tell me so , " returns <NAME> .
1	For yourself , unfortunate girl , orphaned and degraded from the first of these evil anniversaries , pray daily that the sins of others be not visited upon your head , according to what is written .
1	Yes , I always say so , ' Mrs. Gradgrind cried , with unexpected quickness .
1	You have n't got the family face . "
1	' A joke is wasted upon me , sir .
1	<NAME> and mould began to lurk in closets .
1	He took her home , and stayed till she was recovered ; and , having no money to pay the coach , went back in state to <NAME> , bidding the driver ( for it was Saturday night ) wait at the door while he went in for ' change. ' ' Mr <NAME> , sir , ' said <NAME> cheerfully , ' Good evening ! ' Monstrous as <NAME> ' s tale had appeared , at first , Mr <NAME> did , that night , half suspect his affable employer of some deep villany .
1	Because I wish to see you always at your best .
1	' Look here ! ' she said , striking the scar again , with a relentless hand .
1	But looking round at the door , and seeing this dejected figure , he turns back to it , touches it with a mild hand , says ' Good night ! ' A sob is his only acknowledgment .
1	I am going home. ' ' Deed , sir ?
1	<NAME> , with his glued to <NAME> ' s countenance , ran up against the people who were walking about , and fell over little children , and stumbled against steps and railings , without appearing at all sensible of it , until <NAME> , looking stealthily up , said -- ' How do you do , <NAME> ? ' ' It _is_ him ! ' exclaimed <NAME> ; and having established <NAME> ' s identity beyond all doubt , he smote his leg , and vented his feelings in a long , shrill whistle .
1	It has not looked very long , when he sits up , chilled and shaking , slowly recovers consciousness of where he is , and makes himself ready to depart .
1	You recollect the case of the <NAME> and the <NAME> , <NAME> ? ' <NAME> intimated , by a retrospective shake of the head , that he should never forget it -- as indeed it was not likely he would , so long as it continued to be cited daily .
1	By and by , I saw him , with the majority of a lobster on his plate , eating his dinner at the feet of <NAME> !
1	I know the man , and know him to have been in communication with <NAME> before , respecting a deceased person who had given him offence .
1	I think he loves me better every day , and is kinder and more affectionate than he was the day before .
1	' When you were sitting by her , ' said I , ' you seemed to be no less her guardian angel than mine ; and you seem so now , Agnes. ' ' A poor angel , ' she returned , ' but faithful. ' The clear tone of her voice , going straight to my heart , made it natural to me to say : ' The cheerfulness that belongs to you , <NAME> ( and to no one else that ever I have seen ) , is so restored , I have observed today , that I have begun to hope you are happier at home ? ' ' I am happier in myself , ' she said ; ' I am quite cheerful and light-hearted. ' I glanced at the serene face looking upward , and thought it was the stars that made it seem so noble .
1	<NAME> ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , lost in astonishment , ' what is the meaning of this , <NAME> ?
1	They had determined not to admire <NAME> ' s picture .
1	But my younger daughter , <NAME> , rather worries and vexes my thoughts .
1	' But he is one of that family from whom you took a nurse .
1	The rolling wheels were noiseless , and the sharp ring and clatter of the horses ' hoofs , became a dull , muffled tramp .
1	Mr Gowan goes out a good deal among what is considered the best company here -- though he does not look as if he enjoyed it or liked it when he is with it -- and she sometimes accompanies him , but lately she has gone out very little .
1	Moreover it was her habit to shake her head at that wretched old boy whenever she caught his eye as he shivered and shook .
1	" My dear <NAME> , " said she , rising from her desk with her usual sweetness of temper , " these are really ridiculous preparations , though your assisting them is a proof of your kindness .
1	' <NAME> , ' said the visitor .
1	He puts it to his ears , and it whispers information ; he puts it to his lips , and it enjoins him to secrecy ; he rubs it over his nose , and it sharpens his scent ; he shakes it before a guilty man , and it charms him to his destruction .
1	" My good <NAME> , so he was .
1	It can ' t be reasoned out of his head by any powers of mine but what that he can do right by your kind lady and gentleman and do his work for me , both together .
1	And he told her the truth , too ; for his small heart swelled , and his face glowed , when he saw how much they all admired her , and how she was the beautiful little rosebud of the room .
1	If I had been his wife , I could have been the slave of his caprices for a word of love a year .
1	<NAME> , down with him , fifty fathoms down ; his struggles grew fainter and fainter , until they wholly ceased .
1	" I am at a loss , sir , " said I , " to imagine what you can have to communicate in total confidence to me , whom you have never seen but once ; but I should be very sorry to do you any injury . "
1	Still , I must confess he is not without faults , love . "
1	Consequently says he , ' And , gentlemen , when the timbers of the <NAME> of the State are unsound and the Man at the <NAME> is unskilful , would those great <NAME> , who rank among our world-famed merchant-princes -- would they insure her , gentlemen ?
1	Mr Feeder like-wise says , that if he may advise , he would recommend Mr Toots to learn the guitar , or , at least the flute ; for women like music , when you are paying your addresses to ' em , and he has found the advantage of it himself .
1	I say it ' s obstinacy , and nothing shall ever convince me that it isn ' t .
1	But if any man desire confirmation of my statement on this head , let him repair to any place in this city of <NAME> , where scattered numbers of these publications are to be found ; and there , let him form his own opinion .
1	As the sparks fell thick and bright about him , I could see his hands , and touches of his face , and could make out that he was seated and bending over the table ; but nothing more .
1	My dear friend Mr <NAME> is dying. ' The dressmaker clasped her hands , and uttered a little piteous cry .
1	I am so accustomed to the habit that I could hardly live if I relinquished it : but there ' s nothing doing , nothing doing .
1	" Do n't you be afraid of that. " <NAME> 's attention was here diverted to the door-keeper , whom he saw making his way to <NAME> , with the note in his hand .
1	If you tell me that he is dead , I am in your debt and bound to you for life .
1	' I -- I -- remember it very well indeed. ' ' <NAME> is the lady I speak of , ' said brother Charles .
1	The boarders , and the teachers , and the servants , fell back upon the stairs , and upon each other ; and never was such a screaming , and fainting , and struggling beheld .
1	" He says -- I know it 's very foolish , we are both so young -- but he says , " with a burst of tears , " that he loves me dearly , <NAME> . "
1	Do you know that you are talking to a gentleman , sir , who at one time could have bought up fifty such men as you and all you have ?
1	<NAME> <NAME> nods his sagacious head , advances it yet closer , and drops into a whisper .
1	Here one of you boys , carry that show into the barn .
1	inquired <NAME> , turning to the doctor .
1	Although <NAME> had been brought up by philosophers , he was not theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that self-preservation is the first law of nature .
1	' Cause they had both stood betwixt him and his getting his living by the sweat of his brow .
1	' It strikes me rather as a hang-MAN air , ' returned <NAME> .
1	When there came to be but two sisters left at home , the daring mind of <NAME> on the next of these occasions scaled the height of wondering with droll vexation ' what on earth Pa ever could have seen in <NAME> , to induce him to make such a little fool of himself as to ask her to have him. ' The revolving year now bringing the day round in its orderly sequence , <NAME> arrived in the <NAME> chariot to assist at the celebration .
1	Thus he staggered on , creeping , almost mechanically , between the bars of gates , or through hedge-gaps as they came in his way , until he reached a road .
1	Thank you very much. ' One other little circumstance connected with <NAME> I must not omit ; for I had reason to remember it thereafter , when all the irremediable past was rendered plain .
1	At sight of the young lady , <NAME> started and changed colour ; his heart beat violently , and he stood rooted to the spot .
1	cried the girl , pressing her hair back with her hands .
1	' The plug of life is dry , sir , and but the mud is left. ' This speech -- the style of which <NAME> attributed to <NAME> ' s recent association with theatrical characters -- not being quite explanatory , <NAME> looked as if he were about to ask another question , when <NAME> prevented him by shaking his hand mournfully , and then waving his own .
1	' If <NAME> ' s creditors will not give him time , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ' they must take the consequences ; and the sooner they bring it to an issue the better .
1	' This here sluicing night is hard lines to a man as lives on his condition. ' <NAME> proffered a glass of rum , which the <NAME> , throwing back his head , emptied into himself , as into a cask , after proposing the brief sentiment , ' Towards us ! ' Mr Toots and the Captain returning then to the parlour , and taking their seats before the fire , Mr <NAME> began : ' Mr Gills -- ' ' Awast ! ' said the <NAME> .
1	But don ' t let us stop to listen to it ; let us get away ! ' Her hurry is over as soon as they have passed out of the Close .
1	' At all events I should prepare them here for the possibility of my going away suddenly , ' said <NAME> ; ' I should lose no time in doing that. ' As the thought occurred to him , he took up his hat and hurried to the green-room .
1	Consequently , I was not prepared , at seven o ' clock next morning , to receive the following communication , dated half past nine in the evening ; a quarter of an hour after I had left him : -- ' The die is cast -- all is over .
1	He might be , or he might not be .
1	The <NAME> going round with champagne , looks very much as if HE could give them a pretty good idea how people did that , if he had a mind .
1	Em ' ly was took bad with fever , and , what is very strange to me is , -- maybe ' tis not so strange to scholars , -- the language of that country went out of her head , and she could only speak her own , that no one unnerstood .
1	' Wery well , Sir. ' ' And you will sit up , till I return. ' ' <NAME> ' nly , Sir. ' ' Take hold of my leg ; and , when I say " Over , " raise me gently. ' ' All right , sir. ' Having settled these preliminaries , <NAME> grasped the top of the wall , and gave the word ' Over , ' which was literally obeyed .
1	The only eye-sore in the whole place was another cousin of <NAME> ' s , and a brother of <NAME> , whom <NAME> called " <NAME> , " and who seemed to keep <NAME> all to himself , up in one corner of the table .
1	<NAME> <NAME> ! ' So saying , he nodded in a friendly manner , and took his leave : stopping when he had passed the outer door a little distance , and grinning with extraordinary delight .
1	<NAME> ' t be cast down. ' The face looked up at him imploringly , as he rose from wiping it , and gently replaced the coat that covered the writhing figure .
1	Doors were slamming violently , lamps were flickering or blown out , signs were rocking in their frames , the water of the kennels , wind-dispersed , flew about in drops like rain .
1	' Anybody who didn ' t know you as well as I do , my dear fellow , would say you were an accomplished courtier , ' said <NAME> .
1	Such a precious loud hymn , <NAME> , while the tea was a brewing ; such a grace , such eatin ' and drinkin ' !
1	And then they began to fish .
1	<NAME> over that there bottle ! ' Here Mr <NAME> appeared to labour under a virtuous delusion that it was his own property .
1	' Oh , how good of you !
1	You are so very violent , that really I -- ' At this instant , Mrs. <NAME> stepped hastily forward to replace the carpet , which had been kicked up in the scuffle .
1	' And who , ' said <NAME> , shuffling among his papers , ' who is the lodger ' s visitor -- not a lady visitor , I hope , eh , Mr <NAME> ?
1	' I was going there , ' said the surly man .
1	" I always give too much to ladies .
1	I am going to take out the licence .
1	I will try , then , to forgive him his share of blame .
1	Five of 'em strung up in a row , and none left to play booty , or turn white-livered ! '
1	' She ' s very fond of you , <NAME> , though not so fond as I am .
1	<NAME> avenues , that begin in nothing , and lead nowhere ; streets , mile-long , that only want houses , roads and inhabitants ; public buildings that need but a public to be complete ; and ornaments of great thoroughfares , which only lack great thoroughfares to ornament—are its leading features .
1	I tell you that the time was , when I loved him better than you ever did ! ' She stood with her bright angry eyes confronting the wide stare , and the set face ; and softened no more , when the moaning was repeated , than if the face had been a picture .
1	The men obeyed , and the two were left alone together .
1	' On the voyage , I shall endeavour , ' said <NAME> , ' occasionally to spin them a yarn ; and the melody of my son <NAME> will , I trust , be acceptable at the galley-fire .
1	' Twenty pounds per annewum , I believe , Mr Squeers ? ' ' Guineas , ' rejoined the schoolmaster , with a persuasive smile .
1	Was he coward enough to watch her , an hour afterwards , on the old well staircase , where he had once seen <NAME> in the moonlight , toiling up with <NAME> ?
1	At last , when we had passed a couple of hours or so , very agreeably , he suddenly took up his hat , and leaning over the table and looking me full in the face , said , in a low voice : " <NAME> , <NAME> , we ' ve been vara pleasant toogather , and ar ' ll spak ' my moind tiv ' ee .
1	Never let me hear him mentioned as a brother more ! ' ' Dear <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , when they were left alone , and had remained silent for some few moments .
1	' I have almost forgotten that there is anything to do in the world but to go out tossing on the sea here .
1	" If you think so , guardian , it is right . "
1	It seemed to her that she awoke after sleeping some hours , and found <NAME> not yet abed .
1	Have you , though ? ' returned <NAME> , his eyes sparkling with delight .
1	He could have laid hands upon himself for his cowardice , but it was the very shadow of his defeat , and could not be separated from it .
1	But the dead-and-gone Dedlocks take it very calmly and have never been known to object .
1	' God bless her ! ' said my aunt , ' and her husband too ! ' I echoed it , parted from my aunt , and went lightly downstairs , mounted , and rode away .
1	Let this be a warning to all young ladies to be particular in the character of the gentlemen of their choice .
1	I nevermore will see or think o ' anything that angers me , but thou , so much better than me , shalt be by th ' side on ' t .
1	' If any drop of gloom were wanting in the overflowing cup , which is now " commended " ( in the language of an immortal Writer ) to the lips of the undersigned , it would be found in the fact , that a friendly acceptance granted to the undersigned , by the before-mentioned <NAME> , for the sum Of 23l 4s 9 1/2d is over due , and is <NAME> provided for .
1	'You would serve me best , lady , ' replied the girl , wringing her hands , 'if you could take my life at once ; for I have felt more grief to think of what I am , to-night , than I ever did before , and it would be something not to die in the hell in which I have lived .
1	" As pleasantly as I could anywhere , away from you. " " You silly boy , " said <NAME> , quite composedly , " how can you talk such nonsense ?
1	She won ' t come in MY way , he says .
1	' And she has been. ' ' Well , sir , there were violent quarrels at first , I assure you , ' said <NAME> ; ' but she is quite a shadow now .
1	Everybody having eaten everything , the table was cleared in a most alarming hurry , and with great noise ; and the spirits , whereat the eyes of <NAME> glistened , being arranged in order , with water both hot and cold , the party composed themselves for conviviality ; <NAME> being stationed in a large armchair by the fireside , and the four little <NAME> disposed on a small form in front of the company with their flaxen tails towards them , and their faces to the fire ; an arrangement which was no sooner perfected , than Mrs. <NAME> was overpowered by the feelings of a mother , and fell upon the left shoulder of <NAME> dissolved in tears .
1	Where would you wish it taken from ? ' she answered , turning to him with the same enforced attention as before .
1	Mrs. <NAME> was unanimously voted into the chair , and Mrs. Rogers being stationed on her right hand , and Mrs. Raddle on her left , the meal proceeded with great merriment and success .
1	It is still Monday night. " " Thank God ! " " And you have all to-morrow , Tuesday , to rest in , " said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> <NAME> on his legs again .
1	<NAME> <NAME> had previously volunteered to go home with us and had withdrawn to dress himself for the purpose .
1	' Mr Merdle , this is -- ha -- indeed an honour .
1	Catching up the light , they made the best of their way home , at a good round trot ; and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible , the light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance , like some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was swiftly borne .
1	But , he never mentioned her as a woman .
1	' They are very like their mamma , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , majestically .
1	He had turned the course of what he said at that instant , and she remained .
1	My sister would have let him tear her to pieces , before she would have let him believe that he could make her shed a tear. ' <NAME> reviewed those mental notes of his , and was neither at all surprised to hear it , nor at all disposed to question it .
1	If any bagman of that day could have caught sight of the little neck-or-nothing sort of gig , with a clay-coloured body and red wheels , and the vixenish , ill tempered , fast- going bay mare , that looked like a cross between a butcher ' s horse and a twopenny post-office pony , he would have known at once , that this traveller could have been no other than <NAME> , of the great house of <NAME> and <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> .
1	Still the <NAME> pointed downward to the grave by which it stood .
1	' I hope the gentleman will understand that it is n't my fault , sir ? '
1	' <NAME> ' t fear me being any hindrance to you , I have no more to say , ma ' am , ' he remarked , as he moved towards the door .
1	Then , why don ' t they improve it , ma ' am !
1	All day long , little <NAME> has cried for her , and asked me , over and over again , whether <NAME> ' ly was wicked ?
1	' This is the hardest trial I have had .
1	There was something so very agreeable in being so intimate with such a waistcoat ; in being called <NAME> , in such an intimate way , by such a voice ; in being on such off-hand terms so soon , with such a pair of whiskers ; that <NAME> was uncommonly pleased with himself .
1	But if the dear fellow can ' t live there , he can ' t live there .
1	Now , you know , so very prepossessing in the lady with the veil ! "
1	Some artists , ' said <NAME> , ' keep a red coat , and charge seven-and-sixpence extra for hire and carmine ; but I don ' t do that myself , for I don ' t consider it legitimate. ' Drawing herself up , as though she plumed herself greatly upon not resorting to these lures to catch sitters , <NAME> applied herself , more intently , to her task : only raising her head occasionally , to look with unspeakable satisfaction at some touch she had just put in : and now and then giving <NAME> to understand what particular feature she was at work upon , at the moment ; ' not , ' she expressly observed , ' that you should make it up for painting , my dear , but because it ' s our custom sometimes to tell sitters what part we are upon , in order that if there ' s any particular expression they want introduced , they may throw it in , at the time , you know. ' ' And when , ' said <NAME> , after a long silence , to wit , an interval of full a minute and a half , ' when do you expect to see your uncle again ? ' ' I scarcely know ; I had expected to have seen him before now , ' replied <NAME> .
1	I hope he didn ' t catch cold , that dreadful night , Sir. ' There was a momentary look of deep slyness in <NAME> Trotter ' s eye , as he said this , which ran a thrill through <NAME> ' s clenched fist , as he burned with a desire to make a demonstration on his ribs .
1	Yes. ' ' Can you guess , ' said <NAME> , folding her small hands tight in one another , and looking at him with all the earnestness of her soul looking steadily out of her eyes , ' what I am going to ask you not to do ? ' ' I think I can .
1	I casually mentioned to <NAME> , when I had the pleasure of an interview with her the other day , ' -- with another inclination of his body -- <NAME> again -- ' that there was a vacancy here .
1	I heard him say so . '
1	6 , in the court. ' ' There is a double wallflower at <NAME> .
1	' I think it is a knock at the door , ' said <NAME> , as if there could be the smallest doubt of the fact .
1	' Very ill , <NAME> , have I been ? ' ' Dead , all but , ' replied the small servant .
1	However , he left word that you were to make yourself comfortable till he came back , and that I was to entertain you , which I shall be very glad to do. ' In proof of his extreme readiness to exert himself for the general entertainment , <NAME> drew a chair to the table as he spoke , and helping himself plentifully to the cold meat , invited <NAME> and <NAME> to follow his example .
1	" My dear , " said I , " as long as you wo n't hear me out -- " " I do n't want to hear you out . "
1	You could as soon take up and shoulder an eight and forty pounder by your own strength as turn that man when he has got a thing into his head and fixed it there .
1	He dotes upon the children to the last and remembers the commission he has undertaken for an absent friend .
1	What does she try to do ?
1	' Do you see where we are ? ' ' Yes , my love .
1	It was a happy time .
1	<NAME> left it with the landlady , and was returning to pull his master ' s boots off , after drying himself by the kitchen fire , when glancing casually through a half-opened door , he was arrested by the sight of a gentleman with a sandy head who had a large bundle of newspapers lying on the table before him , and was perusing the leading article of one with a settled sneer which curled up his nose and all other features into a majestic expression of haughty contempt .
1	He never smoked so late , and it seemed to hint to me that he wanted comforting , for some reason or other .
1	Nothing disagreeable should ever be looked at .
1	<NAME> , ' said I , bolting it out with some difficulty .
1	Stunned as I was , as weak and helpless at first as I had ever been in my sick chamber , the necessity of guarding against the danger of discovery , or even of the remotest suspicion , did me service .
1	" <NAME> , " he answered , in the same tone ; " chrisen 'd Abel. " " What were you brought up to be ? " " A warmint , dear boy. " He answered quite seriously , and used the word as if it denoted some profession .
1	She only said , ' Oh , dear , dear <NAME> !
1	Mr <NAME> ' s face was not a changeful one , and being cast in its mould of state that day , showed little other apprehension of the story , if any , than that which he expressed when he said solemnly , amidst the silence , that it was ' Very good. ' There was a rapid glance from <NAME> towards <NAME> , but otherwise she remained , externally , impassive and unconscious .
1	<NAME> , evermore. ' This , blotted with tears , was the letter .
1	His eyes were so often turned towards it , that he used his tools mechanically , and , one would have said , to very poor account .
1	<NAME> here , <NAME> , <NAME> .
1	<NAME> ' t you injured me enough already ? ' ' I have never injured you , <NAME> , wilfully. ' ' You are my brother , ' said the Manager .
1	But , he had not yet spoken to her on the subject ; the assassination at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long , long , dusty roads -- the solid stone chateau which had itself become the mere mist of a dream -- had been done a year , and he had never yet , by so much as a single spoken word , disclosed to her the state of his heart .
1	As night came on , the track grew narrower and narrower , until at last it so lost itself among the trees , that the driver seemed to find his way by instinct .
1	he says we ' re dear , ' cried the oldest and ugliest teacher .
1	Softened regrets they might be , teaching me what I had failed to learn when my younger life was all before me , but not the less regrets .
1	'Do you mean to say anything , you young shaver ? '
1	Will you tell them to send him up ? "
1	Only come to see me as if you come by chance alonger <NAME> .
1	There was poison in the house .
1	But that is not the subject on which I wish to speak with you. ' ' Oh ! ' said <NAME> .
1	His mind was evidently wandering to his old life , for he continued to mutter , without appearing conscious of their presence otherwise than as a part of his vision .
1	This did not serve him ; for , at such bantering or retort as suited the company , he was no match for <NAME> .
1	' <NAME> , ' said Mr Boffin , blowing out the light in the lantern , shutting it up , and stowing it away in the breast of his coat as before .
1	I could n't be worse off if I was a what's-his-name -- man and a brother ! "
1	You quite understand that the young lady do n't ride to-day , and that I dine at the young lady 's ? " " Quite so , sir ! " When the waiter had felt my fast-cooling teapot with the palm of his hand , and had looked imploringly at me , and had gone out , <NAME> , careful not to move the shoulder next me , took a cigar from his pocket and bit the end off , but showed no sign of stirring .
1	No , do n't ring -- I have been brought up in a sharp school and am accustomed to a variety of general practice .
1	I appeal to you , sir , ' proceeded <NAME> with increasing spirit , ' not to pursue me .
1	When she came there of an evening , she always shrunk from accepting his escort home , and ran away with me instead .
1	' There ' s Em ' ly ' s cousin , him that she was to have been married to , ' said <NAME> , rubbing his hands feebly , ' as fine a fellow as there is in <NAME> !
1	The stone on which he had first seen the goblin seated , stood bolt upright before him , and the grave at which he had worked , the night before , was not far off .
1	But , although this happy change had a visible effect on the little circle ; and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more heard in the cottage ; there was at times , an unwonted restraint upon some there : even upon Rose herself : which <NAME> could not fail to remark .
1	The honour is reciprocal , sir , as I usually say when I dramatise a book .
1	Make your own arrangements. ' ' Why , I was thinking that this evening would be a good time , <NAME> , when they are all sitting round the fire .
1	After all , the question is still where ? " " At extermination , " said madame .
1	' I have not heard it myself , not being in the way of such things , but I have been told it ' s even printed -- for private circulation -- but that ' s all over town , of course. ' ' It ' s a lie ! ' said <NAME> ; ' I tell you it ' s all a lie .
1	The expression in the forehead , which had so particularly attracted his notice , and which was now immovable , had deepened into one of pain and horror .
1	He was a very easy , pleasant fellow indeed , and his manners were exceedingly winning .
1	<NAME> in the helpless state that you see me in , is naturally anxious .
1	The name has quite escaped me .
1	A substitute for a Fire .
1	And slily he traileth along the ground , And his leaves he gently waves , As he joyously hugs and crawleth round The rich mould of dead men ' s graves .
1	But this latter <NAME> object ( in short sleeves ) always appeared to be the great inoffensive aim of her existence .
1	' Dear Nicholas , ' whispered <NAME> , who had been looking anxiously over his shoulder , ' can this be really the case ?
1	Your aunt is an old lady , <NAME> , and it ' s what you must have looked for , often. ' This consolatory farewell , <NAME> accompanied with a look of heartfelt anguish ; and being left alone with the two children again , and becoming conscious that the wind was blowing mournfully , she indulged in melancholy -- that cheapest and most accessible of luxuries -- until she was overpowered by slumber .
1	' Besides you , I mean , <NAME> , ' returned the craven <NAME> .
1	' I shall make him fetch and carry , my dear , and I shall make him subject to me .
1	When shall we look upon his like again ?
1	demanded <NAME> , pouring question upon question with great volubility .
1	' Hallo ! ' said <NAME> , ' who is that ? ' ' He called to see my Governor this morning , ' replied Mr Chuckster ; ' beyond that , I don ' t know him from Adam. ' ' At least you know his name ? ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> , who had by this time no breath of his own to spare , hurried along without asking any more questions ; and they soon , in their impatience , burst in at a little door and came into a clean parlour full of children .
1	And let me linger in this place , for an instant , to remark that if ever household affections and loves are graceful things , they are graceful in the poor .
1	I have none to spare myself , having to attend court very soon .
1	Thus it was that between seven and eight o ' clock one evening , he and <NAME> found themselves in the <NAME> ' s Head booking-office , securing a place to <NAME> Bridge by the next morning ' s coach .
1	" Where have you been , you young monkey ? " said Mrs. <NAME> , stamping her foot .
1	asked <NAME> , adding , as <NAME> nodded assent , 'What name shall I tell my good friend . '
1	I should say that was worth full twenty pound at the next assizes , without the honesty , sir. ' ' ' Soizes , ' cried <NAME> , ' thou ' d betther not talk to me o ' ' Soizes .
1	It ' s very comfortable , thank you. ' ' I have the pleasure of knowing Mr Dombey , ' observed <NAME> .
1	But I might -- I might -- if this silly business were not completely relinquished altogether , be induced in some anxious moment to guard her from , and surround her with protections against , the consequences of any foolish step in the way of marriage .
1	And so we live on <NAME> , in the charm -- ingest of dolls ' houses , de -- lightfully furnished , and we have a clever little servant who is de -- cidedly pretty , and we are economical and orderly , and do everything by clockwork , and we have a hundred and fifty pounds a year , and we have all we want , and more .
1	The objects he had lately pursued , turned worthless beside her ; such success as was almost in his grasp , he flung away from him like the dirt it was , compared with her .
1	" Better now , " quoth <NAME> , motioning the lawyer to sit down and read to him alone .
1	<NAME> <NAME> 's thoughts take such form as he looks at her , with his ragged grey eyebrows a hair 's breadth more contracted than usual under her gaze .
1	' I am nobody ; do n't consult me , pray .
1	' What , haven ' t you seen her lately ? ' said <NAME> .
1	I only want you to do well , and to be comfortable. " " Well , then , understand once for all that I never shall or can be comfortable -- or anything but miserable -- there , <NAME> ! -- unless I can lead a very different sort of life from the life I lead now. " " That 's a pity ! " said <NAME> , shaking her head with a sorrowful air .
1	My guardian had made up his mind not to lose sight of me until I was safe in <NAME> 's house , so he accompanied us , and we were two days upon the road .
1	They were all three more sharply on the alert , and less deadened by the miserable influences of the place and time .
1	Behind these , back to back with them and facing the opposite wall , are five corresponding rows of cells , accessible by similar means : so that supposing the prisoners locked up in their cells , an officer stationed on the ground , with his back to the wall , has half their number under his eye at once ; the remaining half being equally under the observation of another officer on the opposite side ; and all in one great apartment .
1	The same great manufacturer , always with an immense variety of work on hand , in every stage of development , passed <NAME> onward in his mill , and worked her up into a very pretty article indeed .
1	' You might ha ' made a worser guess than that , old feller , ' replied <NAME> the younger , setting down his burden in the yard , and sitting himself down upon it afterwards .
1	This going away was perhaps the very first action of their joint lives that they had got through without her .
1	He sat down beside me , taking some pains to sit on the form , I thought , in imitation of the print of his illustrious model on the sofa .
1	The morning hurry and flutter had been great ; for , long and anxiously as I had waited for <NAME> , his hint had come like a surprise at last .
1	Mrs <NAME> ' s back being then towards him , the military gentleman shook his forefinger as a sign that her myrmidons were not to apprise her of his presence , and stealing up close behind her , tapped her on the neck , and cried playfully ' Boh ! ' ' What , Mr Slum ! ' cried the lady of the wax-work .
1	This is too hospitable and free. ' By a great exertion of strength , he closed the two old gates , which were deeply sunken in the mud , and barred them with a heavy beam .
1	A sad and desolate place it was , a gloomy , sorrowful place that gave me a strange sensation of mournfulness and even dread .
1	I don ' t want him any longer .
1	I brought him on purpose for you .
1	' My secretary would have to make himself master of the foreign policy of the world , as it is mirrored in the newspapers ; to run his eye over all accounts of public meetings , all leading articles , and accounts of the proceedings of public bodies ; and to make notes of anything which it appeared to him might be made a point of , in any little speech upon the question of some petition lying on the table , or anything of that kind .
1	When he grew tall enough to peep through the keyhole of the great lock of the main door , he had divers times set down his father ' s dinner , or supper , to get on as it might on the outer side thereof , while he stood taking cold in one eye by dint of peeping at her through that airy perspective .
1	" What was your remark , my dear friend ? "
1	" You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired ? " " I think it necessary to turn the key. " Monsieur <NAME> whispered it closer in his ear , and frowned heavily .
1	She will be glad to see you , if you will permit me to let her know that you are here. ' ' By all means , ' returned <NAME> .
1	" Well , sir , " says <NAME> .
1	At the top of the table , seated in an arm-chair rather higher than the rest , was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round , red face .
1	I can not bear it , ' said <NAME> , at once with a burst of tears , and a stamp of her little foot ; ' I shudder with horror of him , and I have come to you to protect me and all of us from him , if you will ? ' ' I will , ' cried <NAME> , with a sudden rush of amazing energy .
1	<NAME> occasioned the inexhaustible baby to square at him with the speckled fists , and demand in a threatening manner what he meant ?
1	' I 'll answer for that boy 's truth with my life ! '
1	' Exactly so , <NAME> , ' said Mr Toots , whose fervour of acquiescence was greatly heightened by his entire ignorance of the <NAME> ' s meaning .
1	' Why , you see , ' said Mr Perch , first turning round to shut the door carefully , ' she takes what has happened in our <NAME> so much to heart , <NAME> .
1	Meanwhile <NAME> and <NAME> walk to and fro , quietly talking together .
1	He paused at the next door in the passage , and tapped gently thereat .
1	There was an innocent piece of dinner-furniture that went upon easy castors and was kept over a livery stable-yard in <NAME> , <NAME> ' s , when not in use , to whom the <NAME> were a source of blind confusion .
1	' And a little bit o ' cold beef , ' said the second coachman .
1	' No , ' said <NAME> , ' I ain ' t .
1	This had better be the end of it .
1	Unbelieving Philosophers who were remodelling the world with words , and making card-towers of <NAME> to scale the skies with , talked with Unbelieving Chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals , at this wonderful gathering accumulated by <NAME> .
1	Do you make that of it ? " <NAME> answered , " Those are not the exact words. " " Not the exact words ! " repeated the gentleman bitterly .
1	Such a mind has Mr <NAME> , whom <NAME> finds contemplating Tippins with the moodiest of visages , while that playful creature rallies him on being so long overdue at the woolsack .
1	It was yet night when she awoke , nor did she know how long , or for how short a time , she had slept .
1	Her thinness seemed to be the effect of some wasting fire within her , which found a vent in her gaunt eyes .
1	No book , no work , no occupation of any kind but her own thought , beguiled the tardy time .
1	Though it has not yet finally disappeared , it is dwindling daily .
1	' We can do it in a fortnight. ' ' No , I thank you .
1	cried Fagin , following him hastily .
1	You 're no trouble at all .
1	of course do you understand that for any other purpose he ' s no man for me , nor for you ? ' ' I have frequently said to <NAME> , sir , ' returned <NAME> , ' that he was of no use at all in the business .
1	Of the remaining four , two , who grasped their foreheads convulsively , were engaged in solving mathematical problems ; one with his face like a dirty window , from much crying , was endeavouring to flounder through a hopeless number of lines before dinner ; and one sat looking at his task in stony stupefaction and despair -- which it seemed had been his condition ever since breakfast time .
1	' And is gone , I know not where. ' ' He should ha ' stopped and fought it out , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> contemptuously .
1	' Thank you ! ' He certainly never had seen this old woman before .
1	<NAME> , with an instinctive delicacy , forbore to urge the least obstacle , though she did not forbear to overpower him with thanks ; and Mr Toots proudly took the commission upon himself for immediate execution .
1	Some laughed ; some said , by way of complete excuse , that the post was virtually a sinecure , and any fool who could spell his name was good enough for it ; some , and these the more solemn political oracles , said that <NAME> did wisely to strengthen himself , and that the sole constitutional purpose of all places within the gift of <NAME> , was , that <NAME> _should_ strengthen himself .
1	' When I am found dead at the foot of the <NAME> , it will be by some of my own sort ; some of the working people who work among the lights yonder .
1	And I know I am so ; and I know she is overjoyed when she can bring it to my mind. ' ' A good pretence ! ' said <NAME> , with no less anger , haughtiness , and bitterness ; ' but too threadbare to cover what I plainly see in this .
1	There was not one touch of tenderness or pity in it .
1	' He has been to <NAME> fifty times , if he has been there once ; yet if he came to <NAME> to-morrow -- I wish he would , dear angel ! -- he would make his fifty-second visit next day. ' ' We are all enthusiastic , are we not , <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> , with a cold smile .
1	Take it from your mother ?
1	Death of my life , sir , ' returned the stranger , ' it ' s my character to be impatient ! ' The sound of <NAME> cautiously chaining the door before she opened it , caused them both to look that way .
1	This is him as I have seen brought up by hand .
1	We who were left walked on towards the house .
1	' I respect you , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> with emotion .
1	I see none like them in that place , but he is admitted to be superior to all the rest .
1	Now , if you stand there , refusing to give evidence , I 'll punish you for disrespect to the bench ; I will , by -- ' By what , or by whom , nobody knows , for the clerk and jailor coughed very loud , just at the right moment ; and the former dropped a heavy book upon the floor , thus preventing the word from being heard -- accidently , of course .
1	' You needn ' t make yourself uncomfortable , ' remarked his wife , laughing heartily .
1	' Let me , oh do let me .
1	Meanwhile you shall have a little taste of something that ' ll do you good , for I ' m sure you must want it after all you ' ve gone through to-day .
1	Their pride in these girls , and their submission of themselves to all their whims , was the pleasantest little testimony to their own worth I could have desired to see .
1	Then <NAME> seeming to be seized with an industrious mania or fury , turned to at the mangle , and impelled it at the heads of the innocents with such a creaking and rumbling , that <NAME> stopped him .
1	<NAME> , <NAME> , it ' s a large place ! ' She shook her head , turned her delighted bright eyes up to mine , kissed me , broke into a merry laugh , and sprang away to put on <NAME> ' s new collar .
1	WHEN <NAME> awoke , it was so dark , that looking out of bed , he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber .
1	' Can you go round when you get back , and tell <NAME> that you saw me safely off , <NAME> ? ' ' It shall be done , Miss. ' ' With my love , please , Joe. ' ' Yes , Miss—and I wouldn ' t mind having it myself ! ' But <NAME> did not articulate the last clause ; only thought it .
1	' God bless her , she is as easily scared as a bird , ' said I .
1	Then to go back , you know , and find him in the same cramped place. ' ' Ah yes !
1	Wants to keep it close and quiet , and to keep you out of the way. ' They were still debating this point when a shadow darkened the entry , and the glass door was opened by a messenger who brought a letter unceremoniously addressed , ' Riah. ' To which he said there was an answer wanted .
1	There , <NAME> , there ! ' ' Well , ' said <NAME> , rather sulkily , but giving the proffered hand a respectful shake at the same time -- ' well , so you ought to be , and I am very glad to find you air ; for , if I can help it , I won ' t have him put upon by nobody , and that ' s all about it. ' ' Certainly not , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
1	' Not a bit , ' returned the <NAME> , kissing his iron hand ; ' and afore I begin to be , my Hearts-delight , <NAME> ' r will have wrote home from the island , or from some port or another , and made all taut and ship-shape. ' And with regard to old <NAME> , here the <NAME> became solemn , ' who I ' ll stand by , and not desert until death do us part , and when the stormy winds do blow , do blow , do blow -- overhaul the <NAME> , ' said the Captain parenthetically , ' and there you ' ll find them expressions -- if it would console <NAME> to have the opinion of a seafaring man as has got a mind equal to any undertaking that he puts it alongside of , and as was all but smashed in his ' prenticeship , and of which the name is <NAME> , that ' ere man shall give him such an opinion in his own parlour as ' ll stun him .
1	<NAME> let me take these bags from you .
1	' He ' s very sorry for giving offence .
1	' <NAME> , my life , ' said <NAME> , touching her cheek , with a grave smile , as she cast down her eyes and pouted again ; ' look at me .
1	I am better with Pa than any one -- more innocent , more sorry , more glad ! ' So , crying out in a wild way that she could not bear this , <NAME> drooped her head on Mrs <NAME> ' s ready breast .
1	' Do you know , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , cheerfully examining the dish , ' I think it is in consequence -- they are capital oysters , but I think it is in consequence -- of their never having been opened. ' They never had been opened ; and we had no oyster-knives -- and couldn ' t have used them if we had ; so we looked at the oysters and ate the mutton .
1	You are not " -- the apprehension came suddenly into his mind -- " a prisoner ? " " No .
1	It was his delight to help her , or to fancy that he did so , and they soon became close companions .
1	When the shop was closed , he took them out of his cap , hung his cap on the chair-back , and stood turning them over before the fire .
1	Of <NAME> , conflicting rumours went abroad .
1	<NAME> , I have heard from the woman who would have been my wife if I had lived , the revolting truth that I should have purchased her , caring nothing for me , as a <NAME> buys a slave .
1	You ' ll hardly believe it , <NAME> , ' said Mr Meagles , laughing within himself , ' but it came out that it would never do , because you and he , walking down to <NAME> together , had glided into a friendly conversation in the course of which he had referred to his intention of taking a partner , supposing at the time that you were as firmly and finally settled as <NAME> ' s Cathedral .
1	' Confound these fellows ! ' thought <NAME> ; ' they have come to breakfast , I suppose .
1	<NAME> <NAME> allowed <NAME> to obey it , in silence .
1	I have a scheme to develop , little woman .
1	I have been offered and rejected , put up and appraised , until my very soul has sickened .
1	If I did think of it at odd moments now and then , I had only to be busy and forget it .
1	If you should have any reason for imposing conditions upon me , I will respect it without asking what it is. ' ' You chanced to see me in the street with the man , ' she observed , after being , to his mortification , evidently more occupied with her own reflections on the matter than with his appeal .
1	It were the Poison-bottle on table .
1	' When the question was referred to <NAME> -- I needn ' t name him , ' said <NAME> , checking himself -- ' I understand , ' said <NAME> , ' N. ' <NAME> darkly nodded -- ' was referred to him , his answer was , " Money , or no release. " ' ' Lord bless my soul ! ' cried <NAME> .
1	' Well , well ! ' returned <NAME> , with a patient , even a submissive , air .
1	As she read on , years seemed to fall away from her son like the imaginings of a dream , and all the old dark horrors of his usual preparation for the sleep of an innocent child to overshadow him .
1	There were some trifles there -- poor useless things -- that she would have liked to take away ; but that was impossible .
1	Her father privately married again -- his cook , I rather think. " " I thought he was proud , " said I .
1	I have shown you now , more plainly , that I do .
1	But now a fearful circumstance occurs .
1	For which I have been thanking her. ' The Patriarch turning his head in a lumbering way towards <NAME> , that assistant put up the note-book in which he had been absorbed , and took him in tow .
1	I can not help thinking , ' said Mrs. Micawber , with an air of deep sagacity , ' that there are members of my family who have been apprehensive that <NAME> would solicit them for their names. -- -I do not mean to be conferred in <NAME> upon our children , but to be inscribed on <NAME> of <NAME> , and negotiated in the <NAME> Market. ' The look of penetration with which Mrs. Micawber announced this discovery , as if no one had ever thought of it before , seemed rather to astonish my aunt ; who abruptly replied , ' Well , ma ' am , upon the whole , I shouldn ' t wonder if you were right ! ' ' Mr .
1	And now Veneering shoots out of the <NAME> wherein he is accustomed , when contemplative , to give his mind to the carving and gilding of the Pilgrims going to <NAME> , in order to show Twemlow the little flourish he has prepared for the trumpets of fashion , describing how that on the seventeenth instant , at <NAME> ' s <NAME> , the <NAME> , assisted by the <NAME> , united in the bonds of matrimony , <NAME> , of <NAME> , <NAME> , to <NAME> , only daughter of the late <NAME> , <NAME> , of <NAME> .
1	<NAME> Whiffers then added that he feared a portion of this outrage might be traced to his own forbearing and accommodating disposition .
1	And we tell people that you have lived there , without so much as a day ' s or a night ' s absence , ever since .
1	<NAME> was his pride , that he indignantly took her away , as if from reproach and disgrace .
1	But these fears vanished before a well-trimmed lamp and the familiar aspect of her own room .
1	' Although I found that the necessity for self-command and restraint became every day more imperious , and the difficulty greater , I never , for one instant , spoke or looked but as I would have done had you been by .
1	These arrangements completed , they give the women good night and come out once more into black and foul Tom-all-Alone 's .
1	This business was capitally described in the advertisement , <NAME> .
1	A joke ' s a joke. ' ' Upon my soul ! ' said the whelp .
1	" Would you allow me to get it filled for you ? "
1	' Oh , very , <NAME> , very , ' replied <NAME> .
1	But forgetting his purpose or changing his mind before he came close to him , he seized his hand and vowed eternal friendship , declaring with an agreeable frankness that from that time forth they were brothers in everything but personal appearance .
1	<NAME> , <NAME> , entered it in a little book , with a gold pencil-case , and the other gentleman entered it also , in another little book with another gold pencil-case .
1	" Well , gentlemen , " resumes the coroner .
1	Whenever I watched the vessels standing out to sea with their white sails spread , I somehow thought of <NAME> and <NAME> ; and whenever the light struck aslant , afar off , upon a cloud or sail or green hillside or water-line , it was just the same. -- <NAME> and <NAME> and the strange house and the strange life appeared to have something to do with everything that was picturesque .
1	I stopped where I was , among the leaves , and listened .
1	' There was one of two ways to be adopted : either to go on to build up a language of signs on the basis of the natural language which she had already commenced herself , or to teach her the purely arbitrary language in common use : that is , to give her a sign for every individual thing , or to give her a knowledge of letters by combination of which she might express her idea of the existence , and the mode and condition of existence , of any thing .
1	The long rows of gaunt black piles , slimy and wet and weather-worn , with funeral garlands of seaweed twisted about them by the late tide , might have represented an unsightly marine cemetery .
1	Though the whole nursery party were dressed by this time in lighter mourning than at first , there was enough in the appearance of the bereaved children to make the day no brighter .
1	" You are very obliging , <NAME> .
1	' You know him , <NAME> ? ' ' I haven ' t been not to say right slap through him , very lately , ' Mr <NAME> made answer , ' having been otherways employed , Mr Boffin .
1	Everybody knows me here. ' ' What will she do there ? ' inquired <NAME> .
1	<NAME> , poor me , poor me , my poor hand shakes like to drop off !
1	Do you hear ? ' <NAME> gave a dogged kind of nod to express an affirmative reply , and , leaving the room for a few seconds , returned with his hat .
1	That ' s all. ' <NAME> rested his elbow on the arm of his chair , and shaded his face with his hand .
1	At one time we were all flung together in a heap at the bottom of the coach , and at another we were crushing our heads against the roof .
1	So now , " said <NAME> , going up to him and giving him her trembling hand , " we are only cousins again , <NAME> -- for the time perhaps -- and I pray for a blessing on my dear cousin , wherever he goes ! "
1	<NAME> and dark he found it .
1	'It 's all bought up as fast as it can be made , ' said the fellow .
1	Now , then , fust cab ! ' And the first cab having been fetched from the public- house , where he had been smoking his first pipe , <NAME> and his portmanteau were thrown into the vehicle .
1	Regarding that as done , is there nothing I can do for you yourself ? " " Nothing .
1	I thought of <NAME> : and a foolish , fearful fancy came upon me of his being near at hand , and liable to be met at any turn .
1	The nearest usher called for <NAME> ; another one , at a little distance off , demanded <NAME> ; and a third rushed in a breathless state into <NAME> , and screamed for <NAME> till he was hoarse .
1	I wish your ladyship good day . "
1	And I don ' t wonder at it , or complain of it , for I am sensible that I must be in the way , though I try to keep out of it as well as I can .
1	It was as if I had seen <NAME> , in all her fascinating artlessness , caressing <NAME> , and thanking her , and coaxingly appealing against me , and loving me with all her childish innocence .
1	I am glad to recollect that when the carrier began to move , my mother ran out at the gate , and called to him to stop , that she might kiss me once more .
1	For some minutes after he had emerged into the outer presence of <NAME> , the husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them , lest he should come back .
1	I ' ve found something. ' ' What have you found ? ' asked <NAME> , clutching him with both hands , so that they stood interlocked like a couple of preposterous gladiators .
1	About midnight I got out of bed and went to <NAME> , with the conviction that I had been asleep for four-and-twenty hours , and that Wednesday was past .
1	<NAME> , sir , ' said the girl .
1	This was <NAME> ' s party .
1	However , I forgive you this once , and look here , <NAME> ; that ' s ' -- <NAME> laid the little forefinger of her right glove on her lip , and then laid it on her father ' s lip -- ' that ' s a kiss for you .
1	" Weel ! " thinks I , " he ' s got a pretty good start , and if he bean ' t whoam by noo , he never will be ; so you may coom as quick as you loike , and foind us reddy " -- that is , you know , schoolmeasther might coom. ' ' I understand , ' said <NAME> .
1	But as the mahogany philosopher gave no evidence of being sentient of anything but warmth and tobacco , except once , when taking his pipe from his lips to make room for his glass , he incidentally remarked with exceeding gruffness , that his name was <NAME> -- a declaration that presented but small opening for conversation -- the Captain bespeaking his attention in a short complimentary exordium , narrated the whole history of <NAME> ' s departure , with the change it had produced in his own life and fortunes ; and concluded by placing the packet on the table .
1	' I am glad you are so well satisfied , sir , ' was his calm remark .
1	" I am very sorry both to hear it and to see it , <NAME> . "
1	Echoing <NAME> A wonderful corner for echoes , it has been remarked , that corner where the <NAME> lived .
1	" Well , <NAME> ? " " I start for <NAME> , <NAME> , to-morrow , " I was exceedingly careful what I said , " and I thought you would kindly not mind my taking leave of you. " " This is a gay figure , <NAME> , " said she , making her crutch stick play round me , as if she , the fairy godmother who had changed me , were bestowing the finishing gift .
1	Let him keep to ' t .
1	Have you any idea of any cause that can have overset him ? ' ' You surprise me !
1	Do I know anything about your combinings ? ' ' No no , sir -- certainly not ; not by any means , ' returned <NAME> .
1	' I 've got to be in <NAME> to-night ; and I know a 'spectable old gentleman as lives there , wot 'll give you lodgings for nothink , and never ask for the change -- that is , if any genelman he knows interduces you .
1	Be here all the earlier next morning . "
1	Sings in the choir. ' ' In the spire ? ' ' Choir. ' ' What ' s that ? ' <NAME> rises from his papers , and comes to his doorstep .
1	The confined entrance was so dark that it was impossible to make out distinctly what kind of person opened the door ; but it appeared to be an old woman .
1	' Well , Mr <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
1	If you ca n't get to be oncommon through going straight , you 'll never get to do it through going crooked .
1	' I do not pretend. ' ' Oh !
1	" But I 'll lime you , you dog , I 'll lime you ! "
1	' Do you , though ? ' said <NAME> , appearing to consider that fact in itself surprising .
1	<NAME> <NAME> had smoked his evening pipe and there were preparations for some supper by and by .
1	He was down in every fit of the hooping-cough , and rolled upon and crushed by a whole field of small diseases , that came trooping on each other ' s heels to prevent his getting up again .
1	She supposed that we were following her , but as soon as the space was left clear , we approached the woman sitting by the fire to ask if the baby were ill. She only looked at it as it lay on her lap .
1	There she is ! ' In the strength of his misfortune , and the energy of his distress , he fired for the moment like a proud man .
1	A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle always have in their mouths , and hard lives they live , <NAME> .
1	The table was long , and the dinner was long ; and <NAME> , overshadowed by a large pair of black whiskers and a large white cravat , lost sight of her father altogether , until a servant put a scrap of paper in her hand , with a whispered request from <NAME> that she would read it directly .
1	I ' d take it by any force , I ' d have it at any price !
1	Three are to meet at the gatehouse to-night .
1	Worth my while , too , to murder him , when I could do worse and drag him back ! " The other one still gasped , " He tried -- he tried-to -- murder me .
1	<NAME> ' t you think he ought , Mrs. Rogers , ma ' am ? ' Oh , certainly , ma ' am , ' replied Mrs. Rogers ; after whom all the other ladies responded , ' Oh , certainly. ' ' Of course I feel it , ma ' am , ' said <NAME> , rubbing his hands , and evincing a slight tendency to brighten up a little .
1	Then , he hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath his clothing .
1	We were disposed , notwithstanding <NAME> ' s stipulation for my aunt ' s attendance , to arrange that she should stay at home , and be represented by <NAME> and me .
1	Other motes there were which showed him as a heavy , selfish , drifting <NAME> , who , having stumbled , in the course of his unwieldy jostlings against other men , on the discovery that to get through life with ease and credit , he had but to hold his tongue , keep the bald part of his head well polished , and leave his hair alone , had had just cunning enough to seize the idea and stick to it .
1	Having described the precise situation of the office , and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk straight up the passage , and when he got into the side , and pull off his hat as he went into the room , <NAME> bade him hurry on alone , and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting .
1	" Which I meantersay , " cried <NAME> , " that if you come into my place bull-baiting and badgering me , come out !
1	The <NAME> liked his answering with a smile ; it looked pleasant .
1	Down to -- ah , poor poor fellow ! -- to the end , he never received me but with something of his old merry boyish manner .
1	Even when she had made the circuit of the enclosure , and , returning to the porch , sat pensively waiting for their friend , she took her station where she could still look upon them , and felt as if fascinated towards that spot .
1	" Were you examined at an inquest ? "
1	Neither his brief consideration , nor its purport , was lost on his companion .
1	Mr Dombey , my love , ' pursued the <NAME> , turning to his wife , ' is so confiding as to -- do you see our little friend ? ' Mrs Blimber , in an excess of politeness , of which Mr <NAME> was the object , apparently did not , for she was backing against the little friend , and very much endangering his position on the table .
1	He could think of her being there , without a lurking misgiving that it would have been better if she had not come .
1	<NAME> n't only one wot can go up town .
1	' If my brother <NAME> had consulted with me , which he sometimes does -- or rather , sometimes used to do ; for he will naturally do that no more now , and this is a circumstance which I regard as a relief from responsibility , ' said <NAME> , hysterically , ' for I thank Heaven I am not jealous -- ' here Mrs Chick again shed tears : ' if my brother <NAME> had come to me , and had said , " Louisa , what kind of qualities would you advise me to look out for , in a wife ? " I should certainly have answered , " <NAME> , you must have family , you must have beauty , you must have dignity , you must have connexion. " Those are the words I should have used .
1	What I have learned has left me doubting , misbelieving , despising , regretting , what I have not learned ; and my dismal resource has been to think that life would soon go by , and that nothing in it could be worth the pain and trouble of a contest. ' ' And you so young , <NAME> ! ' he said with pity .
1	" You copied some affidavits in that cause for me lately . "
1	If you get it ( which you may after a time ) , that memorial must be entered in that Department , sent to be registered in this Department , sent back to be signed by that Department , sent back to be countersigned by this Department , and then it will begin to be regularly before that Department .
1	' Twenty minutes past two , <NAME> , I set your watch at .
1	' A fool of <NAME> ! ' exclaimed <NAME> .
1	<NAME> 's breakfast for to-morrow , served out to be cooked .
1	You hear ; I think that ' s apology enough. ' ' You will not understand me , ' said <NAME> .
1	And I should have done it ( though I have been to see you more than once down at <NAME> , when you little thought of me ) but for my old comrade 's wife here , who I find has been too many for me .
1	After a few moments of painful hesitation , I broke the silence .
1	We have said in walked <NAME> , but the statement is not distinguished by our usual scrupulous adherence to fact .
1	We knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel .
1	'Well , well , Mrs. Mann , ' he replied in a calmer tone ; 'it may be as you say ; it may be .
1	' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' here ' s Father !
1	' My dear , I have remained all night at my table , pondering again and again on what has so painfully passed between us .
1	" We hope you will think better of it , <NAME> , " said I , " and we shall come to see you again , trusting to find you more reasonable . "
1	I well remember mamma ' s clasping her hands , and exclaiming " This will end in a little man ! " ' ( Here Mr <NAME> glanced at his host and shook his head with despondency . )
1	Are you afraid to kiss me ? ' The answer is , the ready pressure of her lips upon the cold but smiling mouth .
1	Was he one of those two passengers ? " " I can not undertake to say that he was. " " Does he resemble either of these two passengers ? " " Both were so wrapped up , and the night was so dark , and we were all so reserved , that I can not undertake to say even that. " " Mr .
1	He was in the full heat and bustle of concluding these operations , when his uncle , <NAME> , accosted him .
1	I travelled heer , and I travelled theer , but I found no Em ' ly , and I travelled home. ' ' How long ago ? ' I asked .
1	And it was particularly kind of him to come , for he had but just gone. ' ' Have you settled , ' asked <NAME> , appealing to them both , ' what is to be done for <NAME> and her brother ? ' ' Why really , ' said <NAME> , ' I am in great perplexity .
1	'Give me a shawl here .
1	' Shall I tell you , ' asked <NAME> , ' what I see down there ? ' ' Limited little b ? ' suggested <NAME> with her eyebrows raised .
1	Their looks were very sad , and might have moved the sternest visitor to tears , but not to that kind of sorrow which the contemplation of the men awakens .
1	This person wore a wig of short , coarse , red hair , which he took off with his hat , and hung upon a nail .
1	<NAME> bowed , said he was very well , and seemed very much astonished at the outward appearance of the proprietor of <NAME> Hall : as indeed he was .
1	If you dare to come here again unless you ' re sent for , I ' ll keep watch-dogs in the yard that ' ll growl and bite -- I ' ll have man-traps , cunningly altered and improved for catching women -- I ' ll have spring guns , that shall explode when you tread upon the wires , and blow you into little pieces .
1	I only meant did you want your horse minded. ' ' I ' m going to get down in the next street , ' returned the old gentleman .
1	Who 'll say as much as that , I should like to know ; eh , <NAME> ? '
1	After a few Wednesdays , <NAME> himself made some inquiries of me about him , and I told him all my aunt had told me ; which interested the Doctor so much that he requested , on the occasion of his next visit , to be presented to him .
1	I might have remembered it .
1	It stands in the corner of the poor field of wheat , which is full of great unsightly stumps , like earthy butchers ' -blocks .
1	I want to found an opinion on what you tell me .
1	<NAME> <NAME> sends a carriage for you -- twenty minutes before seven to the moment -- you ' ll not be so cruel as to disappoint the whole party , Mrs. Nickleby ? ' ' You are so very pressing , that I scarcely know what to say , ' replied the worthy lady .
1	During the half-hour , the young gentlemen , broken into pairs , loitered arm-in-arm up and down a small piece of ground behind the house , or endeavoured to kindle a spark of animation in the breast of <NAME> .
1	Why money should be so precious to an <NAME> too dull and mean to exchange it for any other satisfaction , is strange ; but there is no animal so sure to get laden with it , as the Ass who sees nothing written on the face of the earth and sky but the three letters L. S. D. -- not <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , which they often stand for , but the three dry letters .
1	He must be stopped somehow. " " You mean that you ca n't accept -- " " How can I ? " I interposed , as <NAME> paused .
1	All-Muggleton had the first innings ; and the interest became intense when <NAME> and <NAME> , two of the most renowned members of that most distinguished club , walked , bat in hand , to their respective wickets .
1	That , the proof would go back five years , and would show the prisoner already engaged in these pernicious missions , within a few weeks before the date of the very first action fought between the <NAME> troops and the Americans .
1	Pieces too ; why , you could write us a piece to bring out the whole strength of the company , whenever we wanted one. ' ' I am not quite so confident about that , ' replied <NAME> .
1	'For , ' says he , 'it 's being ground to bits in a slow mill ; it 's being roasted at a slow fire ; it 's being stung to death by single bees ; it 's being drowned by drops ; it 's going mad by grains . '
1	But the boldest point he made was this : it was attempted to be set up , in proof of her jealousy , that she was under strong suspicion of having , at about the time of the murder , frantically destroyed her child by this man -- some three years old -- to revenge herself upon him .
1	' And this is the bed to which society consigns me , is it ?
1	All people knew ( or thought they knew ) that he had made himself immensely rich ; and , for that reason alone , prostrated themselves before him , more degradedly and less excusably than the darkest savage creeps out of his hole in the ground to propitiate , in some log or reptile , the <NAME> of his benighted soul .
1	On the other hand , the question was , not what he thought of the point , but what she thought of it .
1	But , when we went into the room , and it turned pale , she was ten thousand times prettier yet .
1	' Oh , certainly , depend upon me , ' said that gentleman aloud .
1	In an arm-chair , with an elbow resting on the table and her head leaning on that hand , sat the strangest lady I have ever seen , or shall ever see .
1	The family had left that part a week before ; they had called in such trifling debts as were outstanding , discharged them , and left the place by night .
1	Were they not ? ' ' When she told you you would be a judge ?
1	But I can go and earn some more , when I like ; ca n't I , <NAME> ? '
1	In the mean time , ma ' am , I am of opinion , if you ask me my opinion , that the less she is talked about , the better. ' The same evening , Mrs. Sparsit , in her chamber window , resting from her packing operations , looked towards her great staircase and saw <NAME> still descending .
1	Finally , becoming cataleptic , she has to be carried up the narrow staircase like a grand piano .
1	And the man we have in hiding down the river , is <NAME> 's Father. " What purpose I had in view when I was hot on tracing out and proving <NAME> 's parentage , I can not say .
1	' <NAME> , ' said my aunt , ' attention ! ' <NAME> recovered himself , with a blush .
1	This gentleman is his very particular friend , <NAME> -- ' ' Mr .
1	On the preceding occasion , one or two of the Bleeding Heart Yarders had obsequiously picked it up and handed it to its owner ; but Mr <NAME> had now so far impressed his audience , that the <NAME> had to turn and stoop for it himself .
1	That was the subject in my mind .
1	There ; let go ; be sensible .
1	' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , as <NAME> turned to go .
1	' She ' ll be quite happy , now she has come home again , ' said <NAME> , nodding to her with an encouraging smile upon her wholesome face , ' and will be so pleased to see her dear Papa to-night. ' ' Lork , <NAME> ! ' cried <NAME> , taking up her words with a jerk .
1	<NAME> Mr and <NAME> , beaming !
1	" Do you know , " <NAME> asks her , signing to her to bring her chair nearer , " do you know , <NAME> , that I am different to you from what I am to any one ? "
1	They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might , ascended the staircase of the new domicile , were admitted by <NAME> , and found <NAME> weeping , alone .
1	It was nothing to her , that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his forefathers ; she saw , not him , but them .
1	For a little while he sat with his hand over his face , but when he removed it , fell into his usual manner .
1	She busied herself immediately in preparing supper , and while she was thus engaged I remarked that the old man took an opportunity of observing me more closely than he had done yet .
1	I know I did this selfishly , to have my name brought before her ; but I tried to believe it was an act of justice to his memory .
1	' Not in the least , ' replied <NAME> ; ' I like it very much , although I am no smoker myself. ' ' I should be very sorry to say I wasn ' t , ' interposed another gentleman on the opposite side of the table .
1	" He comes here every evening , " returned <NAME> , " and is so fond of sitting in the corner there that it 's a treat to see him . "
1	We have been speaking of you every day. ' ' To tell you the truth , sir , I am glad to find you alone , ' said <NAME> , with some natural hesitation ; ' for I am anxious to say something to you .
1	' Let me see you ride a donkey over my green again , and as sure as you have a head upon your shoulders , I ' ll knock your bonnet off , and tread upon it ! ' It would require a painter , and no common painter too , to depict my aunt ' s face as she delivered herself of this very unexpected sentiment , and <NAME> ' s face as she heard it .
1	I may not myself , ' said Mr Sparkler manfully , ' be up to the mark on some other subjects at a short notice , and I am aware that if you were to poll Society the general opinion would be that I am not ; but on the subject of Amy I AM up to the mark ! ' Mr <NAME> kissed her , in witness thereof .
1	A special contrast <NAME> makes to the <NAME> family .
1	And I know <NAME> thought so too .
1	She is very sensible of your handsome intentions , and wishes you good evening , and wishes you well . "
1	' I ' d show him what I thought of him , ' said <NAME> .
1	Is he a large man , <NAME> ? ' ' I should call him a large man , my dear , ' the old lady replied after some hesitation , ' but that his voice is so much larger. ' ' Than himself ? ' ' Than anybody. ' ' Hah ! ' said <NAME> .
1	said <NAME> , clearing his throat .
1	And whether you have astonished them , and made them shrink in their shoes , or not ? ' ' Go on to the next one , my dear <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
1	I should think I did , or you would have begged in vain .
1	But , by degrees she was led on to confess that she would like to have for the inexhaustible baby such a nursery as never was seen .
1	' The best thing you can do , ' said <NAME> , ' for the time being , at all events , is to come home with me , godmother .
1	Therefore I watched <NAME> closely. ' Dear , tender little Dora , so unconscious of this Dragon ' s eye !
1	The preparations for the reception of visitors appeared to be completed .
1	' I have not the least desire or intention to distinguish myself in that way .
1	No one who could hear , and might , by possibility , understand ? '
1	Can I spare this Doctor to my husband ?
1	' Let the laws be. ' ' Yes , ' he said , with a slow nod or two .
1	' Not just yet ! ' ' Oh very good indeed ! ' cried <NAME> , recovering his spirits a little .
1	' I mean but this -- that when I left you last , I left you with a firm determination to level all fancied barriers between yourself and me ; resolved that if my world could not be yours , I would make yours mine ; that no pride of birth should curl the lip at you , for I would turn from it .
1	' It ' s of not a bit of use , ' said <NAME> , shaking her head , until the ear-rings rang again .
1	They quickly came out again , no one speaking but <NAME> : who remarked to <NAME> , in a whisper , ' Not <NAME> worse than <NAME> Tippins. ' So , back to the whitewashed library of the monastery -- with that liver still in shrieking requisition , as it had been loudly , while they looked at the silent sight they came to see -- and there through the merits of the case as summed up by the <NAME> .
1	I ' ll be your servant , constant and trew .
1	<NAME> <NAME> had regularly assisted at our councils , with a meditative and sage demeanour .
1	The death of <NAME> is much regretted , as he was a liberal-minded and energetic man .
1	But , as years went on , my dear boy would have wearied of his child-wife .
1	' If it had ever been here , its ashes alone would save me from the void in which my whole life sinks .
1	' <NAME> , I was in the way , was I ? ' <NAME> smiled again , but made no answer .
1	'No , nor that neither , ' rejoined the girl .
1	' By your leaves , gentlemen , ' said <NAME> W. B. Childers , glancing round the room .
1	To hear him ! " cried my sister , with a clap of her hands and a scream together , -- which was her next stage .
1	<NAME> went to bed again , and thought , and thought , and thought it over and over and over , and could make nothing of it .
1	" And now , " proceeds the lawyer , still without minding her , " you had better go .
1	I had more than once approached this subject of my thoughts with Mrs. Rachael , our only servant , who took my light away when I was in bed ( another very good woman , but austere to me ) , and she had only said , " Esther , good night ! "
1	My childhood was passed with a grandmother ; that is to say , with a lady who represented that relative to me , and who took that title on herself .
1	I was sorry presently that this was all we said about that .
1	look about you now , and make up for your negligence , ' said <NAME> .
1	In pursuance of this plan , we went into <NAME> on an early day and presented ourselves at <NAME> 's door .
1	It seems very strange , as there must be right somewhere , that an honest judge in real earnest has not been able to find out through all these years where it is . "
1	Little Oliver <NAME> lay on his back on the pavement , with his shirt unbuttoned , and his temples bathed with water ; his face a deadly white ; and a cold tremble convulsing his whole frame .
1	After perusing it , I taxed <NAME> with having many such letters in her possession ; and ultimately obtained from her the packet which is now in <NAME> ' s hand. ' Here she ceased ; and snapping her reticule again , and shutting her mouth , looked as if she might be broken , but could never be bent .
1	He makes dreadful mouths as he rules the ciphering-book ; and now he throws his eye sideways down our lane , and we all droop over our books and tremble .
1	' And I insist on being separated and left to myself , ' said <NAME> , sobbing .
1	I tried to eat my parting breakfast , but my tears dropped upon my bread-and-butter , and trickled into my tea .
1	<NAME> in the breast of her gown , the money to pay for her burial was still intact .
1	<NAME> <NAME> stopped to hear no more ; but darting from the surgery into the outer shop , cried in a stentorian voice , ' Ben , my boy , she ' s bolted ! ' <NAME> , who had been slumbering behind the counter , with his head half a foot or so below his knees , no sooner heard this appalling communication , than he made a precipitate rush at <NAME> , and , twisting his hand in the neck-cloth of that taciturn servitor , expressed an obliging intention of choking him where he stood .
1	<NAME> <NAME> informed me that the academy had been lent , last night , for a concert .
1	I don ' t mind telling YOU , because we have always been favourites of each other ' s , and because you are not like a Pa , but more like a sort of a younger brother with a dear venerable chubbiness on him .
1	He strolled westward this time , pacing the long streets with hurried footsteps , and agitated by a thousand misgivings and apprehensions which he could not overcome .
1	A revolutionary tribunal in the capital , and forty or fifty thousand revolutionary committees all over the land ; a law of the <NAME> , which struck away all security for liberty or life , and delivered over any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one ; prisons gorged with people who had committed no offence , and could obtain no hearing ; these things became the established order and nature of appointed things , and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old .
1	I did MY part. ' ' Excellently , ' replied <NAME> , taking his hand .
1	Mr <NAME> , with a sniff of corresponding intensity , then added , ' Anything more ? ' ' Not at present , sir , not at present .
1	' Don ' t say so. ' ' It is only a pincushion for the toilette table , <NAME> , ' resumed his sister ; ' one of those trifles which are insignificant to your sex in general , as it ' s very natural they should be -- we have no business to expect they should be otherwise -- but to which we attach some interest. ' ' Miss Tox is very good , ' said Mr Dombey .
1	It was wretched weather ; stormy and wet , stormy and wet ; and mud , mud , mud , deep in all the streets .
1	It ' s my way to speak my mind , <NAME> , and that is my mind ; and if you don ' t like it , it ' s past my regular time for going to bed , and I can find my way home without making it later. ' Here was an untoward event !
1	' And whose should you say it was ? ' inquired Mr <NAME> , rubbing the pastry against his nose with a dreadful calmness .
1	She might have been , but that was past !
1	Here and there , the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little creek , and we were all suspicious of such places , and eyed them nervously .
1	' Why don ' t you enliven us yourself , <NAME> ? ' said a young man with a whisker , a squint , and an open shirt collar ( dirty ) , from the bottom of the table .
1	' It was you , I believe , that were wishing to see <NAME> ! ' ' It was , ' said <NAME> .
1	' Why , he ' s pretty well , thank ' ee , I suppose. ' ' You ' re not out of place , <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> , in a wheedling tone .
1	' How do you carry them about ? ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> begs to know now , would it be fair to ask a professional man how -- on -- earth -- these -- people -- ever -- did -- come -- TO -- such -- A -- total smash ?
1	You had better determine to leave him here for the present ! ' ' I am very much obliged to you , ' said my aunt ; ' and so is he , I see ; but -- ' ' Come !
1	' <NAME> , he be a soizable ' un , he be. ' ' Goodness , <NAME> !
1	When would that trial come , through which her faith in , and her duty to , her dear husband , was to carry her , rendering him triumphant ?
1	The door was opened by a big footman with his head floured , or chalked , or painted in some way ( it didn ' t look genuine powder ) , and the big footman , receiving the card of introduction , gave it to a little page ; so little , indeed , that his body would not hold , in ordinary array , the number of small buttons which are indispensable to a page ' s costume , and they were consequently obliged to be stuck on four abreast .
1	He stood at a little distance from the door , with his face towards it ; and with the sleeves of his coat turned back at the wrists , was occupied in bestowing the most vigorous , scientific , and straightforward blows upon the empty air .
1	When <NAME> came , we went and had lunch at a celebrated house which I then quite venerated , but now believe to have been the most abject superstition in <NAME> , and where I could not help noticing , even then , that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives and waiters ' clothes , than in the steaks .
1	This is my reason for living secret here , with the aid of a good old man who is my true friend .
1	' I must take the consequences of what I have done , ' said <NAME> .
1	Will you graciously let me kiss your hand ? "
1	<NAME> Micawber with more shirt-collar than usual , and a new ribbon to his eye-glass ; Mrs. Micawber with her cap in a whitey-brown paper parcel ; Traddles carrying the parcel , and supporting Mrs. Micawber on his arm .
1	But a portrait over the chimney-piece , painted by the fashionable artist of the day , acts upon him like a charm .
1	My aunt ' s old disappointment is set right , now .
1	" I ' ll kick his brains out , if he has any -- , or fracture his skull if he hasn ' t. " Exerting all his strength , at this moment , my uncle wrenched the ill-looking man ' s sword from his grasp , and flung it clean out of the coach window , upon which the younger gentleman vociferated , " Death and lightning ! " again , and laid his hand upon the hilt of his sword , in a very fierce manner , but didn ' t draw it .
1	He had heard the gates open ; and the badly shod feet that waited outside shuffle in ; and the sweeping , and pumping , and moving about , begin , which commenced the prison morning .
1	This going home to clean himself is one of the man ' s incomprehensible compromises with inexorable facts ; he , and his hat , and his boots , and his clothes , never showing any trace of cleaning , but being uniformly in one condition of dust and grit .
1	For I conscientiously believed , dancing-master 's wife though she was , and dancing-mistress though in her limited ambition she aspired to be , she had struck out a natural , wholesome , loving course of industry and perseverance that was quite as good as a mission .
1	<NAME> " -- <NAME> becomes mysteriously and tenderly eloquent -- " it is necessary that I should impress upon your mind once more that circumstances over which I have no control have made a melancholy alteration in my most cherished plans and in that unrequited image which I formerly mentioned to you as a friend .
1	" He has always kept it by him , " said <NAME> , with an anxious look at his friend .
1	cried the stranger ; ' I speak of one ; a meek-looking , pale-faced boy , who was apprenticed down here , to a coffin-maker -- I wish he had made his coffin , and screwed his body in it -- and who afterwards ran away to <NAME> , as it was supposed .
1	Now , will you ? ' ' There ' s something more to be told , ' said <NAME> , as stony and immovable as ever .
1	<NAME> , hand the lady them cards , and offer these to the gentleman .
1	An arch of the bridge in the park has been sapped and sopped away .
1	This light in hand young <NAME> knew perfectly that it was not .
1	<NAME> up here. " The two were kept apart , and each walked surrounded by a separate guard .
1	" Inform the <NAME> of what you did that day within the <NAME> , citizen. " " I knew , " said <NAME> , looking down at his wife , who stood at the bottom of the steps on which he was raised , looking steadily up at him ; " I knew that this prisoner , of whom I speak , had been confined in a cell known as One Hundred and <NAME> , <NAME> .
1	But <NAME> , waking , told in a hurry how they came to be together , and all the why and wherefore of that matter .
1	<NAME> his admiration and his emulation of that shining enchanter .
1	Mrs. Sparsit first elevated , then knitted , her <NAME> eyebrows ; gathered up her work into its proper basket ; and rose .
1	' Well , well , ' said the clergyman .
1	It mayn ' t be altogether safe , vith reference to gettin ' out agin. ' Deferring to his son ' s feeling upon this point , <NAME> at once sought the erudite <NAME> , and acquainted him with his desire to issue a writ , instantly , for the _sum _of twenty-five pounds , and costs of process ; to be executed without delay upon the body of one <NAME> ; the charges thereby incurred , to be paid in advance to <NAME> .
1	' And how are you , old woman ? ' ' Ha , ha ! ' laughed <NAME> , sitting down beside us , and rubbing his hands in his sense of relief from recent trouble , and in the genuine heartiness of his nature ; ' there ' s not a woman in the wureld , sir -- as I tell her -- that need to feel more easy in her mind than her !
1	" I know nothing of it. " Having said it , he passed behind the little counter , and stood with his hand on the back of his wife 's chair , looking over that barrier at the person to whom they were both opposed , and whom either of them would have shot with the greatest satisfaction .
1	<NAME> <NAME> came out again , exhorting the others to be vigilant , darkened his lantern , and once more took his seat .
1	Who is there you would wish to meet ?
1	The falser he , the truer <NAME> ; the meaner he , the nobler <NAME> .
1	A prison taint was on everything there .
1	Knowing you were alone , was it possible that I could stay away ? ' ' You may hang your head , to make yourself the more attractive ; _I_ don ' t know what they see in you when you hold it up , ' thought Mrs. <NAME> ; ' but you little think , my dearest love , whose eyes are on you ! ' That she hung her head , was certain .
1	I saw that a crisis was at hand , and it came .
1	Have YOU ever done anything , sir ? ' ( turning to his nephew . )
1	<NAME> , white with crusted salt ; topmasts struck ; storm-sails set ; rigging all knotted , tangled , wet , and drooping : a gloomier picture it would be hard to look upon .
1	Although her face was wonderfully composed , it was apparent that she was wholly taken by surprise , and that what she had expected to be taxed with , in connection with her small servant , was something very different from this .
1	" Since father died , sir , I 've gone out to work .
1	' Is it , ' said <NAME> junior , taking heed of his visitor ' s brown face , ' anything about -- Tonnage -- or that sort of thing ? ' ( Pausing for a reply , he opened his right eye with his hand , and stuck his glass in it , in that inflammatory manner that his eye began watering dreadfully . )
1	' This won ' t improve with talking about .
1	At the justice-room , they found the single gentleman , who had gone straight there , and was expecting them with desperate impatience .
1	Meantime , all holy angels shower blessings on his head , and prosper and preserve him. ' She was hurrying past <NAME> , when he threw himself before her , and implored her to think , but once again , upon the fate to which she was precipitately hastening .
1	" A job , " says <NAME> .
1	He took off his hat as <NAME> saluted him , and seemed much humbled and abashed at the sight of <NAME> .
1	'What did they say , about last Sunday ? '
1	' But , ' said <NAME> , ' the surplus that would be left as his means of support -- and I suppose the house to be sold , even in saying this -- would be so small , not exceeding in all probability some hundreds of pounds , that perhaps , <NAME> , it would be best to consider whether he might not retain his agency of the estate to which he has so long been receiver .
1	Being found , they were treated with great confidence and honour ( which again showed dense political ignorance ) , and were invited to come at once and do what they had to do .
1	We have been so full of business all day , that we have not known what to do first , or which way to turn .
1	" A Doctor with a daughter .
1	Since then , I have taken heart to write a good many trifling pieces .
1	But ever while he laughs , he glances over his paralytic shoulder at <NAME> and eagerly watches him as he unlocks the padlock of a homely cupboard at the distant end of the gallery , looks here and there upon the higher shelves , and ultimately takes something out with a rustling of paper , folds it , and puts it in his breast .
1	' This is what boys and girls call disinterested affection , till they have boys and girls of their own , and then they see it in a rougher and very different light ! ' <NAME> ' s tears flowed fast , as she pleaded in extenuation that she was young and inexperienced ; that her attachment had alone induced her to take the step to which she had resorted ; and that she had been deprived of the counsel and guidance of her parents almost from infancy .
1	Tell your father , <NAME> , whether the milkman said so. ' ' My dear , it is the same thing. ' ' No it is not , ' said <NAME> , with the same impressive monotony .
1	' In her intellectual character it is pleasing to observe an insatiable thirst for knowledge , and a quick perception of the relations of things .
1	Without my knowing why , these tears allied themselves with the quietly sad smile which was so fixed in my remembrance , and shook me more with hope than fear or sorrow .
1	I come here , and your wife is not here .
1	But the governing powers of the <NAME> ' Company were always ready for them , by picking out a few boys who had turned out well in spite of the system , and roundly asserting that they could have only turned out well because of it .
1	There was a curious constraint between her and <NAME> , I thought ( of whom she seemed to be afraid ) , that never wore off .
1	In the afternoon of the next day , my old nurse and I went down to <NAME> .
1	I was up very early in the morning and called <NAME> to come for a walk .
1	' When did I first begin ? ' he rejoined , passing his hand across his brow .
1	" The wards in <NAME> -- Jarndyce of <NAME> -- Fitz-Jarndyce ! "
1	For I knew , now , that my own heart was undisciplined when it first loved <NAME> ; and that if it had been disciplined , it never could have felt , when we were married , what it had felt in its secret experience .
1	So could you. ' ' I hope so , ' replied <NAME> .
1	Tell me , Mr Dorrit , what surprise would be the most unlooked for and the most acceptable to you .
1	' Why all three are his own , ' returned <NAME> .
1	All the livelong day , there is a grinding of organs and clashing and clanging of little boxes of music ; for <NAME> is an eel-pot , which has no outlet but its awkward mouth -- a case-bottle which has no thoroughfare , and a short and narrow neck -- and in this respect it may be typical of the fate of some few among its more adventurous residents , who , after wriggling themselves into <NAME> by violent efforts and contortions , find that it , too , is no thoroughfare for them ; that , like <NAME> , it leads to nothing beyond itself ; and that they are fain at last to back out , no wiser , no richer , not one whit more famous , than they went in .
1	The mean man had , of course , got the better of the generous man .
1	Sometimes , of an evening , when I was at home and at work -- for I wrote a good deal now , and was beginning in a small way to be known as a writer -- I would lay down my pen , and watch my child-wife trying to be good .
1	' In the very hour of his return almost -- before the shoe upon his foot is dry -- he asperses his father ' s memory to his mother !
1	But see how they glisten with old remembrances !
1	But it ' s not that ; oh , no , it ' s not that. ' ' How do you know it ' s not that ? ' said <NAME> , after a silence .
1	( Our Chancery phrases , my love . )
1	Most inquiries there I leave to you , if you 'll be so good as to make 'em .
1	'But where can I find you again when it is necessary ? '
1	This is not to be received as a figure of speech .
1	When he received her letter he was greatly moved , but did not the less sensibly feel that she was far divided from him by more than distance .
1	The dolls ' dressmaker sat with her attitude unchanged , eyeing the door by which he had departed , until <NAME> pushed her bench aside and sat down near her .
1	" An arrow launched at my brain by my own child ! "
1	The humble individual who addresses you was once under her charge .
1	Not a day passed without my going there , of course .
1	' And I think , ' added Mr Inspector , in conclusion , ' that if all goes well with him , he ' s in a tolerable way of getting it .
1	If you please , miss , I am a little present with his love , and it was all done for the love of you .
1	The shade of a young butcher rises , like the apparition of an armed head in <NAME> .
1	We ' re no losers , anyhow. " For -- don ' t you see , ' said <NAME> , touching me with his pipe , ' it ain ' t likely that a man so short of breath as myself , and a grandfather too , would go and strain points with a little bit of a blue-eyed blossom , like her ? ' ' Not at all , I am certain , ' said I .
1	<NAME> , my dear , arrange with <NAME> about money , and let her have it when and how she pleases .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , proceed. ' Miss <NAME> turned my letter , so as to bring the superscription towards herself , and referred through her eye-glass to some orderly-looking notes she had made on that part of it .
1	As to <NAME> , he was becoming that not unprecedented triumph of calculation which is usually at work on number one .
1	'Not to press you to alter your determination , ' pursued the young man , 'but to hear you repeat it , if you would .
1	The Captain never dreamed that in the event of his being pounced upon by <NAME> , in his walks , it would be possible to offer resistance .
1	It is quite a novelty to have the blinds up , and the shutters open ; and they make themselves dismally comfortable over bottles of wine , which are freely broached as on a festival .
1	Under pretence of looking for <NAME> , she got him out against the stream of gay company now pouring in for the evening assembly , and got him into a coach that had just set down its load , and got him home .
1	Long enough to be chilled to the heart , but I don ' t know how long .
1	But I , misled by the action , and confused by the occasion , shook hands with him with every testimony of warm affection .
1	For <NAME> is as proud , <NAME> ' am , ' said the Major , ' as Lucifer. ' ' A charming quality , ' lisped <NAME> ; ' reminding one of dearest Edith. ' ' Well , <NAME> ' am , ' said the Major .
1	I need not add , after what you have said , that I have not yet found my arguments successful .
1	I have perfect confidence in my partner , and I am satisfied that he will do what is best .
1	Must he go wrong all through wi ' this side , or must he go wrong all through wi ' that , or else be hunted like a hare ? ' ' Indeed , indeed , I pity him from my heart , ' returned <NAME> ; ' and I hope that he will clear himself. ' ' You need have no fear of that , young lady .
1	As she sat looking fixedly at them , rather than at him , she plucked the feathers from a pinion of some rare and beautiful bird , which hung from her wrist by a golden thread , to serve her as a fan , and rained them on the ground .
1	that Knuckleboy , ' said Mrs. Squeers impatiently .
1	The spirit of contradiction was strong in <NAME> 's breast , at the moment ; and it was rendered stronger by his friend 's confident smile .
1	Will you have the goodness to come a little forward , <NAME> ? ' The apple-faced man having sheepishly complied with this request , stood chuckling and grinning in a front row .
1	I made my way to <NAME> , and said , that I believed I had the pleasure of seeing an old schoolfellow there .
1	'Is this the <NAME> ? '
1	There was a bar at the <NAME> , with some alarmingly long chalk scores in it on the wall at the side of the door , which seemed to me to be never paid off .
1	Oh , my lungs and liver , what do you want ?
1	I ran to him -- as well as I know , to repeat my appeal for help .
1	Under cover of the night , the feeble-minded beadle comes flitting about <NAME> with his summonses , in which every juror 's name is wrongly spelt , and nothing rightly spelt but the beadle 's own name , which nobody can read or wants to know .
1	As I never heard of its working that effect anywhere else , I infer that it never will , here .
1	' He was killed , ' gasped <NAME> .
1	Would you use a carpet having a representation of flowers upon it ? ' There being a general conviction by this time that ' No , sir ! ' was always the right answer to this gentleman , the chorus of <NAME> was very strong .
1	<NAME> <NAME> quite frightened and feeling all round himself , but not able to find it . )
1	Lastly , from her pocket , and from the chimney-piece , and from an inverted basin on the highest shelf she brought halfpence , a few sixpences , fewer shillings , and fell to laboriously and noiselessly counting them , and setting aside one little heap .
1	We will devise a story for you that should carry you through twenty times such a trivial scrape as this ; and if they want security in a thousand pounds for your reappearance in case you should be called upon , you shall have it .
1	The flag with the inscription <NAME> ' S HORSE-RIDING was there ; and the <NAME> niche was there ; but <NAME> was not there .
1	<NAME> needed no prompting to despatch , and in little more than five minutes they were on their way to <NAME> .
1	You have expended a great deal on my education , and have always been as liberal to me in all things as it was possible to be .
1	' Won ' t THAT extract a look from him ? ' -- ' Can it be possible THAT makes no impression on him ? ' Such questions <NAME> would propose to herself , often as many times in a day as there were hours in it .
1	' You used the same expression that night , at the door , when I asked you what was going on here .
1	He had fully convinced himself , notwithstanding , that his own proper share of the <NAME> was three and ninepence a week ; and that in this amount he , as an individual collegian , was swindled by the marshal , regularly every Monday .
1	My mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman .
1	Will you have a glass of wine ? ' ' Yes , I will , ' said the man ; ' and I don ' t deceive you , Governors. ' It was given him .
1	All this , I say , was wonderfully fine ; but I must say , too , that there were times when it was very dreary .
1	At last , one afternoon her husband ( to whom she had never , on any persuasion , opened her lips since that night ) , standing at the great south window , saw her drop upon the pavement .
1	I had had a moment 's time to think , since I had urged that duty on myself , and I was quite sure .
1	The truth is , that the old lady ' s evidently increasing admiration was <NAME> ' s principal inducement for going away .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , heartily glad to effect the proposed compromise , gave in her willing adhesion to it .
1	He dressed himself " all in his best , " and at last got out into the streets .
1	You must be broken of it .
1	My poor little wife was in such affliction when she thought I should be annoyed , and in such a state of joy when she found I was not , that the discomfiture I had subdued , very soon vanished , and we passed a happy evening ; Dora sitting with her arm on my chair while <NAME> and I discussed a glass of wine , and taking every opportunity of whispering in my ear that it was so good of me not to be a cruel , cross old boy .
1	<NAME> <NAME> journeys to <NAME> and meets with a romantic Adventure with a middle-aged Lady in yellow Curl-papers 23 .
1	' I tell you they 'll never open it .
1	She was reclining on a sofa in such a very unstudied attitude , that she might have been taken for an actress all ready for the first scene in a ballet , and only waiting for the drop curtain to go up .
1	Containing the Story of the <NAME> ' s Uncle 50 .
1	But you ' ll excuse me if I say , sir , that there are neither slaves nor slave-drivers in this country , and that people are not allowed to take the law into their own hands .
1	' You have been so very anxious I am sure you are not well. ' ' I am as well , ' returned the old man , shutting up his right hand , and holding it out to show her : ' as well and firm as any man at my time of life can hope to be .
1	The fact is , <NAME> , I was unable to repurchase them at the time of their seizure ; in the first place , because the broker , having an idea that I wanted them , ran the price up to an extravagant extent ; and , in the second place , because I -- hadn ' t any money .
1	At the sight of him laughing in that absurd way , the dolls ' dressmaker laughed very heartily indeed .
1	Ten or a dozen years .
1	We were left to ourselves now , and looked very blank , I recollect , on one another .
1	It would be worth no man ' s while to mislead me ; it would really be too easy -- too poor a success , to yield any satisfaction .
1	Oh , my <NAME> , may I beg a word with you ? "
1	The young gentlemen oozed away , semi-annually , to their own homes ; but they never broke up .
1	The small servant stood with humility in presence of <NAME> , and hung her head .
1	Seemed to scent a creditor .
1	We dine soon afterwards with the boarders in the house , and have nothing to drink but tea and coffee .
1	Mr Dombey , not knowing the game , sat down to watch them for his edification until <NAME> should return .
1	He finds himself again constantly in bars of public-houses , being treated and lying dreadfully .
1	inquired <NAME> , casting a contemptuous look at <NAME> .
1	I tell you again , <NAME> is my sister .
1	But , when one means to be good-natured and sportive with young people , one doesn ' t think twice .
1	So strange to have lived to his time of life , and yet to be beginning like a boy this summer morning !
1	' Our brother is not worth a thought , far less a tear .
1	I felt then , more than ever , that she was my better <NAME> ; and if I thought of her sweet face and placid smile , as though they had shone on me from some removed being , like an <NAME> , I hope I thought no harm .
1	I call her probably the very worst woman that ever lived in the world , except my drunken grandmother .
1	The commodities chiefly exposed for sale in the public streets are marine stores , hard-bake , apples , flat-fish , and oysters .
1	I do not remember that I ever saw a light in all the house .
1	He began to rub his head again and to hint that he felt the wind .
1	<NAME> continued to sit on the large stone , meditating upon what was best to be done , and revolving in his mind a plan for knocking at all the doors within five miles of <NAME> , taking them at a hundred and fifty or two hundred a day , and endeavouring to find <NAME> by that expedient , when accident all of a sudden threw in his way what he might have sat there for a twelvemonth and yet not found without it .
1	It was in these apartments that Mr <NAME> made use of the expressions above recorded for the consolation and encouragement of his desponding friend ; and it may not be uninteresting or improper to remark that even these brief observations partook in a double sense of the figurative and poetical character of Mr <NAME> ' s mind , as the rosy wine was in fact represented by one glass of cold gin-and-water , which was replenished as occasion required from a bottle and jug upon the table , and was passed from one to another , in a scarcity of tumblers which , as Mr <NAME> ' s was a bachelor ' s establishment , may be acknowledged without a blush .
1	It was in his childish days .
1	<NAME> to me to-morrow , and keep your own counsel on this subject -- though I need hardly tell you that ; for you ' ll do so for your own sakes .
1	' <NAME> will repeat to me tomorrow morning before breakfast , without book , and from the <NAME> , the first chapter of the <NAME> of <NAME> to the Ephesians .
1	I have brought misery on what I dearly love , I know -- you know !
1	' Bless me ! ' said <NAME> , stepping hastily forward , ' what is the matter ? ' This inquiry produced in <NAME> violent symptoms of a relapse ; and several young ladies , darting angry looks at <NAME> , applied more vinegar and hartshorn , and said it was ' a shame. ' ' What is a shame ? ' demanded <NAME> .
1	' How ' s my <NAME> , best of children , object dearest affections broken-hearted invalid ? ' To which the person of the house , stretching out her arm in an attitude of command , replied with irresponsive asperity : ' Go along with you !
1	I threw it off in argument some little time back .
1	" Time 's up , " said <NAME> , " and I must be off .
1	He had no particular design or plan before him : no energetic wickedness ruffled his lassitude .
1	He kept his eyes upon her , and kept advancing ; and she , completely under his influence , kept retiring before him .
1	I have had a tiring day , and I ' ll go to bed. ' This broke up the agreeable party .
1	Put her in a room in <NAME> here with any six people old enough to be her parents , and her parents may be there for anything she knows .
1	' I imagine not , sir -- I imagine not , ' said <NAME> , in a very peremptory tone .
1	It was a most wonderful closet , worthy of <NAME> and of <NAME> .
1	Do you suppose I haven ' t often thought that things might go on irregular and untidy here , after I was taken away ?
1	But it won ' t. ' ' Won ' t be smoothed down ? ' said I .
1	The success of this first achievement prompted the malicious crowd , whose faces were clustered together in every variety of lank and half-starved ugliness , to further acts of outrage .
1	You shall tell her , Mr Clennam .
1	<NAME> being presently served up stairs , he kept a watch on Fledgeby until <NAME> ' s cup was empty , and then directed him with his finger ( as if that young gentleman were a slow Retriever ) to go and fetch it .
1	<NAME> <NAME> draws near and examines the directions .
1	<NAME> <NAME> threw himself into the business with a will , and by nine o'clock last night he housed <NAME> , <NAME> , or <NAME> , -- whichever it may be , -- you and I do n't want to know , -- quite successfully .
1	In fact , as to this question of opposition , the fair <NAME> 's observation was superfluous , <NAME> on these occasions always delivering in his own candidateship , as a kind of handsome wholesale order to be promptly executed .
1	It was all right enough. ' ' One of the gentlemen , the one who didn ' t speak while I was there , looked hard at me .
1	' I believe , sir , ' quoth Mrs. Sparsit , ' you wished to see me. ' ' I beg your pardon , ' he said , turning and removing his hat ; ' pray excuse me. ' ' Humph ! ' thought Mrs. Sparsit , as she made a stately bend .
1	Mr Quilp could scarcely be said to be of any particular trade or calling , though his pursuits were diversified and his occupations numerous .
1	What shall we do ? ' Do ! ' said the stout old host , who regarded only the last words of the sentence .
1	You mind what I say , do you ? ' ' I hear , ' said <NAME> .
1	He had scarcely time to take down his canister , and stealthily convey some money into the hands of <NAME> , his former favourite , and <NAME> , who had the claim upon him that he was naturally of a maritime build , before the <NAME> was abandoned by them all ; and <NAME> whispering that he ' d carry on smart , and hail <NAME> again before he went aboard , shut the door upon himself , as the last member of the party .
1	But , I said to <NAME> that , before I could go abroad , I must see both <NAME> and <NAME> .
1	It appears to me that this maxim is applicable to the medical as well as to the nautical profession .
1	Entirely , sir ! ' said <NAME> , in a lower and triumphant tone .
1	' Something might ? ' ' If <NAME> ' s movements are really watched , and if the purpose really is to isolate him from all friends and acquaintance and wear his daily life out grain by grain ( which would seem to be the threat to you ) , does it not appear likely , ' said <NAME> , ' that his enemy would in some way communicate with <NAME> to warn him off from <NAME> ?
1	I 'm wrong out of the forge , the kitchen , or off th ' meshes .
1	There is exceedingly mild porter , sir , in the immediate vicinity , and the contingent advantages are extraordinary. ' ' What ' s the rent ? ' said the single gentleman .
1	The governor , as her Majesty ' s representative , delivered what may be called the Speech from the Throne .
1	Meantime she must be careful in no thoughtless word , or look , or burst of feeling awakened by any chance circumstance , to complain against him , or to give occasion for these whispers to his prejudice .
1	<NAME> therefore slipped quietly out , and went to brother <NAME> ' s room .
1	' Would you let a woman like this , whom you could see , if you had any experience of anything , to be as false and insolent as a woman can be -- would you let her put her foot upon your family , and thank her for it ? ' ' <NAME> , <NAME> , I am sure. ' ' Then make her pay for it , you mean little thing .
1	" We should look at this ! " he said .
1	He saw many visitors ; overlooked a number of documents ; went in and out , to and from , sundry places of mercantile resort ; and indulged in no more abstraction until the day ' s business was done .
1	inquired the <NAME> ; taking advantage of the next interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the question .
1	" You are bound to say of where. " Which he was , as a Finch .
1	Above the <NAME> was Mrs Gowan ' s residence .
1	' <NAME> , ' said Mr Dombey , ' this is my daughter Florence .
1	Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from his mind .
1	Their especial interest in the public-house would seem to imply some latent rakishness in the canine character ; for little was eaten there , and they , having no taste for beer or tobacco ( Mrs <NAME> ' s dog is said to have smoked , but proof is wanting ) , could only have been attracted by sympathy with loose convivial habits .
1	" You have a child ; I have none .
1	I know to a figure how you done it .
1	Better to borrow , better to beg , better to die ! "
1	But you said to-night that you would not be afraid of him , under any circumstances , and that gives me—who am so much afraid of him—courage to tell only you .
1	' The unities of the drama , before everything. ' ' Might I ask you , ' said <NAME> , hesitating between the respect he ought to assume , and his love of the whimsical , ' might I ask you what the unities are ? ' <NAME> coughed and considered .
1	'The very same man I told you of , who came so suddenly upon me at the inn , ' said <NAME> .
1	As it was clear that he was a choleric fellow in some respects , Mr <NAME> was relieved to find him in such good humour , and , to encourage him in it , smiled himself .
1	Several indignant glances directed at me .
1	' But luckily he hadn ' t to deal with the people he supposed , <NAME> , my dear ! ' said Mr Boffin .
1	'Suppose that lad , ' pursued <NAME> , 'was to peach -- to blow upon us all -- first seeking out the right folks for the purpose , and then having a meeting with 'em in the street to paint our likenesses , describe every mark that they might know us by , and the crib where we might be most easily taken .
1	" His successor informed me of it yesterday , " said <NAME> .
1	' No , <NAME> , upon my word !
1	I wish we could be brought to consider this , and remembering natural obligations a little more at the right time , talk about them a little less at the wrong one. ' After this , brother <NAME> , who had talked himself into a great heat , stopped to cool a little , and then continued : ' I dare say you are surprised , my dear sir , that I have listened to your recital with so little astonishment .
1	The breath was scarcely out o ' your poor mother- in-law ' s body , ven vun old ' ooman sends me a pot o ' jam , and another a pot o ' jelly , and another brews a blessed large jug o ' camomile-tea , vich she brings in vith her own hands. ' <NAME> paused with an aspect of intense disgust , and looking round , added in a whisper , ' They wos all widders , <NAME> , all on ' em , ' cept the camomile-tea vun , as wos a single young lady o ' fifty-three. ' <NAME> gave a comical look in reply , and the old gentleman having broken an obstinate lump of coal , with a countenance expressive of as much earnestness and malice as if it had been the head of one of the widows last-mentioned , said : ' In short , <NAME> , I feel that I ain ' t safe anyveres but on the box. ' ' How are you safer there than anyveres else ? ' interrupted <NAME> .
1	When they arrived there , <NAME> left <NAME> in the coach , under pretence of preparing the old gentleman to receive him ; and sending up her card by the servant , requested to see <NAME> on very pressing business .
1	' Will you hold your tongue -- female ? ' said <NAME> , plunging violently into this dialogue .
1	I had no companion left but my bird , and him I carried with me in his cage .
1	We have been checked -- brought up suddenly , I would say -- upon the -- shall I term it threshold ? "
1	<NAME> ha ha ha ha ! ' Mrs <NAME> clapped her hands again , rocked herself again , beat her feet upon the floor , and wiped the tears of laughter from her eyes .
1	' Oh , if it ' s nothing particular , ' said <NAME> , with a smile , ' you can speak with me first. ' ' I think I ' d better see arter it at once , ' said <NAME> , still hesitating .
1	The voices in the waves speak low to him of <NAME> , day and night -- plainest when he , his blooming daughter , and her husband , beside them in the evening , or sit at an open window , listening to their roar .
1	The <NAME> looked at her wistfully , and repeated ' No , ' -- still lingering , and still showing embarrassment .
1	The recollection of all the wrongs he had sustained at <NAME> ' s hands , had crowded on <NAME> ' s mind , the moment <NAME> began to speak ; it wanted but a feather to turn the scale , and ' old Fireworks ' did it .
1	<NAME> clenched his teeth ; took one look around ; threw over the prostrate form of <NAME> , the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled ; ran along the front of the hedge , as if to distract the attention of those behind , from the spot where the boy lay ; paused , for a second , before another hedge which met it at right angles ; and whirling his pistol high into the air , cleared it at a bound , and was gone .
1	The box was packed at last , and then there came supper , with some little delicacy provided for the occasion , and as a set-off against the expense of which , <NAME> and her mother had feigned to dine when <NAME> was out .
1	After a moment ' s silence , <NAME> asked , in a more sprightly manner : ' And where ' s <NAME> , <NAME> dear ? ' -- for by that patriarchal appellation , Mr <NAME> was generally known in the family .
1	The horses in the stages that were going out , and had come through the city , were smoking so , that the outside passengers were invisible .
1	<NAME> says anything , at any meal , to anybody .
1	And if the <NAME> of <NAME> , a little hurt and irritated at this , took heart , and ventured to suggest that his wife was at least no worse off than the wives of other barons , the <NAME> begged all persons to take notice , that nobody but she , sympathised with her dear daughter ' s sufferings ; upon which , her relations and friends remarked , that to be sure she did cry a great deal more than her son-in-law , and that if there were a hard-hearted brute alive , it was that <NAME> of <NAME> .
1	The knocker made a more energetic reply than words could have yielded , for it continued to hammer with surprising force and noise , without a moment ' s cessation .
1	Even when that event had happened , to the great relief of everybody , he was heard under the portico , during the rest of the ceremony , now fainter , now louder , now hushed , now bursting forth again with an irrepressible sense of his wrongs .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , mighty proud of the compliment , sets herself to consider ; but it is long before a bright thought occurs to her .
1	The <NAME> and the <NAME> then passed on together until they parted , with many ceremonies , at the <NAME> ' s door ; even then the <NAME> carried his hat under his arm , and gave his streaming white hair to the breeze .
1	His manner was grave , but not coarse , and derived some dignity from a certain repressed dislike of the tone of the conversation .
1	In the active superintendence of this young person , <NAME> appears to attain a perfectly geological age and to date from the remotest periods .
1	This <NAME> was <NAME> , <NAME> , to the <NAME> of such Other Countries as -- as there may happen to be .
1	But it would be safer to avoid seeing the daughter , because the son had seen <NAME> , and -- he could not be too careful -- there might possibly be some comparison of notes between the son and daughter , which would awaken slumbering suspicion , and lead to consequences .
1	I wish all this were over. ' ' Over , <NAME> ! ' repeated a female voice behind him , in a kind of plaintive surprise .
1	He was rather taken aback by the sudden firmness with which <NAME> looked up and answered him .
1	At this rate you wo n't last my time . "
1	After our former interview , it would be monstrous in me if I did otherwise. ' She slowly withdrew her eyes from his face , and turning to the servant , said , ' Some other room. ' He led the way to a drawing-room , which he speedily lighted up and then left them .
1	He set himself to find out , for the man might prove to be a messenger between those two .
1	It was all part of a system .
1	But it rusted and cankered at your father 's heart for years . '
1	<NAME> half a dozen more if you like , and we ' ll find room for ' em .
1	And now I fell into a state of neglect , which I can not look back upon without compassion .
1	This reminded <NAME> that the boy in gray was looking on , with eyes wide open , and greedy ears .
1	He had hardly finished one long resounding knock , when he turned to the knocker again and began another .
1	His appearance , after visiting Mrs. Smallweed with one of these admonitions , is particularly impressive and not wholly prepossessing , firstly because the exertion generally twists his black skull-cap over one eye and gives him an air of goblin rakishness , secondly because he mutters violent imprecations against Mrs. Smallweed , and thirdly because the contrast between those powerful expressions and his powerless figure is suggestive of a baleful old malignant who would be very wicked if he could .
1	'Ah , to be sure , ' said the <NAME> ; 'when is it to be done , <NAME> ? '
1	The only doubt in <NAME> was , whether <NAME> had written in good faith , believing that he really would come back , or warning him to fly .
1	says <NAME> with a low whistle as he sees both grandfather and granddaughter looking hard at him .
1	' <NAME> ? ' cried the little creature , glancing sharply at my face , and then peeping round at <NAME> ' s .
1	A very good likeness in its way , but it wants force of character .
1	You may depend upon it they do , <NAME> , and that ' s the reason they are all near you , and he has put the gravel there , because it ' s the sunny side .
1	He stopped his work when we went in , took off his spectacles , and answered freely to everything that was said to him , but always with a strange kind of pause first , and in a low , thoughtful voice .
1	She was still ruminating upon his curious behaviour , when the floor of the crazy stairs and landing cracked beneath the tread of the other travellers who were passing to their beds .
1	Closed in by night with broad screens , and illumined only in that part , the light of the drawing-room seems gradually contracting and dwindling until it shall be no more .
1	<NAME> <NAME> ! ' ' You were brought up by an uncle , then ? ' said I .
1	' At this very moment , the gentleman in sky-blue turning round , and seeing the young lady with her face uncovered , vented an exclamation of rage and jealousy , and , turning his weapon against her beautiful bosom , pointed a thrust at her heart , which caused my uncle to utter a cry of apprehension that made the building ring .
1	Then , we had chess for those who played it , whist , cribbage , books , backgammon , and shovelboard .
1	' Believe me ; if you knew all , much needed. ' ' I can believe that , ' said <NAME> , with a softening glance at the little creature .
1	Except that I remember them both to have been -- like myself -- timorous of highwaymen , and the prisoner has not a timorous air. " " Did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity , <NAME> ? " " I certainly have seen that. " " Mr .
1	We name our fondlings in alphabetical order .
1	It can do no good , and it might cause her to reproach herself. ' ' My dearest girl , ' urged Mr <NAME> , ' she ought to know it. ' ' No , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , in a tone of resolute self-denial .
1	Ask him , is that so. " " It is so , " assented <NAME> once more .
1	While he was yet yielding himself up to these fancies he fell asleep , and , dreaming of <NAME> , forgot them .
1	' Is it ! ' said my aunt .
1	To make your mother a fright upon your wedding-day ! ' <NAME> bent the same fixed look upon her , as she sobbed and rubbed her eyes ; and said in the same low steady voice , which had neither risen nor fallen since she first addressed her , ' I have said that <NAME> must go home. ' ' Let her go ! ' cried the afflicted and affrighted parent , hastily .
1	<NAME> and despised by even the few who are cognisant of its miserable and disgraceful existence , stifled by the very filth it so profusely scatters , rendered deaf and blind by the exhalations of its own slime , the obscene journal , happily unconscious of its degraded state , is rapidly sinking beneath that treacherous mud which , while it seems to give it a firm standing with the low and debased classes of society , is nevertheless rising above its detested head , and will speedily engulf it for ever. ' Having delivered this manifesto ( which formed a portion of his last week ' s leader ) with vehement articulation , the editor paused to take breath , and looked majestically at <NAME> .
1	The phantom that my mind pursued , was another and more real child .
1	I think I have noticed that they have an inconsistent way of speaking about her , as if she had made some great self-interested success in marrying Mr Gowan , though , at the same time , the very same people , would not have dreamed of taking him for themselves or their daughters .
1	You are the ruin of me. ' She started at the passionate sound of the last words , and at the passionate action of his hands , with which they were accompanied .
1	Then he is half-eaten by the rats in an hour ' s time ; as that man was ; and there an end .
1	I am sure it must be <NAME> ' s doing. ' The arm <NAME> had begun to twine around her neck , unbent itself .
1	" My dear <NAME> , " said <NAME> , poking the fire , " I 'll take an oath it 's either in the east or going to be .
1	The old man and the child passed on through the glad silence , elate with hope and pleasure .
1	I can not bear to think of what did come , upon that memorable night ; of what must come again , if I go on .
1	It is said , at any rate .
1	' I ' m very sorry if -- ' ' <NAME> , <NAME> ' am ! ' said <NAME> , ' sorry in the possession of a <NAME> !
1	' Did you speak , <NAME> ? ' inquired <NAME> , senior , after an awful silence .
1	If you knew how often I have tried to speak to you to-day , you would almost pity me .
1	' All that has ever been in my mind , since I was married , ' she said in a low , submissive , tender voice , ' I will lay bare before you .
1	Some few attempts at cleanliness and order were manifest , though made in a reckless , gipsy way , that might have connected them , at a glance , with the younger woman .
1	By slow degrees , however , he was reconciled to him in the end ; and even went so far as to honour him with his patronage , as one who had in some measure reformed , and was therefore to be forgiven .
1	' It still wants a pair of arms .
1	That ' s the lad ! ' <NAME> pulled down his spectacles from his forehead to his eyes , and looked at <NAME> Junior standing upright in the corner : his head presenting the appearance ( which it always did ) of having been newly drawn out of a bucket of cold water ; his small waistcoat rising and falling quickly in the play of his emotions ; and his eyes intently fixed on Mr Carker , without the least reference to his proposed master .
1	Mrs Blimber was a little alarmed by this -- comparatively speaking -- profligate behaviour ; and especially by the alteration in the character of the music , which , beginning to comprehend low melodies that were popular in the streets , might not unnaturally be supposed to give offence to <NAME> .
1	I tried this , I tried that , I tried t ' other .
1	' Silence ! ' cried <NAME> , suddenly rising up , and striking his desk with the book .
1	When Mr <NAME> had looked at him , and told him he was young , and that his <NAME> ' s circumstances were not good , there had been an expression of disdain in his face ; a contemptuous and disparaging assumption that he would be quite content to live idly on a reduced old man , which stung the boy ' s generous soul .
1	The old woman ' s face was shrewdly anxious and expectant ; that of her daughter was expectant too , but in a less sharp degree , and sometimes it darkened , as if with gathering disappointment and incredulity .
1	If I had had a conjuror ' s cap , there is no one I should have wished for but you ! ' ' What ? ' returned <NAME> .
1	The three had risen , and their heads were together when he came back to the garret .
1	Again and again the old lady hangs upon her son 's neck , and again and again the trooper holds her to his broad chest .
1	<NAME> as it always is to consider any assembly in the act of submissively resigning itself to the dreariness of some complacent person , lord or commoner , whom three-fourths of it could , by no human means , raise out of the slough of inanity to their own intellectual level , it was particularly strange , and it was even particularly affecting , to see this crowd of earnest faces , whose honesty in the main no competent observer free from bias could doubt , so agitated by such a leader .
1	What with one job and another , there ' s lodging -- and good lodging too -- pretty well all the year round , rent free , and a weekly allowance besides , <NAME> , that would provide her with a great many comforts she don ' t at present enjoy .
1	Even now , coming round by the <NAME> 's Arms with the intention of passing down the court , and out at the <NAME> end , and so terminating his unpremeditated after-supper stroll of ten minutes ' long from his own door and back again , <NAME> approaches .
1	Anything you like. " " But , <NAME> , do hear me speak .
1	There ' ll be some lost time to make up , of course .
1	I verily believe that the announcement in the newspapers when his mother was confined was 'On Tuesday last , at her residence in Botheration Buildings , Mrs. Skimpole of a son in difficulties . ' "
1	Then , such an oracle as she became in reference to the localities !
1	would n't you like to be a book-writer ? '
1	<NAME> , do you turn against me after these many years ? ' ' I do , if it ' s turning against you to hear what I don ' t know , and say what I know .
1	' She always was clever , ' said poor Mrs. Nickleby , brightening up , ' always , from a baby .
1	The <NAME> ' s concern for his friend , not unmingled , at first , with some concern for himself -- for a shadowy terror that he might be married by violence , possessed him , until his knowledge of the service came to his relief , and remembering the legal obligation of saying , ' I will , ' he felt himself personally safe so long as he resolved , if asked any question , distinctly to reply ' I won ' t ' -- threw him into a profuse perspiration ; and rendered him , for a time , insensible to the movements of the procession , of which he now formed a feature , and to the conversation of his fair companion .
1	' Ah , run avay , ' said <NAME> , jumping up on the box .
1	An enormous ditch , sometimes two or three miles wide , running liquid mud , six miles an hour : its strong and frothy current choked and obstructed everywhere by huge logs and whole forest trees : now twining themselves together in great rafts , from the interstices of which a sedgy , lazy foam works up , to float upon the water ' s top ; now rolling past like monstrous bodies , their tangled roots showing like matted hair ; now glancing singly by like giant leeches ; and now writhing round and round in the vortex of some small whirlpool , like wounded snakes .
1	' He is dead , ' said <NAME> .
1	' Not vary ! ' repeated <NAME> , raising his eyes to the ceiling .
1	You are that restless and that roving -- " " Yes !
1	In all sorts of recesses , and on all kinds of brackets , stood massive old silver candlesticks with four branches each .
1	Is there nothing you can tell me if you will ?
1	I ' ll begin it. ' ' You seem disappointed , ' observed <NAME> .
1	" At it again , in a new direction !
1	Will you give me the address ? ' Mr <NAME> repeated it , and the Secretary wrote it down in his pocket-book .
1	The pupils then entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the subject of <NAME> , with the view of ascertaining who could tread the hardest upon whose toes .
1	You and I may well stumble at the word , ' returned <NAME> , laughing .
1	'You seem to think , ' retorted the doctor , 'that everybody is disposed to be hard-hearted to-day , except yourself , <NAME> .
1	A long silence ensued ; during which the Jew was plunged in deep thought , with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy perfectly demoniacal .
1	' I left off as I began -- of my own fancy. ' The exquisite indifference of her manner in saying this : an indifference quite removed from dulness or insensibility , for it was pointed with proud purpose : was well set off by the carelessness with which she drew her hand across the strings , and came from that part of the room .
1	Would you wish to have it up to-night , my boy , and drink to <NAME> ' r and his wife ? ' The Instrument-maker , looking wistfully at the <NAME> , puts his hand into the breast-pocket of his coffee-coloured coat , brings forth his pocket-book , and takes a letter out .
1	At length , between ten and eleven o ' clock at night , a few feeble lights appeared in the distance , and <NAME> , an <NAME> village , where we were to stay till morning , lay before us .
1	Elsewhere , people are restless , worried , hurried about , anxious respecting one thing , anxious respecting another .
1	<NAME> , " said <NAME> , when I told him so , " is the best of housewives , and I really do not know what my Clara would do without her motherly help .
1	But I thought -- I implore you to remember the narrow construction which has been my besetting sin -- that , in a case where there was so much disparity in point of years -- ' ' That ' s the way to put it , you see , <NAME> ! ' observed <NAME> , with fawning and offensive pity .
1	Yet I held some station at <NAME> and <NAME> ' s too .
1	I did so , that I might endeavour to render you and your family some service .
1	<NAME> Micawber himself came down to the counting-house , in the afternoon , to tell <NAME> that he must relinquish me on the day of his departure , and to give me a high character , which I am sure I deserved .
1	' The night afore the last day o ' the last election here , the opposite party bribed the barmaid at the <NAME> , to hocus the brandy-and-water of fourteen unpolled electors as was a-stoppin ' in the house. ' ' What do you mean by " hocussing " brandy-and-water ? ' inquired <NAME> .
1	Yes , ' said <NAME> , aloud , as he locked his iron safe .
1	" <NAME> me , shep-herds , te-e-ell me ; tell me-e-e , have you seen ( have you seen , have you seen , have you seen ) my-y-y Flo-o-ora-a pass this way ! " ' Melodiously good Minor Canon the <NAME> thus delivers himself , in musical rhythm , as he withdraws his amiable face from the doorway and conveys it down-stairs .
1	' My dear , ' he continued , ' this is an occasion -- ha -- teeming with a good example .
1	And you can come down from a balloon in a parach -- no you can ' t though .
1	So as he won ' t give me up , I ' m a-going to give him up. ' ' How , <NAME> ? ' ' I ' m a-going to run away from him. ' With an astonished look at the indomitable old face and the bright eyes , the Secretary repeated , ' Run away from him ? ' ' Yes , sir , ' said <NAME> , with one nod .
1	He has long had money ( not overmuch as I make out ) in trust to dole out to her when she can ' t do without it .
1	" That 'll do , <NAME> , " said <NAME> , giving her a slight nod ; " you have been admired , and can go. " She withdrew her hands and went out of the room , and <NAME> , putting the decanters on from his dumb-waiter , filled his glass and passed round the wine .
1	They wouldn ' t wring his neck and me by , no , no .
1	' I won ' t be held ! ' cried the old man .
1	Bless you , <NAME> , she expected they ' d come back to her house. ' ' Then where the devil is the woman ? ' said the impatient gentleman , catching up his hat .
1	' Let me go with you. ' ' Not to-night .
1	Having got behind the hedge , and put him in the light , I took a shot at him and brought him down plump .
1	<NAME> broke down in a piece of knitting , and no one but <NAME> was able to put the defaulter in the right direction .
1	<NAME> , like a giant , fills the church , from pavement to roof , and holds dominion through the silent hours .
1	' I ' ve brought you a softer pillow , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' instead of the temporary one you had last night. ' ' Thank you , ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the <NAME> , and was overcome with penitence and grief .
1	' What motive—even what motive in reason—can you have for preventing the escape of this wretched youth , ' said <NAME> , ' and crushing his miserable father ?
1	' Why , I ' m not exactly out of place , nor in , ' faltered <NAME> .
1	<NAME> placed his hands upon his knees , and , without uttering a syllable , continued the same close scrutiny of his companion ' s face .
1	' The frolicsome youth of the neighbourhood , ' said <NAME> , ' whom I should be delighted to pitch from this elevation into the churchyard below , without any intermediate ceremonies , have probably turned the lamp out .
1	( Cries of " Order , " " Chair , " " Yes , " " No , " " Go on , " " Leave off , " etc . )
1	That is my third dead child , and last .
1	Will it be believed that the governor of such a house as this , is appointed , and deposed , and changed perpetually , as <NAME> fluctuate and vary , and as their despicable weathercocks are blown this way or that ?
1	'She is looking down , and the candle is behind her .
1	' Wery glad you ' ve looked in accidentally , <NAME> .
1	' If he has seen any of them , he must have seen them in the street , going to , or returning from , their work , and not here .
1	' There is no hope for you .
1	<NAME> , ' continued Mrs. Pott , raising herself in the arms of her attendant , ' my brother , the lieutenant , shall interfere .
1	Is there anything the matter , my dear ?
1	That I should innocently take a bad half-crown of somebody else 's manufacture is reasonable enough ; but that I should knowingly reckon the spurious coin of my own make as good money !
1	If he withdrew them for a moment , it was only to glance at a clock in some neighbouring shop , and then to strain his sight once more in the old quarter with increased earnestness and attention .
1	The despairing way in which my mother and I look at each other , as I blunder on , is truly melancholy .
1	Let me go to the door. " He took the lamp in his hand , crossed the two intervening outer rooms , and opened it .
1	" He may have been married already , and her cruel mortification may have been a part of her half-brother 's scheme , " said <NAME> .
1	It ' s of no use pretending to make a secret of matters now , after what I have told you already ; you know she didn ' t marry old Bounderby for her own sake , or for his sake , but for my sake .
1	' Perhaps you ' ll ask him , ' said <NAME> , ' as he ' s a stranger ? ' ' Ask him what ? ' returned <NAME> .
1	<NAME> , in her innocent affliction , might have answered , ' Oh my brother , oh my dearly loved and loving brother !
1	For , it inscrutably appeared to stand to reason , in the minds of the whole company , that I was an excrescence on the entertainment .
1	My father thought you would get on more agreeably through to-morrow with me than with him , and might like to take a walk about <NAME> .
1	There is no help for it. " " But access to him , " said <NAME> , " if it should go ill before the <NAME> , will not save him. " " I never said it would. " <NAME> 's eyes gradually sought the fire ; his sympathy with his darling , and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest , gradually weakened them ; he was an old man now , overborne with anxiety of late , and his tears fell .
1	The design was efficacious ; for I remember that my mother seemed more at ease during the rest of the evening , and that <NAME> observed her less .
1	I hate mine. ' ' It was forced upon me , ' said the gloomy <NAME> , ' because it was understood that we wanted a barrister in the family .
1	<NAME> for some weeks backward and forward rush mysterious men with no names , who fly about all those particular parts of the country on which <NAME> is at present throwing himself in an auriferous and malty shower , but who are merely persons of a restless disposition and never do anything anywhere .
1	' I would n't abase myself by descending to hold no conversation with him , ' replied the Dodger .
1	<NAME> had done the <NAME> Head the honour to request that the supper should be choice and delicate .
1	' I admire your taste , sir , ' says <NAME> .
1	Let me but leave the good name to my three daughters , and that is enough for me ; I am not a self-seeker .
1	" Why , I would n't pass another night there for any consideration that you could offer me , " says <NAME> , haggardly staring .
1	I noticed the scantiest necessaries in the way of furniture ; a few old prints from books , of Chancellors and barristers , wafered against the wall ; and some half-dozen reticles and work-bags , " containing documents , " as she informed us .
1	It was understood to be a great occasion .
1	Really , <NAME> -- ' He turned to the other plump gentleman , and said , ' I forget your friend ' s name. ' ' Pickwick , ' said <NAME> , for it was no other than that jolly personage .
1	I am obliged to you , <NAME> ; it is like your usual discretion .
1	' An ancient flame , <NAME> , ' chuckled <NAME> .
1	But <NAME> was so pleased , when she had trained him to stand upon it without offering to come off , and at the same time to hold the pencil-case in his mouth , that I was very glad I had bought it .
1	It was occasioned , I suppose , by the reverend nature of respectability in the abstract , but I felt particularly young in this man ' s presence .
1	There are decent women in the house , I am told ; and it is a pity such a light as you should be among them , and concealed .
1	' Morning , morning , morning ! ' said Mr Boffin , with a wave of his hand , as the office door was opened by the dismal boy , whose appropriate name was <NAME> .
1	This is a good omen for you .
1	You 're not in a fit state to come here , if you ca n't come here without spluttering like a bad pen .
1	She has the most agreeable of faces , -- not absolutely beautiful , but extraordinarily pleasant , -- and is one of the most genial , unaffected , frank , engaging creatures I have ever seen .
1	I saw but little of the girl ' s face , over which her hair fell loose and scattered , as if she had been disordering it with her own hands ; but I saw that she was young , and of a fair complexion .
1	' This is your pocket-book , ' said <NAME> , producing one from his coat ; ' the certificates of your first marriage and of the boy ' s birth , and your wife ' s two letters , and every other paper that can support these statements directly or by implication , are here , are they ? ' ' Every one of ' em , sir. ' ' And you don ' t object to their being looked at here , so that these people may be convinced of your power to substantiate your claim at once in law and reason , and you may resume your control over your own son without more delay .
1	Another of the moral phenomena of <NAME> .
1	I ' ve been taking a part in <NAME> sand and grey sand .
1	If the dear old creatures were too bashful or too dull to assume their required places in the discussion , why then it would seem desirable that the dear old creatures should be taken by their heads and shoulders and brought into it .
1	She makes <NAME> money , sir , and never stands <NAME> ' orth Rum. ' ' Get on , ' rejoined <NAME> , tapping his palsied head with the fire-shovel , as it sank on his breast .
1	You know your aunt ? ' ' A little , ' I replied .
1	Although you can not be fully conscious of the villainy of this man to whom you are about to give your hand , some of his deeds you know .
1	His thoughts reverting from this occupation to the little old gentleman who had given him the shilling , he suddenly recollected that that was the very day -- nay , nearly the very hour -- at which the little old gentleman had said he should be at the Notary ' s house again .
1	And when you used to tell the stories ?
1	It is a partnership affair , a money-speculation .
1	' Well , then , why <NAME> ' T you think so ? ' said my aunt .
1	How dare you dash against—everybody—in this manner ? ' <NAME> picked up his cap , which the concussion had knocked off ; and backing , and knuckling his forehead , pleaded that it was an accident .
1	It had been lying there some days , for rain and dew had stained it , and the mark of its shape was on the grass where it had fallen .
1	<NAME> , too , as they came from work , proffered their help ; or sent their children with such small presents or loans as the strangers needed most .
1	' For I don ' t remember you. ' ' It ' s not at all likely you should .
1	And if the time should come when I can stretch out a hand to render the least service to one whom it is better not to name even here , I will not fail to do it for her dear daughter 's sake . "
1	' <NAME> ' s people have got three-and-thirty voters in the lock-up coach-house at the <NAME> Hart. ' ' In the coach-house ! ' said <NAME> , considerably astonished by this second stroke of policy .
1	Another thing in <NAME> that I could not understand when it first began to develop itself , but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension of , was this : As I became stronger and better , <NAME> became a little less easy with me .
1	' The question has been asked before , ' said <NAME> , ' and the answer has been , No .
1	' Where am I ? ' exclaimed <NAME> .
1	' It ' s a long way from her home to the wharf , and then she was alarmed to see a couple of young scoundrels fighting , and was timorous on the water besides .
1	They must not be confounded together .
1	As she gently opened the window , and looked eastward down the prison yard , the spikes upon the wall were tipped with red , then made a sullen purple pattern on the sun as it came flaming up into the heavens .
1	The moon , as <NAME> had foretold , was rapidly on the wane ; large tiers of dark , heavy clouds , which had been gradually overspreading the sky for some time past , now formed one black mass overhead ; and large drops of rain which pattered every now and then against the windows of the chaise , seemed to warn the travellers of the rapid approach of a stormy night .
1	I have said that I do not admit these things .
1	<NAME> topple in the streets , and people hold to posts and corners , and to one another , to keep themselves upon their feet .
1	<NAME> out , man , ' retorted <NAME> .
1	The air felt cold upon the river , but it was a bright day , and the sunshine was very cheering .
1	' They ' ll turn up presently , I dare say .
1	' He will do now , ' says the doctor , washing his hands , and looking at the patient with growing disfavour .
1	<NAME> ! " My uncle gave a loud stamp on the boot in the energy of the moment , and -- found that it was gray morning , and he was sitting in the wheelwright ' s yard , on the box of an old Edinburgh mail , shivering with the cold and wet and stamping his feet to warm them !
1	What ' s the matter ? ' <NAME> persisted that there was nothing the matter ; and maintained it so resolutely , that his nephew had no resource but to make a very indifferent imitation of believing him .
1	' Are you ill ? ' asked Kate .
1	If it ' s not a liberty , please to come and take a cup .
1	You make Mrs <NAME> ' s a thankless task .
1	In all the rooms , the mouldering shutters were fast closed : the bars which held them were screwed tight into the wood ; the only light which was admitted , stealing its way through round holes at the top : which made the rooms more gloomy , and filled them with strange shadows .
1	The town was as entirely deserted as if the inhabitants had abandoned it , rather than hold communication with him .
1	because I don ' t want the girls to see you. ' ' It ' s a fine day ; but would you like me to carry an umbrella up ? ' ' Don ' t be foolish , sir .
1	" And this poor person came about the house three or four days , hoping to get a glimpse of you , miss -- all she wanted , she said -- but you were away .
1	Again they went all round the room , scarcely heeding <NAME> if at all , and returned to that corner .
1	If you do otherwise , you will do wrong , and you will have made me do wrong in ever bringing you together . "
1	' Remember that this is <NAME> ' s stupendous collection of upwards of One <NAME> , and that it is the only collection in the world ; all others being imposters and deceptions .
1	' Wery , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> ; ' if ever I wanted anythin ' o ' my father , I always asked for it in a wery ' spectful and obligin ' manner .
1	He gave us to understand that in our children we lived again , and that , under the pressure of pecuniary difficulties , any accession to their number was doubly welcome .
1	The usual diligence and order of the Counting-house at the <NAME> were overthrown .
1	Under it , have I said ?
1	<NAME> sat upon the step of a door , leaned against a wall under an archway , strolled up and down , listened for the church clock , stopped and watched children playing in the street .
1	Mr Blandois , during this exposition , had been strictly attentive , keeping his eyes fastened on the lady , and thoughtfully stroking his moustache with his two hands .
1	Well , well , it 's no matter . '
1	' Take that card , my friend. ' ' I think I won ' t deprive you on it , ' returned the driver , casting his eyes over it with no great favour , without taking it .
1	Did they fly with him on that sudden journey ? -- and until the procession moves , and <NAME> 's view is changed .
1	' At about eight , ' said <NAME> .
1	We ordered something rather special for dinner , with a bottle of something similarly out of the common way , in order that our minds might be fortified for the occasion , and we might come well up to the mark .
1	' You will not undeceive her I hope , Mr Boffin ? ' she said , turning her head towards him , but not her eyes .
1	" None , little woman , that <NAME> would readily understand , " said he .
1	' Damn that boy , he ' s gone to sleep again .
1	' You don ' t expect <NAME> , I take it for granted ? ' ' No , sir .
1	Peeping cautiously over the side of his hammock , he descried <NAME> , to whom , after contemplating her for some time in silence , he communicated a violent start by suddenly yelling out -- ' Halloa ! ' ' Oh , <NAME> ! ' cried his poor little wife , looking up .
1	But is felled flat by <NAME> ' s taking it quite ill , and replying , No , he don ' t like town .
1	' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , closing the door , and keeping his hand on the knob of the lock .
1	" As good as gold , " said <NAME> , " and better .
1	'What do you propose to do with it ?
1	screamed <NAME> : seizing Oliver with her utmost force , which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man in particularly good training .
1	" You 're a dear , good , wise , quiet , blessed girl ; but you have your prepossessions .
1	' You have heard something , I des-say , of a change in my expectations , <NAME> , -- I should say , <NAME> ? ' observed <NAME> .
1	I felt that I could bear no more , and that I must run away .
1	And through getting acquainted with him , you see -- why -- I got acquainted with her , ' said <NAME> tautologically .
1	I have resolved to bear the shame that will attach to me -- resolved to know that it attaches falsely -- that you know it too -- and that he does not , never can , and never shall .
1	' I have been a liar , and among liars from a little child , ' said the girl after another interval of silence , 'but I will take your words . '
1	It was the Charter of the <NAME> .
1	" <NAME> and <NAME> , " said he , rather out of breath , " with all apologies for intruding , WILL you allow me to order up a person that 's on the stairs and that objects to being left there in case of becoming the subject of observations in his absence ?
1	<NAME> said nothing , but folding his arms , and thrusting his head forward so as to obtain a nearer view of <NAME> ' s face , scanned his features closely .
1	roguery ! ' With these reflections , and a very hard knock on the crown of his unfortunate hat at each repetition of the last word , <NAME> , whose brain was a little muddled by so much of the contents of the pocket-pistol as had found their way there during his recent concealment , went forth to seek such consolation as might be derivable from the beef and greens of some cheap eating-house .
1	They sat down to the meal ; and broiled ham , eggs , tea , coffee and sundries , began to disappear with a rapidity which at once bore testimony to the excellence of the fare , and the appetites of its consumers .
1	There were some marks in it that might have been dimples , if the material had been softer and the instrument finer , but which , as it was , were only dints .
1	Once a year , ' she answered , shaking her head .
1	" But for you , dear stranger , I should not be so composed , for I am naturally a poor little thing , faint of heart ; nor should I have been able to raise my thoughts to Him who was put to death , that we might have hope and comfort here to-day .
1	' You mean mischief , <NAME> ! ' The old man raised his eyes inquiringly .
1	And this had passed into such a habit with him , that , if he could not be correctly said to have his tongue at his fingers ' ends , he might certainly be said to have it anywhere but in his face : which being , as we have already seen , of a harsh and repulsive character , was not oiled so easily , but frowned above all the smooth speeches -- one of nature ' s beacons , warning off those who navigated the shoals and breakers of the World , or of that dangerous strait the <NAME> , and admonishing them to seek less treacherous harbours and try their fortune elsewhere .
1	' Demd scarce , or I shouldn ' t want it , ' interrupted <NAME> .
1	In the meantime , under the surgeon ' s directions , some men brought a hurdle , on which others made a thick bed of spare clothes covered with loose straw , while he himself contrived some bandages and slings from shawls and handkerchiefs .
1	I could not get over this farewell glimpse of them for a long time .
1	I adjure you , do not recall that ! " His cry was so like a cry of actual pain , that it rang in <NAME> 's ears long after he had ceased .
1	I really could not at first persuade myself as we rumbled heavily on , filling the bridge with hollow noises , and I held down my head to save it from the rafters above , but that I was in a painful dream ; for I have often dreamed of toiling through such places , and as often argued , even at the time , ' this can not be reality. ' At length , however , we emerged upon the streets of <NAME> , whose feeble lights , reflected dismally from the wet ground , did not shine out upon a very cheerful city .
1	I have been thinking about it a good deal , and this is the conclusion I have come to . "
1	I have fallen like a poor stray shadow on your way , I have married you to poverty and trouble , I have scattered your means to the winds .
1	' Ah ! ' thinks <NAME> , ' his own words ! ' ' Seeing what I have seen to-night , and hearing what I have heard , ' adds <NAME> , with great earnestness , ' I shall never know peace of mind when there is danger of those two coming together , with no one else to interfere .
1	Do you think I don ' t know what a woeful day it was for the soft little creature when you first came in her way -- smirking and making great eyes at her , I ' ll be bound , as if you couldn ' t say boh !
1	' I ' ll trouble you also , if you please , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' with this card and this shilling .
1	This is the port wine , ma'am , that the board ordered for the infirmary ; real , fresh , genuine port wine ; only out of the cask this forenoon ; clear as a bell , and no sediment ! '
1	' I ' ll come anywhere you like , ' said <NAME> , ' or do anything you like .
1	It is always understood among the initiated , that that faithless lover must be planted at table opposite to <NAME> , who will then strike conversational fire out of him .
1	' I will , ' said <NAME> .
1	Besides , it would never do for a man who had been aboard ship from his boyhood to turn luxurious all at once .
1	Says the beadle , no , sir , he is not here .
1	Her loving and innocent face rising before him , had no softening or winning influence .
1	Everything remaining perfectly quiet , he got into <NAME> ' s bed , once more , and drawing the clothes over his head , laughed till he was nearly smothered .
1	These would be hanging on the outskirts of a wide circle of people assembled round some itinerant juggler , opposed , in his turn , by a noisy band of music , or the classic game of ' Ring the <NAME> , ' while ventriloquists holding dialogues with wooden dolls , and fortune-telling women smothering the cries of real babies , divided with them , and many more , the general attention of the company .
1	<NAME> , delighted to be of use , brought down the books under his arm in a great bustle ; and waited , cap in hand , to hear what message he was to take .
1	I should have very much liked to have given it to you long ago , because -- I felt that you were becoming so much our friend. ' ' How can I be otherwise than proud of it at any time !
1	However , I now wrote a comforting letter to Mrs. Micawber , in our joint names , and we both signed it .
1	So he has brought you up to follow in his ways and has sent you into foreign countries and the like ?
1	Oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand , as he had seen the Dodger hold it , and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with the other .
1	" And a nice brother he is -- half-brother I mean to say .
1	' See ! ' said <NAME> , ' miniature flour-barrel , rolling-pin , spice-box , shelf of brown jars , chopping-board , coffee-mill , dresser elegantly furnished with crockery , saucepans and pans , roasting jack , a charming kettle , an armoury of dish-covers .
1	His outer clothing removed , the visitor then took a seat on the opposite side of the fire .
1	<NAME> , ' said Mrs. Leo Hunter , ' I must make you promise not to stir from my side the whole day .
1	It is , how <NAME> could love me so when I so little deserved it , and how you , Mr and <NAME> , could be so forgetful of yourselves , and take such pains and trouble , to make me a little better , and after all to help him to so unworthy a wife .
1	You have undertaken to do something ; all I remark upon that at present is , do it ! ' ' I have written to <NAME> by the post that went out this afternoon , as I have written to him once before sin ' he went away , ' said <NAME> ; ' and he will be here , at furthest , in two days. ' ' Then , I ' ll tell you something .
1	Little Dorrit timidly said Yes , she believed so ; and resumed : ' -- Had gone on to those who were expecting him , and that this remembrance was stolen or kept back from nobody .
1	' You had much better go and marry <NAME> , the carrier .
1	And if <NAME> got clear off , <NAME> 's pretty sure to be safe ; for <NAME> 's worth two of <NAME> any time . '
1	We loitered down to the <NAME> stairs , and stood loitering there , as if we were not quite decided to go upon the water at all .
1	In a little while we had shut the door of the dark and empty sluice-house , and were passing through the quarry on our way back .
1	He delighted to live , barrack-fashion , among the elegant furniture , and he bullied the very pictures with his origin .
1	' And one dish , ' pursued <NAME> , raising his voice still higher as he looked all round the table , ' called , from its enormous dimensions , the <NAME> of <NAME> , and made , among other costly ingredients , of the brains of pheasants -- ' ' Ow , ow , ow ! ' ( from <NAME> . )
1	But , now that fortune had cast in his way a nameless orphan , at whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn , he retorted on him with interest .
1	I only brought it in joke. ' ' You had better be careful how you indulge in such jokes again , ' said <NAME> , ' or you may find an allusion to pulling noses rather a dangerous reminder for the subject of your facetiousness .
1	' We ' ll put you into your regular bedroom tomorrow , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
1	In conclusion , if you feel a sense of having injured me , and a desire to make some small reparation , I hope you will think how respectable you might have been yourself and will contemplate your blighted existence. ' Was it strange that the wretched man should take this heavily to heart ?
1	Never a soul in it but my own self and <NAME> Jaggers. " " Was there no one else ? " I asked .
1	' I am a determined character , ' said <NAME> .
1	' I know the sight on you would cheer ' em up a bit. ' My little Dora being in good spirits , and very desirous that I should go -- as I found on talking it over with her -- I readily pledged myself to accompany him in accordance with his wish .
1	Among my boys , this summer holiday time , I see an old man making giant kites , and gazing at them in the air , with a delight for which there are no words .
1	It was the voice of <NAME> 's nephew , who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach .
1	The legal gentleman being by this time rather giddy and perplexed in his ideas ( for this was one of the operations of the tobacco on his nervous system ) , took the opportunity of slinking away into the open air , where , in course of time , he recovered sufficiently to return with a countenance of tolerable composure .
1	As he stepped back , preparatory to saying he had no more to ask , he could not but observe how gloomily and fixedly she sat with her eyes fastened on the ground , and a certain air upon her of resolute waiting ; also , how exactly the self-same expression was reflected in Mr Flintwinch , standing at a little distance from her chair , with his eyes also on the ground , and his right hand softly rubbing his chin .
1	As it stood open , and as I knew that <NAME> had let the visitors out , -- for she had returned with the keys in her hand , -- I strolled into the garden , and strolled all over it .
1	It was an immense and solid building , erected at a vast expense .
1	Its motto is , Keep the Grubber always at it .
1	In winter-time , the snow will linger there , long after it has melted from the busy streets and highways .
1	That he had charged his messenger to represent his perfect innocence with every solemn assurance he could send us .
1	Remember -- eleven o ' clock. ' ' There is no fear of my forgetting it , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
1	' The person I object to , is Mr <NAME> Wrayburn. ' The Secretary remembered him .
1	At this moment the noise grew louder .
1	He ' ll not come here. ' ' Death give him up ! ' returned the old woman , impatiently .
1	Upon my word and honour , I ' m not in the habit of -- .
1	said <NAME> , regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval .
1	So he got into his place , still making complaints , and the keeper got into the place next him , and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as they could , and the convict I had recognized sat behind me with his breath on the hair of my head .
1	" <NAME> , " said <NAME> , very slowly rubbing his gloved hands , as if , to his cold sense of touch , they were much the same in black kid or out of it , " this was an ill-advised marriage of Mr .
1	<NAME> <NAME> looks distrustfully from the painted ceiling to the ground , from the ground to <NAME> , from <NAME> to <NAME> , and from <NAME> to the painted ceiling again , often in his perplexity changing the leg on which he rests .
1	It had long been customary , as she never changed her room , for those who had anything to say to her apart , to wheel her to her desk ; where she sat , usually with the back of her chair turned towards the rest of the room , and the person who talked with her seated in a corner , on a stool which was always set in that place for that purpose .
1	I could not but observe that he had been peeling the lemons with his own clasp-knife , which , as became the knife of a practical settler , was about a foot long ; and which he wiped , not wholly without ostentation , on the sleeve of his coat .
1	cried the Jew , his eyes flashing with rage .
1	It meant , when it was given , that whoever had this house could want nothing else .
1	<NAME> times a day , his noiseless little feet went up the stairs to his own room , as he collected every book , and scrap , and trifle that belonged to him , and put them all together there , down to the minutest thing , for taking home !
1	I am all right , " said gruff Old Orlick .
1	At six o'clock next morning , <NAME> : having exchanged his cocked hat for a round one , and encased his person in a blue great-coat with a cape to it : took his place on the outside of the coach , accompanied by the criminals whose settlement was disputed ; with whom , in due course of time , he arrived in <NAME> .
1	suppose we change the subject. ' The truth was , that the simple-minded Uncle in his secret attraction towards the marvellous and adventurous -- of which he was , in some sort , a distant relation , by his trade -- had greatly encouraged the same attraction in the nephew ; and that everything that had ever been put before the boy to deter him from a life of adventure , had had the usual unaccountable effect of sharpening his taste for it .
1	<NAME> and he had so much to do with one another in all things else , that it is hard to imagine his complaint , if he had one , being solely his own affair .
1	If I had wanted anything by which to mark this night of our re-union , I should have found it in this .
1	" You deserve a very admirable husband , and whoever he is , he ' ll be a very lucky man. " As <NAME> said this , his eye involuntarily wandered from the widow ' s face to the comfort around him .
1	It would be exciting to look out for wrecks. ' ' But otherwise , ' suggested <NAME> , ' there might be a degree of sameness in the life. ' ' I have thought of that also , ' said <NAME> , as if he really had been considering the subject in its various bearings with an eye to the business ; ' but it would be a defined and limited monotony .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , having shaved himself before a looking-glass of minute proportions , then marches out , bare-headed and bare-chested , to the pump in the little yard and anon comes back shining with yellow soap , friction , drifting rain , and exceedingly cold water .
1	' Get me money , ' he said wildly , as they parted for the night .
1	' What ' s her name ? ' inquired <NAME> .
1	There was another private house besides <NAME> ' s in <NAME> ' s Place : not to mention an immense Pair of gates , with an immense pair of lion-headed knockers on them , which were never opened by any chance , and were supposed to constitute a disused entrance to somebody ' s stables .
1	I wish the whole school was here .
1	' Not a word. ' ' To him or anyone ? ' pursued the Manager .
1	' " What do you think of _that_ ? " said the goblin , turning his large face towards <NAME> .
1	You 'll never have the laugh at me , though , unless it 's behind a nightcap .
1	<NAME> , broad-skirted laced coats , with great cuffs and no collars ; and wigs , gentlemen -- great formal wigs with a tie behind .
1	<NAME> , friend , quick ! " Pressing his hand to his bewildered head , <NAME> sat down at the table .
1	" Now , <NAME> , " said he , " be careful. " " I will , sir , " I returned .
1	Oh , bless him , bless him ! ' mumbled the old woman , holding up her skinny hand , and grinning frightfully at her daughter .
1	I was cold , and I trembled violently , but not a word he uttered was lost .
1	<NAME> was not long in making his toilet ; having taken some breakfast , he replied to a surly inquiry from <NAME> , by saying that he was quite ready .
1	If you suppose that boy -- ' ' Who really will be tired of waiting , ' said <NAME> , politely .
1	' You are as right as right can be , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> ' and far be it from me to tell you otherwise .
1	The salutation between <NAME> and his friends was strictly confined to the freemasonry of the craft ; consisting of a jerking round of the right wrist , and a tossing of the little finger into the air at the same time .
1	Not quite so charming to see their smiling faces fall and brood as they dropped moodily into separate corners of their little carriage .
1	said <NAME> , turning round , and addressing <NAME> , after he had bolted the door behind them .
1	The street was a sharp descent and was crooked too , and the man ( who although not drunk had the air of being flushed with some strong drink ) went down it so fast that <NAME> lost him as he looked at him .
1	Another soft knock at the outer door attracts his attention as he goes down-stairs .
1	' Wot ' s the matter now ? ' said <NAME> .
1	I haven ' t any great liking for that. ' ' No , to be sure , ' he assented .
1	He was going to say " to a shade , " but substituted this , as more appropriate .
1	The opportunity that the day 's rest had given me for reflection had resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting <NAME> .
1	If it was his whim to surprise us , his whim succeeded .
1	Monsieur the <NAME> cast his eyes over the submissive faces that drooped before him , as the like of himself had drooped before Monseigneur of the Court -- only the difference was , that these faces drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate -- when a grizzled mender of the roads joined the group .
1	' No , sir , ' he said , shaking his head , ' all that ' s past and over with me , sir .
1	And so she said to me , did I know the way to the burying ground ?
1	Let me give you a card , sir , of an establishment where those six boys can be brought up in an enlightened , liberal , and moral manner , with no mistake at all about it , for twenty guineas a year each -- twenty guineas , sir -- or I ' d take all the boys together upon a average right through , and say a hundred pound a year for the lot. ' ' Oh ! ' said the gentleman , glancing at the card , ' you are the <NAME> mentioned here , I presume ? ' ' Yes , I am , sir , ' replied the worthy pedagogue ; ' Mr .
1	' " However , " said the old gentleman , " that ' s not the point .
1	His thoughts , not to be stopped or directed , still wandered where they would , and dragged him after them .
1	" It would n't have been much to his advantage to have been clapped into prison by the whole bill and judgment trade of <NAME> . "
1	Up to this time , Mr <NAME> had transacted little or no business at his quarters in <NAME> , except in the sleeping line ; but now that he had become a fortune-teller , he was often closeted after midnight with Mr Rugg in his little front-parlour office , and even after those untimely hours , burnt tallow in his bed-room .
1	' I see how it is , ' said poor Noggs , drawing from his pocket what seemed to be a very old duster , and wiping <NAME> ' s eyes with it , as gently as if she were an infant .
1	The first time I passed <NAME> , <NAME> and I were pulling a pair of oars ; and , both in going and returning , we saw the blind towards the east come down .
1	' Where ' s <NAME> ? ' ' Good-night , <NAME> ! ' ' Good-bye , <NAME> ! ' ' <NAME> hands once more , <NAME> ! ' This was still <NAME> ' s cry , after she was shut up with her little maid , in the coach .
1	It shall be made to pay ; don ' t you be afraid .
1	' I can ' t get up , ' said the child , ' because my back ' s bad , and my legs are queer .
1	' Are you satisfied with that , or shall I finish it a little more ? ' said <NAME> , showing the sketch to Mr Dombey .
1	Do you still think , in spite of it , that I do not mean what I say ? " " You would never marry him , <NAME> ? " She looked towards <NAME> , and considered for a moment with her work in her hands .
1	He encounters <NAME> ; and who he was , is herein made manifest The whole capital which <NAME> found himself entitled to , either in possession , reversion , remainder , or expectancy , after paying his rent and settling with the broker from whom he had hired his poor furniture , did not exceed , by more than a few halfpence , the sum of twenty shillings .
1	One face , and not an agreeable one , though it was handsome , seemed maliciously watchful of this pretty girl , and indeed of every one and everything there .
1	In any case , I will take care of him until you return , and then we will remove him straight. " Both <NAME> and <NAME> were rather disinclined to this course , and in favour of one of them remaining .
1	I have no idea whether this took any time .
1	' Here , you Smike ; take away now .
1	" Why , he paid you for them , you know , and handsome too , " says <NAME> .
1	<NAME> <NAME> ! ' said my aunt , with great indignation , ' I am not going to be serpentined and corkscrewed out of my senses ! ' <NAME> was rather abashed , as most people might have been , by this explosion ; which derived great additional force from the indignant manner in which my aunt afterwards moved in her chair , and shook her head as if she were making snaps or bounces at him .
1	There was no sound inside .
1	" Well , " returns the old man , " it 's true that I do n't see company , <NAME> , and that I do n't treat .
1	The horseman had gone forward to have coffee and some eatables prepared , and they were by this time nearly ready .
1	I suppose you don ' t mind that ? ' ' Not at all , ' said <NAME> .
1	It ' s a strange choice , I must say .
1	' And now here ' s my poor fellow , ' Mrs <NAME> pursued , ' receiving notice that he is to hold himself in expectation of a baby , and all the expenses attendant on such an addition to his family !
1	At length they had left the village far behind , and even lost sight of the smoke among the trees .
1	'It 's a simple question of identity , you will observe , ' said the doctor .
1	It was the sergeant who had spoken to me , and he was now looking round at the company , with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his right hand , and his left on my shoulder .
1	Let me ask two questions .
1	At length , the two money-lenders obtained shelter in a house next door , and , being accommodated with a ladder , clambered over the wall of the back-yard -- which was not a high one -- and descended in safety on the other side .
1	The <NAME> is as yet unable to elaborate a scheme for winning <NAME> , but his first idea has gained possession of him , and he thinks the doubling up of Mr Dombey would be a move in the right direction .
1	She may be dead ! ' The vaunting cruelty with which she met my glance , I never saw expressed in any other face that ever I have seen .
1	' I ' ll leave all the presents behind , and begin again entirely on my own account. ' That the resolution might be thoroughly carried into practice , she even changed the dress she wore , for that in which she had come to the grand mansion .
1	If , for a moment , he did feel resigned , then his wife and child who had to live after him , seemed to protest and to make it a selfish thing .
1	' It does , ' replied the child .
1	It died upon my lips , and from that hour till now has never passed them. ' Mrs. Markleham , with a short groan , leaned back in her easy-chair ; and retired behind her fan , as if she were never coming out any more .
1	' There ! ' cried the coachman , appealing to <NAME> , with a sort of exalting despair ; ' that ' s the way the young lady ' s been a goin ' on for up ' ards of a mortal hour , and me continivally backing out of no thoroughfares , where she would drive up .
1	You brought no one with you ? " " <NAME> , sir !
1	I do n't care about it , I do n't know about it , I do n't want it , I do n't keep it -- it goes away from me directly .
1	'Oh , he wo n't speak out , wo n't he ? '
1	The tract of country through which it takes its course was once productive ; but the soil has been exhausted by the system of employing a great amount of slave labour in forcing crops , without strengthening the land : and it is now little better than a sandy desert overgrown with trees .
1	' <NAME> in love ! ' repeated my aunt .
1	' I have forgotten , <NAME> , ' said Mrs. <NAME> ' s mama , when we were seated , ' to pay you the compliments of the day -- though they are , as you may suppose , very far from being mere compliments in my case .
1	But the small servant immediately pausing in her talk , he subsided again , and pleading a momentary forgetfulness of their compact , entreated her to proceed .
1	He thought of <NAME> , or Providence , or be the directing <NAME> what it might , as having put a fraud upon him -- overreached him -- and in his impotent mad rage bit , and tore , and had his fit .
1	I am obliged to go to London. ' In less than another minute she was on her road to the railway , under <NAME> ' s protection .
1	' I shall not drink my love to you , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> : ' I shall drink to the little Dombey .
1	' My dear <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , ' a thousand thanks for your good opinion .
1	We are not going to wear the bottoms of our boilers out any faster than we wear ' em out now , for all the humbugging sentiment in <NAME> and Ireland. ' By way of ' going in ' to the fullest extent , <NAME> rejoined , ' Mr .
1	We write these words now , many miles distant from the spot at which , year after year , we met on that day , a merry and joyous circle .
1	He could not lose it now , though it was but such a speck in the landscape .
1	Though to bless and restore his mother , not his father , was the errand of this baby , its power was mighty to do it .
1	I was robbed at first setting out , and have walked all the way , and have never slept in a bed since I began the journey. ' Here my self-support gave way all at once ; and with a movement of my hands , intended to show her my ragged state , and call it to witness that I had suffered something , I broke into a passion of crying , which I suppose had been pent up within me all the week .
1	A dull anger that she should be seen in her distress , and that the involuntary look she had so resented should come to this fulfilment , smouldered within her like an unwholesome fire .
1	I ' ve read in books that pilgrims were used to go to chapel before they went on journeys , to put up petitions for their safe return .
1	He was never absent during business hours , unless upon an errand , and then he was represented by his son : a grisly urchin of twelve , who was his express image .
1	Having eaten and drunk to Mr <NAME> ' s extreme contentment , given him his drink , and put everything in neat order , she wrapped herself in an old coverlet and lay down upon the rug before the fire .
1	I sunk in wretchedness and ruin , lower and lower yet .
1	It was a picturesque old house in a fine park richly wooded .
1	Some called for ladders , some for sledge-hammers ; some ran with torches to and fro as if to seek them , and still came back and roared again ; some spent their breath in impotent curses and execrations ; some pressed forward with the ecstasy of madmen , and thus impeded the progress of those below ; some among the boldest attempted to climb up by the water-spout and crevices in the wall ; and all waved to and fro , in the darkness beneath , like a field of corn moved by an angry wind : and joined from time to time in one loud furious roar .
1	' Secondly , isn ' t Fledgeby both Pubsey and Co. ? ' The old man answered with a reluctant nod .
1	" My dear <NAME> , " said my guardian , " I have long had something in my thoughts that I have wished to say to you . "
1	What a pleasure to be the cause of that bright change in her attentive face , and the object of that sweet regard and welcome !
1	The ' young gal ' was re-engaged ; but on the stipulation that she should only bring in the dishes , and then withdraw to the landing-place , beyond the outer door ; where a habit of sniffing she had contracted would be lost upon the guests , and where her retiring on the plates would be a physical impossibility .
1	Should he meet a stranger coming from the churchyard with a quick step , he is morally convinced that the stranger is ' with a blush retiring , ' as monumentally directed .
1	In the entry hung his rusty large-brimmed low-crowned hat , as long out of date as his coat ; in the corner near it stood his staff -- no walking-stick but a veritable staff .
1	' You must not be one , dear <NAME> , ' cried the boy .
1	Here , too , he read of men who , lying in their beds at dead of night , had been tempted ( so they said ) and led on , by their own bad thoughts , to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep , and the limbs quail , to think of .
1	Put it that I take an inventory , or make a catalogue .
1	I am paid for undertaking it , and I do so .
1	He washed , and was cured .
1	Who gave you that name ? ' With a returning suspicion that something might have betrayed him to her , he answered , interrogatively , ' My godfathers and my godmothers , dear love ? ' ' Pretty good ! ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> left alone , laid her head upon her hand , and pressing the other over her swelling heart , held free communication with her sorrows .
1	I beg your pardon , <NAME> .
1	You have seen my sister oftener and oftener .
1	" This is my lodger , <NAME> , " says <NAME> , nodding at her .
1	Either they carry their restlessness to such a pitch that they never sleep at all ; or they expectorate in dreams , which would be a remarkable mingling of the real and ideal .
1	wo n't his manners do then ? " asked <NAME> , plucking a black-currant leaf .
1	' A little , <NAME> , ' replied that gentleman .
1	Still very pale , she is dressed in slight mourning and wears two beautiful bracelets .
1	<NAME> is confident that he invented that forcible figure—would fall to pieces .
1	<NAME> <NAME> listens , starts from his chair , and catches a young fellow in his arms , exclaiming : ' My dear Edwin ! ' ' My dear Jack !
1	And I am sorry to say I have known them cruel to their wives too . "
1	' Oh yes I have , I have my faults , no man knows his faults better than I know mine .
1	Another cause of our being sometimes apart , was , that I had naturally an interest in going over to <NAME> , and revisiting the old familiar scenes of my childhood ; while <NAME> , after being there once , had naturally no great interest in going there again .
1	' Why , it _is_ difficult , sir , I confess , ' said the tall footman .
1	' <NAME> p ' raps it ' s a more tenderer word , ' said <NAME> , after a few moments ' reflection .
1	Their need for watching one another should be over now , but they do it all this time , and the stars watch them both through the opened window .
1	But he caught her by the arm .
1	' I never contemplated anything of this kind ; never dreamt of the possibility of it .
1	However , I got dressed , darkly wiping my sanguinary face at intervals , and I said , " Can I help you ? " and he said " No thankee , " and I said " Good afternoon , " and he said " Same to you. " When I got into the courtyard , I found <NAME> waiting with the keys .
1	He hears that his innocence is established , and that he is pardoned .
1	The lips were parched , and cracked in many places ; the hard , dry skin glowed with a burning heat ; and there was an almost unearthly air of wild anxiety in the man ' s face , indicating even more strongly the ravages of the disease .
1	That gentleman ' s ed would come up-ards when his turn come , that gentleman ' s air would be a pleasure to look upon being all smooth again , and wery well then !
1	<NAME> , <NAME> , fly ! ' So , they went softly up the kitchen stairs on tiptoe , and <NAME> with her light hand softly removed the fastenings of the house door , and <NAME> , having received a parting hug , made off .
1	A gaudy parrot in a burnished cage upon the table tears at the wires with her beak , and goes walking , upside down , in its dome-top , shaking her house and screeching ; but Mr Carker is indifferent to the bird , and looks with a musing smile at a picture on the opposite wall .
1	" It is enough that the time will come when this good woman will find that it WAS much , and that forasmuch as she did it unto the least of these -- This child , " he added after a few moments , " could she possibly continue this ? "
1	The above reward will be paid to any person who will give such information as will lead to the discovery of the said <NAME> , or tend to throw any light upon his previous history , in which the advertiser is , for many reasons , warmly interested . '
1	These Doctors ' <NAME> fellows are the gayest men in town , I believe , and beat us sober <NAME> people all to nothing ! ' His bright glance went merrily round the room , as he took the seat on the sofa opposite to me , which Mrs. Micawber had recently vacated , and stirred the fire into a blaze .
1	replied <NAME> : shuddering as though some deadly chillness were passing over her , while she spoke ; ' I shall be better presently .
1	I thought Mrs. and <NAME> ( at whom I now glanced for the first time , and who were , both , thin and quiet ) were not disappointed .
1	' I will be your true friend always .
1	' There are many pleasanter places even in this dreary world , than <NAME> when it blows hard ; and if you throw in beside , a gloomy winter ' s evening , a miry and sloppy road , and a pelting fall of heavy rain , and try the effect , by way of experiment , in your own proper person , you will experience the full force of this observation .
1	When toned down again , the unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box .
1	She added in the same breath , as if fearful of any further questioning , ' But please will you leave a card or message ? ' These unusual answers might naturally have provoked some more inquiries .
1	' <NAME> ' t so much as look at me like that , or I won ' t talk to you at all , ' vociferated <NAME> .
1	He has a wife ; that wife is attached to , and dependent on him .
1	" ' Blow me , " says <NAME> ; and the mare neighed as if she were precisely of the same opinion .
1	There is much shaking of hands , and much bowing , and a great desire on the part of each young gentleman to take <NAME> down in <NAME> Dombey ' s good graces ; and then , Mr Toots having bestowed a chuckle on his old desk , <NAME> and he withdraw with <NAME> and <NAME> ; and <NAME> is heard to observe behind them as he comes out last , and shuts the door , ' Gentlemen , we will now resume our studies , ' For that and little else is what the <NAME> hears the sea say , or has heard it saying all his life .
1	' Oh yes , <NAME> , I ' m very well pleased , thank you , ' returned <NAME> , who had suddenly become so very upright that she seemed to have put an additional bone in her stays .
1	" You are a little late , <NAME> , " said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> saw him put it there .
1	It was the one grain of relief I had .
1	I never was responsible in my life -- I ca n't be . "
1	Come and ask her if she is better ; come and ask her to lie down .
1	' Nothing , ' Tilda , ' replied <NAME> , sobbing .
1	As you , of course , have not forgotten that he did. ' She watched him still attentively .
1	' We never can be here. ' ' No , we never can again -- never again -- that ' s truly said , ' rejoined the old man .
1	<NAME> <NAME> ! " <NAME> still and silent , and not even fallen back in her chair , she sat under his hand , utterly insensible ; with her eyes open and fixed upon him , and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or branded into her forehead .
1	' And these are the arrangements , <NAME> dear ? ' ' Arrangements ! ' repeated <NAME> .
1	" One in-door , and three out .
1	Now , the eyes of <NAME> had rested on the pretty face of <NAME> many a time and oft before , at church and elsewhere ; but the eyes of <NAME> had never looked so bright , the cheeks of <NAME> had never looked so ruddy , as upon this particular occasion .
1	'How well he looks , and how like a gentleman 's son he is dressed again !
1	The sadness of the scene imparted a sombre tinge to the feelings of <NAME> .
1	Being conveyed into the front parlour , she was there deposited on a sofa ; and the lady from the first floor running up to the first floor , returned with a bottle of sal-volatile , which , holding Mrs. <NAME> tight round the neck , she applied in all womanly kindness and pity to her nose , until that lady with many plunges and struggles was fain to declare herself decidedly better .
1	She had been saying all the while , " Let me go ! "
1	I ca n't stand it any longer .
1	He had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the <NAME> , and his face was wet with tears .
1	' As to myself , sir , ' said Mr Rugg , hoping that his eloquence had reduced him to a state of indecision , ' it is a principle of mine not to consider myself when a client ' s inclinations are in the scale .
1	You are to pay all charges out of my purse , You hear the condition of your going ? " " And must obey , " said I .
1	Lastly , the looking-glass reflects <NAME> and <NAME> , and two other stuffed <NAME> interposed between the rest of the company and possible accidents .
1	' Looking in at the garden gate of the cottage. ' ' No , ' said <NAME> .
1	Finding that the afternoon coach was gone , and finding that his uneasiness grew into positive alarm , as obstacles came in his way , he resolved to follow in a post-chaise .
1	Over most of the beds , the toys were yet grouped as the children had left them when they last laid themselves down , and , in their innocent grotesqueness and incongruity , they might have stood for the children ' s dreams .
1	I was sure it was the same gentlemen because I knew their voices again -- I mean I knew <NAME> 's .
1	His pockets were as full of it as his head .
1	As the traveller sees farthest by day , and becomes aware of rugged mountains and trackless plains which the friendly darkness had shrouded from his sight and mind together , so , the wayfarer in the toilsome path of human life sees , with each returning sun , some new obstacle to surmount , some new height to be attained .
1	If your ladyship would wish to have the boy produced in corroboration of this statement , I can lay my hand upon him at any time . "
1	<NAME> ! ' ' When shall I come to see you , Mr Boffin. ' ' When you like .
1	In spite of her request , he could not help opening the packet that night when he went to bed .
1	<NAME> , for ever and ever .
1	The tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry , " Dead ! " He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man , for whom the rest made way .
1	It would avail me nothing to extenuate it now .
1	Now , <NAME> bounced into the room with great impetuosity ; for , supposing her son-in-law to be still a-bed , she had come to relieve her feelings by pronouncing a strong opinion upon his general conduct and character .
1	If there had been time , I should probably have ordered several suits of clothes for this occasion ; but as there was not , I was fain to be content with those I had .
1	The ground was measured , some usual forms gone through , the two principals were placed front to front at the distance agreed upon , and <NAME> turned his face towards his young adversary for the first time .
1	" Do you think he did it on purpose ? "
1	" There are only the usual odours. " " I am a little tired , " her husband acknowledged .
1	Rather a light purse , ' added <NAME> , throwing it into the air and catching it dexterously , ' but enough to amuse a gentleman for half an hour or so. ' ' We ' ll make a four-handed game of it , and take in <NAME> , ' said the stout man .
1	<NAME> ' s people , ' said a thin , miserable-looking old woman , stopping to recover breath after the ascent of the staircase -- ' Mr .
1	Not even my friends here -- ' ' Except on one occasion , ' said <NAME> .
1	If I have known <NAME> a year , to move to as he went by , I have known him forty years .
1	The unaccustomed visitor from outside , naturally assumed everybody here to be prisoners -- landlord , waiter , barmaid , potboy , and all .
1	<NAME> walked in , taking her sister with her ; and they went up-stairs with powder going before and powder stopping behind , and were left in a spacious semicircular drawing-room , one of several drawing-rooms , where there was a parrot on the outside of a golden cage holding on by its beak , with its scaly legs in the air , and putting itself into many strange upside-down postures .
1	I said to <NAME> that this was very true , and who should know it better than I , who loved <NAME> with a love that never mortal had experienced yet ?
1	<NAME> is the difference between yesterday and today .
1	When they stopped , he was a little surprised to find himself in the act of smoking ; but , on reflection , he remembered when and where he had taken the cigar .
1	'Which contained -- ' interposed Monks , stretching forward .
1	I sat looking at <NAME> for some time , in a reverie on this supposititious case : whether , if she were employed to lose me like the boy in the fairy tale , I should be able to track my way home again by the buttons she would shed .
1	' It ' s quite another matter in the case of a man like me .
1	A mutual understanding follows , and I think it may carry us through .
1	On being asked by a mild boy ( not me ) how he would proceed if he did begin to see him do it , he dipped a match into his phosphorus-box on purpose to shed a glare over his reply , and said he would commence by knocking him down with a blow on the forehead from the seven-and-sixpenny ink-bottle that was always on the mantelpiece .
1	' It was the fright of that -- that noise and confusion last night , ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> , and repent of it .
1	I didn ' t think you would ; and I want , more than ever , to be liked , now <NAME> is gone. ' I have omitted to mention it , by the by .
1	But he shuts out the now chilled air , draws the window-curtain , goes to bed , and falls asleep .
1	' So she is , ' said <NAME> , ' so she is .
1	' I will wait , if you please , for I want to speak to her. ' ' Do you ? ' returned <NAME> .
1	We thought it a pity he should go away .
1	' Yes , to state , ' said the little man , ' I thank my honourable friend , if he will allow me to call him so ( four hears and one certainly from <NAME> ) , for the suggestion .
1	" Ha ' n't you no relations , now , " asks <NAME> with a twinkle in his eyes , " who would pay off this little principal or who would lend you a good name or two that I could persuade my friend in the city to make you a further advance upon ?
1	' No , thank you ! ' said <NAME> , coldly , as I mechanically offered them back to him .
1	" What do you say , <NAME> ? "
1	They moved so gently , that their footsteps made no noise ; but there were sobs from among the group , and sounds of grief and mourning .
1	' I have come here in consequence of receiving this bit of paper , ' rejoined <NAME> .
1	It would be better for me , they tell me , if I restrained myself .
1	'There 's always more or less orange-peel on the pavement in our street ; and I _know_ it 's put there by the surgeon 's boy at the corner .
1	It ' s a wery strange thing now , where this here letter can ha ' come from. ' As <NAME> said this , he did what a great many people do when they are uncertain about the writer of a note -- looked at the seal , and then at the front , and then at the back , and then at the sides , and then at the superscription ; and , as a last resource , thought perhaps he might as well look at the inside , and try to find out from that .
1	Thoroughly tired , I went to bed too , at midnight ; passed the next day on the Dover coach ; burst safe and sound into my aunt ' s old parlour while she was at tea ( she wore spectacles now ) ; and was received by her , and <NAME> , and dear old Peggotty , who acted as housekeeper , with open arms and tears of joy .
1	<NAME> , <NAME> tells me -- ' ' Stay , mother !
1	In his college days of athletic exercises , <NAME> had known professors of the <NAME> of fisticuffs , and had attended two or three of their gloved gatherings .
1	Oliver knew this too well ; but thinking it might be dangerous to express his feelings more openly , he only sighed , and went on with his boot-cleaning .
1	But she had scarcely entered , when another woman , similarly laden , came in too ; and she was closely followed by a man in faded black , who was no less startled by the sight of them , than they had been upon the recognition of each other .
1	They were , and they are , quite ignorant of our history. ' ' So much the worse , ' retorted <NAME> , determined not to admit anything in extenuation , ' for then you have no excuse .
1	'Yes , sir , ' replied <NAME> , in a low , tremulous voice .
1	A dry subject for a young lady , but an important subject too .
1	' I am a demd villain ! ' cried <NAME> , smiting himself on the head .
1	When I came here today , I thought that nothing could have wrested this confession from me .
1	It was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead bodies -- the cap , the noose , the pinioned arms , the faces that he knew , even beneath that hideous veil. -- <NAME> , light !
1	Not for your sake , but for the sake of others .
1	Such were Mr Quilp ' s first proceedings on entering upon his new property .
1	All this she did without looking at me .
1	In this family we are all children , and I am the youngest . "
1	But all these tokens of past grandeur were miserably decayed and dirty ; rot , damp , and age , had weakened the flooring , which in many places was unsound and even unsafe .
1	He bowed , as if in compliance ; but turning back , when he had nearly reached the door , said : ' I am forgiven , and have explained my fault .
1	I am the umble instrument of umbly serving him , and he puts me on an eminence I hardly could have hoped to reach .
1	These gentlemen being rejected after twenty-four hours ' pleasantry , Mr <NAME> consented to remain , and did remain , until a club of choice spirits called a <NAME> jury ( who were in the joke ) summoned him to a trial before twelve other wags for perjury and fraud , who in their turn found him guilty with a most facetious joy , -- nay , the very populace entered into the whim , and when Mr <NAME> was moving in a hackney-coach towards the building where these wags assembled , saluted him with rotten eggs and carcases of kittens , and feigned to wish to tear him into shreds , which greatly increased the comicality of the thing , and made him relish it the more , no doubt .
1	I have been looking everywhere for my bench , and I ca n't find it .
1	' Only a bob ' s vorth , <NAME> , ' cried the driver sulkily , for the information of his friend the waterman , as the cab drove off .
1	Her mother eyed her sharply for a moment , and feeling herself on unsafe ground , said , as a diversion : ' My charming <NAME> , you must come and kiss me once more , if you please , my love. ' Florence complied , of course , and again imprinted her lips on Mrs <NAME> ' s ear .
1	But come in , come in ! ' Chattering in this way , <NAME> pushed <NAME> into the back room , where , amusing himself by boring little circular caverns in the chimney-piece with a red-hot poker , sat no less a person than <NAME> .
1	" Yes , my dear , " said <NAME> .
1	' Then I ' ll tell you wot it is , ' said <NAME> , after a short meditation , ' this is a case for that ' ere confidential pal o ' the <NAME> ' s .
1	There used to be a poem when I learnt lessons , something about Lo the poor Indians whose something mind !
1	and coming half across the room to meet me , kneeled down upon the ground and kissed me , and laid my head down on her bosom near the little creature that was nestling there , and put its hand to my lips .
1	' And now pray tell me something all you know , ' said <NAME> , drawing her chair near to his , ' about the good dear quiet little thing and all the changes of her fortunes carriage people now no doubt and horses without number most romantic , a coat of arms of course and wild beasts on their hind legs showing it as if it was a copy they had done with mouths from ear to ear good gracious , and has she her health which is the first consideration after all for what is wealth without it Mr F. himself so often saying when his twinges came that sixpence a day and find yourself and no gout so much preferable , not that he could have lived on anything like it being the last man or that the previous little thing though far too familiar an expression now had any tendency of that sort much too slight and small but looked so fragile bless her ? ' Mr F. ' s <NAME> , who had eaten a piece of toast down to the crust , here solemnly handed the crust to <NAME> , who ate it for her as a matter of business .
1	The appearances , beyond all rational doubt , observed in that case are the appearances observed in <NAME> 's case .
1	When <NAME> and the unfortunate Prince found an opportunity to become betrothed I do n't know , but they certainly found none on this occasion to exchange a dozen words .
1	Dear Mr Clennam , don ' t let me see you weep !
1	Shall I ever forget the morning I looked scornfully at him when he offered to carry my parasol ?
1	On his way home , on the evening he set aside for this momentous purpose , he took the precaution of stepping into a chemist ' s shop and buying a bottle of the very strongest smelling-salts .
1	The <NAME> pointed as before .
1	He has no curiosity or care for the scene about him , and always speaks to the girl .
1	He had no wife to call in and astonish , so he rang the bell for his servant .
1	Do you think it good ? -- Warn her father against me .
1	' Hum -- eh -- what ' s that ? ' said the strange man .
1	' <NAME> , ' retorted <NAME> , colouring , ' is a wicked , impudent , bold-faced hussy. ' ' What ' s that ? ' inquired <NAME> .
1	<NAME> father said anything particular to you to-day or yesterday , <NAME> ? ' ' <NAME> , <NAME> .
1	For we were very happy then , I think. ' ' Heaven knows we were ! ' said I .
1	At what an opportune moment they arrived , how they listened , and what they heard , is already known to the reader .
1	' Con-found it , no , ' rejoined <NAME> , stopping for an instant to smash a fly with the ruler .
1	The screen still goes , as before .
1	When he loves his Florence most , he will hate me least .
1	I deplored the untimely death of <NAME> , most sincerely , and shed tears in doing so .
1	I admire her -- as my friend does -- exceedingly .
1	My time is nearly all devoted to some very intimate friends .
1	You can have as much flirting as you like -- at your Boffins .
1	'Indeed I do n't know , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
1	' No , ' replied <NAME> ' ly , shaking her head , ' I ' m afraid of the sea. ' ' Afraid ! ' I said , with a becoming air of boldness , and looking very big at the mighty ocean .
1	What do you say , <NAME> ? ' ' I say , aunt , ' I interposed , ' that I must do something ! ' ' Go for a soldier , do you mean ? ' returned my aunt , alarmed ; ' or go to sea ?
1	We merely know that after a short pause <NAME> said , ' Lor , do adun , <NAME> ! ' and that his hat had fallen off a few moments before -- from both of which tokens we should be disposed to infer that one kiss , or more , had passed between the parties .
1	It ' s not possible. ' ' No , <NAME> ' am , ' said <NAME> ' No more did my Uncle ' s child .
1	' As silent a feller as myself .
1	The uncle , a rigid old gentleman of strong force of character ; the nephew , habitually timid , repressed , and under constraint. ' Mistress Affery , fixedly attentive in the window-seat , biting the rolled up end of her apron , and trembling from head to foot , here cried out , ' Jeremiah , keep off from me !
1	' Uncle , ' said <NAME> , when she judged they must be near their destination , ' I must ask one question of you .
1	By degrees , the shutters were opened ; the window-blinds were drawn up ; and people began passing to and fro .
1	I found him in his dressing-room surrounded by his stock of boots , already hard at it , washing his hands of us .
1	said <NAME> with great enjoyment .
1	All that evening , <NAME> had been hunting and searching in byways and corners for the very person who now knocked at his door , while <NAME> had been pursuing the same inquiry in other directions .
1	That this correspondence with the public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day , or of yesterday , or even of last year , or of the year before .
1	They think me a long way off , and if I went wholly unexpected , I should frighten them .
1	' " I will , " rejoined the baron .
1	At length he was quiet -- well he might be with her dimpled chin upon his head ! -- and we walked away to look at a greenhouse .
1	' I am fully aware of that .
1	What could have made them so late ?
1	' There is no " of course " in the case , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , gradually breaking into a smile , in spite of the uneasiness which <NAME> ' s obstinacy had given him .
1	The house in <NAME> Inn had bills in the windows announcing that it was to let , and it looked dirtier and gloomier and ghastlier than ever .
1	Never clapped eyes upon her ! " " Goodness , uncle !
1	' Em ' ly ' s her name , ' said <NAME> , ' and she ' s little too .
1	The name pleased him , or suited him as well as any other , and the Bachelor he had ever since remained .
1	As he is not here , to-morrow will be time enough . '
1	Do n't revive her to consciousness , while she only faints. " " Oh , <NAME> , <NAME> , dear <NAME> ! " cried little Lucie , springing up and throwing her arms passionately round him , in a burst of grief .
1	We can go to the <NAME> , or the <NAME> for the <NAME> , or the <NAME> , I dare say ; and the sooner we go the better. ' With this extraordinary jumble of charitable institutions , Mrs. Nickleby again gave way to her tears .
1	" Not if to lift this glass would do it !
1	" If time could be spared , " said <NAME> , " which is the only thing that ca n't be spared in this case , I might get it out of that woman ; but it 's too doubtful a chance to trust to under present circumstances .
1	' Now , my men , ' said the single gentleman ; ' you have done very well .
1	" That 'll do , my good friend ! "
1	If he takes and says , " Maggy , you hurry away and back with that letter , and you shall have a sixpence if the answer ' s a good ' un , " I must take it .
1	<NAME> vapouring , combined with the extravagant plots of <NAME> for the restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself , and worn out Heaven and earth as well as itself , was hard to be endured without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth .
1	If you do n't like it , I ca n't help it .
1	I sent for you , in order that I might say -- hum -- impressively say , in the presence of Mrs General , to whom we are all so much indebted for obligingly being present among us , on -- ha -- on this or any other occasion , ' Mrs General shut her eyes , ' that I -- ha hum -- am not pleased with you .
1	' As handsome as her ? ' said <NAME> .
1	' Give them a glass of wine each to drink the toast in .
1	' Your father is not on duty at present , I think , <NAME> ? ' ' <NAME> , sir , he comes on later in the afternoon. ' Another twirl of the great hat , and then <NAME> said , rising , ' I am afraid I must wish you good day , sir. ' ' So soon ?
1	I ' ve never met with nothing but beer ath ' ll ever clean a comic blackamoor. ' <NAME> rapidly assented ; <NAME> rapidly turned out from a box , a smock frock , a felt hat , and other essentials ; the whelp rapidly changed clothes behind a screen of baize ; <NAME> rapidly brought beer , and washed him white again .
1	' There ! ' said <NAME> when they got into the street ; ' now you ' re provided for. ' <NAME> was about to thank him again , but he stopped her .
1	At length , on Sunday night when all the village is asleep , come soldiers , winding down from the prison , and their guns ring on the stones of the little street .
1	On the road I have suffered a great deal .
1	<NAME> , please to give the lad some wine. ' Mr <NAME> ' s glance followed <NAME> with sharp disfavour , as he left the room under the pilotage of Mrs <NAME> ; and it may be that his mind ' s eye followed him with no greater relish , as he rode back to his <NAME> ' s with <NAME> .
1	The boy , <NAME> , was training for and with a schoolmaster .
1	I left him climbing to the window , and I came to tell you .
1	He was out of breath by that time , as he might well be , and his heart seemed to jerk faster than the little shop-bell , as it quivered and jingled behind him with his hasty shutting of the door .
1	And you hear the people who are alive , crying , and working , and calling to one another down in the close dark streets , and you seem to pity them so !
1	' I ' ll brood over miseries no longer , but put a good face on the matter , and try the fresh air and the bears again ; and if that don ' t do , I ' ll talk to the baroness soundly , and cut the <NAME> dead. ' With this the baron fell into his chair , and laughed so loud and boisterously , that the room rang with it .
1	Extraordinary how soon the noisome flavour of imprisoned sleep , becomes manifest in all such places that are ill cared for !
1	' <NAME> ! ' he returned , and burst into a roar of laughter that shook the chaise .
1	Sometimes , I had proceeded restlessly from place to place , stopping nowhere ; sometimes , I had lingered long in one spot .
1	Holding my mind as steadily as I could to these points , I went into the next room with them .
1	He promptly says again , " Have the goodness to hear me , <NAME> , " and motions to the chair from which she has risen .
1	In the fulness of time a milliner came in , and to her she repaired on her own behalf .
1	Indeed , such another lucky hit would almost have set him up in that way to his satisfaction .
1	' I wonder they do n't murder you !
1	Not , however , that <NAME> would do here alone. ' Mr <NAME> was going to say ' No ? ' interrogatively , but he saw his danger and said it assentingly , ' <NAME> , Oh dear no ; she wouldn ' t do here alone. ' ' No , <NAME> .
1	Let me know how you would have dealt with me if you had regarded me as being what you would have considered on equal terms with you. ' ' It is impossible , Mr Wrayburn .
1	If he followed it by mere fortuitous coincidence , it was done by an evil chance .
1	'She will be persuaded now , ' cried the young lady .
1	<NAME> was not at all what I meant , for I had intended my question to apply to his means .
1	' So ! ' said <NAME> , with a contemptuous laugh , ' I see her at last !
1	are not bonded together for better for worst so fast , but that they can be set free fro ' _their_ misfortnet marriages , an ' marry ower agen .
1	The state of that wretch who continually finds the weak spots in his own crime , and strives to strengthen them when it is unchangeable , is a state that aggravates the offence by doing the deed a thousand times instead of once ; but it is a state , too , that tauntingly visits the offence upon a sullen unrepentant nature with its heaviest punishment every time .
1	Firm of look and firm of purpose , she intently watched its coming on , until it was very near ; then , with a touch unshipped her sculls , and crept aft in the boat , between kneeling and crouching .
1	He ' s close to the door .
1	All I had to do , I said , with gloomy sarcasm , was to forget <NAME> .
1	' Though I am old and ugly now , -- much older by life and habit than years though , -- I was once as young as any .
1	captive , bound , and double-ironed , " cried the phantom , " not to know , that ages of incessant labour by immortal creatures , for this earth must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is all developed .
1	<NAME> water is in general request at the office next day , and most of the party deem the bill an imposition .
1	" I am sorry , " says <NAME> , " to have touched so sore a place . "
1	It struck cold and damp , but was not dark .
1	She ' d deny it , and so would my master .
1	In a word , I was too cowardly to do what I knew to be right , as I had been too cowardly to avoid doing what I knew to be wrong .
1	' Not contented , <NAME> , ' said Mr Chuckster , ' with making friends with <NAME> , he has cultivated the acquaintance of his father and mother .
1	When you know that she only does it out of kindness and the best intentions !
1	It don ' t signify to any one. ' ' O yes it does ; I am sorry to see you so. ' ' You are not sorry , ' said the girl .
1	I have had to-day ' s practice at home and abroad , on a march , and aboard ship , and I ' ll tell you this : I don ' t know that I have ever pursued it under such quiet circumstances as here this day .
1	But I felt that the kiss was given to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been , and that it was worth nothing .
1	And yet -- and yet -- she sends a look in that direction as if it were her heart 's desire to have that figure moved out of the way .
1	She ' s more to me -- gent ' lmen -- than -- she ' s all to me that ever I can want , and more than ever I -- than ever I could say .
1	' Is it Justice with the bandage off her eyes , and without the sword and scales ?
1	His tap at the glass roused her from the musing solitude in which she sat , and she came to the door to open it ; aiding her steps with a little crutch-stick .
1	It was a temperance song ( whirlwinds of cheers ) .
1	Little <NAME> is waiting for the coroner and jury on their return .
1	Every patient in this asylum sits down to dinner every day with a knife and fork ; and in the midst of them sits the gentleman , whose manner of dealing with his charges , I have just described .
1	The day being very warm and the street a quiet one , the windows were wide open ; and it was easy to hear through the <NAME> blinds all that passed inside .
1	But now , <NAME> arrived .
1	What _could_ the boy be crying for ?
1	Still Knitting Madame Defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the bosom of <NAME> , while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the darkness , and through the dust , and down the weary miles of avenue by the wayside , slowly tending towards that point of the compass where the chateau of Monsieur the <NAME> , now in his grave , listened to the whispering trees .
1	She has her friend and counsellor always near . "
1	No ; I repudiate the title !
1	Others drew forth , with clashing noise , upon the ground , great sheets of glowing steel , emitting an insupportable heat , and a dull deep light like that which reddens in the eyes of savage beasts .
1	' A quiet , happy place -- a place to live and learn to die in ! ' She would have said more , but that the energy of her thoughts caused her voice to falter , and come in trembling whispers from her lips .
1	<NAME> , on that unfortunate occasion , commits himself under provocation. ' ' And under mulled wine , ' added the old lady .
1	He complied , and I went on alone .
1	I felt in the same way towards my school companions ; I felt in the same way towards Mrs. Rachael , who was a widow ; and oh , towards her daughter , of whom she was proud , who came to see her once a fortnight !
1	' You mean that in that case I must pay the damages ? ' said <NAME> , who had watched this telegraphic answer with considerable sternness .
1	Batter the gate once more ! ' He stood listening intently , but the noise was not renewed .
1	It was written with a plain , unaffected , homely piety that I knew to be genuine , and ended with ' my duty to my ever darling ' -- meaning myself .
1	( Gusty weather with deceitful calms .
1	' When he was waiting to be the object of your munificence , so freely bestowed for my sake , and when I was unhappy in the mercenary shape I was made to wear , I thought it would have become him better to have worked his own way on .
1	Are you her ladyship 's property , or somebody else 's ?
1	Shall I give you a ride , <NAME> ?
1	" Anyhow , here I stand , this present day , <NAME> married to <NAME> 's widder .
1	<NAME> clamps and girders , fire-proof from top to bottom ; mechanical lifts for the housemaids , with all their brushes and brooms ; everything that heart could desire .
1	It is to be hoped they will still continue happy .
1	And so I said yes , if it was no harm , and she said no -- no harm .
1	But he wore out , poor man , so I have appointed his successor .
1	<NAME> <NAME> roused me from this reflection , which was blended with a certain remorseful apprehension of seeing <NAME> himself , by bestowing many encomiums on the absent Littimer as a most respectable fellow , and a thoroughly admirable servant .
1	<NAME> <NAME> looked at me , and I looked at her and said I was indeed .
1	He was a simple-hearted old gentleman , of a shrinking , subdued spirit , accustomed to retirement , and very little acquainted with the world , which he had left many years before to come and settle in that place .
1	The instant over , he says , sensibly touched : ' I am afraid I am but a shallow , surface kind of fellow , <NAME> , and that my headpiece is none of the best .
1	Pictures and prints of vessels fighting with the rolling waves filled her with alarm .
1	A little pincushion , a little housewife , a little book , a little workbox , a little set of tables and weights and measures , and a little woman , all in one .
1	Come -- to play. " " Come nearer ; let me look at you .
1	" Yes , dearest. " " Yes , citizen. " " Ah !
1	<NAME> retired behind his elbow at first , but relented at the sight of sponge-cake and allowed me to take him on my lap , where he sat munching quietly .
1	A profound silence was observed during the ride .
1	' I hope , ' stammered <NAME> : ' I hope the magistrates will not form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper conduct , on the unsupported testimony of a child . '
1	The apothecary 's apprentice , having completed the manufacture of the toothpick , planted himself in front of the fire and made good use of it for ten minutes or so : when apparently growing rather dull , he wished Mrs. Corney joy of her job , and took himself off on tiptoe .
1	" And , O my dearest Love ! " she urged , clinging nearer to him , laying her head upon his breast , and raising her eyes to his , " remember how strong we are in our happiness , and how weak he is in his misery ! " The supplication touched him home .
1	I saw my brother near the school , sir , ' to <NAME> , ' because it ' s easier for me to go there , than for him to come here .
1	Never , no , never once , in one unguarded moment from that time to the end , did any care for himself , any thought of his own comfort , any selfish consideration or regard distract his thoughts from the gentle object of his love .
1	So make her comfortable. ' ' Thank you very much , sir , ' that discreet lady observed , ' but pray do not let My comfort be a consideration .
1	And the communication I have got to make is , that he has great expectations. " <NAME> and I gasped , and looked at one another .
1	My appetite vanished instantly , and I knew no peace or rest until the day arrived .
1	' I believe every word you have said , ' he returned .
1	Without I was informed agen , the danger ai n't so much to signify .
1	The pace at which they went , was such a very lazy , ill-looking saunter , that <NAME> soon began to think his companions were going to deceive the old gentleman , by not going to work at all .
1	" She was a noble vessel .
1	Nevertheless , his dignity gets over it after stopping to refit , and he goes on with my Lady for <NAME> , lying only one night in <NAME> on the way to <NAME> .
1	And the one that went on only went on a certain way agreed upon to deceive and then turned across country and went home .
1	<NAME> took no notice of either of us , but led us the way that I knew so well .
1	You would then have been my ward until you were of age .
1	This is an unseasonable hour , but here is a young woman who has been making statements which render my visit necessary .
1	<NAME> told him it was between two and three .
1	' His ascendancy over papa , ' said <NAME> , ' is very great .
1	If he falls in my way , I shall tell him my mind ; if he don ' t fall in my way , I shan ' t , for it won ' t be worth my while to do it .
1	' And now , ' said the schoolmaster , dividing the bread and butter for three into as many portions as there were children , ' you had better look sharp with your breakfast , for the horn will blow in a minute or two , and then every boy leaves off. ' Permission being thus given to fall to , the boys began to eat voraciously , and in desperate haste : while the schoolmaster ( who was in high good humour after his meal ) picked his teeth with a fork , and looked smilingly on .
1	' Dear Arthur , ' said her delighted voice outside the door , ' I have some one here .
1	Yes , it was ; there they were .
1	<NAME> firm , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , looking down .
1	' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> and was about to add ' we may wait at a little distance , ' when turning his head he found that no <NAME> was there .
1	The lodging was rather confined as to space , but I fancied that if Mrs. <NAME> 's household had been the only lodgers in <NAME> <NAME> 's or <NAME> 's , the sole advantage they would have found in the size of the building would have been its affording a great deal of room to be dirty in .
1	<NAME> is not a very comfortable lodging , but perhaps I thought it less so when I first saw it than you would have done , because you have been in many different countries and have seen many different customs .
1	' A positive fool , ' said <NAME> .
1	Why , we ain ' t had such a thing happen here , my dear , not for I couldn ' t name the time when .
1	'As you like , my dear , as you like ' replied the Jew .
1	' It was at that time that mama was most solicitous about my <NAME> .
1	' What a world of gammon and spinnage it is , though , ain ' t it ! ' This was addressed confidentially to both of us , as the morsel of a hand came away from the face , and buried itself , arm and all , in the bag again .
1	She detested us , she was miserable with us , she couldn ' t bear it , she wouldn ' t bear it , she was determined to go away .
1	<NAME> back , look back , and see if we are pursued !
1	Mysterious and incomprehensible , the <NAME> , with that lively sense upon him of having done a little business for the youngsters , remained all day , even to his most intimate friends ; and but that <NAME> attributed his winks and grins , and other such pantomimic reliefs of himself , to his satisfaction in the success of their innocent deception upon old <NAME> , he would assuredly have betrayed himself before night .
1	' Good night , sir , good night , ' cried the lawyer , retreating backwards towards the door .
1	The rising of the moon is more in keeping with the solitary ocean ; and has an air of melancholy grandeur , which in its soft and gentle influence , seems to comfort while it saddens .
1	' I ' ll see this <NAME> and <NAME> !
1	I never saw her more .
1	Here he made the acquaintance of the <NAME> ' s beautiful young wife ( paler than formerly , all this time ; more rarely seen by me or anyone , I think ; and not so gay , but not less beautiful ) , and so became more and more familiar by degrees , until , at last , he would come into the school and wait .
1	" <NAME> , " said <NAME> , clasping his hands , " that no one near and dear to me is in this dreadful town to-night .
1	That lady seemed to think very little about it , for the supper being by this time on table , she gave her hand to <NAME> and repaired with a stately step to the left hand of <NAME> .
1	R. <NAME> locked up his desk one evening , and , putting his bunch of keys in his pocket much as if it were his peg-top , made for home .
1	" But our Defarge , " said <NAME> , " is undoubtedly a good <NAME> ?
1	" Slander those who tell it ye !
1	' My mama departed this life , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ' before <NAME> ' s difficulties commenced , or at least before they became pressing .
1	' Well ; let it be so. ' Newman , who had stood during the foregoing conversation with his back planted against the door , ready to oppose any egress from the apartment by force , if necessary , resumed his seat with much satisfaction ; and as the water in the kettle was by this time boiling , made a glassful of spirits and water for <NAME> , and a cracked mug-full for the joint accommodation of himself and <NAME> , of which the two partook in great harmony , while <NAME> , leaning his head upon his hand , remained buried in melancholy meditation .
1	In a word , I never saw anybody so thoroughly jovial as <NAME> was , down to the very last moment of the evening , when I took a hearty farewell of himself and his amiable wife .
1	He told with perfect truth how it had come of a little contraband trading , and how he had in time been released from prison , and how he had gone away from those antecedents .
1	Hoping to hear from you when convenient ' I remain ' Yours and cetrer ' FANNY SQUEERS .
1	<NAME> _he_ think of his neighbour too ?
1	<NAME> and affable as man could be , Mr <NAME> picked his way along the streets and hummed a soft tune as he went .
1	There might be medical doctors at the present hour , a picking up their guineas where a honest tradesman do n't pick up his fardens -- fardens !
1	He was to be another father to him , and they were all to live together in a garden of roses , weren ' t they ?
1	' My dear , ' said <NAME> , leading her towards me , ' here is a gentleman of the name of <NAME> , who wishes to renew his acquaintance with you. ' It would have been better , as it turned out , to have led gently up to this announcement , for Mrs. Micawber , being in a delicate state of health , was overcome by it , and was taken so unwell , that <NAME> was obliged , in great trepidation , to run down to the water-butt in the backyard , and draw a basinful to lave her brow with .
1	He has exhausted his resources and is bound henceforward to the tree he has planted . "
1	' You ' re one of the thort , <NAME> , that keepth a prethiouth thight of money out of the houthe .
1	It ' s him ! ' ' What does this good woman mean ? ' cried Mr Blandois , turning white , hot , and slowly rising with a look of such deadly wrath that it contrasted surprisingly with the slight force of his words .
1	' " Was it a large one ? " inquired <NAME> .
1	" It is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of unhappiness .
1	' Put you back half-an-hour every morning , and about another quarter towards the arternoon , and you ' re a watch as can be ekalled by few and excelled by none .
1	Making towards a faint gleam of light which streamed across the pavement from a cellar , <NAME> was about to descend two or three steps so as to render himself visible to those below and make his inquiry , when he was arrested by a loud noise of scolding in a woman ' s voice .
1	'Here they are , ' replied <NAME> , producing a pair of pistols .
1	The time came , without bringing with it any relief to my feelings , and the company came .
1	Here , the <NAME> ' s <NAME> trained scarlet beans , kept fowls and rabbits , erected rotten summer-houses ( one was an old boat ) , dried clothes , and smoked pipes .
1	' Oh ! ' says Mr Wegg , with a sort of sense of being introduced ; ' I dare say you were all right enough in your own country , but I hope no objections will be taken to my saying that the <NAME> was never yet born as I should wish to match. ' At this moment the greasy door is violently pushed inward , and a boy follows it , who says , after having let it slam : ' Come for the stuffed canary. ' ' It ' s three and ninepence , ' returns <NAME> ; ' have you got the money ? ' The boy produces four shillings .
1	' I tell you I have a presentiment that it must be a girl , ' returned <NAME> .
1	The first words I heard Monks say were these : " So the only proofs of the boy 's identity lie at the bottom of the river , and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin . "
1	' Yes , <NAME> ? ' ' Gone in and locked his door , ma ' am. ' <NAME> repressed a sigh as she gathered her work together for bed , and transfixed that part of her dress where her heart would have been if she had had the dress on , with a sharp , sharp needle .
1	' But no , not he ! ' says <NAME> of the no surname , clinching the quartette .
1	On account of Mr Gowan ' s painting <NAME> ' s picture ( which I am not quite convinced I should have known from the likeness if I had not seen him doing it ) , I have had more opportunities of being with her since then than I might have had without this fortunate chance .
1	Watch-guards and toasting-forks were alike at a discount , and pencil-cases and sponges were a drug in the market .
1	I saw a rigidity come upon the whole school as if they had been turned into stone , and found <NAME> in the midst of us , with <NAME> at his side , and Mrs. and <NAME> looking in at the door as if they were frightened .
1	It was this , I conceive , which led to the <NAME> 's being advised by the gallery to " turn over ! " -- a recommendation which it took extremely ill .
1	' Yes , ' rejoined <NAME> , looking round for an instant , and immediately carrying his eyes back again to the ceiling .
1	Since laws were made for every degree , to curb vice in others as well as in me -- and so forth you know -- doesn ' t it strike you in that light ? ' The single gentleman smiled as if the light in which Mr <NAME> had put the question were not the clearest in the world , and proceeded to explain that they contemplated proceeding by stratagem in the first instance ; and that their design was to endeavour to extort a confession from the gentle <NAME> .
1	It made me giddy and faint in a moment .
1	But what could I do ?
1	inquires the stationer with his cough of sympathy .
1	The perfect formation of that accomplished lady ' s surface rendered it difficult to displace an atom of its genteel glaze , but <NAME> thought she descried a slight thaw of triumph in a corner of her frosty eye .
1	At three o ' clock that afternoon , <NAME> took a last look at his little room , and made his way , as well as he could , through the throng of debtors who pressed eagerly forward to shake him by the hand , until he reached the lodge steps .
1	That gently done , he called to him <NAME> and <NAME> .
1	Permit me to inquire the name of the magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a respectable person , under the protection of the bench . '
1	" Why , no , sir , I could n't .
1	<NAME> , reassured , falls to rubbing his legs .
1	I am <NAME> mere child , sir .
1	Little Dorrit would have been glad to make her visit to Mrs Gowan , alone ; but as <NAME> , who had not yet recovered from her <NAME> ' s protest , though it was four-and-twenty hours of age , pressingly offered her company , the two sisters stepped together into one of the gondolas under Mr <NAME> ' s window , and , with the courier in attendance , were taken in high state to Mrs Gowan ' s lodging .
1	' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , at length breaking the silence , ' you were right , and I was wrong .
1	<NAME> upon that , for she would lay her own fair head beside her husband 's cheerfully. " He faltered for an instant ; then went on as before .
1	Not changing his action even then , he opened and shut the palms of his hands as he warmed them , and looked down at it .
1	Yes , he was the Father of the place .
1	Then Veneering repairs to the legal gentleman in <NAME> ' s confidence , and with him transacts some delicate affairs of business , and issues an address to the independent electors of Pocket-Breaches , announcing that he is coming among them for their suffrages , as the mariner returns to the home of his early childhood : a phrase which is none the worse for his never having been near the place in his life , and not even now distinctly knowing where it is .
1	<NAME> in the deepening gloom looks down upon the ground , half frightened and half shy .
1	" I wish <NAME> was dead ! "
1	Many among them were pressing forward to shake him by the hand again , when he drew his arm through <NAME> ' s , and hurried from the prison , far more sad and melancholy , for the moment , than when he had first entered it .
1	Come across with me. ' She laid her hand upon his arm , and he took her over the way ; the crowd , rather injured by the near prospect of losing her , pressing before and behind and on either side , and recommending an adjournment to <NAME> .
1	<NAME> , that you could remember , long ago , another child who loved you dearly , you being but a child yourself .
1	That I could not absolutely pledge myself to like it , until I knew something more about it .
1	What would you have ? " They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night , and then rode forward again when all the town was asleep .
1	' <NAME> ' t , <NAME> ' ly ! ' said <NAME> , tapping her gently on the shoulder .
1	' There , poor dear ! ' ' Oh well , <NAME> !
1	<NAME> little <NAME> put a forefinger into each of her ears when these rumours began to circulate , and retired into a corner , beseeching not to be told any more ; but <NAME> , begging permission of <NAME> to go and speak with her brother , and pretty plainly showing that she would take it if it were not given , struck out the more definite course of going to <NAME> ' s for accurate intelligence .
1	At this momentous crisis , <NAME> proved herself a vigourous and useful ally , for not confining herself to expressing by scornful smiles a contempt for Mr <NAME> ' s accomplishments , she took every opportunity of whispering into <NAME> ' s ear expressions of condolence and sympathy on her being worried by such a ridiculous creature , declaring that she was frightened to death lest <NAME> should fall upon , and beat him , in the fulness of his wrath , and entreating <NAME> to observe how the eyes of the said <NAME> gleamed with love and fury ; passions , it may be observed , which being too much for his eyes rushed into his nose also , and suffused it with a crimson glow .
1	Along the crowded path they bore her now ; pure as the newly-fallen snow that covered it ; whose day on earth had been as fleeting .
1	You waste a great deal of money -- or what would be a great deal in the pockets of most gentlemen -- in cultivating a kind of society that is useless to me , and , indeed , that upon the whole is disagreeable to me .
1	It won ' t do ; I told the clerk when I took my places that it wouldn ' t do .
1	" From the market-gardens down by <NAME> .
1	The different wards might have been cleaner and better ordered ; I saw nothing of that salutary system which had impressed me so favourably elsewhere ; and everything had a lounging , listless , madhouse air , which was very painful .
1	Pending which , the long-initiated Tip , with an awful enjoyment of the <NAME> ' s resources , pointed out the common kitchen fire maintained by subscription of collegians , the boiler for hot water supported in like manner , and other premises generally tending to the deduction that the way to be healthy , wealthy , and wise , was to come to the <NAME> .
1	Nothing easier , ' said Mr Carker , without any show of surprise , and taking up the pen to re-endorse the letter , as coolly as he had done before .
1	<NAME> , and <NAME> and Means , you ' re all up in , so we shall only want one rehearsal .
1	The clerk in the <NAME> involuntarily applauded .
1	The interest displayed in <NAME> ' s countenance is most intense , as <NAME> and the guard try to squeeze the cod-fish into the boot , first head first , and then tail first , and then top upward , and then bottom upward , and then side-ways , and then long-ways , all of which artifices the implacable cod-fish sturdily resists , until the guard accidentally hits him in the very middle of the basket , whereupon he suddenly disappears into the boot , and with him , the head and shoulders of the guard himself , who , not calculating upon so sudden a cessation of the passive resistance of the cod-fish , experiences a very unexpected shock , to the unsmotherable delight of all the porters and bystanders .
1	And will you tell them all that I have thought of them every day , and that my heart is faithful to them everywhere ?
1	<NAME> <NAME> had , that day , invited his three friends to dinner ; they were all seated round the fire , drinking their wine , when <NAME> presented himself , as above described .
1	He carried so very attentive an expression on his countenance that it appeared as if the confidential discourse of the big stick required to be followed closely .
1	' Wery good , <NAME> , a dispensation if you like it better , ' returned <NAME> ; ' I call it a dispensary , and it ' s always writ up so , at the places vere they gives you physic for nothin ' in your own bottles ; that ' s all. ' With these words , <NAME> refilled and relighted his pipe , and once more summoning up a meditative expression of countenance , continued as follows -- ' Therefore , my boy , as I do not see the adwisability o ' stoppin here to be married vether I vant to or not , and as at the same time I do not vish to separate myself from them interestin ' members o ' society altogether , I have come to the determination o ' driving the <NAME> , and puttin ' up vunce more at the <NAME> , vich is my nat ' ral born element , Sammy. ' ' And wot ' s to become o ' the bis ' ness ? ' inquired <NAME> .
1	He does nothing steadily or patiently ; but equally takes things up and throws them down , and does them , or leaves them undone , without caring about them .
1	This is not your resolution ; call it up , <NAME> , call it up ! "
1	' They won ' t let you be more than a Casual there .
1	' Well , I ' m pretty well , thank ' ee , <NAME> , ' said Mr Toots .
1	<NAME> is a little dim , but she is of the true descent ; and there are many who appreciate her sprightly conversation , her <NAME> conundrums so old as to have become in the cycles of time almost new again , the honour of taking the fair Dedlock in to dinner , or even the privilege of her hand in the dance .
1	<NAME> smiled and lifted up his arm to touch him as he stood behind the head of the couch .
1	' Why , the truth is , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' that I have been out on a visit -- the first visit I have made for fifteen years. ' ' That is a long time , ' said <NAME> , sadly .
1	He had left her in her father ' s room within an hour .
1	' I can ' t think how he can have picked up what he knows , ' said <NAME> , ' unless I have committed myself -- let something drop at <NAME> ' s , for instance -- which has been overheard .
1	' Oh indeed , ma ' am , ' thought <NAME> , ' you have been pining , have you ?
1	We all sat round the fire ; while the sharp boy , who I now divined had lost his breath in putting the papers out , cleared them away again , and produced the tea-things .
1	' I look sharply after most men that I deal with , and most of all I looked sharply after you .
1	A delightful sentiment , sir ! ' To all these rambling observations , Mr <NAME> answered not one word , but , returning for the aquatic jacket , rolled it into a tight round ball : looking steadily at <NAME> meanwhile as if he had some intention of bowling him down with it .
1	<NAME> praised <NAME> more to me that night than ever she had praised him yet .
1	' <NAME> , you Sir ! ' shouted <NAME> fiercely .
1	He quickened his pace ; but before he reached her , she turned her head .
1	<NAME> is the dread power of the man , and so terribly evident it is that he makes no idle boast , that <NAME> begins to apologize .
1	The poor old creature had taken the upward course of the river Thames as her general track ; it was the track in which her last home lay , and of which she had last had local love and knowledge .
1	' How ? ' An impatient glance from <NAME> seemed , as <NAME> saw it , to answer ' With my eyes ! ' But her only answer in words was : ' I met her near the church. ' ' What was she doing there I wonder ! ' said Mr Meagles .
1	Next to accepting a large sum on the spot , I believe this gave <NAME> more comfort than anything I could have done .
1	So the two old schoolfellows felt it to be , as , their dinner done , they turned towards the fire to smoke .
1	Having had great experience of the sex , and being perfectly acquainted with all those little artifices which find the readiest road to their hearts , Mr Chuckster , on taking his ground , planted one hand on his hip , and with the other adjusted his flowing hair .
1	' Here I am , sir. ' ' And our friend of the perspiring brow is at the far corner there ?
1	I am sure , ' added <NAME> , glancing at her pretty face , ' he can have very little idea of the pleasure he denies himself. ' ' Oh , my dear <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' what shall we do , if he continues to be angry with us ? ' ' Why , wait patiently , my dear , until he thinks better of it , ' replied <NAME> cheerfully .
1	It was a large house , but one of broken fortunes ; for the spacious offices were little used , their walls were damp and mossy , their windows broken , and their gates decayed .
1	<NAME> <NAME> usually improved these occasions by remarking , when she was gone , that if <NAME> had been properly trained from an early age she would have remonstrated to herself on sound principles the baselessness of these fantastic hopes .
1	But he did , " said <NAME> , raising his laughing eyes in playful astonishment ; " he did interpose that ridiculous figure , and he does , and he will again .
1	But , in this separation , I associate you only with the good ; and I will faithfully hold you to that always , for you must have done me far more good than harm , let me feel now what sharp distress I may .
1	It still increased , until our horses could scarcely face the wind .
1	" My friends , " says <NAME> , looking round him in conclusion , " I will not proceed with my young friend now .
1	Whispering to <NAME> that <NAME> had never in his life expressed surprise , and was considered not to know what it meant , the <NAME> watched him as he eyed his mast-head , and afterwards swept the horizon ; and when the revolving eye seemed to be coming round in his direction , said : ' <NAME> , my lad , how fares it ? ' A deep , gruff , husky utterance , which seemed to have no connexion with <NAME> , and certainly had not the least effect upon his face , replied , ' Ay , ay , shipmet , how goes it ? ' At the same time <NAME> ' s right hand and arm , emerging from a pocket , shook the <NAME> ' s , and went back again .
1	We may be reckoning without our host in all this , ' he added more cheerfully , ' and I trust , and almost believe we are .
1	<NAME> , <NAME> ! ' Fascination Fledgeby , left alone in the counting-house , strolled about with his hat on one side , whistling , and investigating the drawers , and prying here and there for any small evidences of his being cheated , but could find none .
1	' I don ' t know how it is , <NAME> ; I seem to want some faculty of mind that I ought to have .
1	<NAME> <NAME> , charmed to see you .
1	Sometimes , he went down alone from Saturday to Monday ; sometimes his partner accompanied him ; sometimes , he merely strolled for an hour or two about the house and garden , saw that all was right , and returned to <NAME> again .
1	The whole population of <NAME> and the adjoining towns rose from their beds at an early hour of the following morning , in a state of the utmost bustle and excitement .
1	Who can describe the pleasure and delight , the peace of mind and soft tranquillity , the sickly boy felt in the balmy air , and among the green hills and rich woods , of an inland village !
1	" Now , do n't stare about you all the afternoon , " cries <NAME> , shaking her head and stamping her foot as she happens to catch the glance which has been previously sounding the basin of tea , " but take your victuals and get back to your work . "
1	Am I never to throw it off ?
1	' A little drop of spirits , master , if it 's all the same , ' replied <NAME> .
1	A speck in the mist , at last !
1	' We don ' t know , ' said <NAME> , answering this mute appeal aloud .
1	' N-not particularly so , I think , sir , ' rejoined <NAME> , with his teeth chattering in his head .
1	Your dear friend amused me and amused himself as long as it suited his inclinations ; and then reminded me that we were both people of the world , that we both understood mankind , that we both knew there was no such thing as romance , that we were both prepared for going different ways to seek our fortunes like people of sense , and that we both foresaw that whenever we encountered one another again we should meet as the best friends on earth .
1	' Well , sir , her cousin -- you know it ' s a cousin she ' s going to be married to ? ' ' Oh yes , ' I replied .
1	In either case , it would appear that Mr Clennam is put altogether out of the question , and that we have nothing to do with him or he with us .
1	Accompanied by the lightest of porters , fit colourless servitor at <NAME> ' s door when Mrs. Gradgrind knocked , <NAME> rumbled to <NAME> , over the coal-pits past and present , and was whirled into its smoky jaws .
1	' <NAME> , ' cried <NAME> , when this sound met her ear , ' make haste , for <NAME> ' s sake , he will destroy himself !
1	He will certainly help us to a new livelihood .
1	what ' s that ? ' ' Miscreant with a Pig ' s head , stand still ! ' to another horse , who bit another , who frightened the other two , who plunged and backed .
1	While he was at a loss , <NAME> said , resuming his former air of contemplating cards : " And indeed , now I think again , I have a strong impression that I have another good card here , not yet enumerated .
1	' I do not , <NAME> , I do not , ' said <NAME> ' The society in which you move -- necessarily move , from your station , connection , and endowments -- is one vortex and whirlpool of the most frightful excitement .
1	When should I awaken the heart within her that was mute and sleeping now ?
1	One day he came up to the office , all in a hurry , and had a private interview with the magistrate , who , after a deal of talk , rings the bell , and orders <NAME> in ( <NAME> was a active officer ) , and tells him to go and assist <NAME> in apprehending the man as robbed his house .
1	' They are strangers in this part of the town , <NAME> .
1	I expected , every day , that my guardian might speak to me about the letter , but he never did .
1	' You accidentally saw a young lady in this room one morning , my dear sir , in a fainting fit .
1	On these national occasions dancing may be a patriotic service , and <NAME> is constantly seen hopping about for the good of an ungrateful and unpensioning country .
1	Still , very steadfastly and quietly walking towards it , a peaceful figure too in the landscape , went <NAME> , shoeless , through the wet grass .
1	Shall it be done ? ' ' It shall , sir , ' said <NAME> .
1	He called himself for the plaintiff , there was no getting over his evidence , the counsel for the defendant threw up his brief , and the jury did not even turn to consider .
1	' Now , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , pushing back her hair from her temples with both hands , ' what ' s first ? ' ' First , ' returned <NAME> solemnly , ' if you persist in what I can not but regard as conduct utterly incompatible with the equipage in which you arrived -- ' [ ' Which I do , Ma. ' ) ' First , then , you put the fowls down to the fire. ' ' To -- be -- sure ! ' cried <NAME> ; ' and flour them , and twirl them round , and there they go ! ' sending them spinning at a great rate .
1	Here , among his many boxes labelled with transcendent names , lives <NAME> , when not speechlessly at home in country-houses where the great ones of the earth are bored to death .
1	Take your old place ! ' <NAME> , looking anything but reassured , sat down on the floor at the bedside , keeping his eyes upon his patron all the time .
1	I have seen so much business done on sharp principles that , to tell you the truth , Mr <NAME> , I am tired of them. ' Mr <NAME> laughed .
1	" No , " returns his friend ; " if it 's nothing worse than this , I withdraw the observation . "
1	I remember one hot evening I went into the bar of a public-house , and said to the landlord : ' What is your best -- your very best -- ale a glass ? ' For it was a special occasion .
1	But the moment <NAME> understood the full extent of his misfortune , self-preservation dictated an attempt at flight .
1	" Yet , " said <NAME> , leading the company gently back to the theme from which they had strayed , " <NAME> -- regarded as biled -- is rich , too ; ai n't it ? " " Have a little brandy , uncle , " said my sister .
1	' A milliner and dressmaker , ma ' am , ' replied <NAME> .
1	' Blessed if she didn ' t send ' em all to sleep till twelve hours arter the election was over .
1	Whether it was possible in a <NAME> country to get on without blood , after this , was a question on which the Finches were divided .
1	It was a picture of cold , silent decay .
1	His walking did not bring him home until the dawn of day .
1	And , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ' though it is possible I may be mistaken in my view of the ceremony , I never will ! ' ' My dear , ' said <NAME> , a little impatiently , ' I am not conscious that you are expected to do anything of the sort. ' ' I am aware , my dear <NAME> , ' pursued Mrs. Micawber , ' that I am now about to cast my lot among strangers ; and I am also aware that the various members of my family , to whom <NAME> has written in the most gentlemanly terms , announcing that fact , have not taken the least notice of <NAME> ' s communication .
1	<NAME> ' t you better be seated ?
1	I writed some words to <NAME> , ' an air of novelty came over Mr Pancks with this designation , ' to come and help .
1	The visitor said that was well , and he would return for the information , relying on its being obtained .
1	I know what it is , sir .
1	" I think , " replies <NAME> after pensively tracing out a cross-wrinkle in his forehead with the brush-handle , " that mischeevious consequences is always meant when money 's asked for . "
1	I was very sorry , but there was a higher consideration than sense .
1	We arranged a time for <NAME> to come out by the coach and share my early dinner .
1	However , the <NAME> were so patriotic after all , that they never had pitched their property into the <NAME> yet , but , on the contrary , had been kind enough to take mighty good care of it .
1	' So they used to say in that part of the country I come from , ' observed <NAME> , complacently , ' but I think oil ' s better. ' ' Better than what ? ' roared <NAME> , adding some rather strong language in an undertone .
1	The procession then reformed ; the chairmen resumed their stations ; and the march was re- commenced .
1	' They are not worth your notice , ' said the dismal man .
1	' I debated with myself a long time , ' she said in a low voice , ' whether to write this at all , in case of dying suddenly or by accident , and feeling the want of it upon me .
1	Let her come and go , unobserved and unquestioned .
1	'She was my daughter , ' said the old woman , nodding her head in the direction of the corpse ; and speaking with an idiotic leer , more ghastly than even the presence of death in such a place .
1	It ' s made out of a boat ! ' ' Made out of a boat , is it ? ' said <NAME> .
1	His temper gave abundant promise of being imperious in after-life ; and he had as hopeful an apprehension of his own importance , and the rightful subservience of all other things and persons to it , as heart could desire .
1	<NAME> and less respectable men might fall short of that mark , but Mr <NAME> was always up to it .
1	' I try to believe and hope so still .
1	Affery was the first to move , and she , wringing her hands , pursued her mistress .
1	The sick man laid his hand upon his attendant ' s arm , and motioned him to stop .
1	' Yes , I think it ' ll do , ' said <NAME> .
1	What a launch in life I think it now , on looking back , to be so mean and servile to a man of such parts and pretensions !
1	" 'Doctor , they are very proud , these <NAME> ; but we common dogs are proud too , sometimes .
1	I hope that contents you. ' ' Upon your soul ? ' said <NAME> .
1	When I was old enough , I was to be apprenticed to <NAME> , and until I could assume that dignity I was not to be what Mrs. <NAME> called " Pompeyed , " or ( as I render it ) pampered .
1	I quite agree with you , <NAME> , that perhaps topics may be incautiously mentioned upstairs before him , which it would be as well for his little mind not to expatiate upon ; but I really don ' t see how that is to be helped , in the case of a child of his quickness .
1	It was a consequence of his playing the accompaniment without notes , and of her being a heedless little creature , very apt to go wrong , that he followed her lips most attentively , with his eyes as well as hands ; carefully and softly hinting the key-note from time to time .
1	A part of the bone came out .
1	' You see , you go over to Staple with <NAME> and <NAME> , ' said <NAME> ; ' I going in and out , and out and in alone , in my usual way ; you go up with those gentlemen to <NAME> ' s rooms ; you look into <NAME> ' s flower-garden ; you wait for <NAME> ' s appearance there , or you signify to <NAME> that you are close by ; and you communicate with her freely , and no spy can be the wiser. ' ' I am very much afraid I shall be— ' ' Be what , my dear ? ' asked <NAME> , as she hesitated .
1	So , at six o ' clock that evening , which was one of the early office evenings , I announced myself as ready , to <NAME> .
1	The change consisted in the appearance of strange faces of low caste , rather than in the disappearance of the high caste , chiselled , and otherwise beautified and beautifying features of <NAME> .
1	<NAME> must be got into a butt by some agency before it can be drawn out ; and the wine of sentiment never having been got into Mr Riderhood by any agency , nothing in nature tapped him .
1	The name I have heard <NAME> mention , tossing in his dreams , <NAME> ; is it not ? ' ' The name of the <NAME> is <NAME> , ' said Mr Fledgeby , with a rather uncompromising accent on his noun-substantive .
1	While the meal was in progress , their host remarked that the old man seemed much fatigued , and evidently stood in need of rest .
1	' I hardly know -- I -- I am much obliged , Sir. ' ' He needn ' t wait , <NAME> , ' said Mr Dombey .
1	'Your behaviour has ever been kind and noble . '
1	But that lady , kissing me , and making me put them back in my pocket , replied that she couldn ' t think of it .
1	<NAME> was glad to walk out into the night air -- was even glad , in spite of his great experience , to sit down upon a door-step for a little while : feeling sick and faint .
1	The girl gradually recovered her senses ; and , staggering to a chair by the bedside , hid her face upon the pillow : leaving <NAME> to confront the new comers , in some astonishment at their unlooked-for appearance .
1	<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> , stunned and paralysed by the awful event which had so suddenly overthrown their schemes ( it would not otherwise , perhaps , have made much impression on them ) , and carried away by the extraordinary energy and precipitation of <NAME> , which bore down all before him , looked on at these proceedings like men in a dream or trance .
1	These articles having been promptly supplied , he walked on direct towards Leadenhall <NAME> at a good round pace , very different from his recent lingering one .
1	The snow had covered our late footprints ; my new track was the only one to be seen ; and even that began to die away ( it snowed so fast ) as I looked back over my shoulder .
1	I have been so , many years .
1	The roof yet vibrated with the cheering , when the assembly dispersed .
1	For <NAME> wos wery good to me too , and I knows it . "
1	I knew from her own lips that she regarded herself as the innocent cause of his errors , and as owing him a great debt she ardently desired to pay .
1	You think so , Mr Headstone ? ' Conscious that his pupil-teacher was looking for his answer , that he himself had suggested the boy ' s keeping aloof from this sister , now seen for the first time face to face , <NAME> stammered : ' Your brother is very much occupied , you know .
1	He is as dead as the Doges ! ' Mrs General , always on her coach-box keeping the proprieties well together , took pains to form a surface on her very dear young friend , and Mrs General ' s very dear young friend tried hard to receive it .
1	Here he would crease up his eyelids and kiss his fingers to me , though I am happy to say he had ceased to be particular in his attentions since I had been so altered .
1	' Yes -- yes ; I almost forgot , I do declare. ' ' I thought you were forgetting , ' said <NAME> .
1	I should have done it before now , if I hadn ' t been afraid of making bad worse .
1	If she had ever had the virtue in her , it had quite gone out of her .
1	They were in high good-humour ; and one of them , a little , weazen , hump-backed man , began to dance .
1	'She has formed no other attachment ? '
1	One was a slim and rather lame man in rusty black , and a white neckerchief ; another was a stout , burly person , dressed in the same apparel , with a great reddish-black cloth round his neck ; a third was a little weazen , drunken-looking body , with a pimply face .
1	I would have spared you the degradation , but we must hear them from your own lips before we part , and you know why . '
1	' Now , my reliance is on you. ' ' But it must not be on me , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , with a pleasant smile .
1	Struck by the energy of her manner , <NAME> looked up in her face with great surprise .
1	The man with the wooden leg eyed me all over -- it didn ' t take long , for there was not much of me -- and locked the gate behind us , and took out the key .
1	It ' s my handsome daughter , living and come back ! ' she screamed again , dropping on the floor before her , clasping her knees , laying her head against them , and still rocking herself to and fro with every frantic demonstration of which her vitality was capable .
1	' We saw him pass this morning , afore he got off his horse ; when you were ready to take it. ' ' Ay , ay , ' returned <NAME> , appearing to wish that his readiness had carried him to any other place. -- ' What ' s the matter with her ?
1	He tells her , in acknowledgment of her many subdued thanks , that she is very welcome , gives her good day , and walks away .
1	Mr Feeder says he has no doubt of it .
1	Will you only promise that , <NAME> ? ' Before the child could reply to this earnest solicitation , the street-door opened , and Mr Brass thrusting out his night-capped head called in a surly voice , ' Who ' s there ! ' Kit immediately glided away , and <NAME> , closing the window softly , drew back into the room .
1	' I have a crotchet in my head that it must be so .
1	It was because he grew so scared and trembling , and because he felt himself to be a poor , weak , ignorant , helpless man ( those used to be his words ) , that he wanted me so much to know a great deal , and be different from him .
1	But this I know , -- that we saw the Doctor before he saw us , sitting at his table , among the folio volumes in which he delighted , resting his head calmly on his hand .
1	' I say I wonder <NAME> didn ' t take you with him , dear. ' ' Never you mind , <NAME> , ' returned the <NAME> .
1	" Hope , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , Precedent , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
1	<NAME> <NAME> pointed to it , and admonished him to take it up .
1	It was curious and interesting , nevertheless , to be sitting up there behind four horses : well educated , well dressed , and with plenty of money in my pocket ; and to look out for the places where I had slept on my weary journey .
1	Their way lay , for the most part , through the low grounds , and open plains ; and except these distant places , and occasionally some men working in the fields , or lounging on the bridges under which they passed , to see them creep along , nothing encroached on their monotonous and secluded track .
1	Slipping us out at a little side gate , the old lady stopped most unexpectedly in a narrow back street , part of some courts and lanes immediately outside the wall of the inn , and said , " This is my lodging .
1	<NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , have , collectively or separately , been the attendants of my career. " ' The relish with which <NAME> described himself as a prey to these dismal calamities , was only to be equalled by the emphasis with which he read his letter ; and the kind of homage he rendered to it with a roll of his head , when he thought he had hit a sentence very hard indeed .
1	And when you used him shamefully , I took his part and loved him -- There !
1	' When I happened to say to that naughty thing , the other day , ' pursued her mother , shaking her head and her fan at her , playfully , ' that there was a family circumstance she might mention to you -- indeed , I think , was bound to mention -- she said , that to mention it was to ask a favour ; and that , as you were too generous , and as for her to ask was always to have , she wouldn ' t. ' ' <NAME> , my dear , ' said the Doctor .
1	'He has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth , sir , ' replied Mrs. Bedwin : drawing herself up slightly , and laying strong emphasis on the last word : to intimate that between slops , and broth will compounded , there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever .
1	It portended that there was one stone face too many , up at the chateau .
1	He never thought of <NAME> .
1	How <NAME> went on , from day to day , filling the mind of his adopted child with stores of knowledge , and becoming attached to him , more and more , as his nature developed itself , and showed the thriving seeds of all he wished him to become -- how he traced in him new traits of his early friend , that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances , melancholy and yet sweet and soothing -- how the two orphans , tried by adversity , remembered its lessons in mercy to others , and mutual love , and fervent thanks to Him who had protected and preserved them -- these are all matters which need not to be told .
1	So I said as much .
1	The old abbey flourished then ; and the five sisters , living on its fair domains , paid yearly dues to the black monks of St Benedict , to which fraternity it belonged .
1	Therefore <NAME> read the newspaper with profound attention and no comprehension , and therefore <NAME> said nothing whatever about <NAME> to himself , or admitted to himself that he was thinking about him , or would recognise in the most distant manner that <NAME> had anything to do with his feeling as lonely as <NAME> .
1	They had no other friends or home to leave , he said , and had come to share his fortunes .
1	Everybody was excited , except the fat boy , and he slept as soundly as if the roaring of cannon were his ordinary lullaby .
1	' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , when a hackney coach had been called , and the ladies and the luggage hurried in , ' gang to the <NAME> ' s Head , mun. ' ' To the <NAME> ? ' cried the coachman .
1	' <NAME> ! ' cried <NAME> , ' where is that fellow , <NAME> ? ' But not a word said <NAME> .
1	The time has flown. ' ' You ' re a brute ! ' exclaimed <NAME> .
1	My aunt and I were at that time vacating the two cottages at <NAME> ; I intending to go abroad , and she to return to her house at <NAME> .
1	There was no other orphan among us ; and I perceived ( here was the first disadvantage of not being a fool ) that they conciliated me in an insolent pity , and in a sense of superiority .
1	I put my hand upon her head , and touched her forehead , and said it was hot now but would be cool to-morrow .
1	' Now , <NAME> , ' says the Major , ' our friend <NAME> having , with an amount of eloquence that <NAME> B. has never heard surpassed -- no , by the <NAME> , <NAME> !
1	If our observant lady readers can deduce any satisfactory inferences from these facts , we beg them by all means to do so .
1	<NAME> elevates his one eyebrow , and after respectfully staring at his master to express interest , swallows a great gulp of coffee , still staring at him .
1	Only don ' t talk of anticipating means , <NAME> , as a discovery ; because that would be too much. ' ' Too much , ma ' am ? ' said Mr Meagles , as seeking an explanation .
1	Otherwise , ma ' am , we know out of whose pocket _that_ money comes. ' ' Ah—h ! ' sighed Mrs. Sparsit again , with another melancholy shake of her head .
1	The first time he came to our old place was when my father was alive .
1	<NAME> was in his inner room , his sanctuary of sanctuaries , the <NAME> to the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without .
1	And yet , through the very limited means of expression that he possessed , he seemed to express kindness .
1	I have already said , sir , that I have had my suspicions of <NAME> , in reference to <NAME> , for some time .
1	<NAME> , ' said that excellent gentleman , lowering his voice , ' there is the most trifling , the most excusable breach of confidence in what I am about to say ; and yet if my friend Pyke there overheard it -- such is that man ' s delicate sense of honour , Mrs. Nickleby -- he ' d have me out before dinner-time. ' Mrs. <NAME> cast an apprehensive glance at the warlike <NAME> , who had walked to the window ; and <NAME> , squeezing her hand , went on : ' Your daughter has made a conquest -- a conquest on which I may congratulate you .
1	' What you will , <NAME> , ' she answered , without turning her head , and with supreme indifference .
1	' It must not turn me , but it is the truth ; no doubt it is. ' ' Only remember what we have been since that bright morning when we turned our backs upon it for the last time , ' said <NAME> , ' only remember what we have been since we have been free of all those miseries -- what peaceful days and quiet nights we have had -- what pleasant times we have known -- what happiness we have enjoyed .
1	It never , in its uttermost pride and passion , knew the shadow that had fallen on his , in the dark corner , on the night of the return ; and often since ; and which deepened on it now , as he looked up .
1	Perhaps you may be interested , <NAME> , " continued <NAME> , leading the way into the next drawing-room , " in this portrait of <NAME> .
1	' <NAME> ' ee , <NAME> , ' returned the <NAME> .
1	If you will hold the candle for <NAME> , my friend , he 'll soon see whether there is anything to help you . "
1	Then we all went to <NAME> , a narrow alley at a very short distance .
1	He read almost at a glance , and made combinations of one letter with another and one business with another as he went on , adding new matter to the heaps -- much as a man would know the cards at sight , and work out their combinations in his mind after they were turned .
1	' When I proposed to come with Mr and <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' Mrs <NAME> urged me to do so , in order that I might give her my small report -- it ' s not worth anything , Mr Rokesmith , except for it ' s being a woman ' s -- which indeed with you may be a fresh reason for it ' s being worth nothing -- of <NAME> Hexam. ' ' Mr Boffin , ' said the Secretary , ' directed me to come for the same purpose. ' As they spoke they were leaving the little street and emerging on the wooded landscape by the river .
1	Her mother ' s brother , gentlemen , failed for eight hundred pounds , as a law stationer. ' ' Vell , ' said <NAME> , who had grown rather restless during this discussion , ' vith regard to bis ' ness. ' The word was music to <NAME> ' s ears .
1	He was five foot nine and a half , and he lays in five-and-twen-ty foot of ground. ' ' RAT -- tat-tat , <NAME> -- tat-tat , <NAME> -- tat-tat , ' across the yard .
1	Lastly , up comes the flag over <NAME> 's unconscious head cheerfully proclaiming that <NAME> and <NAME> are in their happy home and that there is hospitality at the place in <NAME> .
1	I must tell you how it was .
1	On the table , and about the room , were the charts and maps on which the heavy-hearted Instrument-maker had again and again tracked the missing vessel across the sea , and on which , with a pair of compasses that he still had in his hand , he had been measuring , a minute before , how far she must have driven , to have driven here or there : and trying to demonstrate that a long time must elapse before hope was exhausted .
1	" When I ask what I am to call myself to-day , <NAME> , " I went on , " I suggest what I have in my thoughts .
1	They made room for the stranger , but he sat down in the furthest corner , and ate and drank alone , or rather with his dog : to whom he cast a morsel of food from time to time .
1	But he did not hint to me that when I had been better looking he had had this same proceeding in his thoughts and had refrained from it .
1	We had better not say anything having the appearance of a remonstrance or condition ; it might not seem generous .
1	For what says the <NAME> ?
1	He do n't make himself comfortable with it .
1	I mean to burn him at last. ' ' Ha ha ! ' cried <NAME> .
1	Many accounts and account-books , many files of correspondence , and several strong boxes , garnished <NAME> ' s room .
1	I trust it confidently to your not suppressing anything .
1	you needn ' t mind reading that , ' interrupted the client .
1	Why , I have known that grandmother of mine lie in her bed and drink her four-teen glasses of liquor before breakfast ! ' Mrs. Gradgrind , weakly smiling , and giving no other sign of vitality , looked ( as she always did ) like an indifferently executed transparency of a small female figure , without enough light behind it .
1	<NAME> , this has been a dreadful day !
1	<NAME> ! " I thought he never would have done wiping his feet , and that I must have gone out to lift him off the mat , but at last he came in .
1	Mr <NAME> replied to it accordingly .
1	But , from this aperture , he had never ceased to call on those without , to guard the back ; and thus , when the murderer emerged at last on the house-top by the door in the roof , a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in front , who immediately began to pour round , pressing upon each other in an unbroken stream .
1	' Oh come away ! ' said <NAME> , ' they are quarrelling .
1	Is he at home ? ' ' Mr Rokesmith is at home , ' said <NAME> ; ' indeed , ' pointing through the window , ' there he stands at the garden gate .
1	I have to begin the world . "
1	Then I go among the <NAME> .
1	He was evidently pleased by this assurance , though he rejoined with a good-humoured smile and an arch shake of his head , that the <NAME> used to be very fond of the <NAME> when they wanted their help , but had not cared much for them , since .
1	There was some singing , too , from <NAME> and <NAME> , and very likely there might have been more , if the fly-driver , who stopped to drive the happy pair to the spot where they proposed to take steamboat to <NAME> , had not sent in a peremptory message intimating , that if they didn ' t come directly he should infallibly demand eighteen-pence over and above his agreement .
1	Within , were a few wooden partitions , behind which such customers as found it more convenient to take away their dinners in stomachs than in their hands , Packed their purchases in solitude .
1	I was not aware of it myself , but I felt it necessary to uphold the institutions of my county , and to evince a familiarity with them ; so I shook my head , as much as to say , ' I believe you ! ' ' And the <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
1	<NAME> , on the first morning of my so auspiciously beginning life on my own account , the oldest of the regular boys was summoned to show me my business .
1	Being asked what he thinks of the proceedings , characterizes them ( his strength lying in a slangular direction ) as " a rummy start . "
1	Many of them have a display of goods in their windows , such as may be seen in thriving county towns in <NAME> ; and there are some which would do no discredit to the metropolis itself .
1	Before whom do the presidential candidates bow down the most humbly , on whom do they fawn the most fondly , and for whose tastes do they cater the most assiduously in their servile protestations ?
1	While we were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved yard at the back , he asked me how often I had seen <NAME> eat and drink ; offering me a breadth of choice , as usual , between a hundred times and once .
1	That Mrs. <NAME> , impelled by gratitude , or ambition , or maternal pride , or maternal love , or all four powerful motives conjointly , had taken secret conference with <NAME> , and had finally returned to propose that <NAME> should instruct the four Miss Kenwigses in the <NAME> language as spoken by natives , at the weekly stipend of five shillings , current coin of the realm ; being at the rate of one shilling per week , per each Miss <NAME> , and one shilling over , until such time as the baby might be able to take it out in grammar .
1	She was a formidable style of lady with spectacles , a prominent nose , and a loud voice , who had the effect of wanting a great deal of room .
1	She was much more accessible , much more free and engaging , much less exacting ; insomuch that she now entertained a host of followers and admirers , to the bitter indignation of ladies with daughters to marry , who were to be regarded as Having revolted from <NAME> on the <NAME> grievance , and erected a rebellious standard .
1	' Hold up ! ' said the stout old <NAME> , as <NAME> dived head foremost into his capacious waistcoat .
1	The shameful accounts we read , every week in the <NAME> year , my lords and gentlemen and honourable boards , the infamous records of small official inhumanity , do not pass by the people as they pass by us .
1	inquired the beadle , affectionately pressing her hand .
1	" Is it possible , " whispered my guardian as we put a chair for the little creature and got her to sit down with her load , the boy keeping close to her , holding to her apron , " that this child works for the rest ?
1	There was some secret , sure perception between them , which set them against one another in all ways .
1	Is it blank cartridge or ball ?
1	The room was a pleasant one , at the top of the house , overlooking the sea , on which the moon was shining brilliantly .
1	I believe I had at this time some lurking distrust of <NAME> .
1	Of my making a speech in the same dreamy fashion , without having an idea of what I want to say , beyond such as may be comprehended in the full conviction that I haven ' t said it .
1	Mr and <NAME> have sent me the kindest note possible ( which Mr Rokesmith just now read to me out aloud , for I ain ' t good at handwritings ) , offering to find me another little child to name and educate and bring up .
1	The <NAME> gets first to the mountain , and waits for the <NAME> people to come up ; both sets of passengers being conveyed across it at the same time .
1	From whence have we derived that spiritual profit ?
1	' You see what a dry , shrivelled , withered old chip it is , ' returned <NAME> , when the other was at length silent .
